PM Modi Highlights Legal Reforms, Stresses Need for Law in Local Languages

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Saturday said that ease of getting justice or universal accessibility to the justice delivery system plays a significant role in optimising ease of doing business and ease of living of citizens and that use of technology with a pro-people focus can serve as a force multiplier in this process.Addressing a gathering of constitutional court judges and lawyers at Supreme Court Annexe on Legal Services Day, Modi said that in the last 11 years the govt has focussed on ease of doing business by removing over 40,000 compliances, doing away with 3,400 legal provisions and repealing over 1,500 archaic laws, coupled with revisiting the archaic penal laws.""Ease of doing business and ease of living is possible only when ease of justice is ensured,"" he said, adding that in the last three decades National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) has played a vital role in linking commoners to the justice delivery system.Referring to speeches of CJI B R Gavai and CJI-designate Surya Kant on NALSA's efforts to prevent and settle lakhs of disputes through mediation in last three years, the PM said 'community mediation' is an ancient Indian practice that creates harmony and reduces litigation. Highlighting the importance of technology, Modi said, ""Technology can be disruptive. But with pro-people focus, it can be a democratic force."" For instance, UPI has revolutionised digital payments. ""Villages are being linked with optical fibres. One lakh mobile towers are being erected.""Legal professionals, judges and judicial officers must come together to chalk out a plan of action to make the justice delivery system advanced and accessible so that it is in sync with the goal of a developed India by 2047, he said, adding govt has sanctioned over Rs 7,000 crore for the judiciary's technological upgrade. The marginalised will not get justice until they are made aware of their rights. HCs and district courts must follow SC initiative to translate judgments into 18 different languages.""The language of justice must be understood by the litigants. Only then will there be increased compliance and less litigation,"" Modi said.CJI Gavai said NALSA has given rise to hope among the hopeless, marginalised and exploited class of citizens that someone will stand up for them somewhere for protection of their rights.""The system should not be reactive but proactive to prevent abuse of rights,"" he said. NALSA executive chairman and CJI-designate Kant said, ""The true measure of a justice system is not how swiftly it decides complex cases, but how deeply it touches the lives of ordinary citizens.""While echoing the importance given by PM to the role of technology, Justice Kant said, ""Technology does offer real opportunities like online conciliations and digital complaint portals, but technology alone will not suffice. It must be guided by local knowledge, linguistic accessibility and human empathy.""","PM Modi flagged off four Vande Bharat Express trains from Varanasi. He said in the last 11 years the govt has focussed on ease of doing business.

"Many still sitting on old note stashes, hoping for exchange",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gang-cheats-traders-sitting-on-old-notes/articleshow/125195600.cms,".

GHAZIABAD: Nine years after demonetisation, crores of invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes remain stashed with people, sustaining a grey market large enough for organised fraud. This was evident from the arrest of eight members of a gang over the last two weeks.The men were allegedly behind a multi-level racket that trapped clients, mainly traders and middlemen still hoarding invalid notes, via social media sites by promising discreet conversion of demonetised currency in exchange for hefty commissions.Investigation revealed that no currency was ever exchanged, and the gang simply collected bundles of demonetised currency and their advance fees before vanishing. Police have so far recovered demonetised notes worth Rs 3.9 crore from their stash.""Most victims never approached police because their own transaction was illegal,"" Trans-Hindon DCP Nimish Patil said. ""The fraud operated through a structured, three-tier chain. The first tier, which included the recently arrested SK alias Sharik and Abhinav alias Rahul Buddhi Raja, handled negotiations with victims and offered assurances of converting the notes at 25% of face value.The second comprised collectors who sourced demonetised currency directly from clients, and the third consisted of couriers who transported the notes to designated handover points. ""Police said the gang used WhatsApp, Telegram and encrypted calling apps to connect with potential clients. Conversations were coded, identities were masked, and SIM cards were changed frequently to avoid tracking. Abhinav, identified as the mastermind, coordinated activities across the chain and handled communications between collectors and couriers.In two rounds of arrests-first on Oct 31 and then on Nov 6 night-cops also nabbed Fakhruddin, Nasruddin, Shubham Chaudhary, Arun Kashyap, Mahesh Prasad and Jitendra Kumar.An FIR has been registered under BNS sections 318(2) (cheating), 62 (punishment for attempting to commit offences), 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) and 3/5 (common intention) and 5/7 of the Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017.Police are now examining the digital trails and financial links between the accused and their clients. Investigators say two to three other suspects named in the FIR are yet to be traced. For now, officers are expanding their focus to traders and middlemen who approached the gang, the very people who kept this underground market alive.""Victims rarely report these cases because they fear legal consequences. That secrecy is what the gang exploited for years,"" the DCP said.","Eight members of a gang were arrested over the last two weeks.

NEW DELHI: In an attempt to seal the finances of banned Popular Front of India (PFI), the ED on November 6 attached properties worth Rs 67 crore of various trusts associated with the outfit and its political front, the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI). The attached properties are mostly located across Kerala. The total value of properties attached in the case so far is Rs 129 crore.The top brass of PFI is being investigated by NIA and ED for its role in sponsoring terror activities, particularly after it was found operating a terror training camp in Kerala's Narath, for which a special NIA court convicted 21 of its activists in 2016.""The history of origin of PFI can be traced back to the ban of Jamaat-e-Islami after demolition of Babri Masjid...

Workforce in numbers







New York City police officers are leaving the force in growing numbers, with morale sinking ahead of socialist Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral inauguration, according to the New York Post.NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year, according to Police Pension Fund data.“Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro. “You have a person who is supposed to be running New York City that does not believe in law enforcement. What’s coming out of everyone’s mouth is, ‘We’re in trouble.’”The Police Benevolent Association warned that attrition could worsen. “Every single month, we’re losing enough cops to staff an entire precinct,” PBA President Patrick Hendry said. “It will certainly get worse if our city leaders don’t work with us to fix our unsustainable workload, our expired contract and the constant second-guessing that is driving good cops away from the job.”New hires have helped cover up some losses. The NYPD has recruited 2,911 new officers this year, the highest in a single year since 2006, with the next class scheduled for December. The department currently has 33,745 uniformed officers, down slightly from 33,812 in 2024. Peak staffing was 40,285 in 2000, according to Independent Budget Office data.Concerns are mounting that Mamdani’s proposed reforms could further strain the force. The mayor-elect wants to create a Department of Community Safety to dispatch mental health professionals to crisis calls and shift disciplinary power to the Civilian Complaint Review Board.“How’s that going to work when the person pulls out a gun or a knife?” a Bronx cop asked.Former and current officers voiced frustration at Mamdani’s past comments calling cops racist and homophobic. “How do you work for somebody who considers you racist and anti-queer and wants to defund the police? Things are hard enough already. If you’re eligible to leave, why would you want to stay in that situation?” said a retired officer.A police union consultant warned recruitment could become increasingly difficult. “Nobody wants to be a New York City cop. It’s not worth the money, the stress, the danger, especially working for a mayor who wants to take the department apart,” the source told the New York Post.","NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year. “Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125193072,imgsize-1148308,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

: Foreign nationals seeking to immigrate to the United States could now be denied visas and green cards based on pre-existing chronic health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, under new guidance issued by the Trump administration.The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.A cable sent by the State Department to visa officers instructs them to flag applicants whose medical conditions could require ""hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care."" The list of conditions cited includes, but is not limited to cardiovascular diseases; respiratory diseases; cancers; diabetes; metabolic diseases; neurological diseases; and mental health conditions.The guidance also specifically advises officers to consider conditions like obesity, noting that it can lead to costly complications such as asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure. All these chronic illnesses are now being assessed as potential indicators that an individual might become a future financial burden on the United States.The policy shift, revealed on Thursday, is one of the most aggressive moves in the administration’s broader immigration crackdown, effectively linking an applicant’s health status to their eligibility for entry.It was not immediately clear if the directive applies to tourist and student visas. While it technically applies to all visa applicants, including those seeking non-immigrant visas for tourism (B-1/B-2) and studies (F1), it is expected to be primarily used for those seeking to permanently reside in the US.As things stand, tourist visa applicants are required to demonstrate they have sufficient financial means for their trip; they intend to leave the US at the end of their authorized stay; and they will not become a ""public charge"" during their temporary visit.At the heart of the new guidance is a stricter interpretation of the ""public charge"" rule—a century-old immigration provision designed to exclude those likely to become primarily dependent on government assistance. While health screenings have always been part of the visa process, traditionally focusing on communicable diseases like tuberculosis, the new directive vastly expands the list of conditions to be considered.Immigration advocates warn that the new rules grant consular officers, who lack medical expertise, sweeping authority to make subjective judgments about an applicant's long-term health since no one is expected to disclose their ailments in visa applications.Also read: Getting US visa could soon be harder for many – Who's affected? Under the new framework, visa officers are explicitly instructed to determine whether applicants have the financial resources to cover the costs of such long-term medical care ""over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.""Immigration experts contend that this policy will dramatically reduce legal immigration for older applicants and those with common chronic illnesses. Effectively, the policy will favor the wealthiest and healthiest applicants.","The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.

Chennai: At least 136 MBBS seats in the state, including 22 in govt medical colleges and nine seats in AIIMS-Madurai, were vacant after three rounds of counselling by Centre's medical counselling committee, as students who were allotted seats did not join the respective institutions. The committee has said that 802 MBBS seats across India are vacant.""These seats are in the seat matrix for the stray round.

""In the third round, the penalty for not joining the allotted colleges is 10,000 for govt institutions and 2 lakh for deemed universities.

The city woke up to a chilly Saturday covered in a blanket of smog on Saturday as the air quality deteriorated to 'very poor' levels, with several areas slipping into the 'severe' category and many others on the verge. It was also Delhi's lowest minimum temperature for the month so far at 11C, three notches below normal. The capital's overall AQI stood at 337 at 9am, rising to 343 by noon. By 4pm, it settled at 361 - among the worst readings this season - and was 380 by 8pm. So far this season, the worst average AQI the city recorded was 371 on October 31.Residents grappled with burning eyes, sore throats, and itchy noses amid a thick, choking haze. By late afternoon, more areas had entered the severe category, including Nehru Nagar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Bawana and Burari. The air quality is very likely to stay in the very poor category till November 11.However, Delhi Pollution Control Committee said the city's air quality this Nov has, so far, remained better than the corresponding period last year. Officials said that for six out of seven days, the AQI was lower than last year's readings, adding that unlike last year, when emergency restrictions under Grap 3 were invoked on Nov 13, this year the govt has initiated mitigation steps much earlier.Grap 3 is yet to be implemented this year as CAQM officials state it will only kick in once the AQI turns 400 or worse.Residents have been urged to avoid burning biomass, waste, or wood, especially as temperatures fall and such practices become common for heating. Large housing societies have been advised to replace coal or wood-fired heaters for security guards with electric ones. Construction sites have been asked to ensure anti-smog guns are installed and operational, particularly at projects above five floors, till at least Nov 29. DPCC also said that staggered office timings should continue. CM Rekha Gupta announced that the govt will soon extend Ujjwala benefits to slums, enabling them to switch to clean cooking fuel. The govt has also instructed departments to step up road cleaning, dust suppression and pavement repair.Itchy eyes, sore throat, choked lungs: Air quality takes a toll on residents | page 4Noida: Smog continued to choke Noida on Saturday, with several neighbourhoods waking up to a burning sensation in the eyes, sore throats, and increasing breathing discomfort. As the Air Quality Index (AQI) remained in 'very poor' category, residents said they have stopped early-morning walks, jogging, cycling, and other outdoor activities because of the thick layer of haze that blankets the skyline.CPCB data showed Noida's overall AQI rose to 354, up from 306 a day earlier.""It's impossible to step out for walks anymore. Even five minutes outdoors leaves the eyes and throat burning,"" said Pramila Dhar of Sector 78. ""Parks across high-rise clusters that are usually crowded on weekend mornings remained near-empty today.""Ghaziabad fared no better, with air quality sliding further to 339 from Friday's 314, while Greater Noida slipped from 'poor' to 'very poor', reaching 336 compared to 284.Station-level readings presented a grim picture for Noida. Sector 116 - which covers the 7x sectors - recorded the highest AQI at 357, followed by Sector 125 at 347, Sector 62 at 345, and Sector 1 at 341, all in the very poor range.Nisha Rai, a resident of Prateek Wisteria in Noida's Sector 77, said people in the area have been facing respiratory problems. ""People in the area are suffering from sore throats and breathing difficulties. We don't see water sprinkling being done, and the sky remains grey. We have also stopped outdoor activities,"" she said.Shreya Sharma, a resident of Panchsheel Pratishtha in Sector 75, said the AOA has started sprinkling water on its own. ""There is rampant construction in the neighbourhood, and trucks and dumpers carrying materials create dust. However, there is no official check on such activities.

Court: Sale proceeds of Choksi's assets to be given to affected lenders

MUMBAI: In a step towards liquidation of Gitanjali Gems Ltd, the company at the centre of the Rs 23,000 crore Punjab National Bank fraud case involving Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi , a special PMLA court allowed the company's liquidator to proceed with valuation and subsequent auction of 13 unsecured properties valued over Rs 46 crore, reports Rebecca Samervel.Among the assets are four flats at Borivli (each valued at Rs 2.6 crore), a commercial unit in the central wing of Bharat Diamond Bourse in BKC, along with 14 car parking spaces (Rs 19.7 crore), six industrial galas in Goregaon (E) (Rs 18.7 crore), silver bricks, semi-precious stones, and machines at the company's facility in Jaipur SEZ (Rs 90,120). The valuations are from 2018.Special judge AV Gujarathi said, ""If the property is kept idle and without maintenance, it will definitely reduce the value. Hence, it is necessary to pass an order in this case urgently.""The judge said the liquidator is allowed to carry out the requisite valuation of the properties held by GGL. ""Post undertaking the aforesaid valuation process, the liquidator is allowed to auction the unsecured properties which are held by GGL...by following due process under the applicable law, and the same be facilitated by the ED,"" the judge said.It was further directed the liquidator is allowed to open a fixed deposit with ICICI Bank (being the lead bank for GGL Consortium and NWL Consortium) for the proceeds from the sale of assets.NWL Consortium is a consortium of banks with ICICI Bank as the lead. They are creditors to companies involved in PNB scam.""The sale proceeds shall be deposited as FDs after deducting all associated costs and expenses incurred for the purpose of carrying out valuation and auction. The sale proceeds deposited in the form of FDs will be in favour of this court."" The judge also said the sale proceeds deposited in the form of FDs will be distributed to the aggrieved lenders.The application was moved by GGL's liquidator under the PMLA Act. It was submitted that the committee of creditors (CoC) initiated proceedings for liquidation by passing a resolution in 2019. The liquidator was appointed by an order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) dated Feb 7, 2024. On Sept 10, 2024, the special court allowed the liquidator to conduct the valuation of ""secured properties"" held by the company headed by Nirav Modi and Choksi.The court then called for the reply of ED. In its reply submitted through special public prosecutor Kavita Patil, ED said the plea moved by the liquidator was in the interest of justice and a necessary order may be passed. ED did not object to the plea. Nirav and Choksi are being held in jails in the UK and Belgium, respectively.","Gitanjali Gems Ltd is at the centre of the Rs 23,000 crore Punjab National Bank fraud case involving Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi.

NEW DELHI: On a long standing litigation between Mumbai and Bengaluru factions of Iskcon over control of Bengaluru temple, Supreme Court had kept the verdict reserved for more than a year and gave judgment favouring the Bengaluru branch in May just prior to the retirement of presiding judge Justice A S Oka.The bench of Justices Oka and A G Masih had set aside Karnataka High Court's detailed judgment in May 2011 giving control of the Bengaluru temple to the Mumbai branch. High Court had quashed the trial court decree of April 2009 which was in favour of the Bengaluru faction.After 14 years of the HC verdict and six months of Supreme Court judgment, pronounced a week before Justice Oka's retirement, the parties are now almost back to square one as a bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and A G Masih (who was part of the bench led by Justice Oka) delivered a split verdict on the Mumbai branch's plea for review of the May 16 judgment.Justice Maheshwari found that the Mumbai branch has made out a case for review of the judgment. In his two sentence order, he said, ""Applications for listing the review petitions in open court are allowed. Notice be issued to the parties."" This would mean Justice Maheshwari felt that the Mumbai branch should be allowed to argue its case in open court pointing out the ""error apparent"" in the judgment.On the other hand, Justice Masih said, ""After having carefully gone through the review petitions, the judgment under review and the material annexed therewith, I am satisfied there is no error apparent on the face of record or any merit in the review petitions, warranting reconsideration of the judgment impugned.The review petitions are, accordingly, dismissed.""""In view of the divergent views... the review petitions be placed before the CJI for directions and to do the needful,"" the bench then said.Iskcon-Mumbai had consistently maintained that the Bengaluru faction had never functioned as an independent entity and had always operated under the Mumbai branch, and hence, the management of the temple vested with the Mumbai faction. But the trial court had allowed the Bengaluru branch's suit, and given a decree in its favour over the management of the temple affairs. HC had set aside the decree and ruled that the Bengaluru branch functioned under the overarching control of Mumbai group.",Long standing litigation between Mumbai and Bengaluru factions of Iskcon over control of Bengaluru temple.

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

Why GRAP 3 not yet enforced?



NEW DELHI: The national capital on Saturday entered the ""red zone"" after the air quality index (AQI) crossed 400-mark, making the situation adverse for Delhiites and the citizens in the national capital region.With a 24-hour average AQI of 361, Delhi became the country’s second most polluted city, according to CPCB data. Several areas, including Wazirpur (420), Burari (418), and Vivek Vihar (411), recorded ""severe"" pollution levels, while most others hovered in the ‘very poor’ range. In the NCR, Noida (354), Greater Noida (336), and Ghaziabad (339) also reported hazardous air, underscoring the region’s worsening smog crisis.The air quality early warning system for Delhi has forecast that the city’s air will stay in the ‘very poor’ category for the coming days. Since Diwali, the capital’s air quality has largely hovered between ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’, at times deteriorating to ‘severe’ levels.Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) stage 3 has not been enforced yet because, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), the city’s air quality this November has remained comparatively better than the same period last year.Officials said that pollution levels have not yet reached the severe threshold that would trigger Stage 3 restrictions. They credited this improvement to timely and coordinated actions across departments, including intensified dust control, road cleaning, anti-smog operations, and stricter checks on vehicles and industrial emissions, which have helped delay the need for harsher measures.""Out of the last seven days, six have recorded better air quality than the corresponding days last year. This has been possible because of timely and coordinated action taken across departments,"" PTI quoted an official saying.""Last year, GRAP Stage 3 was imposed on November 13. This time, with support from all departments and the residents of Delhi, we hope to prevent reaching that stage,"" the official said.","The national capital on Saturday entered the ""red zone"" after the air quality index (AQI) crossed 400-mark.

Akola SIT case

to be posted before CJI for assigning another bench

NEW DELHI: After Maharashtra government took exception and sought review of a September 11 order of a two-judge Supreme Court bench to set up an SIT comprising police officers from Hindu and Muslim communities to probe certain crimes during 2023 Akola communal riots, the same judges gave a split verdict - one allowing the review, the other dismissing it.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, on behalf of Maharashtra, had pleaded before a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Satish Chandra Sharma that it would set a dangerous precedent as for every riot the police investigation must be done by assigning probes to officers depending on their personal faith when the police force is secular.The review petition said the direction for setting up of an SIT would be implemented but the state had taken exception to the direction as far as it impinged on the principle of institutional secularism. Justice Sharma said, ""In the considered opinion of this court as review and recall has been sought of the judgment to the limited extent that 'it directs or mandates the composition of the SIT on the basis of religious identity' requires consideration and, therefore, let notice be issued to the respondents, returnable within two weeks. ""But Justice Sanjay Kumar was furious over the filing of the review petition and condemned the manner in which the state made separate mentioning of the plea before both judges on the bench, without disclosing that the other was also being approached.Rejecting the review petition, Justice Kumar said the directions for including officers from both communities in the SIT was issued because of the laxity on part of police to register FIRs and probe the two crimes during the riots. Given the split verdict, the matter would now be posted before the CJI for assigning the review petition to another bench.Justice Kumar said, ""As the case related to communal riots..., and the hues of this case prima facie hinted at a religious bias, it was necessary to direct constitution of an investigation team comprising senior police officers of both communities so as to maintain transparency and fairness in the investigation. Needless to state, that should be the objective of the police machinery in the state of Maharashtra but, unfortunately, that did not happen in the case on hand. """"In such circumstances, constitution of an investigation team comprising members of both communities involved in the riot would go a long way in ensuring and safeguarding the transparency and fairness of the investigation...""","A two-judge Supreme Court bench ordered police officers from Hindu and Muslim communities to probe certain crimes during 2023 Akola communal riots.

Civic Woes, Star Candidate And High-Stakes Contest: Ground Report From Chapra Ahead Of Bihar Polls

SITAMARHI: In the heart of Bihar's Mithilanchal, where air carries the scent of Maithili folk songs and the pain of annual floods - though people had a respite this monsoon - 2025 assembly polls have boiled down to faith, jobs and local pride.NDA is banking on Ramayan symbolism and development pledges to hold its ground, while opposition Mahagathbandhan has played the migration and unemployment cards to counter the ""susashan"" narrative of incumbent Nitish Kumar, which is central to the ""double engine"" plank of the alliance, along with PM Modi's charisma.The buzz started when Union minister Amit Shah performed ""bhoomi pujan"" at Punaura Dham in Sitamarhi, the birthplace of Sita. NDA has promised massive redevelopment along the lines of Ayodhya, which includes a greenfield city, Sitapuram. Land acquisition is nearly done, and construction - funded through crowdfunding - will soon begin on a 68-acre complex costing Rs 890 crore.This pledge extends beyond Punaura. The project is a part of the Ramayana Circuit: Rs 52 crore for Valmiki Nagar, Rs 31 crore for Pulhar in Madhubani, Rs 24 crore for Panth Pakar in Sitamarhi, Rs 23 crore for Ahilya spot, Rs 13 crore for Ram Reka Ghat and Rs 7 crore for Sita Kund in Munger-Gaya.People in the region see the initiative as a boost to Mithila's identity where NDA's confidence is soaring amid a diverse mix of Yadavs, EBCs (36% as per 2023 caste survey), Muslims and upper caste Maithils.The promise of restarting Riga Sugar Mill, shut for over five years, has made locals hopeful. ""This will bring jobs back to our fields,"" says Ram Kripal, a farmer.NDA candidate Vaidyanath Prasad is locked in a tough fight with MGB's Congress pick Amit Kumar Tunna. Congress is hammering the ""local vs outsider"" point, painting Prasad as an import since he hails from Sheohar. Yet, NDA's edge is evident: in 2020, it had won 30 of Mithilanchal's 46 seats; in 2024 Lok Sabha polls, it swept all seven parliamentary segments here.Mithilanchal covers 10-12 districts: Darbhanga and Madhubani (10 seats each, NDA strongholds), Muzaffarpur and Samastipur (10 each, Yadav-EBC battles), Sitamarhi (6, migration woes), Saharsa (5), Supaul (3), Madhepura (3), Sheohar (1), and bits of Vaishali-Begusarai.Over 70 lakh voters, including 10 lakh first timers, will be eligible to cast votes in the second phase of polling on Nov 11. Women, whose turnout was 59% in 2024 Lok Sabha polls, have been wooed through schemes like aid for 1.51 crore Jeevika sisters, a factor which could be the most decisive one in case NDA maintains its winning streak.NDA's ""M3 Strategy"" - Mithila, Music, Mahila - is on show with folk singer Maithili Thakur as the star campaigner in 20+ seats. She draws the youth, countering migration blues. PM Modi and Shah have pushed ""Modiwaad + Nitishwaad,"" promising IT jobs, sugar mill revivals, and a classical language tag for Maithili.MGB, led by Tejashwi Yadav's RJD, is eyeing gains of 10-15 seats, hoping EBC voters will boost its Yadav-Muslim constituency. Tejashwi conducted rallies in Samastipur-Madhubani, promising one crore jobs, double panchayat pay and pensions. But seat-sharing woes -friendly fights on eight seats - and 'jungle raj' jibes are set to hurt MGB.Besides, AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi has fielded four candidates (in Jale, Bisfi, Keoti, Darbhanga town), splitting the Muslim vote. Jan Suraaj is contesting all 46 seats. It remains to be seen whom the new entrant will hurt the most, given that the fight is largely between the two alliances.","NDA is banking on Ramayan symbolism and development pledges to hold its ground.

However, the district magistrate concerned had, under Section 6 of the 2019 Act, already issued a certificate of identity, officially recognising Sharad's gender transition after surgery.Subsequently, he requested modification of his educational certificates to reflect his new name and gender. However, the regional secretary rejected his application on April 8, 2025.In its judgment delivered on Thursday, the court observed, ""Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 is a special Act. Section 20 of the Act provides that its provisions shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other law for the time being in force. Therefore, the concerned respondents (education authorities of the state) committed a legal error by not applying the provisions of the Act of 2019 in favour of the petitioner. ""Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocates HR Mishra and Chitrangada Narayan cited verdicts of SC and HCs to assert petitioner's right to have his name changed after gender reassignment.","Allahabad HC has directed UP education department to issue fresh marksheets and certificates with the required changes.

Major relief for Delhi Development Authority in housing project case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/major-relief-for-delhi-development-authority-in-housing-project-case/articleshow/125192028.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Delhi's Real Estate Appellate Tribunal (REAT) has set aside a Rs 1 crore penalty imposed on the Delhi Development Authority by Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) for failing to register a housing project.The relief came after DDA argued that the Rohini project was completed before the RERA for Delhi was established in 2017, making registration unnecessary.""The documents being sought now were not available when the authority passed the orders. Since these documents are crucial to the case, and in the interest of justice, it is appropriate to send the matter back to the authority to review the complaint again within two months,"" the REAT bench said in its recent order.In the process, REAT quashed RERA's order imposing the Rs 1-crore cost on DDA and overturned the direction to file a criminal complaint against the agency via its vice-chairman for violation of provisions of the real estate law.Earlier, in January, RERA had faulted DDA for not registering its ""Residential Plotting Project /Scheme, sector-7, Rohini,"" labelling it an ongoing project and alleging ""wilful default.""It had also directed that all future sales be suspended until registration was complete.In its appeal, DDA-represented by advocates Anil Sharma and Vrinda Kapoor Dev-argued that the project was completed before the Act came into force on May 1, 2017. They submitted a clarification from the ministry of housing and urban affairs stating that pre-2017 projects do not require RERA approval, along with a completion certificate and proof that sewerage services had been handed over to Delhi Jal Board in August 2009.The resident welfare association (RWA) of the housing society opposed the appeal, claiming the project remains ongoing under RERA and challenging the evidential value of DDA's documents. The RWA also argued that the completion certificate, based on the 1982 layout plan, did not account for the revised 1985 plan.REAT, however, left it to RERA to examine both DDA's submissions and the RWA's counterclaims.",Delhi's Real Estate Appellate Tribunal (REAT) has set aside a Rs 1 crore penalty imposed on the Delhi Development Authority. The relief came after DDA argued that the Rohini project was completed before the RERA for Delhi was established in 2017.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125192040,imgsize-676798,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-45.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday took congnisance of the alarming rise in dog bite incidents in institutional areas and ordered authorities to move stray dogs from educational centres, hospitals, and bus stations to shelter homes.A bench of justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria directed that stray dogs picked up from such institutions shall not be released back in the same place.

NEW DELHI: Operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport have returned to normal, the airport authority said on Saturday, a day after a technical glitch in the Air Traffic Control (ATC) flight planning process caused widespread delays across more than 800 flights, while some others were cancelled.In an advisory issued at 11:55 hours, IGI Airport confirmed that all flight operations were now normal. “Airline operations at Delhi Airport are returning to normal, and all concerned authorities are working diligently to minimise any inconvenience caused. Passengers are advised to stay in touch with their airlines for the latest flight update,” the advisory stated.The disruption at Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) was triggered by a glitch in the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS), which forced air traffic controllers (ATC) to abandon automated operations and switch to manual procedures. The slowdown began to affect the entire network from Thursday afternoon.As the airport deals with the fallout, it was revealed that, in July, the Air Traffic Controllers’ Guild of India had warned that “current systems, particularly at major airports such as Delhi and Mumbai, have shown performance degradation, including slowness and system lags, affecting operational efficiency and safety margins.”Read more: System crash, flight disruptions could have been avoided, say Air Traffic Controllers The AMSS is responsible for transmitting flight plan data to controllers’ screens, and its failure meant that each flight had to be processed manually, causing significant delays in arrivals and departures.As India’s busiest airport, IGIA typically handles around 1,500 aircraft movements daily, with peak traffic reaching 60–70 flights per hour, leaving little room for disruption when automation fails. Air traffic control, a ground-based service, manages and guides the movement of aircraft both on the ground and within controlled airspace, making such technical failures particularly impactful.","Operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport have returned to normal.

SCBA Takes Strict Action Against Rakesh Kishore For Court Misconduct

Accommodated request twice, AG not being fair to court: CJI





NEW DELHI: Unaffected by the rebuke from Supreme Court for seeking reference of petitions challenging the validity of the Tribunal Reforms Act to a five-judge bench half-way through the final hearing in the matter, attorney general R Venkataramani made a fresh request for adjournment on Thursday, upsetting CJI B R Gavai, who wondered why the top law officer wasn't being direct enough to seek adjournment of the hearing beyond Nov 24, when a new CJI assumes office.Venkataramani, who had already been granted two adjournments to enable him to participate in an international arbitration proceeding, through ASG Aishwarya Bhati, requested the bench to adjourn the hearing scheduled for Friday to Monday.The CJI, who on Nov 3 had refused to accept the Centre’s application seeking reference of the case to a five-judge bench and termed it as an attempt to drag the matter beyond his retirement date of Nov 23, told Bhati that the AG is “not being fair to the court” despite the bench, also including Justices K Vinod Chandran and Vipul Pancholi, accommodating his request for adjournment twice in the past.“If you want to have the hearing after Nov 24 (when Justice Surya Kant takes over as CJI), you should frankly say that,” the CJI said, adding that “every now and then it is told to us that the AG is busy with international arbitration and yet the Centre comes out with a midnight application seeking reference of the case midway through the final hearing to a five-judge bench.”“We have highest regard for the office of the highest law officer.But when we were practising in HCs, we used to give up cases if we were engaged in a part-heard matter before any bench to enable the HC to complete the hearing as scheduled,” CJI remarked. Though the CJI reluctantly agreed to adjourn the case to Monday, he pointed out that the bench needed enough time to write the judgment. The petitions before SC challenged the provisions of the Tribunal Reforms Act which put in place a uniform tenure of four years for the chairperson and members of different tribunals, even though SC had ruled that the tenure should be of five years.On Nov 3, the bench had said, “We did not expect the Union govt to indulge in such tactics. After we have heard the petitioners fully, the Union govt cannot be permitted to take the plea for reference to a larger bench.” However, it clarified that “if on consideration of the arguments, we arrive at a conclusion that the matter involves substantial questions of law requiring reference to a 5-J bench, we will do so”.","Attorney general R Venkataramani made a fresh request for adjournment on Thursday.

United States President Donald Trump on Thursday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he may travel to India next year as the two countries continue discussions on trade.Speaking to reporters at the White House after announcing a move to reduce the prices of weight loss drugs, Trump said his conversations with PM Modi were progressing smoothly.

Maharashtra Deputy CM Ajit Pawar’s 'How Dare You' Retort At IPS Officer Triggers Political Firestorm

.

.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said that a land deal involving his son Parth Pawar has been cancelled amid allegations of irregularities in the transaction.Addressing reporters after meeting chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Pawar said his son and his business partner were unaware that the land in Pune, which their company had agreed to purchase, belonged to the government.“The concerned land is a government land which cannot be sold. Parth and his partner Digvijay Patil were not aware of this fact. How the registration (of its sale) was done and who is responsible will come out in the probe being headed by ACS Vikas Kharge, who will submit his report in a month,” he said.Pawar maintained that transparency and adherence to the law remain his top priorities.“I have never flouted any rules in my 35-year political career. If anyone from my family or anyone close to me does something wrong, I will never support it. I have gathered all information about the case and spoken to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. I told him he can order a probe.”He confirmed that the sale documents and related transactions “have been cancelled,” and that affidavits to this effect have been submitted to the registering authorities.“Not a rupee has changed hands in the deal,” he said.He added: "" I want to make it clear that neither I nor my office made any phone calls, gave any help, or had any role or knowledge about this transaction at any stage.""Pawar further said that he has directed all officials under him not to succumb to any pressure, even if someone uses his name to influence a decision.""There is no transaction in the related case as yet. FIR has also been registered in the said case. Who had put pressure on officers, who were involved, who had carried out the transaction, everything will be investigated,” he added.In a formal statement issued, Pawar clarified that the deal was only an agreement to purchase land and no payment had been made by Parth or his firm, Amadea Enterprises LLP.""My son Parth says that the proposed deal was within the ambit of the law and was completely above board. However, in public life, we must not allow even the suspicion of wrongdoing. Since allegations of wrongdoing have been made, he has agreed to cancel the deal. The required document for cancellation of the sale deed has already been submitted to the registering authority,” the statement read.He reiterated that neither he nor his office made any calls or provided assistance at any stage.“I have always worked within the limits of law and rules. Every decision I take is based on fairness and legality. These principles apply equally to everyone, including my family members,” Pawar added. He further emphasised that the NCP and its members hold themselves to “the highest standards of probity and accountability.”The controversy erupted after reports surfaced that a company linked to Parth Pawar had agreed to buy 40 acres of government land in Pune’s Mundhwa area, valued around Rs 1,800 crore for Rs 300 crore, allegedly bypassing due procedures and stamp duty.Following preliminary findings, the state government suspended a sub-registrar and registered an FIR against three individuals, including a company partner and a government official.CM Fadnavis said that the inquiry will determine whether any irregularities occurred. He further added that “strict action will be taken if wrongdoing is established.”Meanwhile, political reactions have intensified. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that government land reserved for Dalits had been sold “at a throwaway price” to a minister’s family member, calling it “land theft.” He also questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s silence on the issue.Pawar further said that an inquiry committee has been appointed to investigate the matter and urged anyone with relevant information or evidence to come forward and present it before the panel.“The government has appointed an inquiry committee to look into the matter. Anyone who has information or evidence should present it before the committee. The truth will emerge through this process, and if anyone is found responsible for any wrongdoing, action will be taken,” he said.","Ajit Pawar cancels a land deal involving his son Parth Pawar amid allegations of irregularities in the transaction.

Bihar polls: Record voter turnout in Phase 1 triggers guessing game — will it help or hurt Nitish Kumar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-record-voter-turnout-triggers-guessing-game-will-it-help-or-hurtnitishkumar-mahagathbandhan-nda-election-narendra-modi-tejashwi/articleshow/125165511.cms,"‘Do Not Like MLA, But…’: Gaya Voters Face ‘Nitish’ Dilemma, Reveal Bihar Poll Mood

What history tells about high voter turnout

What analysts feel

Is SIR responsible for high voter turnout?

NEW DELHI: High voter turnout in the first phase of polling in Bihar assembly elections on Thursday has raised many eyebrows, curiously wondering whether it will favour the Nitish Kumar-led incumbent government or is it a sign of aggressive anti-incumbency voting.For 121 assembly seats, Bihar recorded 64.66 per cent voter turnout, which was an 8.5 per cent jump from the 2020 assembly elections. The enthusiastic voting has led both alliances - NDA and the Mahagathbandhan - interpreting the surge to their advantage.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday asserted that the record turnout in the first phase of Bihar assembly polls was proof that people have reposed their trust in the ""track record of Narendra and Nitish"".""Yesterday, the voters of Bihar broke all records. Never before in the history of the state has there been such a high poll percentage. Much of the credit goes to mothers and sisters, the Maatri Shakti (mother power), who turned up in large numbers to raise the turnout to nearly 65 per cent. It is evident that they all have trust in the track record of Narendra-Nitish,"" PM Modi said. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, the INDIA bloc's chief ministerial candidate, said, ""I salute the people of Bihar for the bumper voting.I can now confidently say you have affirmed the victory of 'Mahagathbandhan'.""Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor also hailed voter turnout and claimed it to be a sign of the people's yearning for a change. ""After November 14, when votes will be counted, Bihar will have a new regime.""Rashtriya Janata Dal feels that the high voter turnout is a confirmation to Tejashwi Yadav's bet to the chief ministerial post.Riding on the anti-incumbency wave, RJD scion's 's campaign revolving around the promise of Ek Parivar, Ek Naukri; MAA Yojana; free electricity up to 200 units; farm loan waivers; expanded scholarships; and a return to the old pension system. His last moment effort to roll out Rs 30,000 to women on Makar Sankranti is also seen as a counter to NDA.After the first phase of the elections, Tejashwi claimed that the people of Bihar have voted for change.“Today, Bihar has voted for change in the first phase. Every citizen has stepped out to end the 20 years of darkness and lit the flame of transformation, bringing a wave of happiness, prosperity, and peace across the state,"" Tejashwi said.RJD supremo patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav drew a parallel between politics and roti while advocating for a regime change in Bihar.""We must keep flipping the roti when it is on the hot tawa, otherwise it will get burnt. Twenty years is enough. A Tejashwi (Yadav) led government is important for a new Bihar,"" he said, sharing a photo with son Tejashwi and wife and former Chief Minister Rabri Devi. The veteran leader and his family cast their votes at a polling booth in Patna.Historically, high voter turnout is a sign of regime change in Bihar. People have traditionally lined up in polling booths when they desire for change.In 1980, the voter turnout surged almost 7 per cent in favour of Congress after a three-year rule of Karpoori Thakur-led Janata Party government and a president's rule.In 1990, voter turnout rose from 56.3 per cent to 62 per cent — a 5.8 per cent increase that saw the ousting of Jagannath Mishra-led Congress government and Lalu Prasad Yadav from Janata Dal took oath as chief minister.However, in 2005, turnout dropped by 16%, yet it again brought a change of guard, with JD(U)’s Nitish Kumar taking office for the first time.In 2010, voter turnout rose from 46.5 per cent to 52.7 per cent, giving Nitish Kumar another chance as chief minister due to his promising work earning him the name of ""Sushashan Babu.""Political analyst Kumar Vijay feels that the cash rollouts and social security schemes announced by Nitish, just ahead of the elections, might have worked in favour of NDA in the first phase of polls. He, however, said that votes ""will translate more in favour for JD(U) within the NDA"" -- which seemed to lag behind ahead of the elections.""Women voter turnout in the first phase of the elections was very encouraging. It seems that Mukhya Mantri Mahila Rojgaar Yojana, which gave Rs 10,000 to the bank accounts of 75 lakh women, free electricity upto 125 units and increased pension to Rs 1,100 may have worked out for the incumbent government,"" Kumar Vijay said while talking to The Times of India.""Even after 20 years of Nitish Kumar's rule, surprisingly, anti-incumbency was not visible,"" he added.He further said that Mahagathbandhan's rozgaar promise may not have worked in the first phase of the elections.""Employment pitch by Tejashwi does not seem to impress voters. RJD's promise to transfer Rs 30,000 under Mai Bhain Yojana till January 14 also did not work as it was only a promise, while NDA government had already transferred Rs 10,000,"" he said.Meanwhile, Kumar Vijay said that migrants labpureres in north Bihar, who returned home for Chhath festivities and have not yet gone back to their places of work, are the ""X factor"" in the assembly polls and may incline more towards Prashant Kishore's Jan Suraaj.""Jan Suraaj made migration a huge issue in the run up to the elections. Migrant laboureres in north Bihar, who returned home for Chhath festivities and have not yet gone back to their places of work, are the 'X factor' in the assembly polls and may incline more towards Prashant Kishore's Jan Suraaj.""Months before the assembly elections, the Election Commission conducted a voter list purification drive - Special Intensive Revision - which led to a significant correction in the state’s electoral roll.Following SIR, the final list included 7.42 crore eligible voters — 18 lakh more than the 7.24 crore names in the draft roll, but 47 lakh fewer than the 7.89 crore names recorded before the revision exercise.In the Magadh region, the voter base grew by an average of 2.6 per cent, with Patna district registering the highest increase at 3.4 per cent, adding around 1.6 lakh new voters to the rolls. This might be the responsible for the higher voter turnout.In the 2020 Bihar assembly elections, the battle across these 121 seats turned out to be one of the most tightly contested phases. The Mahagathbandhan — comprising the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress, and Left parties — managed to secure a slender edge by winning 61 constituencies. The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the BJP and JD(U), was close behind with 59 seats.Now, the second phase of assembly polls will be held on November 11, and the votes will be counted on November 14.While the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), comprising of BJP, JD(U), HAMS, LJP (RV), and others, is looking to retain power for a second term, the Mahagathbandhan, comprising Congress, RJD, left parties, and VIP, is looking to get back to power. Jan Suraaj party has also made a debut in the electoral fray, contesting in more than 200 seats on its own.In the 2020 assembly election, NDA won 125 seats, while the Mahagathbandhan secured 110 seats. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) emerged as the single largest party with 75 seats, followed closely by BJP with 74 and JD(U) with 43.","For 121 assembly seats, Bihar recorded 64.66 per cent voter turnout, which was an 8.5 per cent jump from the 2020 assembly elections. The enthusiastic voting has led both alliances - NDA and the Mahagathbandhan - interpreting the surge to their advantage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125165546,imgsize-1355521,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well” Facebook-parent Meta made a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup in June.

Delhi airport flight delay: What has caused the technical glitch affecting hundreds of flights across India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/delhi-airport-flight-delay-what-has-caused-the-technical-glitch-affecting-hundreds-of-flights-across-india/articleshow/125150625.cms,"Massive ATC System Breakdown At Delhi Airport Disrupts Flights; Airlines Urge Patience And Care

What caused the ATC glitch at Delhi airport

How air traffic control systems work

Why delays spread beyond Delhi

What passengers experienced

What this reveals about aviation infrastructure





Hundreds of flights were delayed at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport this morning after a technical failure in the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system forced controllers to manually process every departure and arrival. The breakdown, which began Thursday evening, disrupted operations at India's busiest airport and caused cascading delays across several other key airports.Controllers lost access to automated flight plan data when the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS) crashed, slowing operations to a crawl at an airport that typically handles over 1,500 flight movements daily. Airlines including IndiGo , Air India, SpiceJet, and Akasa Air warned passengers of extended delays, with some departures held up for over 53 minutes by mid-morning Friday.The Airports Authority of India said technical teams were working to restore the system but provided no timeline for when normal operations would resume.The problem originated in the Automatic Message Switching System, which automatically transmits flight plan data to air traffic controllers' screens. When AMSS failed Thursday at 3 PM, controllers could no longer receive this information automatically and had to manually compile flight plans using available data.This manual process is significantly slower than automated systems, reducing the number of flights that can be processed per hour. ""Such a glitch is uncommon and has not happened earlier,"" one official familiar with the situation said. ""Since each task before a flight departure is being done manually, there is chaos at Delhi ATC currently.""The system had been experiencing issues since Wednesday evening, according to sources, but the full impact became apparent Thursday afternoon when the automated messaging system went down completely.Air traffic control manages the movement of aircraft both in the air and on the ground, ensuring safe distances between planes while maintaining efficient traffic flow. Modern ATC relies heavily on automated systems that process flight plans, track aircraft positions, and provide real-time data to controllers.The Auto Track System displays this information on controllers' screens, allowing them to coordinate takeoffs, landings, and aircraft movements. AMSS serves as the communication link between ATC and airlines, transmitting thousands of messages daily about flight plans, weather updates, and operational changes.When automation fails, controllers must revert to manual procedures—writing down flight details, calculating separations, and coordinating through voice communication. While these backup procedures maintain safety, they cannot match the speed of automated systems, creating bottlenecks that slow operations significantly.The disruption at Delhi had far-reaching effects. As a major connecting hub for North India, delays here affect the entire regional network. Aircraft scheduled to fly onward from Delhi were grounded. Planes meant to arrive and depart again sat waiting. Crew duty time limits were affected, and passengers missed connections.Flight tracking data showed 513 delayed flights on Thursday and 171 more by Friday morning. Each delay compounded the next as aircraft queued for manual clearances that normally happen automatically within seconds.The manual processing created congestion both on the ground and in the airspace, as controllers could only handle a fraction of their usual workload. Airlines faced operational challenges largely beyond their control, with ground teams attempting to manage passenger concerns while waiting for the technical issue to be resolved.Passengers reported confusion and frustration as delays mounted without clear information about when flights would depart. Many waited both at gates and inside aircraft that had already boarded.IndiGo initially posted a detailed explanation on social media describing the AMSS outage as ""the backbone of pre-flight and in-flight communication between ATC and airlines."" The airline later deleted the post but continued to advise passengers to check its website for updates on their flights.Air India issued a travel advisory stating that the ""technical issue with the ATC system in Delhi is impacting flight operations across all airlines"" and was ""beyond our control."" The airline said cabin crew and ground staff were providing assistance to reduce inconvenience.One reporter on an IndiGo flight said the captain announced that ""all aircraft are delayed"" and that ""ATC systems are down,"" affecting all Delhi departures with no update on how long repairs would take.The incident highlights the aviation industry's heavy reliance on automated systems. AMSS is not cutting-edge technology but essential infrastructure that operates invisibly until it fails. When it does, the impact is immediate and widespread.While backup procedures exist to maintain safety, they cannot replicate the efficiency of automated systems. The scale and complexity of modern air traffic make manual operations a necessary fallback but an inadequate substitute for normal operations.This wasn't the first major disruption at Indian airports this week. On Thursday, Air India and several other carriers experienced delays due to a third-party connectivity network outage that affected check","Hundreds of flights were delayed at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport.

US Shutdown Triggers Massive Political War, Trump Mulls Mass Layoffs; Dems Call Move 'Dirty Trick'





Online job search platform Indeed is reportedly eliminating a very small number of roles, Business Insider reports. The latest job cuts come four months after the company announced to lay off over 100 employees in July earlier this year. The BI report quotes a statement from Indeed where it says “To better align our team structure with business priorities, we've reorganized several functions and made the difficult decision to eliminate a very small number of roles”.However, no details about the roles impacted are known yet.As part of an ongoing restructuring effort by its parent company – Japan’s Recruit Holdings, Indeed has reduced its global workforce to around 11,000 employees. As mentioned above, in July, Indeed and its sister company Glassdoor together laid off about 1,300 employees. The cuts then mainly affected the US-based teams working in research, people operations, and sustainability.In an internal email to staff at the time, Recruit Holdings and Indeed CEO Hisayuki “Deko” Idekoba said, “AI is changing the world” and stressed the need for the company to evolve quickly. “Delivering on this ambition requires us to move faster, try new things, and fix what's broken,” Idekoba wrote. “To achieve our company priorities, it requires creating a structure and culture to support them.”This marks the second round of layoffs at Indeed in two years. In May 2024, the company had already let go of around 1,000 employees, or about 8% of its workforce at the time.","Online job search platform Indeed is reportedly eliminating a very small number of roles.

Canada Rejects 74% Indian Student Visas In August, Citing Fraud, As Ties With India Hit New Low





The Canadian government has announced new immigration level plans as the country aims to attract top researchers and H-1B visa holders, reports Bloomberg. Prime Minister Mark Carney presented its first budget where he unveiled a plan to attract international talent, earmarking $1.2 billion to recruit more than 1,000 skilled researchers. As part of the new immigration plan, the Canadian government has set a target of bringing in 380,000 permanent residents per year from 2026 through 2028.“The expertise of these researchers will help advance our global competitiveness and contribute to the economy of the future,” the budget statement reads.Canada’s new program is expected to draw skilled professionals from the US and other countries. The announcement comes after US President Donald Trump raised H-1B visa fees to $100,000 from September 21, 2025.The Canadian government is also planning an “accelerated pathway” for H-1B visa holders in the coming months. Additionally, it aims to reduce the share of non-permanent residents to less than 5% of the population by the end of 2027. The figure was 7.3% on July 1 this year.Further, the government plans to lower the number of temporary residents to 3,85,000 in 2026 and 3,70,000 in the following two years — a drop of more than 40% from current levels.The sharpest cut will come from study permits, which are set to fall to 1,55,000 in 2026 and 1,50,000 in both 2027 and 2028.The Bloomberg report claims that these figures are significantly lower than the previous targets under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, which projected around 305,900 study permits each year between 2025 and 2027.The report quotes Universities Canada, which in a statement said that it “recognizes the government’s efforts to build a sustainable immigration system that welcomes those seeking to study at Canada’s world-class universities, but the plan must match this government’s talent and economic agenda.”","Canada to introduce accelerated pathway for H-1B visa holders. $1.2 billion earmarked to recruit more than 1,000 skilled researchers.

Tesla announced the results of the vote on Thursday (November 6) at its annual shareholders meeting in Austin, Texas. The final vote tally is expected to be formalized in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing within days. Musk is expected to achive certain milestones, like selling robotaxi fleet, humanoid robots and more to get the full package.The approval essentially grants Musk enormous influence over the electric vehicle (EV) company and aims to mitigate the risk of him focusing his attention on other ventures.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said that the government programmes are often inefficient because they operate without real competitors or customer feedback. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), the tech billionaire wrote: “The reason government programs are so inefficient is that, unlike a commercial company, the feedback loop for improvement is broken, because they have a state-mandated monopoly and can’t go out of business if customers are unhappy. ”He added that poor service in government departments continues because citizens have no choice but to use them. “No matter how bad the service is at your DMV (sorry to pick on DMVs), you still have to use your DMV, because it’s a monopoly,” Musk said.The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has often been vocal about government inefficiency and regulation. His latest remarks appear to be a broader criticism of how state-run institutions lack accountability compared to private companies, which must improve constantly to retain customers.Musk’s post has drawn attention on X, with several users agreeing with his comments about bureaucratic inefficiency, while others argued that public services cannot always function like private businesses due to their social obligations.Commenting on Musk’s post, one user wrote “Imagine shareholders of a failing company demanding that other shareholders give the company more money to fail. Socialism in a nutshell”. The Tesla CEO replied in affirmative writing ‘Yup’.U.S. Senator for Kentucky Rand Paul also responded to Musk’s post. He wrote: “Which is why we should let government do as little as necessary and keep power with individuals and the market”.
