External affairs minister S Jaishankar may meet his Bangladesh counterpart Touhid Hossain next week, as both sides remain in touch diplomatically to finalise the proposed meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. Jaishankar is expected to use the meeting to underscore the need to quickly restore law and order in the country, express concern over the threat to minorities, particularly Hindus , while also reaffirming India’s commitment to work with a democratic and peaceful Bangladesh despite the recent tensions in ties.Jaishankar-Hossain talks will likely be the first high-level, in-person engagement between India and the interim government in Dhaka since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina. India has so far not officially ruled out a meeting between PM Narendra Modi and Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus but it looks unlikely apparently because of scheduling constraints.Modi will address the UN Summit of the Future on September 23 and leave for India the same day. Jaishankar, however, will be in New York to deliver India’s national statement at the UNGA on September 28.The meeting will be closely followed to also see what issues Hossain raises with India. Both Hossain and Yunus have suggested that Bangladesh wants Hasina extradited but Dhaka has to do a lot of paperwork before approaching India with an official extradition request. However, with key political parties like the BNP also seeking Hasina’s extradition, her extended stay in India is unlikely to help India’s efforts to get the relationship back on to an even keel.The Indian government has also taken note of some of the “unhelpful’’ remarks made by a few of the top functionaries of the interim government, starting with Yunus himself. The chief advisor has twice said that the issue about attacks on minorities are exaggerated, calling upon India to not remain captivated by the “narrative that portrays every other political party except Awami League as Islamist’’ or that Bangladesh is safe with only Hasina at the helm.India is also wary of the interim government’s efforts to, as Hossain said in an interview this week, build a normal relationship with Pakistan after Hasina’s exit. Yunus has sought a revival of SAARC, which remains stalled because of India’s opposition to cross-border terrorism, and reports from Dhaka say he’s likely to have a bilateral meeting with Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif in New York next week.","Jaishankar-Hossain talks will likely be the first high-level, in-person engagement between India and the interim government in Dhaka since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina.

It revealed the presence of foreign fats including lard (clarified pig fat), tallow (beef fat) and fish oil.SEE ALSO: '3 lakh laddus daily, Rs 500 crore revenue annually': Tirupati's sacred sweet takes a sour turn after ghee adulteration charges The samples also contained fats from vegetable sources like coconut, linseed, rapeseed and cottonseed.The analysis was conducted on July 23 after the government received complaints of change in taste of the laddu prasadam.Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had sparked a major controversy on Wednesday when he told NDA allies that animal fat had been found in the ghee for the laddus when YSRC was in power. YSRC had reacted angrily, denying the allegations and claiming it to be one of Naidu’s political stunts.The analysis by the Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF) of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), however comes with a caveat - there can be chances of false positive results in certain circumstances. The report lists several conditions where a result could go wrong, including in cases like overfeeding cows with feed rich in vegetable oils, underfeeding cows or the milk being subjected to technological treatments like removal of cholesterol.The report is silent whether the adulterants were deliberately added or crept in through feeding conditions and other factors.Naidu’s allegation and the NDDB’s report have shocked millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe as the Tirupati laddus are considered Maha Prasadam and carry a high sentimental value.The TDP govt had in June appointed senior IAS officer J Syamala Rao as the new executive officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) which manages the temple complex. As part of streamlining measures, an inquiry was ordered into the alleged poor quality, taste and texture of the laddus.TTD constituted an expert committee to look into the quality of the prasadam. The members included Dr B Surendranth, former principal scientist of the National Dairy Research Institute, Vijayawada, Bhaskar Reddy (dairy expert), Prof B Mahadevan (IIM-Bangalore) and Dr G Swarnalatha from the Telangana Veterinary UniversityApart from suggesting several measures to TTD to restore the taste and quality, the committee also sent samples of the ghee to NDDB, Gujarat. The lab reports, issued in July, confirmed the presence of foreign fats. TTD returned the ghee stocks supplied by AR Dairy Foods, Dindigul, in Tamil Nadu and blacklisted the contractor. Then, TTD selected Karnataka Milk Federation to supply the ghee.TTD sources said that while cow ghee was procured from the blacklisted contractor at Rs 320 per kg, the Tirupati trust is now procuring ghee at Rs 475 per kg from the Karnataka federation.TTD prepares and distributes about 3 lakh laddus to the devotees every day at Tirumala. Every year, the trust earns around Rs 500 crore from laddu sales alone.","The TDP govt in Andhra Pradesh made public laboratory analysis of the cow ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala temple trust for making its famous Tirupati laddu prasadam.

Curbs imposed by FCU rule fail proportionality test: Judge

MUMBAI: Describing it as an infringement on the right to equality and freedom of speech , Bombay high court on Friday quashed the amended Information Technology rules enabling the Centre to set up its own fact check unit (FCU) and flag social media content about its functioning as 'fake, false or misleading'.Holding the FCU to be unconstitutional, Justice A S Chandurkar of the Bombay high court - who served as 'tie-breaker judge' after a division bench in Jan 2024 delivered a split verdict - described the expression, 'fake, false and misleading' as 'vague and overbroad'.""The FCU in a sense is an arbiter in its own cause,"" said Justice Chandurkar, echoing the view of Justice Patel who had on Jan 31, 2024, struck down the rule as unconstitutional for its vagueness and disproportionality. Justice Patel had differed with Justice Neela Gokhale, on the two-judge bench that heard the matter and arrived at a split verdict, thus bringing it before a third judge.Justice Chandurkar said the FCU rule would have ""a chilling effect"" on individuals as well as intermediaries; the new rule could have led to loss of 'safe harbour' against legal action for social media platforms if FCU-flagged content was not acted upon. The FCU rule is sans safeguards to prevent its abuse, said Justice Chandurkar, rejecting the Centre's stand that making the FCU's findings subject to a legal challenge was a safeguard.Striking down the Centre's proposed fact check unit, Justice A S Chandurkar of Bombay high court said there was no rationale to undertake an exercise in determining whether information related to the business of Central govt was fake or false or misleading when in digital form but not doing the same when such information was in print.""Under the right to freedom of speech and expression, there is no further 'right to the truth', nor is it the responsibility of the State to ensure that citizens are entitled only to 'information' that is not fake or false or misleading as identified by FCU,"" HC said.Justice Chandurkar in a 99-page opinion accepted all major contentions raised by comedian Kunal Kamra and others who challenged its constitutional validity, citing its ""chilling effect"" on fundamental rights. The judge said he agreed with arguments that the rule violated Article 14 (right to equality), Article 19 (1) (a) (freedom of speech), and Article 19(1)(g) (freedom of trade) of the Constitution.The third judge's ruling renders a majority view against FCU by 2:1. The judgment to strike down the rule will be formally pronounced soon by a two-judge bench assigned the roster, one of the judges being Justice Gokhale.FCU was brought into play in April 2023 through an amendment to rules for intermediaries under IT Act of 2000. The Centre introduced it as a mechanism to flag as 'fake, false or misleading' digital content concerning the 'business' or functioning of the Centre. Kamra, followed by others including Editors Guild of India, News Broadcasters & Digital Association and Association of India Magazines challenged the decision, citing its vagueness and overbreadth and the lack of the Centre's legal capacity to split content online to fall in two categories - non-govt-related and govt-related.The rule cannot be saved by reading it down, Justice Chandurkar concluded, rejecting the Centre's contention of having ""adopted the least restrictive mode to prevent the spread"" of information that it deemed fake, false or misleading.When he first began hearing the matter in March 2024, Justice Chandurkar had declined Kamra's plea for an interim stay, pending final disposal of the challenge. The Union govt, subsequently, notified FCU. Kamra went to SC which on March 20 stayed the rule, noting constitutional issues had been raised.Justice Chandurkar said the restrictions imposed by the rule failed the proportionality test ""especially when it seeks to abridge fundamental rights, (to free speech and trade)."" He held, ""Rule 3(1)(b)(v) seeks to restrict the fundamental right... by seeking to place restrictions"" that do not align with Article 19(2) (reasonable restrictions). It is ""impermissible through the mode of delegated legislation,"" held Justice Chandurkar.""The Editors Guild of India is justified in its grievance that it is concerned with both, the print media as well as digital platforms. There is thus an infringement of the right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) (freedom of trade),"" said the third Judge.","The Bombay high court quashed the amended Information Technology rules enabling the Centre to set up its own fact check unit (FCU) Justice A S Chandurkar described the expression, 'fake, false and misleading' as 'vague and overbroad' He said the FCU rule would have ""a chilling effect"" on individuals as well as intermediaries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113535909,imgsize-53228,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/113535909.jpg"

The impugned rules are violative of Article 14 (right to equality), 19 (freedom of speech and expression) and 19(1)(g) (freedom and right to profession) of the Constitution of India,"" the judge said.The expression ""fake, false and misleading"" in the Rules was ""vague and hence wrong"" in the absence of an definition, he added.The petitions were referred to Justice Chandurkar after a division bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Neela Gokhale delivered a split verdict in January, with Justice Patel striking down the Rules and Justice Gokhale upholding them.The IT Amendment Rules, 2023, introduced changes to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. A key provision under Rule 3 empowered the central government to establish Fact-Check Units (FCUs) tasked with identifying false or fake news about the government circulating on social media and online platforms.On April 6, 2023, the Union government promulgated amendments to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which included a provision for an FCU to flag fake, false, or misleading online content related to the government. Under these rules, if the FCU identifies any posts that are fake, false, or contain misleading facts about the government's business, it would flag them to social media intermediaries. The intermediary then has the option to either take down the post or put a disclaimer on it.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday took a dim view of Karnataka HC judge V Srishananda's purported gratuitous reference to a Muslim-majority Bengaluru locality as Pakistan, and said it would consider laying down guidelines to keep judges from getting carried away during judicial proceedings and ending up being the butt of ridicule on social media.CJI D Y Chandrachud took suo motu cognisance of Justice Srishananda's controversial reference to a Bengaluru locality in the course of observations on traffic rule violation, which trended on social media along with his misogynistic comment aimed at a woman lawyer.The CJI constituted a bench of the top five judges - Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B R Gavai, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy besides him - to record SC's displeasure over judges going overboard in their remarks during judicial proceedings.

Congress demands CBI probe

Karnataka govt mandates temples to use Nadani ghee for prasadam

'Lab reports confirms presence of animal fat in the ghee'



NEW DELHI: The controversy over the adulteration of laddus, part of Tirupati temple prasadam, intensified on Friday with the Centre intervening and seeking a report.Former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy, meanwhile, denied allegations of the use of animal fat in preparation of the Tirupati laddu during his tenure and in turn accused Chandra Babu Naidu of ""playing with the sentiments of devotees for political gains"".The YSRCP chief said that the tender process occurs every six months and the qualification criteria has not changed for decades.""The tender process occurs every six months, and the qualification criteria has not changed for decades. Suppliers must provide an NABL certificate and a product quality certificate. TTD collects samples from the ghee, and only products that pass certification are used,"" Reddy said.""TDP is politicizing religious matters. We have rejected the products in our regime 18 times,"" he added.Reddy also announced that he will be writing to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Justice of India explaining how Naidu twisted the facts and why action should be taken against him for having done so.""Ultimately, at the end of the day, I myself am writing a letter to the Prime Minister. I am also writing a letter to the Chief Justice of India. I am explaining to them as to howChandrababu Naidu twisted the facts and why action should be taken against him for having done so,"" Reddy said.The Centre sought a full report on the issue and Union health minister JP Nadda said that the government will further the matter and take suitable actionsUnion health minister JP Nadda also asked for a full report from CM Naidu and said that the government will further the matter and take suitable actionsDuring a press conference, Nadda said that he spoke to Naidu after the controversy erupted and announced speaking to state regulators for a thorough investigation""I spoke to Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu after getting information about this and took details from him. I have asked him to share the available report so that I can examine it,"" Nadda said""I will also speak to the state regulators and investigate this. Suitable action will be taken as per the food safety standards . As of now I have asked for the report and we will examine it,"" he added.Temple's executive officer Shamala Rao said that the contractors were also warned of stringent action if they supply adulterated and low-quality ghee.""When I took over as executive officer TTD, the CM expressed concern on the ghee procured and the quality of the laddu which is considered to be very sacred and offered as 'Prasadam' to Lord Venkateswara Swamy. Any deviation in the quality will cause doing 'apavithram' (doing something which is not sacred). He wanted me to take steps to ensure that the sanctity of this temple is restored including getting pure cow milk ghee. We started working on that""""We found that we don't have any internal lab to test adulteration in the ghee. There is no system to check the quality of ghee in outside labs also... The rates quoted by tenderers are unviable, they are so low that anyone can say that pure cow ghee cannot cost so less... We warned all suppliers that they will be blacklisted if the ghee supplied doesn't pass the lab test. We collected all samples and sent it to the best lab, it is government-controlled, and the reports have come and are shocking,"" he added.Rao also announced setting up a four-member expert committee to keep a check on the ghee procured by the temple.""The report says the ghee sample is adulterated with vegetable fat and also animal fat. Animal fat adulteration includes lard (pig fat), palm oil, beef tallow, and fish oil including grape seed and linseed. The ghee sample was a concoction of all this and the result was abnormally low. Pure milk fat should have a reading between 95.68 to 104.32, but all our ghee samples had values around 20, which means the ghee supplied is highly adulterated,"" he said.""We started the procedure for blacklisting and also penalising the supplier. We formed an expert committee to improve ghee supplies and also to strengthen our internal system so that we don't face this problem again... We have found suppliers who have passed the tests... We have been asked by the expert committee to set up our own lab... This problem will be solved in the future,"" he added.Andhra Pradesh Congress President YS Sharmila shot off a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah demanding a central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into Chandra Babu Naidu's allegations and said that the issue is related to sentiments and faith of millions of devotees and""Yesterday, Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu told that the earlier government was involved in the adulteration of prasadam. This relates to the sentiment, emotions and faith of crores of people, not only in Andhra Pradesh but also all over the country and even internationally,"" Andhra Pradesh Congress President YS Sharmila said.""N Chandrababu Naidu presented a report that said a sample was taken on the day that he assumed power and this sample reported that there is beef tallow and fish oil also in the ingredients that were used to make the laddus, the prasadam in Tirupati. We do not understand why Chandrababu Naidu made this so casual,"" she added.Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi also called for a thorough probe into the controversy and said that authorities across India must protect the sanctity of religious spaces.Taking to X, Gandhi said that the issue hurt every devotee and needs to be thoroughly investigated.""The reports about the defilement of the Prasad at Sri Venkateshwara temple in Tirupati are disturbing. Lord Balaji is a revered deity for millions of devotees in India and across the world. This issue will hurt every devotee and needs to be thoroughly looked into,"" Gandhi said.""Authorities across India have to protect the sanctity of our religious spaces,"" the Congress leader added.Amid the ongoing controversy, Karnataka government on Friday issued a directive for notified temples across the state to use 'pure Nandini ghee' for preparing prasadam and other services.In a letter issued to all the district collectors, religious endowment department and other officials, the government directed to maintain the quality of the prasadam prepared in the temples.""All notified temples under the Karnataka State Religious Endowment Department are instructed to use only Nandini ghee mandatorily for services, lamps, and all types of prasadam preparation, as well as in the Dasoha Bhavan,"" the letter read.""Additionally, it is directed to maintain the quality of the prasadam prepared in the temples,"" it added.This comes a day after Telugu Desam Party cited a laboratory report supporting the claims made by Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu regarding the use of animal fat in the preparation of the renowned Tirumala laddu during the tenure of the previous government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy of the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP).A lab test report confirmed the presence of animal fat in the ghee used to prepare the famous Tirumala laddu during the term of the previous YSRCP government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.According to the report, fish oil, beef tallow and lard was found in the sample of the prasad during the examination.Earlier, Andhra Pradesh CM Naidu accused the previous YSRCP government of mixing animal fat in the ghee used to prepare the prasad during its term.""They (YSRCP govt) have spoiled the quality of the free food service and did not even leave Lord Venkateswara's laddu by using substandard ingredients,"" he said.Naidu said that he was astonished to find that poor quality material was used to prepare Lord Venkateswara's 'prasadam.'","Former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy denied allegations of the use of animal fat in preparation of the Tirupati laddu.

Strong emotions over Article 370 unite youths in Valley,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/strong-emotions-over-article-370-unite-youths-in-valley/articleshow/113537415.cms,"GANDERBAL (KASHMIR): His flowing beard evokes a picture of piety and his humble tone of a decent young man. His cakes and pastries suggest a passion to bake. But his lament runs a dagger deep through the heart.Aamir Nazir (29) is an engineer from Kashmir University, a 2020 graduate, who is making a living by selling tea and snacks on a highway passing through the 'Ganderbal garage' area.He banks on good local traffic and booming tourism to Sonmarg. ""I am still doing something. I was an average student. But even the toppers of my batch are without jobs,"" he said. And to underline, Aamir is vocal about Article 370 Special status for J&K, under whose shadow is unfolding the 2024 assembly election, evokes strong emotions. But for youngsters like Aamir, the junked provision is as utilitarian as a livelihood question. ""Article 370 reserved jobs and land for us. It's important for my generation,"" he reasoned.Throughout the region, the anger over nullification of Article 370 has triggered the people to rush to voting booths in hordes. But it is also a sentiment that connects with the cry for jobs and incomes echoing from Anantnag to Srinagar to Ganderbal.Aamir claims he cannot compete with engineering graduates from Delhi and that posts advertised in J&K are attracting those settling in Jammu. He insists it's true.The fate of Article 370 has appeared sealed over the last five years. But along the highways and in cities and towns of Kashmir, there is no dearth of those who claim that ""protection of jobs and land exist in many states like Himachal Pradesh and Jharkhand"".There are sharp concerns about the cultural dimensions of existence sans the special status but people are also eagerly hoping that a new govt will help the youth stand on their feet.Amid discussions over the fate of National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah , Mohd Sultan, who heads a 'transport union' in Ganderbal, said, ""The job scene is bad. Educated are without work. And, prices are high. Life is very difficult.""Desperate for an elected govt for the last six years and facing routine difficulties, people in villages and towns alike are waiting for the installation of local MLAs whom they can approach with their problems. It will be interesting to see what MLAs, ministers and govt would face post October 8, given the mounting grievances over jobs, electricity, roads, jailed youth, schools etc.""We want our govt and MLAs. That is the reason why voting will be high,"" said Sultan, seconded by Abdul Qadar and Mohd Yaseen. It is a view expressed by Mohd Saleem in Bijbehara and Tahir in Srinagar. High voting in Kashmir has a reason, and it is the desperation for an open door of an elected representative where residents can go and plead with hope, and leave with optimism, true or misplaced. Aamir said he appeared for panchayat assistant exam that was clouded by paper leak allegations and for engineer's post by the Service Selection Board in 2023 which he did not pass.""I worked as a delivery boy for one and a half years and saved Rs 60,000 to start this shop,"" Aamir said, carrying a tray of fresh pastries.Call it the swelling pride of a trier, or wrenching regret of a failure.","Aamir Nazir (29) is an engineer from Kashmir University, a 2020 graduate, who is making a living by selling tea and snacks on a highway passing through the 'Ganderbal garage' area.

She frequently complained about her work situation, and her parents even took her to a cardiologist in July. The doctor confirmed that while she was healthy, she lacked adequate sleep and proper nutrition.Additionally, Joseph said that the letter written by his wife to EY India Chairman Rajiv Memani was intended to prevent similar incidents from happening to others in the future, even though their daughter had died. The family has decided not to pursue legal action against the company.The Union labour ministry ordered a probe to look into the circumstances surrounding Anna's death.Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday said an investigation is underway.

The letter urged EY India to reassess a work culture that ""seems to glorify overwork while neglecting the very human beings behind the role"".""She was full of life, dreams, and excitement for the future. EY was her first job, and she was thrilled to be part of such a prestigious company.

KOZHIKODE: A man from Wayanad who briefly trained for the clergy before migrating to Norway in search of greener pastures has emerged as an alleged link in the sensational pager explosions in Lebanon on Tuesday that targeted Hezbollah fighters and killed 12 people, including civilians, and injured dozens.Norta Global Ltd, based in Sofia, Bulgaria - allegedly owned by Rinson Jose (37) of Wayanad, now a Norwegian citizen - is being probed by international security agencies following reports linking it to the sale of hundreds of pagers.Central intelligence agencies and Kerala Police special branch collected details on Friday about Rinson from his native village, Ondayangadi, near Mananthavady, Wayanad. Wayanad district police chief Taposh Basumathary said police had done a normal background check. ""Now that the identity and details of the family have come out in the media, police have taken steps to ensure they are safe. We are patrolling the area,"" he said.Family sources said Rinson, son of Moothedath Jose and Gracy, who used to work as tailors, had gone abroad with his twin brother, who now works in the UK. His sister is a nurse in Ireland. He lives in Norway with his wife and had last come home in Nov 2023 and returned in Jan 2024.""Rinson last spoke to his family here three days ago.

The firm's website - which described it as a leading technology company with strong focus on consulting, technology and payment integration, recruitment & outsourcing - has been taken down now.However, Bulgaria's State Agency for National Security said that Norta Global and its owner had ""not carried out any transaction linked to the sale or purchase of the merchandise"" or that which ""falls under laws on terrorism financing"".Reuters had reported on Thursday that Norta's Bulgarian headquarters was registered at an apartment building near Sofia that was also home to nearly 200 other companies, but there was no sign of Norta.Reuters said Rinson declined to comment on the pagers when reached by phone and hung up when asked about the Bulgarian business.Amund Djuve, the CEO of DN Media, where Jose currently works, told Reuters he was aware of the reports and had alerted police and security services. He said that Jose was travelling to the US.Oslo Police said it had initiated ""preliminary enquiries into the information that had come to light"".

Finding beauty in impermanence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/finding-beauty-in-impermanence/articleshow/113520188.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Recently, I was tasked with interviewing a young musical prodigy – 19-year-old Lydian Nadaswaram – alongside my colleague, Pattimandram Raja. Upon reaching the venue, I was struck by the small room packed with violins, a Thavil, guitars and a grand piano occupying much of the floor. It felt more like an artist's sanctuary than a studio.

Some years ago, Lydian had won the ‘World’s Best Talent’ award, among other accolades. As I prepared myself for the chat, I wondered whether I should approach him like a child genius. But as soon as the recording began, however, Lydian’s presence took control, and time flew.

Born a musical genius , Lydian's parents allowed him to bypass conventional schooling in favour of his passion. His current project, an ambitious one, involves composing tunes for all 1,330 couplets of the Tirukkural. With help from his sister, Amirthavarshini, also a musician, he has already tuned over a 1000 couplets, inviting singers from across the globe. Listening to them was a soul-stirring musical experience where we all felt Valluvar honoured.

What struck me even more than Lydian’s talent was his unwavering dedication to this project, despite the allure of more glamorous opportunities. When asked about his favourite couplet, he cited couplet 331 from the chapter on impermanence:

Nilladha Vatrai Nilayina Endrunarum

Pullari Vaannmai Kadai

""Dishonourable amongst intellects is the one who trusts as secure,

In things that shall pass away, as though they eternally endure.""

While Kural is full of verses on love, fame, friendship, and fortune, his choice was striking. I asked him the reason, and he explained that amidst everything that is transient, he wanted to leave behind a legacy.

It led me to reflect on the idea of impermanence, a concept present in all religious philosophies. Buddhism, for instance, speaks of the transient and evanescent nature of all things—whether physical or emotional. Acceptance of this truth can transform one's view of life.

Often, I hear freshers seeking ‘permanent positions’. When organisations aren’t permanent, how can any position be? Yet, human nature craves permanence, for it offers a sense of security. Oscar Wilde once said, ""Nothing in the world is permanent. We are foolish to ask anything to last, but surely, we are more foolish not to delight in its brief existence.”

At Japan’s Ise Shrine, a marvel of architecture, visitors are told the shrine has existed since 685 BCE, yet it is also only 20 years old. This is because the shrine is rebuilt every two decades, using the same materials and style, as a living symbol of ephemerality.

Narada once questioned Krishna about the nature of illusion and impermanence. Krishna requested some water first. As Narada went to fetch it, he was distracted by a beautiful woman, fell in love, married, and had children. Years passed and a sudden flood swept away his family and village. Distraught, Narada collapsed, only to have Krishna reappear and ask, “Where is my water?” The entire episode had been an illusion—a demonstration of life’s fleeting nature.

Impermanence, however, need not lead to despair. It can transform our lives into vibrant experiences of mindfulness, urging us to savour each moment in its fullest intensity. When nothing lasts, the present becomes infinitely precious.

As we concluded the interview, Lydian’s music still lingered in the air. I reflected that while everything may fade, some things may endure—like music, like the Thirukkural.

Want to become IPS officer to fight naxals: 14-yr-old LWE-violence survivor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/want-to-become-ips-officer-to-fight-naxals-14-yr-old-lwe-violence-survivor/articleshow/113535379.cms,"NEW DELHI: An IED blast in 2013 in Chhattisgarh’s Maoist-hit Kongera village left Mala, (name changed) who is 14-years-old now, blind in one eye and with low vision in the other. But this hasn’t stopped her from aspiring to become an IPS officer to “fight the naxals”.She was one of the 55 naxal violence survivors — most of them physically challenged — who have travelled from villages in the state’s left wing extremism-affected Bastar division to the national Capital to demand measures to ensure peace in the region so that future generations are able to live without fear.The blast that left Mala with shrapnel injuries in her face took place when she was going to an anganwadi in her village in Narayanpur district along with her brother, who too was hurt in the explosion.“I want to grow up to be an IPS officer and fight the naxalities to bring peace to our villages,” said Mala, a class 9 student, who with the other survivors held a demonstration under the banner of ‘Bastar Shanti Samiti’ at Jantar Mantar on Thursday and met home minister Amit Shah.On Friday, at the Constitution Club, they shared stories behind their injuries from IED blasts and firing by naxals , some taking place while they were going to haats (village markets) or moving through forests.The survivors, who will meet President Droupadi Murmu on Saturday, said increasing presence of police camps in certain areas has reduced the sense of fear but still there are some interior areas, which lack connectivity, where the fear of extremists lingers.According to data shared by the samiti’s co-coordinator Jayarama Das, in over four decades nearly 8,000 people living in villages in Bastar have been killed and 90% of them are tribals. Also, over a thousand people survive with disabilities caused by injuries suffered in blasts.Among the survivors is Dudhi Mahadev (28) who lost his leg in an IED blast when naxals attacked a bus near his village. Though Mahadev uses an artificial limb, the inability to do many tasks frustrates him.Sixty-five-year-old Nagraj (name changed) recalled how his son was brutalised and killed before his own eyes in 2018. He was also injured in the attack. Recounting the attack and how helpless his son felt in that moment he said, “woh Bachao, Bachao, Bachao chilata raha...(he kept shouting for help..).” “I pray that no one has to go through what my son and I experienced. I am here in Delhi as I don’t want something like this to happen to anyone else. I want the authorities to address our concerns,” Nagaraj from Kanker sharedFrail Kosi Madvi, who can only speak Gondi, lost her vision in an IED blast. In October 2020 she and her farmer husband were going to another village by foot to meet their daughter. Naxalites had planted an explosive on the way and she put her foot on it and it blew into her face leaving her blind. “I am dependent on others now and that makes life very difficult,” Kosi said, adding that she is in Delhi to “demand justice and peace”.Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai in a statement on Friday asserted that his govt is committed to make the state naxal-free. He also shared that the state govt is working on a new surrender policy for those who want to shun violence. ""We will announce it in 1-2 months,"" Sai said.Emphasising that drug addiction has become a serious problem in the state, Sai said that he has also instructed the police to dismantle the ecosystem supporting this illegal trade of illicit drugs. He highlighted that it has been seen that money earned from this illegal trade of drugs is used for funding naxalism and terrorism.On survivors coming to Delhi and meeting the union Home Minister, Sai said, ""It is a very positive thing that the voice of Naxal victims is now being heard across the country. Solving their problems is our priority. The people of Bastar are fed up with naxals and are ready to go on the path of development.""On the way forward, Sai said that along with freeing the people from terror by expanding new police camps in the interior areas, the work of ensuring basic facilities in these areas is also being done. ""For this, we have started the “Niyad Nellnar” (Your good village) scheme,"" he added. According to the Chhattisgarh govt, 'Niyyad Nella Nar' scheme aims to bring development and stability in Maoist-affected areas. Under this, 5 villages around the newly established police camps are being linked to 53 welfare schemes of 17 departments of the state. So far, 23 camps have been established under the scheme.","55 naxal violence survivors have travelled from villages in Chhattisgarh’s Maoist-hit Kongera village to the national Capital. They are demanding measures to ensure peace in the region.

KOLKATA/BURDWAN/RANCHI: Bengal's battle with floods triggered a face-off with Jharkhand Thursday after CM Mamata Banerjee ordered the sealing of the inter-state border, accusing Damodar Valley Corporation ( DVC ) of swamping 11 south Bengal districts with 5 lakh cusecs of water in three days despite her appeals to the PSU and counterpart and INDIA bloc ally Hemant Soren.Mamata declared her government was ""severing all ties"" with DVC, which operates in both states, for ""flooding Bengal to save Jharkhand"".""It's a hasty and unreasonable move by Bengal,"" JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said. ""We will block all goods trucks carrying foodgrain and other commodities to Bengal. Water levels in Jharkhand's reservoirs were nearing the danger mark due to heavy rain.

This cannot be allowed,"" the CM said, pointing out that 26 people had died in the floods and 2.5 lakh people displaced.Mamata alleged that DVC hadn't been providing details of how much water was being released from dams in the neighbouring state. Senior officials in several of Bengal's westernmost districts said police checkpoints had been set up along the border with Jharkhand and all inbound vehicles were being stopped, barring any emergency.Mamata, who visited East Midnapore 's Panskura and Howrah's Udaynarayanpur Thursday to survey the flood damage, later held an emergency meeting at the state secretariat with chief secretary Manoj Pant, DGP Rajeev Kumar and other senior officers. ""Even Durga Puja pandals are under water,"" the CM said.""Why should Bengal always suffer? Why will DVC always try to keep Jharkhand safe? I need to protect Bengal,"" she said. ""This flooding is not because of rain. It is because of the absence of any desilting or dredging despite my appeals to PM Narendra Modi.""DVC executive director Anjani Dubey said the PSU had ""reduced the release of water, corresponding to reduction in rainfall"". Denying Banerjee's accusations, the Centre said all norms were followed while releasing water from DVC. The Jal Shakti ministry and power ministry said all parties concerned were kept informed about the weather conditions likely to prevail from Sept 14-16 and the release of water.","Bengal's battle with floods triggered a face-off with Jharkhand Thursday.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra govt is set to adopt National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) textbooks for mathematics and science in state board schools from the next academic year, reports Sandhya Nair.The decision was taken in a meeting with officials, principals and teacher representatives, where school education minister Deepak Kesarkar emphasised the growing demand for CBSE schools due to their focus on preparing students for competitive exams .CBSE schools use NCERT texts.The texts will be introduced in a phased manner, starting with classes 1, 3, 5, 8, and 11 in 2025-26. For History and Geography, the curriculum will remain the same, with a few additions from the NCERT-prescribed course.Maharashtra govt’s decision to introduce NCERT readers for maths and science will make all non-English medium schools adopt a semiEnglish mode of education as textbooks for the two subjects will be available only in English. However, Marathi will continue to be a mandatory language for all schools and standards up to class 12.The transition from the current Balbharati course work to NCERT textbooks is planned to coincide with the introduction of theNational Education Policy in school education next year. The State Curriculum Framework for School Education (SCF-SE) is also in its final stages, despite occasional criticism such as the inclusion of a controversial verse from the ancient text Manusmriti in a draft released in May.Reacting to the decision, Fr. Flovi Dsouza, principal of Don Bosco School Borivali, noted the high demand for CBSE schools and the benefits of NCERT textbooks in prepa ring for competitive exams. State board teachers pointed out that the govt had previously lowered the difficulty level of its textbooks to help students score well in board exams. Veena Donwalkar, principal of Shivaji Vidyalaya, emphasized the need for teacher training if NCERT textbooks are introduced. However, anot her CBSE school principal questioned the relevance of using NCERT texts now that competitive exams are conducted by the National Testing Agency instead of CBSE. A principal from an Andheri school recalled discussions undertaken in 2009 for introducing NCERT textbooks to state schools, and said the books were then found to be too challenging for ""academically weak"" children.CBSE has encouraged the use of NCERT textbooks for class 1 to 8. In Aug, CBSE made it compulsory for its schools to use NCERT texts for class 9 to 12 from this year.

These can be summarised as theatres associated with ISIL or AQ-linked extremist groups active in and around Jammu and Kashmir, whether directly or via proxies or affiliates, as well as other separatist movements in the region; other ISIL and AQ cells, their affiliates, or radicalised individuals in India; regional insurgencies in the Northeast and North of India; and left-wing extremist groups seeking to overthrow the government. The most significant terrorism threats appear to relate to ISIL or AQ-linked groups active in and around Jammu and Kashmir,"" FATF said.Praising India's performance in fighting against the anti-money laundering, the FATF report said that New Delhi has implemented an anti-money laundering (AML)/counter-terrorist financing (CFT) system that is effective in many respects and particularly good results are being achieved in the areas of money laundering/TF risk understanding; national coordination and cooperation; use of financial intelligence for money laundering, predicate offences and TF investigations; depriving criminals of their assets; preventing misuse of legal structures; the implementation of targeted financial sanctions related to proliferation; and international cooperation.FATF also said that there are scope of major improvements to strengthen the prosecution of ML and TF, protecting the non-profit sector from terrorist abuse, supervision and implementation of preventive measuresIndia achieved major success in the last two to three years before the FATF on-site visit, according to the report.""Many positive developments have taken place in the last two to three years before the on-site visit, and while some initiatives are beginning to show results (e.g., increases in ML investigations, improvements to the timelines for incoming MLA requests, the implementation of a new mechanism of TFS for PF), others have been too recent and require an appropriate period of time to be operational and lead to changes in the effectiveness of the system (e.g., DNFBP and VASP supervision)."""" India has achieved strong results in its technical compliance with the FATF Standards. The remaining areas requiring significant improvement are risk-based measured to protect NPOs, establishing due diligence requirements on domestic PEPs and supervision of DNFBPs,"" it added.The FATF also said that Indian authorities have demonstrated a good understanding of both current and emerging TF threats and risks in different theatres of risk in the country, and investigations are broadly conducted in line with the risks identified. Case studies provided reflect India’s ability, in particular the National Investigative Agency (NIA) and ED, to conduct complex financial investigation and identify money trails to support the investigation and prosecution of terrorist activity and TF.","India faces a disparate range of terrorism threats, categorised into six different theatres.

Modi is expected to brief Biden in detail about his recent meetings with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukraine counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.""Talks are ongoing between the leaders. As for putting forward any proposal, we'll have to see how much consensus is reached and whether we can reach a stage where a proposal can be put before a larger audience. So, I think we need to wait a little,"" said foreign secretary Vikram Misri, when asked if India will come up with a specific peace proposal either at the UN, where the PM will address the summit of the future, or in the engagements in Delaware. While seeking peace proactively, India has not budged from its original position that it won’t mediate directly or propose any peace formula of its own.On the IPEF, Misri said India will be formally joining the additional pillars, while negotiations for India’s participation in the trade pillar continue. IPEF, which comprises 14 Indo-Pacific countries as members, aims to strengthen economic cooperation for advancing growth and prosperity in the region. It’s structured around 4 pillars – trade, supply chains, clean economy and fair economy in that order. India is yet to join the trade pillar. ""We are joining pillars 3 and 4 and the overarching agreement, an administrative arrangement on how things will move forward. So, at the end of this exercise, we would have done 2, 3, 4 and the overarching agreement. Work and discussion on the trade pillar continue at this point in time,"" said Misri.On the sidelines of the Quad summit , Modi will also have bilateral meetings with his Australia and Japan counterparts, Anthony Albanese and Fumio Kishida. Asked if he would meet former president Donald Trump or Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus at the UNGA in New York, Misri said meetings are still being scheduled, keeping in mind time available.Modi will arrive on September 22 in New York, where he will participate in a technology roundtable with CEOs and also address an Indian diaspora event. On Monday, he will address the UN summit of the future, taking upGlobal South concerns about ongoing conflicts and calling for inclusive and equitable sustainable development.""There is an obvious deficit of development in the world at large and the Global South is at the risk of being left behind on account of current developments. The world is also playing catch-up in so far as fulfilment of the very important Sustainable Development Goals is concerned. So, I would imagine that the Prime Minister's message and India's message will take many of these issues into consideration and highlight India's approaches on all of these issues,"" said the foreign secretary.A ""signature initiative"" that will be unveiled by Quad in Delaware is the Cancer Moonshot, through which the grouping aims to implement innovative strategies to prevent, detect, treat, and alleviate the impact of cancer on patients and their families. ""And to begin with, we intend to collaborate in reducing the burden of cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific region,"" said Misri. Apart from discussing the threat from China in the Indo-Pacific, the Quad meeting will focus on issues related to health security, climate change, critical and emerging technologies, HADR infrastructure, connectivity, maritime security and counter-terrorism.",PM Narendra Modi's bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden on Saturday will see substantive talks on carrying forward the Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.

Yet, Anna had called her friends in Pune, breaking down over the phone.Another friend, Ann Treasa Joseph, recalled how Anna would call her mother in tears almost every day.""Anita Aunty often said how overwhelmed Anna was with work at EY.

and Linda Bollea

NEW DELHI: The issue of divorce among elite athletes has become a subject of great interest, shedding light on the difficulties of juggling high-level sports careers and personal lives. These athletes invest immense time and energy into their training, competitions, and public image, which can put immense strain on their marital relationships.From widely publicised breakups to the consequences for family life, the stories of divorce in the sports industry reveal the human aspects of these remarkable individuals and the obstacles that come with fame and achievement in their personal relationships.In 2006, following a 17-year marriage of Michael Jordan and Juanita Vanoy, the couple's relationship reached an irreparable point, resulting in a divorce settlement of $168 million in Vanoy's favour. This settlement was the most expensive for any celebrity or athlete in history at that time.Despite the significant financial impact, Jordan has managed to maintain his financial stability. However, the experience likely influenced his decision to establish a prenuptial agreement with his current wife, Yvette Prietto.The agreement stipulates that Prietto will receive a pay out of one million dollars for each year of marriage over the next ten years. After the initial decade, the pay out will increase to $5 million for every subsequent year of marriage.Australian golfer, Greg Norman, known as ""The Shark,"" faced a $104 million divorce settlement with his wife of 25 years, Laura Andrassy. Their tumultuous split involved relationships with other athletes; Norman left Andrassy for former tennis star Chris Evert , who was married to Norman's friend, skier Andy Mill. Norman and Evert married and then divorced 15 months later, marking three divorces among three athletes.Tiger Woods experienced a dramatic fall from grace due to his marital infidelities. The fallout not only ended his marriage to Elin Nordegren, with a $100 million settlement, but also cost him several sponsorships and his status as a golfing legend. Woods' game has never fully recovered.Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson's marriage to actress Robin Givens ended before he reached the peak of his career. At the time of their divorce, Tyson's net worth was between $300 million and $685 million.Givens received a $10 million settlement after just seven months of marriage. During the divorce proceedings, Tyson's net worth was approximately $50 million.Michael Strahan, now a familiar face on television, had a tough financial hit in 2006. His divorce from Jean Muggli led to a $15 million settlement and ongoing child support payments of $18,000 per month.Yankees legend Alex Rodriguez, or A-Rod, parted ways with his wife Cynthia in 2008 after five years of marriage. Cynthia cited infidelities and emotional abandonment, including a rumoured relationship with Madonna.Although the settlement details remain private, Cynthia's petition included their $12 million Coral Gables estate and ""equitable distribution"" of assets, likely amounting to millions more.Hulk Hogan's divorce from Linda Bollea cost him over $10 million. Linda received 70% of their liquid assets, 40% ownership of Hogan's companies, and $3 million in property.","The issue of divorce among elite athletes has become a subject of great interest.

"Not taking EY to court, says dead CA's father",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/not-taking-ey-to-court-says-dead-cas-father/articleshow/113537713.cms,"Her family said that Anna did not maintain a proper diet due to demanding work schedule.

BENGALURU: After labour ministry initiated probe into the tragic death of Ernst & Young (EY) India employee Anna Sebastian Perayil , her father, Sibi Joseph clarified that the family is not pursuing legal action against EY .""She cleared her CA in Feb this year and in March joined the firm. We used to speak to her every day and her major grouse was extreme work pressure .She was engaged in an audit of Bajaj Auto . Most of the days she used to work till 12.30 in the night and get back to her paying accommodation by 1.30am,"" Joseph told news agency IANS.The family alleged that Anna was under work stress and had not maintained a proper diet due to her demanding work schedule.Her death triggered an uproar after a lengthy letter by Anna's mother, Anita Augustine, to EY chairman Rajiv Memani went viral on social media on Wednesday. Augustine voiced her concerns regarding the excessive workload placed on her daughter, a newcomer to the company, which indicated that Anna ultimately succumbed to work-related stress. Anna had joined the company in March, after completing CA, and passed away on July 20.Late Thursday, Memani took to LinkedIn to express his regret for being unable to attend Anna's funeral, describing it as uncharacteristic of the firm's culture. ""I truly regret the fact that we missed being present at Anna's funeral. This is completely alien to our culture. It has never happened before; it will never happen again."" Memani, however, said that Anna's death was not a result of work pressure and that all EY employees are assigned equal workloads.Former HCL CEO Vineet Nayar took to LinkedIn to say that across industries, young employees are overworked under the guise of ""training"" or ""preparation for the real world."" Although hard work is essential, extreme hours should not become standard.World Health Organisation links long working hours to a 35% increased risk of stroke and a 17% higher risk of heart disease. Nayar said this prevalent pattern sees young professionals working tirelessly for weeks or months without a break, fostering a toxic culture where exhaustion is celebrated and well being is ignored.",Anna Sebastian Perayil died on July 20.

"Tamil Nadu: 72 spas, massage centres offering sex services shut down in Coimbatore",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/tamil-nadu-72-spas-massage-centres-offering-sex-services-shut-down-in-coimbatore/articleshow/113535882.cms,"Representative Image

COIMBATORE: Flesh trade is flourishing in the city under the cover of spas and massage centres , many of which are functioning illegally. These spas mostly offer nude body massages with a ' happy ending ' by women, who are brought in from different parts of India. The 'services' are priced at anywhere between ₹2,000 and ₹3,000 per hour. The charges, however, vary based on the 'services' chosen by customers.The city police have been cracking down on such illegal spas and massage centres and closed 72 of them so far this year. Police said the drive against the spas and massage centres offering sex services would be intensified in the coming days.Two weeks ago, the city police had busted a notorious sex racket being operated by Sikkandar Basha, 38, of Cumbum in Theni district, and his aide S Stephen, 32, of Podanur in the city, from Kolkata. They were running several spas and massage centres across the city for flesh trading.Investigation revealed Basha had international connections and been bringing women from Russia and other countries to India for flesh trading.""Basha was earning at least ₹50 lakh a month through flesh trade and funding various notorious rowdy gangs in Tamil Nadu to attack the people threatening illegal spas and massage centres for monthly 'mamool',"" said R Stalin , city deputy police commissioner (North).He said 59 spas were functioning in his jurisdiction. ""We collected details of all the spas, which were mostly functioning at Gandhipuram, Peelamedu, Hope College, Singanallur and surrounding areas, and came to know some of them were offering fullbody massage without appointing a certified masseur. Many spas were functioning illegally without renewing their licences from the city corporation and obtaining no-objection certificates from the city police."" The officer said some spas were offering 'happy ending' services and body-to-body massages. ""These spas were mostly employing women from the northeastern parts of the country. We have closed 57 spas that were functioning illegally in our jurisdiction from Jan 1 to Sept 19 this year.""Stalin said these spas and massage centres were luring customers by advertising their services with contact numbers on various websites. ""When people contact them over phone, they would share photos of women available to provide services for their selection. When we started cracking down on illegal spas and massage centres, some sex racketeers have shifted their trade to a few lodges in the city. We are closely monitoring such lodges."" K Saravanakumar, city deputy police commissioner (South), said 15 illegal spas were closed in his jurisdiction during the period under discussion.","Flesh trade is flourishing in the city under the cover of spas and massage centres.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
