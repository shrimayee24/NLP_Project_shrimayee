NEW DELHI: Justice Surya Kant on Monday took oath as the 53rd Chief Justice of India , marking the start of a nearly 15-month tenure at the helm of the judiciary. President Droupadi Murmu administered the oath to Justice Kant.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, and commerce minister Piyush Goyal were present at the ceremony.He succeeds Justice BR Gavai, who demitted office on Sunday evening. Appointed on October 30, Justice Kant will serve until February 9, 2027, when he turns 65.Justice Kant was part of the Supreme Court bench that upheld the abrogation of Article 370, kept the colonial-era sedition law in abeyance by directing that no new FIRs be filed, and oversaw the presidential reference on the powers of Governors and the President regarding state bills.He asked the Election Commission to disclose the names of 65 lakh voters excluded from Bihar’s draft rolls, and reinstated a woman sarpanch who was unlawfully removed, pointing to gender bias. He directed that one-third of seats in bar associations, including the Supreme Court Bar Association, be reserved for women.Justice Kant was also on the bench that appointed a committee led by Justice Indu Malhotra to probe the security breach during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 2022 Punjab visit, observing that such questions required “a judicially trained mind”.He upheld the One Rank-One Pension scheme and continues to hear cases filed by women officers seeking parity in permanent commission. He was part of the seven-judge bench that overruled the 1967 AMU judgment and served on the bench handling the Pegasus spyware case, stating that the state cannot get a “free pass under the guise of national security”.Born on February 10, 1962 in Hisar, Haryana, Justice Kant rose from a small-town practice to the country’s top judicial office. He stood “first class first” in his Master’s degree in law from Kurukshetra University and later served as Chief Justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court. Known for his calm approach to public scrutiny, he had earlier said: “Frankly speaking, I call social media ‘unsocial media’ and I do not feel pressured by online comments. .. Fair criticism is always acceptable.”","Justice Surya Kant took oath as the 53rd Chief Justice of India. He succeeds Justice BR Gavai, who demitted office on Sunday evening.

"Garhwal villages ban costly gifts, fast food at weddings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/garhwal-villages-ban-costly-gifts-fast-food-at-weddings/articleshow/125528766.cms,"DEHRADUN: Nearly two dozen villages in Uttarakhand’s Chakrata region have collectively banned fast food, lavish gifts and high-cost customs at weddings to curb rising social pressure and restore traditional practices. The rules, agreed upon unanimously by village representatives in the Jaunsar Bawar area, aim to return wedding celebrations to their cultural roots and reduce financial strain on families. Anyone violating the norms will be fined Rs 1 lakh by the gram panchayat.Rajender Tomar, head of the Doha village cluster, told TOI that the increasing display of wealth during weddings had created unhealthy competition in the region. “These customs were becoming a competition and creating unnecessary pressure,” he said. Villages including Dau, Doha, Chutou, Bajau, Ghingo and Kaitri are among those enforcing the new policy.As part of the decision, food items such as chowmein, momos and other fastfood snacks have been barred from wedding menus. Families are encouraged to serve traditional Garhwali cuisine made from local ingredients such as mandua and jhingora millets.The exchange of expensive gifts and luxury items has also been prohibited. Karmu Pal, a resident of Kyawa village, supported the move. “We’re happy our local cuisine and culture are being promoted. The new generation won’t forget where they come from.”The sentiment echoed in neighbouring Naugaon in Uttarkashi, where residents of Koti Thakral and Koti Banal agreed to ban DJ music and alcohol at weddings. Traditional folk music and local instrumentswill be mandatory at celebrations.","Nearly two dozen villages in Uttarakhand’s Chakrata region have collectively banned fast food, lavish gifts and high-cost customs at weddings.

Police outpost comes up at seat of Reds’ Jantana Sarkar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/police-outpost-comes-up-at-seat-of-reds-jantana-sarkar/articleshow/125528705.cms,"The camp becomes the eighth police installation in Abujmarh since 2023

NAGPUR: Maharashtra forces on Sunday pushed deeper into Abujmarh than ever before, establishing a fortified police outpost in a lightning 24-hour operation at Phulnar — an isolated village in south Gadchiroli’s Bhamragarh division near the Chhattisgarh border — long regarded as the CPI (Maoist) command spine where insurgents once dictated life and law.Camp Gundurwahi stands exactly where the Maoists ran their Jantana Sarkar — the parallel govt that controlled the “Red Corridor” of Leftwing extremism for more than five decades. The camp becomes the eighth police installation in Abujmarh since 2023, marking the deepest penetration into India’s most entrenched Maoist belt.The breakthrough aligns with Union home minister Amit Shah’s target of ending Maoist insurgency by March 31, 2026, through a mix of intelligence-driven security operations and rapid development in tribal belts. Shah has ruled out talks with armed groups, urging cadres to surrender and join mainstream life under the Centre’s rehabilitation policy.For years, Phulnar–Gundurwahi functioned as an impenetrable headquarters. PLGA fighters marched in olive green. Landmines and ambushes made even approaches kilometres away perilous. Reaching Phulnar was impossible for seven months due to flooding of the Parlakota river in monsoon.The remaining months were barred by PLGA guns. “Now, the Tricolour will fly here,” a senior officer said.The outpost was completed in a round-the-clock operation involving 1,050 personnel, including 1,000 C-60 commandos, 21 bomb-disposal squads, new constables, 500 special police officers, CRPF companies and private contractors. A convoy of four JCB bulldozers, seven trailers, two Poclain earthmoving machines and 25 trucks carved out a fully functional base with 12 porta cabins, Wi-Fi, RO plants, generator backup, toilets, watchtowers and bunkers.Phulnar, barely 4km from Chhattisgarh and 20km from Bhamragarh, once housed the feared Company No. 10 of PLGA — responsible for the 2016 kidnapping and killing of a C-60 commando. Months ago, security forces gunned down four of its cadres.Villagers repeatedly resisted police entry and openly backed Maoists until recently. Sunday signalled a sharp turn. More than 300 tribal residents from 10 surrounding villages attended the inauguration and Jan Jagran Melawa — a “people’s awakening” function. ADG (special operations) Chhering Dorje and Gadchiroli SP Neelotpal presided over the event.Neelotpal said work would resume on roads, bridges, mobile towers at Koparshi and Phulnar, and a sub-primary health centre, followed by state transport buses. “Improved security will finally allow seamless connectivity between Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, boosting commerce and development,” he said.Police launched a large civic outreach — distributing saris, blankets, utensils, mosquito nets, school kits, sports gear and food items while explaining govt schemes and peace benefits.","Camp Gundurwahi stands exactly where the Maoists ran their Jantana Sarkar.

'No Longer Optional': PM Modi Calls For UNSC Reforms At IBSA Meet; Urges United Stand Against Terror

PM Narendra Modi participated in the IBSA Leaders' Meeting on G20 margins, stressing that UNSC reform is imperative, and said that there should be no room for double standards while fighting terrorism.PM Modi joined the trilateral mechanism meet hosted by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and attended also by Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.While all three countries have had their share of problems with the US under Trump, diplomatic sources played down suggestions that the meeting was a response to the Americans as they cited the fact that a substantive IBSA summit meeting took place on the margins of 2024 G20 summit too in Rio.The US boycotted the G20 summit in South Africa because of alleged mistreatment of white Afrikaners.PM Modi said global institutions do not reflect the realities of 21st century. ""None of us is a permanent member of UN Security Council. This clearly demonstrates that global institutions no longer represent today's world. Therefore, IBSA must send a unified message to the world: institutional reform is not an option but imperative,"" he said.""Similarly, we must work in close coordination in the fight against terrorism. On an issue of such gravity, there can be no room for double standards. For the sake of global peace and prosperity, united and decisive action is essential,"" he added, calling for institutionalising the NSA-level meeting of the countries to strengthen security cooperation.Describing the meeting as timely, PM Modi noted it coincided with the first G20 summit on African soil and marked the culmination of four consecutive G20 presidencies by Global South countries, of which the last three were by IBSA members. This, he said, had resulted in several important initiatives focused on human-centric development, multilateral reform and sustainable growth. Modi emphasised IBSA is not just a group of three countries but an important platform connecting three continents, three major democratic nations and three major economies.""Highlighting technology's crucial role in ensuring human-centric development, the PM proposed establishing an 'IBSA Digital Innovation Alliance' to facilitate sharing of Digital Public Infrastructure like UPI, health platforms like CoWIN, cybersecurity frameworks and women-led tech initiatives among the countries,"" said an Indian readout, adding the PM also emphasised IBSA's potential to contribute to development of safe, trustworthy and human-centric AI norms. He invited IBSA leaders to the AI summit next year.""Appreciating IBSA Fund's work in supporting projects across 40 countries in sectors like education, health, women empowerment and solar energy, the PM proposed IBSA Fund for Climate Resilient Agriculture to further advance South-South Cooperation,"" said the Indian government.","PM Narendra Modi participated in the IBSA Leaders' Meeting on G20 margins.

E-tailers fined for selling walkie talkies

NEW DELHI: The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has imposed a Rs 30,000 fine on a restaurant in Patna for collecting service charge from a customer in violation of guidelines. The authority's order - monetary penalty, direction to refund service charge collected and instructions to immediately stop the practice - may serve as a reference point for similar consumer complaints in the future.This comes after the March 28 Delhi HC order which held that all restaurants must adhere to guidelines issued by CCPA on service charge. The court also made it clear that any violation of guidelines would invite appropriate action against erring establishments.CCPA in its guidelines issued on July 4, 2022, had specified that no hotel or restaurant will add service charge automatically or by default to the bill and that this should not be collected by adding it along with the food bill and GST on the total amount. Service charge is voluntary and this must be informed to customers.The instant case was taken up CCPA after Ravi Nandan Kumar filed a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline in April over Cafe Blue Bottle levying a service charge of Rs 801 in addition to GST.CCPA carried out an examination of the veracity of the claim since such a practice would have impacted a 'class' of customers.In response, the restaurant claimed that service charge was optional and that if a customer declines to pay, it is removed from the bill. It also submitted that a refund of Rs 591 would be made to the customer.An investigation found the restaurant had offered a credit note of Rs 591 (minus discount of Rs 210), without the customer's consent, which was ""not a valid substitute for monetary reimbursement"". The authority concluded that the restaurant used a software based bill generation system whereby service charge would have been automatically generated for all customers. It noted the restaurant didn't submit the number of bills with included service charge but removed or refunded subsequently to clear shadows of doubts.In two other orders, CCPA imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh each on Jiomart and Chimiya for selling walkie talkies without necessary disclosures. They have also been directed to remove advertisements and ensure that in future no product requiring statutory approval or certification is listed or sold on platforms without compliance of law.","The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has imposed a Rs 30,000 fine on a restaurant in Patna for collecting service charge from a customer.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi sought a global compact to ensure AI is used for good and to prevent its misuse, saying this should be based on basic principles including effective human oversight, safety-by-design, transparency, and strict restrictions on the use of AI in deepfakes, crime and terror activities.To build a fair and just future for all, PM Modi said, India stood for development that is sustainable, trade that is trusted, finance that is fair, and progress in which everyone prospers. Citing the Covid-era global supply chain vulnerabilities, the PM underscored that nations cannot be viewed merely as markets, and must adopt a sensitive and long-term approach.""AI systems that impact human life, security, or public trust must be responsible and auditable. And, most importantly, while AI may enhance human capabilities, the ultimate responsibility for decision-making must always remain with human beings,"" said the PM, addressing another G20 session on Sunday.The PM announced India had invited all G20 countries for the AI summit it would host in Feb next year with the theme 'Sarvajana Hitaya, Sarvajana Sukhaya - welfare for all, happiness for all'.PM Modi said India's approach to AI is anchored on three pillars - equitable access, population-scale skilling, and responsible deployment.""Under the India-AI Mission, we are developing accessible high-performance computing so the benefits of AI reach every district and every language. This will provide scale and speed to our efforts toward human development,"" he said, addressing the session on critical minerals and AI.The PM stressed that as technology continues to advance, both opportunities and resources are becoming increasingly concentrated in a few hands. ""Around the world, competition over critical technologies is intensifying. This is a matter of concern for humanity, and it also poses an obstacle to innovation. To address this, we must bring about a fundamental change in our approach,"" he said.""We must promote technology applications that are 'human-centric' rather than 'finance-centric', that are 'global' rather than merely 'national', and that follow 'open-source' models rather than 'exclusive' ones.

NEW DELHI: Amid attempts to link the deaths or alleged suicides by booth-level officers (BLOs), particularly in West Bengal, to ""pressure"" of work related to the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, election-related officials pointed out that Phase-2 of the exercise was progressing at a much more relaxed pace than Phase-1, which was exclusive to Bihar.An officer said while the distribution of enumeration forms was completed in four days in Bihar, it stretched for 10 days in Phase-2 across 12 states and UTs. While states like West Bengal have seen a steady procession of alleged SIR-related suicides and complaints of work pressure, reports of some deaths have also been received from Gujarat, Rajasthan and MP.On the other hand, work is on seamlessly in other states/UTs. For instance, a differently-abled BLO in Rajasthan, Babulal, has already completed 100% digitisation of enumeration forms, as has woman BLO Jyoti Pawar in Madhya Pradesh's Nepanagar assembly constituency. Even reports from Left-led Kerala suggest good participation.Officers pointed out that the digitisation of enumeration forms in SIR's Phase-2 was, on an average, progressing at a comfortable pace, with each BLO completing around 50-60 forms a day.""Around 40% forms were digitised in the 10 days from Nov 14-23, and at this steady rate, the task looks achievable by the Dec 4 deadline. Besides, even if eligible electors do not show up in the draft list, they have time until Feb 7 to get added to the final roll,"" said the officer.The officer added that over 450 BLOs were suspended in Bihar for not doing their duty properly. ""But there were no suicides,"" he said.It may also do well to verify whether the BLOs are indeed being subjected to pressures that may be driving them to suicide or causing their deaths. ""It may possibly be related to other reasons, including political pressure, a health issue or family reasons. For instance, the suicide by a woman BLO in Nadia. Though the West Bengal chief electoral officer has sought a report from the district magistrate, the reason for death can only be established based on the postmortem report; in case a suicide or murder is confirmed, an FIR will follow,"" he said.""The suicide note will then be sent for forensic analysis to establish its authenticity. Calling it a suicide at this juncture is premature. Even if it does turn out to be death while discharging duty, the rules require the kin to be compensated,"" he said.","Election-related officials point out that Phase-2 of the exercise was progressing at a much more relaxed pace than Phase-1.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Defending the collegium, the outgoing Chief Justice of India BR Gavai, emphasised the need to exclude the creamy layer from the Scheduled Caste quota, and expressed regret over not appointing any women judges during his tenure.According to PTI, Gavai said he leaves the institution with a deep sense of satisfaction and contentment. Reiterating his decision not to accept any post-retirement assignments, he said, ""I made it clear when I took office that I would not take up any position after retirement. For the next 9-10 days, it’s a cooling-off period. After that, a new chapter begins,"" he said.BR Gavai is the 52nd Chief Justice, the first Buddhist and second Dalit to head the Supreme Court after KG Balakrishnan.Addressing the issue of the ""creamy layer"" within caste-based reservations, CJI Gavai said the Supreme Court has ""done its part,"" but it is now up to the government and Parliament to implement changes to ensure that benefits reach the truly marginalised sections.Last year, as part of a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court approved subclassification within scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, a move aimed at preventing the creation of a ""class within a class"" in reservation benefits.Justice Gavai, who was part of the bench for that judgment, emphasised that equality must permeate through all levels and cautioned against the continued misuse of reservations by families that have already progressed socioeconomically.""We have seen many Scheduled Caste families prosper, yet they still avail reservation benefits,"" he said, pointing out cases where children of SC/ST IAS officers seek quota-based advantages.In his judgment, he wrote, ""The State must formulate a policy to identify the creamy layer among SC/ST categories and exclude them from affirmative action. This is the only way to achieve true equality.""Chief Justice Gavai, who retires tomorrow, remains a significant figure as only the second Dalit to lead India’s highest judicial body.

NEW DELHI: India has welcomed the key outcomes of the 30th session of the UN climate conference (COP30), saying it recognised the need for adaptation in developing countries and would not shift the burden of climate change mitigation (emission reduction) onto the shoulders of those who have the least responsibility in causing the problem. The annual conference concluded in the Brazilian city of Belem late Saturday.""A substantive decision on adaptation is a manifestation of the principle of equity and a recognition of the overwhelming need for adaptation in developing countries,"" said Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav in his post on X on Sunday, while appreciating the Brazilian Presidency’s efforts in foregrounding the issue of climate finance.The decision to triple the adaptation finance means increasing it to around $120 billion annually by 2035 from the current $40 billion annually. Though it would be part of the overall climate finance of $300 billion annually by 2035, the move at least gave a much-needed push to the cause of adaptation in developing countries.Besides deciding to triple the funds needed by developing countries to adapt themselves to face the impacts of climate change, the COP30 also decided to develop a 'just transition mechanism' to support countries in protecting workers and communities as they shift to clean energy; and launch a 'global implementation accelerator' - a two-year process to close the gap between current national climate plans and what is required to keep the global warming within 1.5 degree Celsius.The outcomes are, in fact, aligned with what India had been telling the forum not to expect the developing countries to fill in for the failure of the rich historical emitters, and also not to allow developed nations to carry on with unilateral trade measures such as the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in the garb of climate action.India has long been opposed to the CBAM, which is to be implemented from next year. The mechanism will impose a border tax on carbon-intensive goods such as iron and steel, aluminium and cement entering the 27 European Union nations, placing a tariff burden on products from developing countries, including India and China.The COP30 agreement has, at least, acknowledged the concerns, noting that the response measures on climate change must not constitute ""disguised restrictions on international trade"".Thanking the COP30 Presidency for delivering the space to discuss unilateral trade-restrictive climate measures, India in a statement, said that these measures are increasingly affecting all developing countries and are violative of the principles of equity and CBDR-RC, enshrined in the Convention and its Paris Agreement.The statement, delivered by the country's representative at the closing plenary of the COP30 on Saturday, stressed that these issues cannot continue to be brushed under the carpet. ""The Parties (countries) have made a beginning here to reverse this trend,"" it said.Expressing satisfaction over the decision to establish the 'just transition mechanism', India called it a ""significant milestone"" and hoped that it would help operationalise equity and climate justice at both global and national levels.",India welcomed the key outcomes of the 30th session of the UN climate conference (COP30) The decision to triple the adaptation finance means increasing it to around $120 billion annually by 2035 from the current $40 billion annually. India had been telling the forum not to expect the developing countries to fill in for the failure of rich historical emitters.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125522176,imgsize-1512450,width-400,resizemode-4/125522176.jpg"
Explainer: What is the ‘996’ work culture that Narayana Murthy has pitched for India & why did China declare it illegal?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-the-996-work-culture-that-narayana-murthy-has-pitched-for-india-why-did-china-declare-it-illegal/articleshow/125519688.cms,"AI image

Narayana Murthy Sparks Fresh Storm By Urging to Adopt China’s 996 Model, Work 72 Hours Every Week

What exactly is the 996 work culture?



How 996 became China’s unofficial tech timetable



Why the model eventually collapsed



Does that mean 996 has disappeared?



Working hours around the world: What the data shows



What India can learn from China’s mistakes

Conclusion

When Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy recently urged young Indians to embrace a 72-hour workweek, his comments rekindled a fierce debate — not least because he pointed to China’s infamous “996” work culture as a benchmark.“9 am to 9 pm, six days a week – that’s 72 hours,” he said, arguing that for India to accelerate its growth, a similar ethic might be necessary.Speaking in an interview, he justified his remark on extended working hours and said, “Last year, Catamaran senior and middle level staff went to China and they went to tier 1 cities, tier 2 cities and tier 3 cities. They stayed in tier-3 kind of hotels because we wanted to understand the real China. And you know there is a saying there, 9, 9, 6. You know what it means? 9 am to 9 pm, 6 days a week.”Once celebrated for powering China’s tech miracle, the 996 model has since been denounced by employees, criticised by health experts and, in 2021, declared outright illegal by China’s top court.But while Murthy frames 996 as a badge of discipline, China’s experience serves as a revealing case study of how far a nation can stretch its workforce—and where the limits eventually snap.We take a look at how 996 came to be, and why it was banned:The term “996” refers to a working schedule whereby employees put in their hours from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week.That adds up to 72 hours a week, far more than standard working hours in most countries.This practice gained traction during China’s tech boom, especially in high-growth companies in e-commerce, internet, and startups.For some leaders, it became a symbol: hustle, ambition, and non-stop growth.The origins of 996 lie in the breakneck expansion of China’s tech sector during the 2010s. Tech giants such as Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com and countless high-growth startups were scaling at a pace unmatched anywhere in the world.Companies were racing to dominate new markets and speed was often framed as the single most powerful competitive advantage.In this environment, 996 organically became the accepted norm. Young professionals—many fresh graduates from China’s elite universities—internalised the idea that exceptional growth demanded exceptional commitment.London-based Oliver Pearce, who worked in China for 15 years and is a managing director of communications advisory Corporate Perspectives, was quoted by Reuters as saying, “Many Chinese employees are desperate to succeed or need to preserve their incomes to sustain more aspirational lifestyles, so there are enough people in the workforce who will persist with these working hours”.Founders like Jack Ma romanticised long hours as a badge of ambition by labelling working overtime as a ‘huge blessing’. They reinforced the narrative that extraordinary national progress required equally extraordinary personal sacrifice.In return, employees hoped for rapid promotions, sizeable bonuses and in the most coveted roles, stock options that could multiply in value if the company went public.While China’s labour laws already imposed clear limits on daily and weekly working hours, enforcement during those early boom years was uneven.The combination of an expanding tech market, weak oversight and a cultural acceptance of overwork allowed 996 to emerge, unchallenged, as the unofficial industry standard.By 2021, the Chinese government began pushing back strongly against the practice — not just in rhetoric, but legally.Despite its initial momentum, 996 was inherently unsustainable. Over time, the intense pressure began to surface in troubling ways.Reports of chronic burnout became common, with employees speaking openly about sleep deprivation, collapsing mental health, and the breakdown of work-life boundaries.In 2021, a 22-year-old female employee of the e-commerce company Pingduoduo reportedly collapsed to her death while returning home from work after midnight, according to Reuters.Several widely publicised cases of sudden deaths among overworked employees in the tech and logistics sectors triggered public outrage and brought national attention to the human cost of relentless schedules.In 2019, this discontent crystallised in a symbolic act of digital protest. A group of Chinese tech workers created a GitHub repository titled “996.ICU”—a darkly humorous reference to the idea that “working 996 could land you in the ICU.”The repository quickly went viral, compiling testimonies, naming companies that embraced the practice and attracting global attention to China’s culture of overwork. The movement marked one of the first organised, collective pushbacks against the country’s tech giants.As Beijing launched its “common prosperity” campaign—a push aimed at curbing corporate excesses—the government began scrutinising labour practices more strictly.This culminated in August 2021, when China’s Supreme People’s Court, along with the ministry of human resources and social security, issued a public statement explicitly declaring 996 to be a serious violation of labour law.For the first time, the state formally acknowledged the model’s illegality, describing it as harmful to workers' physical and mental well-being.Not entirely. Declaring something illegal doesn’t instantly erase deep-rooted work cultures — enforcement is uneven and many firms still find workarounds.Some companies rebranded their overtime policies under terms like ""big week/small week"" or “flexible hours” to skirt the 996 ban.In recent years, leading firms such as Midea and DJI have instituted more formal clock-off policies and reduced mandatory overtime, but reports suggest many employees still work more than they officially should.According to a 2025 Reuters report, average working weeks in China still exceed legal limits: official data indicated ~48.5 hours/week in early 2025, above the 44-hour cap.A director at a renewable power firm in China, who asked not to be identified, was quoted by Reuters as saying that he routinely puts in even longer hours than the “996” schedule. “I work more hours than ‘996’ every week. I feel very, very tired,” he says.Although his hours are technically flexible, he explains that he must work over 12 hours a day — without overtime pay — to hit his sales targets and earn a bonus. “My bonus accounts for 50% of my monthly salary,” he says, noting that the additional hours are put in voluntarily.Thus, while the most extreme version of 996 has lost official sanction, elements of the overwork culture linger, shaped by competition, economic uncertainty and company-specific pressures.In short: 996 may be “illegal,” but overwork hasn’t disappeared.India’s current debate over long workweeks benefits from a wider global perspective. International data reveals a clear pattern: countries with shorter average working hours consistently produce higher output per worker.Across much of Western Europe, for instance, employees work far fewer hours annually than their counterparts in Asia.Eurostat, which tracks “actual working hours” in the EU, shows that as of 2024, employees in the Netherlands work only 32.1 hours/week on average, while Germany and Denmark come in at about 33.9 hours/week. These are not low-productivity nations — far from it.The Netherlands, too, has one of the shortest workweeks while maintaining high living standards and strong economic performance.By contrast, countries such as the United States and Japan work more hours on paper, but not enormously more.According to the ILO, the US hits roughly 37.6 hours/week, which makes it approximately 1955 hours/year.While in Japan, the figure was around 1,611 hours/year as of 2023, according to an OECD estimate.These figures are still lower than some emerging economies that log more than 2,000 hours annually. For example, estimated data from Clockify (which aggregates global working-hour metrics) suggests that workers in China and India record much higher annual hours, ranging around 2400 hours/week. Indian workers—particularly those in informal sectors—often exceed that.These comparisons challenge the assumption that longer hours inherently translate into higher productivity.Actually, research shows the opposite in many cases. Productivity (measured as output per hour) exhibits diminishing returns beyond a certain point, especially when hours stretch past 45–50 per week.Economists such as John Pencavel have long documented the diminishing returns of extra work hours. Beyond about 50 hours/week, productivity per hour drops sharply, and after 55 hours, more time often does not mean more output.Recent work from Purdue University reinforces this, which reveals that while working long may boost performance in the short term, it impairs recovery and reduces next-day effectiveness.This global trend has encouraged countries to experiment with shorter workweeks.The UK, Japan, New Zealand and many more countries have conducted large-scale trials of the four-day week, and many reports indicate improvements in employee well-being and in some cases, even higher productivity due to better time management and reduced burnout.India’s fascination with longer workweeks must be balanced against the lessons from China’s decade-long experiment with 996.The first and most crucial insight is that longer hours do not guarantee higher productivity.India already ranks among the countries with the longest workweeks, yet its productivity levels lag behind. As per the ILO, the average hours worked per week per employed person in India was 45.7 hours/week in 2024.India’s labour productivity — measured as GDP per working hour — is around $8, placing it well below many other economies and reflecting a major efficiency gap, according to another recent ILO estimate.In May 2025, Niti Aayog vice-chairman Suman Bery warned that India has the lowest labour productivity among G20 nations, which likely indicates that longer hours may not translate into proportional output.Extending work hours without addressing inefficiencies will only exacerbate fatigue without meaningfully improving output.Secondly, China’s experience shows that intense work cultures can create significant long-term liabilities—ranging from burnout and health issues to declining creativity and increased attrition.These problems become structural as companies scale, ultimately forcing governments or markets to intervene.Mohandas Pai, chairman of Aarin Capital and a renowned voice in the field, recently reacted to Murthy’s comments and said that such a work culture need not be for everyone, suggesting 9-9-6-style hours might apply for entrepreneurs or key innovators, not every worker.“This is for a select group of innovators who want to build unicorns. Ordinary employees are not being asked to work 70 hours. Nobody is asking bank staff or people in offices to do this,” he said.Thirdly, India’s own tech and startup sectors are already seeing the contours of an overwork culture. Long hours in early-stage startups, sales-heavy edtech firms, and logistics operations often mirror the early days of China’s tech boom, but with even fewer formal protections.Without clear guidelines, India risks replicating the same trajectory that pushed China to reverse course.Most importantly, India’s real challenge lies not in hours but in productivity, skills, technological adoption and managerial efficiency.Priyanka Mukherjee, a senior assistant news editor in a leading organisation, says, “Absolutely. India’s challenge isn’t the number of hours people work. It’s the productivity we derive from those hours, the quality of skills, our ability to use technology intelligently and how efficiently our managers plan workflows.”“Increasing hours doesn’t increase output, smarter systems do”, she added.Hence, improving these areas—along with investing in worker well-being—will have far greater impact on national output than simply stretching the workday.China’s 996 work culture stands as a powerful reminder that economic growth achieved through relentless hours eventually encounters hard limits. What drove early-stage expansion later became a source of public anger, legal battles and policy intervention.As India charts its own path to higher productivity, the Chinese experience offers a crucial lesson. Sustainable growth comes not from the quantity of hours worked, but from the quality of work, the efficiency of systems and the well-being of the workforce.As Swami Vivekananda said, “Learn everything that is good from others, but bring it in, and in your own way absorb it; do not become others.”","Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy recently urged young Indians to embrace a 72-hour workweek.

Cyclone 'Senyar' likely to form over Bay of Bengal: 10 key points,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cyclone-senyar-likely-to-form-over-bay-of-bengal-10-key-points/articleshow/125516130.cms,"Representative Image

One Dead, Thousands Evacuated as Cyclone Montha Tears Through Andhra and Odisha

Here are 10 key points you need to know:

The low-pressure area, currently well-marked, is expected to move west-northwestwards and intensify into a depression over the southeast Bay of Bengal around Nov 24.

It may further strengthen into a cyclonic storm over the southeast Bay of Bengal within 48 hours after forming as a depression.

The IMD issued a Special Message on Saturday, a protocol followed when there is significant likelihood of cyclone formation.

IMD Director General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said once the system becomes a depression, bulletins will be issued every six hours, and every three hours after it turns into a cyclone.

The warnings are anticipatory, advising fishermen to avoid venturing into the sea and cautioning about heavy rain over the Andaman & Nicobar Islands .

. Skymet Weather also flagged the system’s potential to develop into a cyclonic storm next week but said the track remains uncertain.

Skymet president GP Sharma suggested the system may bypass Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, potentially moving towards West Bengal or Bangladesh, but exact paths are difficult to predict at this stage.

IMD forecast isolated very heavy rainfall over Andaman & Nicobar Islands from Nov 22 to 27, with squally winds of 40-50 kmph.

Wind speeds are expected to increase further as the system intensifies into a depression and possibly a cyclone.

Officials said it is too early to predict landfall or rainfall zones for mainland India; impacts will become clearer once the system consolidates over the Bay of Bengal.

CHENNAI: A low-pressure area over the Strait of Malacca and adjoining south Andaman Sea is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm over the Bay of Bengal next week, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.If named, the cyclone will be called Senyar — meaning ""lion"" — a name submitted by the United Arab Emirates. The Bay of Bengal has historically produced intense cyclones in the September–October season, including Montha in late October, which left two dead and damaged over 80,000 hectares of crops.","A low-pressure area over the Strait of Malacca and adjoining south Andaman Sea is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm over the Bay of Bengal next week.

What It Means For Indian Workers





Foreign-trained physicians, who make up nearly one quarter of the United States’ medical workforce, could be forced to leave underserved communities due to skyrocketing H-1B visa fees, a historian of science has warned.Before, the hospitals had to pay approximately $5,000 to sponsor a physician’s visa to work in the United States. Now, they’d have to pay $100,000 per physician. That is a massive increase, according to Eram Alam, an associate professor and author of The Care of Foreigners: How Immigrant Physicians Changed US Healthcare.She warned that many hospitals, particularly in rural areas, cannot absorb these additional costs, which could force foreign doctors to leave. The American Medical Association has petitioned the administration to exempt physicians from the higher fees, citing their critical role in providing care to millions of Americans.Alam said immigrant doctors have become the backbone of American medicine, especially in rural areas and under-resourced urban communities. These physicians often fill gaps that American-trained doctors avoid, providing care where it is most needed, reports the Harvard Gazette She noted that immigrant physicians were invited to take up these roles because American-trained doctors generally prefer more lucrative or prestigious positions.Today, the United States has between 200,000 and 300,000 foreign-born doctors, many practising primary care or less lucrative specialties. A large share come from India, Pakistan, the Philippines, and more recently Nigeria. Many work in rural hospitals where immigrant physicians may make up 100 per cent of the medical staff.Early immigrant physicians often felt socially and culturally isolated, Alam said. Despite this, over the decades, South Asian doctors in particular have become important figures in medicine and public life, from hospital leadership roles to high-profile media personalities.Alam also said that immigrant doctors are essential to US healthcare but their home countries lose medical talent when these physicians migrate. Many are trained with local taxpayer money, creating a global shortage even as they help address the US physician gap.The United States should invest in training and producing enough doctors so that it can share medical expertise globally, rather than relying on importing physicians from abroad, according to Alam.","Before, the hospitals had to pay approximately $5,000 to sponsor a physician’s visa to work in the United States.

NEW DELHI: In a major crackdown on synthetic drug trafficking, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and Delhi Police’s special cell seized 329 kg of methamphetamine worth Rs 262 crore from a house in south Delhi’s Chattarpur on Nov 20. Two people were arrested.The joint exercise, codenamed Operation Crystal Fortress, was an intelligence-driven effort to dismantle a transnational drug network. Investigators believe the cartel is linked to a foreign-based kingpin who is also wanted in last year’s seizure of 83 kg cocaine in Delhi.Saying that the Centre “is shattering drug cartels at an unprecedented pace”, Union home minister Amit called the operation “a brilliant example of seamless multi-agency coordination to achieve PM Modi’s vision for a drug-free India”.Officers in the know of things said that the breakthrough followed months of surveillance and technical intercepts that exposed a well-oiled cartel using multiple couriers, safe houses and layered handlers, with Delhi as a key hub for domestic and overseas distribution of drugs.One of the arrested suspects, Shane Waris (25), a resident of Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, was picked up from Noida’s Sector 5 on Nov 20. Employed as a sales manager in a company, Waris allegedly operated under instructions from his handler.He was directed to use fake SIM cards and encrypted apps, such as WhatsApp and Zangi, to discreetly run the operations.During interrogation, Waris admitted to his role in the syndicate and provided crucial leads to the investigators, including identifying a woman associate, Esther Kinimi from Nagaland, who recently managed one of the narcotic consignments transported through a rider of a logistics platform.Waris shared her address, contact numbers and other operational details with the investigators.Acting on Waris’ inputs, NCB personnel raided Kinimi’s Chattarpur Enclave Phase 2 residence the same day, recovering the massive consignment. She was arrested with assistance from Nagaland Police.Preliminary findings suggest that the syndicate was part of a larger cartel. “The investigation indicates Waris was actively involved in a synthetic drug trafficking syndicate functioning under foreign operators,” an officer said.Authorities are now working with international enforcement agencies to trace the kingpin and secure his deportation to India so that he could face legal proceedings.Further investigation is required to map the entire supply chain, financial trail, logistics nodes, and potential storage points, the officer said.This seizure is among the largest of methamphetamine in Delhi. The investigators said efforts are underway to dismantle the entire network and prevent its tentacles from spreading to overseas markets.","The joint exercise, codenamed Operation Crystal Fortress, was an intelligence- driven effort to dismantle a transnational drug network.

When our teams were trying to remove them, some of the protestors attacked police personnel using chilli spray. Three to four personnel sustained injuries and are undergoing treatment,"" the officer said.The protestors were subsequently removed from the C-hexagon to avoid traffic disruption.""This was very unusual. For the first time, protestors used chilli spray on officers managing traffic and law and order,"" deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Devesh Kumar Mahla told PTI.Earlier, on November 9, several people were also detained after they gathered at India Gate as part of a “clean air protest,” demanding urgent government action and strict policies to tackle what they called an “air emergency.”Some women even brought their children, holding nebulisers and medical prescriptions, to the site — symbolic reminders of the pollution crisis that has choked the city.Some took to social media, sharing visuals of people being herded into police buses. A post on X read: ""India Gate clean-air protest. We are being taken away, shoved into a bus"". A few protesters alleged that they were manhandled and some children also detained, but police denied both claims.In a press statement, the protesters demanded ""urgent, accountable and transparent action"" from Delhi govt to tackle the crisis. They called for the creation of an independent air regulator, real-time air quality data transparency, clear health advisories during pollution spikes and public accountability for funds to tackle pollution.Delhi woke up to dense smog on Monday, and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data indicates that the AQI has crossed the 400 mark in several areas, including Akshardham, ITO and Ghazipur, placing it in the ‘severe’ category.Water sprinklers were deployed as authorities attempted to tame the thick smog enveloping the area.Meanwhile on Sunday, Bawana recorded the highest AQI level of 435 at 7 am, falling under the 'severe' category. In contrast, NSIT Dwarka recorded the lowest AQI of 313, according to the data by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).A layer of toxic smog lingers in the air of Anand Vihar, as the Central Pollution Control Board reported that the Air Quality Index in the area is 429, categorised as 'very poor'.Chandani Chowk recorded an AQI of 390, RK Puram 397, ITO 384, Punjabi Bagh 411, Patparganj 401, Pusa 360, and Dwaraka Sector-8 386.","Police detained 15 people protesting against Delhi’s worsening pollution at C Hexagon after they allegedly refused to disperse.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Record earnings









Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed the growing concerns about an AI bubble. In recent months, investors and analysts have raised alarms about a potential AI bubble, warning that soaring spending by cloud providers and tech giants may prove unsustainable. Concerns have centered on whether the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure could mirror past boom-and-bust cycles in technology. Huang feels that the industry is presently undergoing some structural transformations and that it will sustain growth for the years to come. Speaking at the company’s earnings call, Huang said, “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.” The remarks made by Huang in AI bubble were quite expected as his company is presently at the centre of the artificial intelligence boom. Almost all the major cloud service provider such as Google, Amazon, Oracle are Nvidia’s customers.During the earnings call, Huang also laid down three major transitions which are fueling the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs.- From CPUs to GPUs - Firstly, Huang talked about the slow down of Moore’s law.He said that traditional computing is built around central processors and it is reaching its limit. Industries ranging from data processing to search and ad recommendations are shifting toward GPU-powered systems, which are uniquely suited to handle the massive computational demands of AI.- AI as a creator of new applications - Secondly Huang feels that AI is not just improving the existing tools but it is now unlocking completely new categories of applications. From generative models reshaping search and recommendations to advanced engineering solutions, AI is becoming the foundation for innovations that didn’t exist before.- Rise of Agentic and Physical AI - Lastly, Huang pointed out that the next-generation AI systems are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting and require minimal human intervention. These “agentic” and “physical” AI applications, such as coding assistants and robotics, will require unprecedented levels of computing power, further driving demand for Nvidia’s architecture.Huang believes that Nvidia’s singular architecture supports all three transitions across every industry and modality of AI, making the company uniquely positioned to power this next wave of infrastructure growth.Nvidia reported a record quarter with $57 billion revenue which is up by 62% year-over-year, and forecasted $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The shares of the company rose by 5% in after-hours trading. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress reinforced the bullish outlook, noting, “The clouds are sold out. Our GPU installed base is fully utilized.”","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed the growing concerns about an AI bubble.

How this compares to Verizon's previous layoffs









: Verizon has announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history, a report has said, adding that the job cuts come as the country’s largest wireless carrier struggles with competitive pressures and a shrinking customer base. CEO Dan Schulman, who took the helm in October after serving on Verizon’s board since 2018, cited the need to streamline operations and reduce costs that are limiting the company's ability to invest in customer value.“Our current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,"" Schulman wrote in an internal memo obtained by news agency Reuters. “We must simplify our operations to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers”.The telecom giant plans to significantly reduce not only its direct workforce but also outsourced and external labour expenses, the report noted. Additionally, Verizon will convert 179 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations and close one location.Meanwhile, a company spokesperson told CNBC that the job cuts are “an opportunity for Verizon to reset, restructure and realign our priorities on ways that will help us regain our leadership as a communications provider.”This represents Verizon's largest-ever single job cut. The company had approximately 1,00,000 US employees at the end of 2024, including around 70,000 non-union workers. Over the previous three years, Verizon had already eliminated nearly 20,000 positions, making the current reduction particularly dramatic.Verizon is establishing a $20 million career transition fund specifically for laid-off workers, focusing on “opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI.” The company emphasised that the job cuts were not driven by AI implementation.Reports say that Verizon is facing competition from established rivals offering cheaper plans and cable operators entering the wireless market. The company added just 44,000 monthly bill-paying wireless subscribers in the third quarter, significantly trailing AT&T and far behind T-Mobile, which led the industry with over 1 million net subscriber additions.Schulman inherited substantial challenges from his predecessor at PayPal, arriving amid aggressive promotions from AT&T and T-Mobile surrounding new iPhone launches. Despite massive investments—including $52 billion for 5G spectrum in 2021, a $20 billion Frontier Communications acquisition, and $6 billion for TracFone Wireless—Verizon continues to lose ground in the competitive landscape.","Verizon announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history.

Moody's warns that many US States showing recession signs





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy. Bezos has urged the consumers and businesses to postpone their large purchases as the fear of recession is mounting. Speaking to CNN’s Chole Melas in an interview, Bezos has cautioned that the coming months could bring prolonged downturn. Bezos has recommend that households should consider putting a hold on purchasing big-ticket products such as cars, televisions and appliances. He urge the consumers to save that money as it will make a lot of difference if the economic worsens. Along with this, Bezos has also advised the small businesses to avoid large capital expenditures or acquisitions during this uncertain period.“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”Despite his cautionary advice, Bezos struck an optimistic tone about the long-term future, saying he believes the American Dream remains attainable. He even projected that within his lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public. Last month, Bezos tweeted a warning to “batten down the hatches,” advice he reiterated in his CNN interview as relevant to both consumers and business owners.Ironically, if the consumers follow Bezos’ advice, then it could mean lower sales for Amazon. Recently, Amazon announced its plans to layoff 14,000 employees. In October, Amazon projected holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street expectations, citing inflation and shifting consumer behavior. Americans are spending more on travel and dining out and less on discretionary goods.Recently, Mark Zandi, chief economist at credit rating agency Moody' warned about recession in the US. A new analysis of state-level data suggests that the US economy is ""on the edge of recession,"" said Mark Zandi of Moody's. ""Based on my assessment of various data, states making up nearly a third of US GDP are either in or at high risk of recession, another third are just holding steady, and the remaining third are growing,"" Zandi wrote on social media.The data reveals a mixed picture across the country. States in the South are generally the strongest, though their growth is beginning to slow. Meanwhile, some of the nation's largest economies, like California and New York, are described as ""holding their own,"" and their stability is seen as critical to preventing a full-blown national recession.However, many states are showing signs of vulnerability. Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Kansas, and Massachusetts were all identified as being at high risk of recession. The broader Washington, D.C. area is also notable for its economic struggles, which Zandi attributes to government job cuts.Adding to the forecast, Zandi predicts that the annual inflation rate, currently at 2.7%, could rise to nearly 4% within the next year, further eroding purchasing power for consumers.Along with this, Zandi also warned about the restrictive immigration policies which could hurt the tech sector. He urged the lawmakers to protect access to global talent especially in AI, software engineering, and data science. ""If it feels like we're coming to the end of the tariff increases, or like we're going to get a more rational immigration policy,' I think that would be a signal that the coast may be cleared,"" Zandi told BI.“It’s no mystery why the economy is struggling; blame increasing U.S. tariffs and highly restrictive immigration policy. The tariffs are cutting increasingly deeply into the profits of American companies and the purchasing power of American households. Fewer immigrant workers means a smaller economy,” added Zandi.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy.

A room full of startup founders and investors at the world's biggest AI conference votes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI among 'likely flops',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-biggest-ai-conference-votes-sam-altmans-openai-among-likely-flops/articleshow/125364076.cms,"Representative Image

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’





OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference.

Debate erupts on social media

Delhi’s air quality near ‘severe’

NEW DELHI: A London-based Indian techie has ignited a fierce debate online after urging people to “leave Delhi, even if you have to go into debt”, describing the capital’s worsening air pollution as nothing short of a health emergency.Kunal Kushwaha, a senior developer advocate at CAST AI and founder of WeMakeDevs community, shared his stark experience on X after landing in Delhi for a short trip. Having lived in London for a few years, he said the contrast in air quality hit him badly as he could 'literally taste and smell the pollution.'Kushwaha admitted he had grown up in Delhi and never truly felt how bad the air was while living there. “You see people walking without masks, going for morning runs... I thought, how bad can it really be?” he wrote.He said the moment he stepped out of the airport, even an AQI of around 200 hit him hard: 'Sore throat, and a feeling like needles in my lungs. I could actually feel the pollution entering my body.' he posted adding that he was cutting his trip short and flying out the next day.His post quickly went viral, drawing over 10 lakh views, along with thousands of likes, reposts, and heated arguments.Many agreed with his warning, calling Delhi’s toxic air a silent, slow-moving public health disaster. But others argued that “leaving” was a privilege.One user wrote: “‘Leave Delhi’ is great advice for the tiny percent who can. The rest of us need the air fixed, not a relocation plan.”Another commented: “It’s extremely worrying to see what’s happening in Delhi. But millions can’t just relocate. By all means protect your health—but the solution has to be systemic.”A third user slammed authorities for inaction: “True—and companies, schools and other non-important institutions are still open like it’s nothing. It’s clearly a health emergency, but the government isn’t doing what it can. Not even WFH is mandatory.”Meanwhile, the capital’s air quality deteriorated further on Sunday, touching 391—dangerously close to the ‘severe’ category.A combination of low wind speeds and falling temperatures trapped pollutants close to the surface, choking the city under a thick layer of haze.Despite repeated warnings from environmental experts and public health researchers, the capital continues to struggle with the annual winter pollution cycle driven by vehicle emissions, construction dust, thermal power output, waste burning and stubble smoke from neighbouring states.","Kunal Kushwaha shared his stark experience on X after landing in Delhi for a short trip.

FY27 is likely to witness above 15% earnings growth. This is a strong fundamental support. A US-India trade deal may happen at any time.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Over time, he grew close to her family and visited her home frequently. During one such visit, he allegedly claimed her astrological readings suggested she should build a Goddess Lakshmi temple.As a devotee of the goddess, she agreed to contribute to the construction of a temple.A month later, Manjunath allegedly claimed he planned to build a Goddess Lakshmi temple in Kapu, Udupi district, and requested financial support, promising to repay her once the structure was completed.Manjunath introduced her to Raghavendra, identifying him as his follower, Madhusoodan as a bank employee, and Gopal Krishna as a Reserve Bank of India manager.Trusting Manjunath, she gave him Rs 10 lakh in cash in 2022. Subsequently, she transferred Rs 4.6 lakh through multiple transactions between April 2022 and Sept 2023.When Manjunath requested additional funds, she sold one of her properties and provided him with Rs 30 lakh.Additionally, she transferred Rs 3 lakh to Raghavendra and Rs 2.6 lakh to Madhusoodan in 2022, along with another Rs 3 lakh to Raghavendra. In total, she claimed to have provided approximately Rs 1 crore to them.To convince her that the temple was indeed under construction, Manjunath made a video call from a temple in Kapu village, showing her an under-construction site and claiming the temple was being built here.After a few weeks, she wanted to see the construction work in person and travelled to Kapu. However, Manjunath and others avoided her calls, and she returned without being able to view the temple.Even after her visit, Manjunath continued to ask for financial assistance, stating that more money was needed for construction of the temple tower (gopura). During this time, she gave him 180 grams of gold ornaments, which included two gold chains, earrings, and other items.Eventually, Manjunath began avoiding her and stopped responding to her calls. She managed to trace him to Rameswaram, where she demanded that he return her money and gold. He promised to repay her within a month but failed to do so.The music teacher sought police action against all four individuals, accusing them of cheating her by exploiting her faith and trust in astrology.A senior police officer said a case has been registered under BNS Section 318 (cheating) and investigation is on.","A 56-year-old music teacher has accused an astrologer and three accomplices of cheating her of nearly Rs 1 crore in cash and 180 grams of gold, allegedly under the pretext of raising funds to build a temple.

Toxic smog chokes Delhi: Air quality turns 'severe' as AQI reading soars to 435,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/toxic-smog-chokes-delhi-air-quality-turns-severe-as-aqi-reading-soars-to-435/articleshow/125515423.cms,"'We Can’t Breathe': Activists, Parents, Kids Held During Delhi Clean-Air Protest At India Gate

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Delhi woke up to dense smog on Sunday morning, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 381 at 7 am, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category. This comes despite the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-IV being in effect across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).A thick layer of smog covered several parts of the city, showing little improvement from Saturday morning, when the AQI had stood at 359.Bawana recorded the highest pollution level at 435, falling under the ‘severe’ category, while NSIT Dwarka recorded the lowest at 313, as per CPCB data.A layer of toxic smog lingers in the air of Anand Vihar, as the Central Pollution Control Board reported that the Air Quality Index in the area is 429, categorised as 'very poor'.Chandani Chowk recorded an AQI of 390, RK Puram 397, ITO 384, Punjabi Bagh 411, Patparganj 401, Pusa 360, and Dwaraka Sector-8 386.Visuals from India Gate and Kartavya Path are blanketed in a layer of toxic smog, with the AQI in the area at 388 in the 'very poor' category, according to the CPCB.According to AQI categorisation, 0-50 is 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', and 401-500 'severe'.On Saturday, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) for NCR and Adjoining Areas revised the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for the entire NCR. The commission directed that measures for the 'Severe' AQI category under GRAP Stage IV would now be implemented under GRAP Stage III, according to a press release.Under the revised plan, the NCR State Governments and the GNCTD will decide whether public, municipal, and private offices can operate at 50% capacity, with the remaining staff working from home. The Central Government may also decide on permitting work-from-home arrangements for employees in central government offices.Earlier, on Friday, AAP Delhi State President Saurabh Bharadwaj alleged that Delhi’s pollution crisis has escalated into a public health emergency due to manipulation of air quality data and lax enforcement of restrictions intended to curb toxic air.Bharadwaj accused the BJP-run Delhi government of fabricating AQI readings and allowing government and private construction to continue despite GRAP-III bans. He claimed that pollution levels of 500-700 were being reported as 300-400 to avoid triggering mandatory restrictions.","Delhi woke up to dense smog on Sunday morning, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 381 at 7 am.

What took so long in the investigation

What was the motive behind the brutal murder?





The US authorities have sought the extradition of Nazeer Hameed, an Indian man, currently living in India, on charges of murdering a mother and son in 2017 in a New Jersey flat. 38-year-old Sasikala Narra and her 6-year-old son, Anish, were stabbed multiple times and the crime scene was described as difficult to forget as there were signs that both of them fought back the attack. Eight years have passed and Hameed went back to India but the investigation went on and now finally Nazeer Hameed has been charged with murder.Nazeer was a co-worker of Sasikala's husband and used to live within walking distance of the Narras. He was in the US on a work visa but he returned to India six months after the murders.Patrick Thornton, the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office chief of investigations, said investigators collected various evidence at the crime scene, including blood samples. A lab report issued after two years showed that a single drop of blood collected did not belong to the family. Then, investigators determined Nazeer Hameed was a person of interest.Nazeer was already in India and refused to give a DNA sample for the match which was crucial to solving the case. In 2024, the investigators obtained a court order that requested Nazeer's company in India to send them his company's laptop so that they could gather DNA evidence.""Ultimately, a DNA contributor was able to be obtained from the laptop, which matched the DNA from the unknown blood droplet from the crime scene,"" Lt. Brian Cunningham with the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office said.""Our message is clear. We did not forget,"" Burlington County Prosecutor LaChia Bradshaw said. ""We did not forgive, and we will not stop pursuing those who take innocent lives in this county. Justice must and will prevail.""Investigators said they don't have a motive for the murders.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





US diplomat Mahvash Siddiqui, an Indian-origin US Foreign Service Officer, called out the industrialized fraud in the H-1B visa program as she recounted her experience at the Chennai consulate in India 20 years ago. Siddiqui appeared on a podcast and spoke on her personal capacity and not as a diplomat as she busted the myth that America has a shortage of STEM talents that have to be filled from India. The diplomat revealed a shocking figure and claimed that 80-90% of the H-1B visas from India are fake -- either they have fake degrees or some other forged documents or they are not highly skilled as to be deserving an H-1B visa.The H-1B visa program allows US companies to hire skilled workers from foreign countries. The Donald Trump administration has come under heat over its vacillating stand on the issue as H-1B now has a fee of $100,000 so that only candidates who are absolutely necessary and are highly skilled can be hired, but the administration does not want to take a strong stand against the visa program. In a recent interview, President Trump has made it clear that America needs H-1B as there are certain talents that the US needs to hire from other countries.Siddiqui said she was posted to the Chennai consulate from 2005 to 2007 when she adjudicated at least 51,000 H-1B visas. The Chennai consulate processed applications from four regions: Hyderabad, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, she said, adding that Hyderabad was the most concerning as Hyderabad's Ameerpet had shops not only consulting candidates on visa but providing them with forged documents -- be it an educational certificate or a marriage certificate. Siddiqui said she and the team she was working with quickly learned the fraud pattern and flagged it to the administration but there was a lot of political pressure. And their anti-fraud drive was called a 'rogue operation'.""As an Indian-American, I hate to say this but fraud and bribery are normalized in India,"" Siddiqui said, adding that she doesn't want to generalize but there were cases where the candidates did not even appear for their job interview themselves if the interviewer was an American.

The bigger travel picture: Roads and rails will be packed too

Cars: An estimated 73 million people will take to the roads, nearly 90% of all Thanksgiving travellers — and 1.3 million more than last year. Car-rental agencies are already reporting all-time-high booking activity for the holiday week, and if weather-related flight cancellations occur, this number could climb even further. The resulting congestion could also spill into airport access roads, creating traffic jams around terminals and adding yet another layer of pressure for air travellers trying to reach their flights on time.

with bus and rail likely to see last-minute booking spikes. City buses and feeder services, which link neighbourhoods to major junctions like metro stations and rail terminals, will play a crucial role in last-mile connectivity, though many of these services may be packed throughout the holiday week.



Cruises remain popular, with 20.7 million Americans sailing in 2025 and 21.7 million projected in 2026. Caribbean routes are especially attractive around Thanksgiving due to warm weather and all-inclusive family appeal.

A holiday rush that’s manageable with preparation





Thanksgiving week is always a national homecoming, but this year the scale is on a different level. Whether you’re flying, driving, or taking the train, the country is about to experience one of the most congested travel periods in modern history. AAA expects 81.8 million people to travel 50 miles or more between 25 November and 1 December, and the strain will be felt everywhere, from highways to departure gates. Air travel, in particular, will feel intense. The TSA is preparing to screen almost 18 million passengers in just seven days, while airlines and federal agencies brace for some of the busiest airport moments Americans have ever seen. If you’re heading to the skies, here’s the full picture, and what you can do to stay ahead of the rush.The upcoming week will push air travel to extraordinary levels. TSA expects more than 17.8 million screenings from 25 November to 2 December, with Sunday 30 November projected to exceed three million passengers, securing its place as one of the busiest days on record.The trend mirrors the year overall: eight of the ten highest-volume TSA days have occurred in 2025, with a daily average of 2.48 million travellers, up from 2.47 million in 2024, or roughly 14,000 more people every day.The Federal Aviation Administration is seeing similar intensity from its side.Airlines are adding capacity to cope. According to Airlines for America (A4A):With so many moving parts full aircraft, tight schedules, and intense gate activity, the airport environment will feel busy from the moment travellers arrive.TSA is rolling out extra staffing and expanded lanes, but the agency stresses that passenger preparation still plays a major role. Their key guidance includes:Together, these steps will help smooth out what is expected to be an exceptionally busy week.Beyond official guidelines, a few practical steps can significantly reduce stress during holiday travel:These steps aren’t glamorous, but they are realistic and effective, especially during a holiday period where millions of passengers will be competing for the same airport resources.While airports will feel the most pressure, the broader travel landscape is equally intense, if not more. AAA’s forecast of 81.8 million travellers highlights how widespread the movement will be.Here’s how the modes break down:Even though fewer people use these modes compared with flying or driving, the surge still adds to the picture of just how much movement is happening across the country.Thanksgiving 2025 will bring some of the highest travel volumes America has experienced, from almost 18 million passengers in TSA lines to 360,000+ flights navigating the skies. But with smart planning, early arrivals, and the right tools at hand, travellers can navigate the crowds and make it home in time for the holiday table. Families travelling with children should map out their journey in advance and build in buffer time for meals, naps, and airport navigation. It also helps to keep a flexible Plan B, whether that’s a rental car, a long-distance drive, or even a rail option, in case delays stack up. Preparing for busy terminals and packed roads makes the whole experience far more manageable.","More than 360,000 flights are scheduled nationwide for Thanksgiving week. Tuesday of the holiday week is forecast to be especially heavy. Carriers expect to fly 2.8 million passengers per day over the Thanksgiving period. Sunday 30 November and Monday 1 December will be the most crowded.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125521541,imgsize-128900,width-400,resizemode-4/the-shutdown-has-disrupted-air-travel-will-that-drive-a-surge-in-car-rentals-and-train-bookings.jpg"
"COLA increases Social Security payments for 2026: Boosts confirmed for retirees, spouses, survivors and disability recipients",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cola-increases-social-security-payments-for-2026-boosts-confirmed-for-retirees-spouses-survivors-and-disability-recipients/articleshow/125520986.cms,"What the 2.8% COLA means for beneficiaries

When will beneficiaries receive their updated amounts





Social Security beneficiaries are set to receive a higher monthly income in 2026 after the Social Security Administration confirmed a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). The increase will raise payments for more than 75 million Americans, including retirees, spouses, survivors, disabled workers and SSI recipients. The adjustment takes effect automatically, with the first larger payments arriving in January 2026 and SSI increases beginning on 31 December 2025.The new COLA will lift the average retirement benefit from $2,008 to $2,064 per month, adding $56 to the typical retiree’s income. Spousal benefits will increase from $954 to $981, survivor benefits from $1,575 to $1,619 and average disabled-worker payments from $1,583 to $1,627. Around 7.5 million SSI recipients will also see their payments rise, with adjustments applied to both Social Security and SSI for those who receive benefits from both programmes.Although the increase is welcome, it remains below the average COLA over the past decade and may not fully match rising living costs, particularly healthcare expenses, which weigh more heavily on older Americans.Beneficiaries who continue working while claiming Social Security before their full retirement age will see higher earnings thresholds in 2026.The annual earnings limit will increase to $24,480, up from $23,500, while the upper limit for those reaching full retirement age during the year will rise to $65,160.Exceeding these thresholds can result in temporary benefit withholdings, though withheld amounts are later credited back once full retirement age is reached. No earnings test applies after reaching full retirement age.The highest possible Social Security benefit for someone retiring at full retirement age will rise from $4,018 to $4,152 in 2026. This reflects an increase in the maximum taxable earnings cap, which climbs from $176,100 in 2025 to $184,500 in 2026. Higher wage indexing ensures that maximum benefits grow in line with national earnings trends.For many retirees enrolled in Medicare Part B, rising healthcare costs may offset part of their COLA increase. The standard Medicare Part B premium will climb 9.7% next year to $202.90, driven by higher outpatient care costs and prescription-drug spending. While this premium is deducted directly from most Social Security payments, the COLA ensures beneficiaries do not receive a net reduction in their monthly deposit — though many will see little or no real financial gain.The Social Security Administration will send personalised COLA notices in late November via online accounts, with paper letters arriving in December. These one-page summaries will outline each beneficiary’s new monthly amount, deductions and payment schedule. Even if a notice is delayed or misplaced, the higher payment will arrive automatically in January 2026. Medicare enrollees will also see updated premium information in their online Message Centre.","The increase will raise payments for more than 75 million Americans.
