Gold price prediction today: Amidst ongoing US-China trade deal talks, gold prices are likely to continue fluctuating, with geo-political uncertainties adding to volatility. Where are gold prices headed in the short-term and what are the factors that investors need to watch out for?Top trade deputies of the US and China began their talks in London on Monday. Gold gained on Monday on a weaker US Dollar. MCX August gold contract was at Rs 97200, up 0.16% on the day.Earlier, spot gold prices fell 1.25% to close at $3310 on Friday as the US non-farm payroll report (May) came in somewhat better than expected, though details were not so encouraging.Easing US-China trade tensions pressurized the yellow metal further. Despite falling for two straight days on June 5 and June 6, the metal closed nearly 0.63% higher on a weekly basis in the week ending June 6.The metal rose to $3403 on June 5 --highest since May 8- as traders piled into the metal on safe haven demand as US-China tensions escalated.US Treasury Secretary Bessent, Commerce Secretary Lutnick and US Trade Representative Greer met a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng Monday at London's Lancaster House. Presence of high-profile officials in Trump's Team reflects willingness of the US administration to allow some relaxations in the US exports to China, which may include technical supplies, jet engine parts, etc. China, in turn, is expected to ease rare earth exports to the US.Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 88.394MOz as of June 6. ETF holdings witnessed net inflows for the second consecutive week following net outflows for five straight weeks. ETF holdings are up around 6.70% YTD.China's inflation data released Monday showed that China's CPI (May) declined 0.1% y-o-y vs the forecast of -0.2%. It was the fourth straight monthly decline as the Chinese economy continues to struggle with sluggish demand amid a raging trade war. China’s factory deflation continued for the 32nd straight month as PPI (May) declined 3.3% y-o-y as against the estimate of 3.2% and 2.7% decline in April. The deflation threat will continue to linger unless consumer demand remains sluggish.China's exports slowed from 8.1% y-o-y in April to 4.8% y-o-y (forecast 6%) in May as shipments to the US declined 34% y-o-y, worse than a 21% decline registered in April. Chinese imports dipped 3.4% y-o-y due to trade uncertainty as against the forecast of a decline of 0.8%.The US non-farm report (May) released Friday was somewhat better-than-expected as US employers added 139K jobs Vs the forecast of 126K jobs, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Average hourly earnings m-o-m and y-o-y rose 0.4% and 3.9% respectively Vs the respective estimates of 0.3% (prior 0.2%) and 3.7% (prior 3.9%). However, two-month payroll net revision showed a decline of 95K jobs as labor force participation rate slid from 62.6% to 52.4%. The household survey reflected a weakening job market. Even as the population increased by 188k, the labor force dropped by 625k. Thus, even though employment fell by 696k, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.20%.Traders will closely monitor US CPI (May) and PPI (May) data to be released on June 11 and June 12 respectively for clues to the Fed rate cut path.The US Dollar Index, at the time of writing, was seen at 98.95, down nearly 0.24% on the day. The Index fell 0.14% in the week ending June 6. Ten-year and 30-year US yields were a tad lower at 4.48% and 4.95% respectively.Money managers increased their net bullish gold bets to a seven-week high in the week ending June 3.China's gold reserves were up for the seventh consecutive month as PBoC bought around 2 tons of gold in May. China's gold holdings reached 73.80 MOz at the end of May.The lingering deflation threat to China’s economy, positive ETF inflows and not so strong US non-farm payroll report (May) are positive factors for the yellow metal. However, in the near-term, the metal is expected to take its clues from the ongoing US-China trade talks in London. Positive outcomes from the talks will weigh on the shiny metal. In that case, gold may fall to as low as $3260 (Rs 95,000). Interim support is at $3292 (Rs 96,000). Resistance is at $3365 (Rs 98,000)/$3405 (Rs 99,200).In all the possibility, there may be some tentative positive developments in the trade deal talks. In that case, gold may decline to test the support at $3292. However, full resolution of all the trade related issues looks to be elusive for the time being. Nonetheless, traders need to take cognizance of the ongoing US-China trade deal talks. In the meantime, a light sell position can be initiated with due risk management in place.","Gold gained on Monday on a weaker US Dollar.

Poll Do you think the Vande Bharat train service will boost tourism in Jammu and Kashmir? Yes, definitely No, not really

NEW DELHI: A day after travelling on the newly launched Vande Bharat train from Srinagar to Katra, Jammu and Kashmir National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah visited the Vaishno Devi shrine and offered prayers on Wednesday.""I had a good darshan and I hope that we will get what I prayed for. We want prosperity, unity, brotherhood.

NEW DELHI: Continuing with the high tempo of military exercises with other countries after last month’s hostilities with Pakistan during Operation Sindoor , India has now conducted anti-submarine operations with the UK in the northern Arabian Sea, undertaken Special Forces drills with the US and is set for trilateral wargames in Mongolia.The Navy deployed stealth frigate INS Tabar, a Kalvari-class submarine and a long-range maritime patrol P-8I aircraft for the tactical exercise with an aircraft carrier strike group of the UK, which included HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Richmond, on June 9-10.India had forward deployed several frontline warships and submarines led by aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, with its MiG-29K fighters, in a dissuasive deterrent posture in the northern Arabian Sea when the IAF and Army had launched deep precision strikes against nine terror hubs in Pakistan and PoK on May 7. The deployment had bottled up the Pak Navy within its own shores in a defensive mode.The IAF’s Garud commandos, in turn, conducted intensive combat drills with their counterparts from the USAF at different locations in north India from May 26 to June 10, in the first-ever such Special Forces exercise called “Tiger Claw”.“The exercise aimed at expanding partnerships, mutual exchange of best practices in special operations, and joint training between the two air forces to develop interoperability,” an officer said.An Army contingent of Kumaon Regiment soldiers and some other units, including a woman officer and two women soldiers, also reached Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia on Wednesday to take part in the “Khaan Quest” exercise, with the US as the third participant in the drills from June 14 to 28.“The exercise’s aim is to prepare Indian armed forces for peacekeeping missions while operating in a multinational environment, thereby increasing interoperability and military readiness in peace,” an officer said.","The Navy deployed stealth frigate INS Tabar, a Kalvari-class submarine and a long-range maritime patrol P-8I aircraft for the tactical exercise with an aircraft carrier strike group of the UK.

Who is Zeeshan Akhtar? Key conspirator in Baba Siddique murder held in Canada; linked to Bishnoi gang,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-is-zeeshan-akhtar-key-suspect-in-baba-siddique-murder-held-in-canada-linked-to-bishnoi-gang/articleshow/121790642.cms,".

Who is Zeeshan Akhtar

Zeeshan Akhtar is a 22-year-old from Punjab.

He is accused of being a key conspirator in Baba Siddique’s murder.

Police say Akhtar planned the killing, managed finances through more than 10 bank accounts, and coordinated with other accused.

He worked closely with jailed shooter Gurmel Singh and helped arrange weapons and shelter for the attackers.

Akhtar reportedly left Mumbai a month before the murder to avoid raising suspicion.

He is linked to the Lawrence and Anmol Bishnoi gang.

Akhtar is the second accused to be detained in Canada after Anmol Bishnoi.

Zeeshan Akhtar has been detained in Canada in connection with the murder of NCP politician Baba Siddique. Akhtar was reportedly held on the basis of an Interpol notice and has been in Canadian police custody for over a week.Baba Siddique, 66, was shot dead on October 12 last year outside his son's office in Bandra (East), Mumbai. Three assailants carried out the attack. His son had alleged that a builder lobby involved in a Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) project was responsible, but police ruled out this angle. Instead, their chargesheet pointed to Lawrence Bishnoi's Canada-based brother Anmol as the mastermind, linking the murder to Siddique's alleged connections with Dawood Ibrahim and actor Salman Khan.So far, 26 people have been arrested from different parts of the country, including Pune, Uttar Pradesh’s Bahraich, Haryana, Dombivli and Karjat. They include Shivkumar Gautam alias Shiva, who is accused of firing the shots. All 26 are facing charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).","Zeeshan Akhtar, 22, is accused of being a key conspirator in Baba Siddique’s murder.

In a historic first, Indian-origin doctor Bobby Mukkamala has been sworn in as the 180th president of the American Medical Association (AMA).He is the first physician of Indian heritage to lead the influential organisation.The appointment comes just months after Mukkamala underwent surgery for an 8-cm brain tumour, according to the American Medical Association. Reflecting on his journey, he said, “As I lay in recovery from brain surgery at the Mayo Clinic, with tubes and wires monitoring my every movement, this night — this honour — this opportunity to improve health care seemed a very distant dream.”Addressing AMA members and guests, he underlined the urgent need to reform the US healthcare system. “There are tremendous gaps in our health care system that require our attention,” he said. “That’s why continuing to fight for adequate health coverage for our patients is so important... and why fighting for a sustainable, equitable health care model is so important.”Mukkamala has been a longstanding advocate within the AMA, chairing the Substance Use and Pain Care Task Force and working on evidence-based policies to combat the overdose crisis.His public service work includes leading the Community Foundation of Greater Flint during the water crisis, with a focus on projects that helped mitigate the impact of lead on children.Born to Indian immigrant doctors, Mukkamala credited his parents' sacrifices and his hometown of Flint for shaping his career. “I stand here tonight on the shoulders I quite literally stood on as a kid,” he said. “Those of my parents, Apparao and Sumathi, two immigrants from India who settled in this country believing it offered them — and their future children — opportunities that simply were not possible at home.”Mukkamala completed his medical degree at the University of Michigan and residency at Loyola University in Chicago and returned to Flint to practise medicine alongside his wife, Nita Kulkarni, an obstetrician-gynaecologist. The couple have two sons, Nikhil, a biomedical engineer, and Deven, a PhD candidate in political science.Mukkamala also used his first speech as AMA president to highlight rising health disparities in underserved cities like Flint. “Life expectancy in Flint is about 12 years shorter than its suburbs,” he said, adding that he and his wife have witnessed those disparities firsthand through their work.He warned that more doctors may leave private practice because of financial problems and a growing shortage of physicians.“Where are our patients supposed to turn?” he asked, recounting how a patient preferred to wait six weeks for his return after surgery than seek alternative care.As president, Mukkamala plans to continue advocating for accessible, affordable care and greater government investment in research and public health. “Our patients deserve better. Our physicians deserve better. Our nation deserves better,” he said.",Bobby Mukkamala is the 180th president of the American Medical Association.

Project Pelican: Canada busts drug racket financing anti-India activities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/project-pelican-canada-busts-drug-racket-financing-anti-india-activities/articleshow/121787460.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Project Pelican, a major investigation conducted by Peel Regional Police, has busted a big narco-terror network based out of Canada and individuals suspected to be Khalistan sympathisers. While the operation led to the largest ever drug seizure there with 479 kg of cocaine valued at $47.9 million, nine individuals including seven Indian-origin men settled in Canada have been arrested.The investigation has revealed that the network exploited commercial trucking routes from the US to Canada, with ties to Mexican cartels and US-based distributors, the Peel police said.The proceeds from drug trafficking were being used to finance anti-India activities, including protests and referendums besides funding for weapons, sources said. Intelligence sources pointed towards an ISI-backed plan where Khalistani groups in Canada are being funded to traffick high value Mexican cocaine. The ISI has also been been found pushing Afghan-grown heroin.The arrested men include Sajgith Yogendrarajah, 31, of Toronto; Manpreet Singh, 44, of Brampton; Philip Tep, 39, of Hamilton; Arvinder Powar, 29, of Brampton; Karamjit Singh, 36, of Caledon; Gurtej Singh, 36, of Caledon; Sartaj Singh, 27, of Cambridge; Shiv Onkar Singh, 31, of Georgetown and Hao Tommy Huynh, a 27-year-old from Mississauga.They face a total of 35 charges related to firearm and drug offences, the Canadian police said.Last Dec, two Canadian nationals of Indian origin were arrested when US Illinois State Police found over 1,000 pounds of cocaine in their Volvo truck: something which alerted the investigators to the smuggling ring involving ISI which patronised illegal poppy cultivation in Afghanistan to help Taliban fight the US and Afghan troops.The current investigation began in June 2024, focusing on a cocaine smuggling operation using US-Canada commercial trucking routes. By Nov, multiple individuals, trucking companies, and storage sites linked to the operation were identified with the help of Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and the US Drug Enforcement Administration.Significant seizures were made between Feb and May 2025, including 127 kg of cocaine at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor and 50 kg at the Blue Water Bridge in Point Edward, the Peel police said in a statement. Additional seizures were made across the Greater Toronto area, with some individuals arrested in possession of loaded firearms.""A total of 479 kg of bricked cocaine, worth an estimated $47.9 million, was seized, along with two illegal loaded semi-automatic handguns. The accused were held for a bail hearing at the Ontario Court of Justice in Brampton,"" the Peel police said.Michael S Kerzner, solicitor general of Ontario, praised the operation, stating, ""Project Pelican is proof of what police can accomplish when they have the tools and resources needed to keep our communities safe.""","The operation led to the largest ever drug seizure there with 479 kg of cocaine valued at $47.9 million.

'Trump Card is coming': $5m gold card offering US residency now accepting applications; key details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-card-is-coming-5m-gold-card-offering-us-residency-now-accepting-applications-key-details/articleshow/121790287.cms,"(Source: Donald Trump's Truth Social account)

The

Trump Card

is coming!

What the card promises — and what it doesn’t

A replacement for EB-5?

Major tax advantage for card holders

The much-hyped “Trump Card” is now officially open for registration, offering wealthy foreigners a chance to join a waiting list.US President Donald Trump describes it as a premium route toward US citizenship, for a hefty $5 million price tag.The official website, TrumpCard.gov, features an image of the shiny gold-coloured card, complete with Trump’s photo, signature and name. The form asks for basic details like name, email, region of origin, and whether the applicant is applying as an individual or a business.Trump announced the launch on his social media platform Truth Social, “For five million $DOLLARS, The Trump Card is coming! Thousands have been calling and asking how they can sign up to ride a beautiful road in gaining access to the greatest country and market anywhere in the world.”“The waiting list is now open,” he added.The website lists eight regions for applicants to choose from: Europe, Asia (including the Middle East), North America, Oceania, Central America, South America, the Caribbean and Africa.Above the details, the site ensures that applicants will be notified when access opens: ‘Enter your information below to be notified the moment access opens.’Trump claims the card offers a “path to citizenship,” but he has clarified that it does not guarantee immediate entry or naturalisation. “It’s somewhat like a green card , but at a higher level of sophistication,” the POTUS has claimed.The Trump administration insists the new card does not require approval from Congress, as it doesn’t provide citizenship outright. White House officials have said more information will be released soon, reports USA Today.Under the existing US naturalisation system, immigrants must typically be lawful permanent residents for at least five years, meet age and language criteria, and have a clean record.Trump first proposed the Trump Card earlier this year as a replacement for the EB-5 investor visa programme, which grants green cards to foreigners who invest between $800,000 and $1.05 million into US job-creating projects. The EB-5 programme has long suffered from backlogs and accusations of fraud.“Wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card,” Trump said in February. “They'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful, and they'll be spending a lot of money, and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people.”He added, “It’s a road to citizenship for people and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in.”One of the key selling points of the Trump Card appears to be its potential tax benefits. Trump has suggested that gold card buyers would only be taxed on their US earnings, unlike green card holders, who are taxed on worldwide income. This is likely to appeal to many high-net-worth individuals who have avoided relocating to the US due to its global tax obligations.Trump Card does not seem to require applicants to create US-based jobs or launch businesses, unlike the EB-5 visa programme. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has claimed that 1,000 cards were sold in a single day, even though the programme has yet to officially launch. According to Lutnick, some 37 million people worldwide could afford the Trump Card.Trump has claimed he was the first to purchase the Trump Card himself. “I had no idea who would be the second,” he said. However, the programme is not designed for American citizens.","The much-hyped ‘Trump Card’ is now officially open for registration.

Digital economy has eliminated traditional boundaries

Companies report positive results from flexible schedules

Shark Tank judge and millionaire Kevin O'Leary has dismissed the growing four-day workweek movement as ""the stupidest idea I have ever heard,"" arguing that the modern digital economy has already made traditional work schedules obsolete.Speaking on Fox News, the 70-year-old investor took particular aim at France's exploration of shortened work weeks, suggesting a provocative alternative: ""I think we should let the French go to a two-day workweek and then kick their ass internationally,"" he spoke at a Fox TV show.O'Leary contends that pandemic-era changes have fundamentally altered how work functions. ""There's no such thing as a workweek anymore anyway on a digital economy, post-pandemic,"" he explained. With 40% of his staff working remotely worldwide, he focuses on project completion rather than hours clocked.""I don't care when my staff does their work—as long as it gets done on time,"" O'Leary said, acknowledging that while he opposes mandated four-day weeks, the traditional 9-to-5 model is equally outdated.Despite O'Leary's skepticism, numerous organizations are seeing benefits from shortened workweeks. Performance coaching company Exos implemented a four-day schedule for its 3,500 employees, resulting in 24% increased productivity and halved burnout rates.The trend has gained executive attention, with 30% of CEOs now considering organization-wide schedule shifts, according to KPMG survey data. International governments are also experimenting—Tokyo's metropolitan government recently introduced four-day options to address population decline and improve work-life balance .""We must build a society where everyone can balance work and family life, and one step forward is the four-day workweek,"" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told Fortune.Research supports worker interest, with 77% of employees saying a four-day workweek would favorably impact their wellbeing, even if maintaining 40 total hours, according to Gallup polling.","Kevin O'Leary has dismissed the growing four-day workweek movement as ""the stupidest idea I have ever heard"" The Shark Tank judge argues that the modern digital economy has already made traditional work schedules obsolete. 30% of CEOs now considering organization-wide schedule shifts, according to KPMG.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121725791,imgsize-1038327,width-400,resizemode-4/Kevin-OLeary.jpg"

Thane: In a victory for the residents of Mullabaug in Thane, MMRDA will realign the Thane-end entry and exit points of the twin tunnel highway to Borivili through a covered route which is likely to be at a carriageway depth of five metres. This adjustment ensures the alignment bypasses the densely populated cluster of high-rise buildings in the vicinity before surfacing several meters ahead of Ghodbunder Highway.The revised plan received an in-principle nod from deputy CM and MMRDA chairman Eknath Shinde on Tuesday. MMRDA officials said fresh surveys will be conducted to finalize the alignment, adding that a rise in project cost is likely due to the changes. Residents from housing societies including Cosmos Lounge, Neelkanth Greens, Neelkanth Woods, The Verraton, and Shree Satya Shankar -- united under the banner of Mullabaug Project Affected People -- had voiced strong opposition to the original alignment. The earlier plan routed the tunnel's exit through their ""tranquil neighborhood"", stoking concerns over traffic congestion and pollution.In April, residents staged protests and submitted representations to public officials, including Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske and NCP (SP) MLA Jitendra Awhad.The matter was covered in detail by TOI.""The Thane-end of the tunnel will be extended by 200 metres towards the boundary wall of Shree Satya Shankar society, closer to Ghodbunder Highway. This realignment will bring much-needed relief from traffic congestion for locals,"" Shinde announced following a meeting with representatives from the MMRDA, the municipal corporation, and resident delegations in Mumbai.An MMRDA official explained, ""The tunnel entry and exit will now be underground until it reaches beyond the residential zone. The road will remain approximately five meters underground. Either the cut-and-cover method or box tunnelling will be used. The six-lane highway will emerge 50 meters past the Shree Satya Shankar society compound wall, near the Thane-end toll plaza ahead of the Ghodbunder junction.""Before finalizing the new alignment, 12 alternative routes were evaluated. A detailed route map, along with revised cost estimates, will be released at a later stage, officials said.""We're pleased that the key demands raised by the Mullabaug Project Affected People have been addressed,"" said Nitin Singh, a resident of one of the affected societies."," MMRDA will realign Thane-end entry and exit points of the twin tunnel highway to Borivili through a covered route.

Farmers dump mangoes onstreets after prices crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/farmers-dump-mangoes-onstreets-after-prices-crash/articleshow/121786153.cms,"



Bengaluru/Kolar: Protests erupted in Srinivaspura–India's Mango Capital – located 90 km from Bengaluru, Wednesday following a sudden crash in mango prices. With the king of fruits commanding little respect in the market, distraught farmers across Kolar district took to the streets, demanding a support price and withdrawal of the ban imposed by the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh on Karnataka mangoes. The growers poured several quintals of mangoes on the streets and staged a protest.Fighting the vagaries of weather that cast a dark spell on mango production, the farmers were hopeful of recovering their expenses with whatever was left on the trees. However, with the crash in mango prices, both the farmers and traders incurred losses. ""At the beginning of the season, we were dismayed by the delayed flowering and subsequently the crop was debilitated due to the extreme heat, and now the early onset of monsoon has wreaked havoc across the region. Not much is left for us to take home,"" bemoaned Ravishankar Reddy, a mango farmer in Srinivaspur taluk.With the crop cultivated over 45,000 hectares of area, Kolar supplies more than half of Karnataka's mangoes, and Srinivasapura, with over 35 varieties of the fruit, is known as India's mango capital. But unlike previous years, the prices of mangoes dropped to as low as Rs 3,000-4,000 per tonne.""It used to be around Rs 10,000-12,000 per tonne all these years during this time of the season.In the retail market, 1 kg of mango is sold for Rs 8-10 now! With nearly 40% of the crop awaiting harvest, the price crash has pushed farmers to the wall,"" lamented Bayya Reddy, another farmer.With a similar situation unfolding in Andhra Pradesh, the border districts of that state refused to allow the transportation of mangoes from Karnataka. This added to the woes of Karnataka farmers, forcing them to shut down the entire taluk Wednesday demanding stability in market prices and free trade across borders. The day-long bandh by the Srinivaspur Mango Growers Association evoked a total response, with all establishments remaining completely closed throughout the day.""The mango market at Srinivaspur gets about 900-1,000 tonnes of mangoes every day, with the demand lasting till July. But this season, there are hardly any takers due to a lack of demand in both Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, where mango pulp processing industries thrive,"" explained Munishamappa, a farmer from Kolar.""The mango season in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh begins after the harvest in Kolar. However, most of the pulp processing factories in these states did not even use 50% of their stock last year due to a drop in exports, triggered by a steep rise in air cargo charges. Similar is the situation in Srinivaspur taluk. This has affected the overall purchase of mangoes. Besides, the quality of mangoes has also taken a hit this year due to the early onset of monsoon,"" explained a technical officer of the Karnataka State Mango Board.Sensing the farmers' anguish, Kolar deputy commissioner MR Ravi held a meeting with the farmers and promised them that the district administration would persuade pulp processing units to purchase mangoes, besides exploring other options to stabilise prices in the market. Kolar MP Muniswamy also urged the state govt to announce a minimum support price for mangoes in Karnataka.——-Box:Govt may announce MSPHorticulture minister SS Mallikarjun acknowledged the crisis across the mango belt of Karnataka and said he discussed the issue with chief minister Siddaramaiah. ""We have asked the CM to announce a minimum support price for mangoes. But this would require additional funds, and the finance department headed by the CM must approve our proposal. Currently, the MSP for mangoes is around Rs 3 per kg, and the govt may increase it by Rs 1-2 over the next few days,"" Mallikarjun said.(With inputs from Manya Lama)","Kolar district supplies more than half of Karnataka's mangoes.

Why Tesla has not paid Elon Musk

What’s next for Elon Musk’s pay?

Despite being one of the most influential figures in the tech and automotive industries, Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Musk’s compensation structure has been a subject of debate for years. His 2018 pay package, which was designed to grant him stock options based on Tesla’s performance milestones, was twice struck down in court, leaving him without formal compensation. While Tesla’s valuation has skyrocketed—growing over 2,000% in the past seven years—Musk has not received a paycheck during this period.As mentioned above, Elon Musk’s salary package was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018. As part of the agreement his entire compensation was tied to the company’s overall performance and market capitalisation milestones.Under this structure, Musk was granted stock options that would vest only if Tesla hit specific, escalating targets for market capitalisation, revenue, and adjusted EBITDA. Over the years, as Tesla's valuation soared and it met many of these goals, the package became immensely valuable, potentially making it the largest compensation deal in corporate history.The legal battle over Musk’s $56 billion stock award has prevented Tesla from issuing him compensation. Courts have ruled that the approval process for his pay package was flawed, leading to its rejection despite shareholder support.Musk himself has acknowledged the situation, stating that he has worked without pay for years. However, with Tesla facing market volatility and leadership concerns, some experts argue that it may be time to restructure his compensation to ensure stability and long-term commitment.Tesla’s board is now weighing options for a new compensation plan. Some analysts suggest a performance-based stock package, while others argue Musk should receive a traditional CEO salary to align with industry standards.","Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies.

Transfer Darbar: Out-of-the-box 'open house transfers' system by UP Irrigation Department,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/transfer-darbar-out-of-the-box-open-house-transfers-system-by-up-irrigation-department/articleshow/121792236.cms,"Transfer darbar, face-to-face forum where engineers confront ministers and officials to secure fair postings.





LUCKNOW: In the corridors of Uttar Pradesh’s bureaucracy, where whispers of bribe rackets have long tainted government postings, an interesting but bold experiment is unfolding.The Irrigation Department, under Jal Shakti Minister Swatantra Dev Singh along with state ministers Dinesh Khateek and Ramkesh Nishad, has thrown open its doors with an innovative ‘transfer darbar’—a transparent, face-to-face forum where engineers confront ministers and officials to secure fair postings.Being conducted at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Parikalp Bhavan in Lucknow, this open house system is promising to dismantle a culture where plum postings allegedly cost several lakhs.On Wednesday, minister Swatantra, flanked by the two state ministers oversaw the darbar, finalizing transfers for 292 JEs and 182 AEs in the civil wing. Another 75 AEs await their fate on Thursday, with executive engineers next. This follows a session last month where 500 mechanical engineers were reassigned, reflecting the department’s scale: 3,115 JEs and 1,400 AEs statewide.Unlike the secretive, cash-driven transfers of yore, engineers now submit three posting preferences in public, engaging directly with decision-makers.“It’s an out-of-the-box idea to uproot the bribe racket,” Swatantra Dev Singh told TOI. “However, the transfer darbar is also a way to create an opportunity for engineers and push them out of their comfort zone, to switch into a new wing where they could learn new expertise to run the department efficiently in case of crises,” he added.Irrigation department has three primary branches including a wing for design, planning, research, second wing for operating canals and third flood control.Among AEs summoned for transfer darbar, two stories stood out: Indrasen Verma, battling liver cirrhosis, and Sanjay Kumar Sachan, both emblematic of a system ripe for reform.Indrasen, from Ambedkar Nagar, has served as AE in Mirzapur’s research and implementation section for years, his health deteriorating under the strain of liver disease. Sanjay, from Kanpur Dehat, remained untouched by transfers for three decades in Farrukhabad’s irrigation section, a sign of stagnation often linked to malpractice.Indrasen was retained in Mirzapur on humanitarian grounds, sparing him a grueling relocation. Sanjay, nearing retirement, was directed to move out of Farrukhabad, for a fresh start for his final service leg.Principal Secretary Irrigation and Water Resources, Anil Garg hailed the process as a game-changer. “We’re the only department with such an open, transparent posting system. It’s designed to weed out the bribe culture. We will see the result of this idea in the coming months,” he added.","The Irrigation Department, under Jal Shakti Minister Swatantra Dev Singh, has thrown open its doors with an innovative ‘transfer darbar’ The open house system is promising to dismantle a culture where plum postings allegedly cost several lakhs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121792231,imgsize-1051919,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/121792231.jpg"
"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

NEW DELHI: Contrary to earlier speculations that Raj was the main conspirator, sources now suggest he might have been used as a pawn in a bigger plan.They suspect Sonam was planning to elope with someone else, and Raj, unaware of the larger game, ended up facilitating her escape.Investigators probing the murder of Indore transporter Raja Raghuvanshi during his honeymoon in Meghalaya now believe Sonam Raghuvanshi — the victim’s wife — may have orchestrated the entire plot.Senior police officials monitoring the interrogation of all accused said Sonam appears to have manipulated each of them, luring Raj with promises of love and possibly offering others financial incentives.“Sonam appears to have manipulated each one of them, luring Raj through promises of love and possibly enticing others with financial gains,” a senior officer said.Crime branch officials believe Sonam had planned her disappearance in advance. She had allegedly arranged for a flat in Indore where she intended to stay after the murder.She selected the location herself, made the payments, and ensured the hideout remained a secret — even from her co-accused.Interestingly, no one apart from Sonam seems to know the address of this flat. Even those involved in the case are believed to have been kept in the dark.Officials now suspect Sonam remained in Indore for most of the time while her family staged protests and police teams searched for her across states.When she realised the plan was beginning to unravel, she allegedly asked Raj to book her a cab and fled to Uttar Pradesh — where she was eventually traced on June 8.“Raj made payments to cab driver who dropped Sonam in UP on June 6,” an officer said.Indore crime branch officials confirmed they still do not have the exact location of the flat where Sonam stayed while on the run.Sonam briefly switched on her mobile phone near a highway dhaba in Ghazipur on June 9, exposing her location, a UP police officer said.Though the phone was quickly switched off, surveillance cells had already begun tracking her coordinates.""Sonam avoided her own phone after Raja's murder, using borrowed devices to contact Raj Kushwaha and others,"" the officer said.""Before calling her brother from the dhaba owner's phone, she turned on her phone — likely to note a relative's number. This triggered an SOS from Meghalaya and MP police, who alerted us.""The alert helped local teams zero in on the dhaba, leading to her eventual detention.Investigators said Sonam had purchased three phones in Indore — a basic keypad handset and two Android models — using identity documents of co-accused Anand Kurmi.""Raj helped arrange the purchase,"" the officer said.Police verified the purchases through logbook entries at an Indore mobile shop, which matched details in their records.All three phones and their SIM cards were allegedly destroyed in Meghalaya, in what police believe was a deliberate attempt to wipe out digital footprints and evade detection.","Investigators probing the murder of Indore transporter Raja Raghuvanshi now believe Sonam may have orchestrated the entire plot.

The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it was making an immediate policy change for green card applicants, keeping in mind the issue of public health. The previous policy was introduced just over a year ago, but now the new rule will be applicable from June 11. What is the new rule? Every new application for a green card requires a new medical examination form. Suppose an application was withdrawn or rejected earlier. The new application of the same person would now require a new medical examination form. But per the existing rule, the medical form remained valid for indefinite time.""Form I-693, Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record, signed by a civil surgeon on or after Nov. 1, 2023, is only valid while the application the Form I-693 was submitted with is pending.

""We have since determined that the April 4, 2024, policy is overly broad and could potentially threaten public health in the United States.

In a country where expatriates make up nearly 90% of the population, the UAE’s latest Emiratisation push marks a decisive turn. Emiratisation, the policy of integrating UAE nationals into the workforce, especially the private sector, has been a cornerstone of national planning since its launch in 2000. Now, with fresh quotas targeting up to 60% Emirati representation in insurance sector by 2030, the government is signalling a clear intent to reshape workforce dynamics with long-term sustainability in mind.Emiratisation, also known as Tawteen, refers to the strategic initiative by the UAE government aimed at increasing the participation of UAE nationals in the workforce, especially in the private sector. This initiative reflects a long-term national vision embedded in broader frameworks like UAE Centennial 2071, designed to enhance the nation's sustainability, competitiveness, and knowledge-based economy.Despite being a wealthy and economically diversified country, the UAE has historically relied heavily on expatriate labor. With expatriates accounting for up to 90% of the population, native Emiratis have been significantly underrepresented in the private sector workforce. To bridge this gap, Emiratisation was launched in 2000, applying across the UAE (except Free Zones), and has seen more success in public institutions than in private enterprise.To address this imbalance, the Emirati Human Resources Competitiveness Council, known as Nafis, was established to spearhead Emiratisation in private sectors. Nafis offers incentives to companies, support to Emiratis, and monitors compliance. However, challenges persist, including instances of ""fake Emiratisation,"" where companies employ Emiratis merely to meet quotas without assigning real responsibilities, a practice the government strictly penalizes.In a significant policy development, the UAE has announced new Emiratisation goals for the insurance sector, aiming for 50% to 60% localisation by the year 2030, depending on the size of the company. This forms part of the government's Emiratisation strategy for 2027–2030, which sets differentiated targets for leadership roles and critical functions within insurance firms.The announcement was made by Mohamed Al Husaini, UAE Minister of State for Financial Affairs, during a Federal National Council (FNC) session on Wednesday, June 11, 2025. His statement came in response to a question raised by FNC member Adnan Al Hammadi regarding the Central Bank's role in enforcing Emiratisation compliance in the insurance sector.As of June 1, 2025, the UAE insurance sector employs 2,159 Emiratis out of 9,773 employees, equating to an Emiratisation rate of 22.09%. This marks a steady improvement from 13.34% in 2022 and 21.64% in 2024.“The 2022–2026 strategy aims to increase localisation to 30 percent by 2026, growing about 3 percent annually,” said Mohamed Al Husaini, Minister of State for Financial Affairs, in a statement.The upcoming goals set further conditions:To ensure these goals are met and to curb fraudulent practices, the Central Bank has set up a dedicated Supervision and Inspection Unit. This unit has the authority to impose fines of AED 60,000 on companies found to be missing Emirati hires, calculated as AED 20,000 per violation point.Beyond enforcement, a significant emphasis has been placed on human capital development:Training fields include:In 2023, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Ministry of Presidential Affairs and the Emirates Institute of Finance to offer 100 annual scholarships in actuarial science. As of now, nine Emiratis have been selected to study in the United States and Australia under this initiative.The minister also announced future plans to further bolster educational opportunities in this field:Collaborations are underway with institutions such as:","Emiratis now hold 22% of insurance jobs, up from 13% in 2022, as the UAE targets 50–60% localisation by 2030. At least one Emirati must be hired annually in job categories with 2 to 19 employees. A bachelor’s degree programme in actuarial science will launch in September 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121787817,imgsize-1389312,width-400,resizemode-4/121787817.jpg"

Why Armenia Made the Change



A Growing Destination for UAE Travellers







Starting July 1, 2025, UAE residents will be eligible for visa-free entry to Armenia, as confirmed by Khaleej Times. Currently, only UAE nationals can travel without a visa, while residents must obtain a visa on arrival. The upcoming change will remove this requirement, marking a significant shift in regional travel access.The new policy will apply to residency visa holders with documents valid for at least six months, allowing eligible UAE residents to enter Armenia without a visa once the update takes effect.Under the new policy, UAE residents can travel to Armenia for purposes such as:Under the new policy, UAE residents will be allowed to stay in Armenia for up to 90 days within any 180-day period, without needing a visa.This change aligns UAE residency with that of other regions such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the European Union (EU), the Schengen Area, and the United States—all of which are already part of Armenia’s expanded visa-free travel programme.The policy applies to anyone holding a valid residency permit from any of the six GCC countries: the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar. Expanding the scheme to residents “broadens the accessibility for a substantial segment of the GCC expatriate communities,” the country’s Tourism Committee said on Wednesday.The decision was finalized during an Armenian cabinet meeting last month. As reported by state news agency Armenpress, the visa reform is part of Armenia’s broader strategy to boost tourism and attract foreign investments.By easing access for residents of high-mobility countries and economic hubs, Armenia hopes to position itself as a more accessible and attractive destination for both short-term tourism and longer-term opportunities.Situated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Armenia has become an increasingly popular destination for UAE-based travellers, especially among expatriates. The country offers a rich mix of historical landmarks, natural beauty, and vibrant urban culture. Top attractions include the capital city Yerevan, the scenic Lake Sevan, and Dilijan National Park, known for its lush forests and hiking trails. Armenia is also home to several ancient monasteries such as Geghard, Khor Virap, and Haghpat, which are major draws for history and architecture enthusiasts. With direct flights from airlines like flydubai, Air Arabia, and Wizz Air, and now visa-free access for UAE residents, the country is more accessible than ever.","Residents of any of the GCC countries will gain visa-free access to Armenia starting July 1, 2025.

As anticipation builds for the Dh25 million (about $6.8 million) Big Ticket grand prize draw on July 3, five lucky individuals have already secured a windfall of Dh150,000($40,800) each in the latest round of winnings, among them, several Indian expatriates who have spent years in the UAE building lives, working hard, and hoping for a breakthrough.This month’s Big Ticket Abu Dhabi draw turned dreams into reality for a delivery rider, a businessman, a former UAE shop owner, and other long-time residents who placed their bets with persistence, patience, and a dash of hope.Abdulla Pulikkoor Mohammed, a 34-year-old delivery rider from Kerala, has been living in Abu Dhabi for the past nine years, supporting his family back in India. Despite having purchased only six Big Ticket entries, he hit the jackpot this time, sharing the winning ticket with a group of 12 friends.“Receiving the winning call made me feel happy. I plan to split the prize money with my friends and use my share to clear some loans,” he told“Big Ticket is truly doing wonders, and I believe everyone should take part.”His win is a reflection of how even modest participation, when shared and consistent, can lead to big rewards.Another Indian expat, Salihrahman Pallipadath, a 37-year-old businessman, has been living in Ajman for 15 years with his family.Though he first learned about Big Ticket two years ago, he only started buying tickets seven months ago, also as part of a group of 11 friends.“Receiving the winning call was a great experience – I’m truly happy,” Pallipadath said.“I plan to use the prize money to renew my company visa. I’ll continue purchasing from Big Ticket, and I encourage others to do the same. It’s a luck-based raffle, and everyone should keep trying.”His story is one of perseverance and optimism, especially significant in the face of everyday business pressures and long-term responsibilities as a UAE-based entrepreneur.Babulal Gautam, a 68-year-old from Mumbai, India, is another Big Ticket success story. He lived in Sharjah in 2014, where he ran a shop before returning to Mumbai. He’s been buying Big Ticket entries for ten years, a full decade of trying that finally paid off.“I actually missed the winning call, but I saw the email and was overjoyed. I kept checking and rechecking to make sure it was real. After a whole decade of trying, it finally happened,” he said.Known for his practical outlook, Gautam shared a piece of advice for hopefuls:“I’m more of a scientific person and don’t believe in luck much, so I believe the first step to winning is to simply buy a ticket.”His long journey with the raffle is a reminder of the patience and persistence that many expats maintain in the face of uncertain rewards.Also among the Dh150,000 prize winners is Shaji Memana, another Indian expat originally from Kerala. Memana bought his winning ticket online, and the news of his win came as an unexpected joy.The next major Big Ticket event is the live grand prize draw on July 3, where the staggering Dh25 million jackpot will be awarded. In addition to the main prize, three winners will take home Dh75,000 each.Leading up to the grand event, Big Ticket will also hold weekly E-draws, with upcoming dates as follows:With decades-long participation from the Indian community, especially among expats, Big Ticket continues to hold deep emotional and financial appeal.

Emaar secures naming rights









Dubai is set to claim another world record, this time in its public transportation network. The city will soon be home to the world’s highest metro station, standing at an impressive 74 metres, as part of the newly unveiled Dubai Metro Blue Line.The foundation stone for this ambitious infrastructure project was recently laid by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. During the ceremony, Sheikh Mohammed also approved the architectural design of the flagship Emaar Properties Station, which will be the tallest metro station in the world.Designed by the globally acclaimed American architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), whose portfolio includes iconic structures like the Burj Khalifa, Sears Tower in Chicago, and the Olympic Tower in New York, the station is a modern gateway to the future. Its striking architecture is inspired by the concept of a ""crossing gateway"", aligning seamlessly with the urban identity and forward-looking vision of Dubai.Spanning an area of approximately 11,000 square metres, the Emaar Properties Station is not just about height. It is engineered to accommodate a staggering 160,000 passengers per day, with projections indicating that over 70,000 daily users will commute through the station by 2040.The interior design reflects a fusion of luxury, tradition, and innovation. Warm, earthy textures meet high-end materials such as Jura limestone, bronze metal wall panels, and granite flooring. Glass ceiling panels at the lobby and platform levels invite natural light, creating an open and inclusive atmosphere.The materials were carefully selected for durability, environmental efficiency, and cultural resonance—blending stone, bronze, and glass to embody Dubai’s identity. The station is designed to withstand the emirate’s operational and climatic demands, reinforcing its long-term sustainability and resilience.Once complete, the Dubai Metro Blue Line will significantly extend the emirate’s transit system, increasing the total length of the rail network to 131 km, and the number of stations to 78, served by 168 trains (including 11 tram trains and 157 metro trains).The Metro’s expansion mirrors the city’s dramatic population and ridership growth. Since its launch on September 9, 2009, Dubai Metro has carried over 2.527 billion passengers, with 900,000 daily riders recorded in 2024 alone.Ridership stats reveal a steady climb:Studies indicate this upward trend will continue, with ridership projected to exceed 300 million in 2026 and reach 320 million by 2031.The number of stations and trains has expanded in tandem:This makes the Blue Line not just a symbol of vertical ambition but also a key component in easing congestion and supporting the city’s mobility masterplan.In a major branding move, Emaar Properties has acquired the naming rights for the signature station. Announced during the foundation ceremony, the station will be officially known as Emaar Properties Station for 10 years, starting from its inauguration in 2029.The Dubai government confirmed that further announcements about naming rights for other stations along the Blue Line will follow in the next phase.The Emaar Properties Station, with its record-breaking height and world-class design, sets a new benchmark for urban transport infrastructure, blending aesthetics, efficiency, and vision. As Dubai continues to break boundaries, this project stands as a tangible symbol of its commitment to smart mobility and architectural excellence.","Dubai's Blue Line will feature the world's tallest metro station, standing at 74 metres.

Bridging policy gaps in early education





A nationwide push to prioritise Arabic

In Dubai, the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) rolled out a policy in February 2025 requiring Arabic instruction for all children from birth to age six in private schools and early childhood centres.





In Sharjah, Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi , Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, decreed in November 2024 that Arabic become the medium of instruction in all government nurseries. He also stressed early education’s role in supporting children’s development, nutrition, and wellbeing.







Abu Dhabi’s Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK) has announced a landmark policy requiring all private and educational partnership schools to dedicate four hours (240 minutes) per week to Arabic language instruction for children in early childhood education, starting from the 2025–2026 academic year.The mandate applies to all early years levels, from nursery (pre-KG) to KG2 (second year), and will increase to five hours weekly (300 minutes) starting in 2026–2027, ADEK confirmed.While the directive enforces instructional time, ADEK emphasises that the goal goes far beyond curriculum metrics. “This is about more than just adding Arabic lessons,” said Mariam Al Hallami, Executive Director of Early Education at ADEK.“It’s about giving every child in Abu Dhabi the gift of language, identity, and connection starting from day one. We want Arabic to feel natural, interactive and alive in every classroom and every home,” she added.The policy’s timing is deliberate: backed by research showing that early childhood is the most effective period for language acquisition, the strategy aims to root Arabic as a living, thriving language in children’s daily lives, both at school and at home.ADEK highlighted that although Arabic is commonly spoken at home in Abu Dhabi, many children still lack the confidence to use it fluently. The initiative is designed to close that gap by ensuring consistent, quality instruction through immersive methods and active family engagement.To meet diverse classroom needs, the program will follow two dedicated learning tracks:The instruction will be delivered through interactive, age-appropriate techniques, including:To ensure quality, schools will employ specially trained teachers and use modern learning resources. Schools are also encouraged to build strong school-home connections, sharing tools and activities to keep children engaged with Arabic even outside the classroom.The initiative aligns with ADEK’s broader goals to harmonise Arabic instruction between nurseries, currently regulated under its Early Education Institutions (EEI) policies, and Cycle 1 education, which is governed by the Ministry of Education.By standardising Arabic exposure across all early education providers, Abu Dhabi is aiming to build language skills, foster cultural belonging, and ensure that children are well-prepared as they transition to formal schooling.Abu Dhabi’s new policy is part of a wider national effort to revitalise Arabic language learning from birth to school age, with similar actions now being taken in other emirates:This bold move by Abu Dhabi reflects a strategic cultural investment: reinforcing Arabic not just as a language subject, but as a core identity marker for the next generation, native and non-native speakers alike.","Abu Dhabi to mandate 4 hours of Arabic weekly for KG students to boost early fluency and cultural identity. The mandate applies to all early years levels, from nursery (pre-KG) to KG2 (second year) The initiative is designed to close that gap by ensuring consistent, quality instruction through immersive methods.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121730918,imgsize-894796,width-400,resizemode-4/121730918.jpg"

Global architecture and design firm Gensler has released its 2025 Global Workplace Survey, delivering an in-depth look at what office workers want, and aren't getting, in the United Arab Emirates. Marking its twentieth edition, the survey drew insights from more than 16,800 full-time office workers across 15 countries, including a focused sample from the UAE.The survey findings come at a crucial moment as the UAE pushes forward on national priorities such as the “We the UAE 2031” vision and the National Strategy for Wellbeing. With this momentum in mind, the report provides a practical roadmap for employers and developers aiming to build future-ready workspaces aligned with innovation, talent attraction, and sustainable growth.“The UAE has become a global benchmark for ambition and adaptability,” said Edith Eddy, Senior Interior Designer, Workplace, at Gensler Middle East.“In cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi, we are witnessing rapid shifts in how people live and work, and the workplace must evolve accordingly. Our research reveals a clear gap between what employees need to thrive — flexibility, creativity, and connection, and what their current spaces provide.Bridging this gap will be essential for organisations aiming to attract talent, foster innovation, and design workplaces that truly support the future of work in the Emirates. ”Despite heavy post-pandemic investment in upgraded office spaces across the UAE, including new, in-demand office buildings in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, only 31% of UAE office workers strongly agree that their current workspace enables them to do their best work, according to Gensler. This places the UAE ahead of France and Japan, but behind the UK, India, and the United States in workplace satisfaction.Common pain points remain:Top improvement areas identified by employees include:A lot of noise is rated as the biggest concern voiced by UAE office staff about their workplacesOne of the report’s most striking insights is the shifting vision for what an ideal workplace looks like. Only 15% of UAE workers said their ideal workplace is a formal “business hub,” even though 29% said that describes their current environment.Instead, there’s a marked preference for:“This reflects a global trend away from rigid corporate settings,” the Gensler report states. The UAE is now ranked among the top five countries worldwide where employees show a strong preference for imaginative and wellness-focused workspaces.While flexible work is valued, UAE employees still see the office as essential. Respondents said 67% of their ideal workweek should be spent in the office, well above the global average of 60%. Yet actual attendance is lower, largely because current office setups aren’t meeting employee needs.Top reasons for in-office attendance include:However, only 28% of UAE workers believe their meeting spaces are adequately equipped to support these functions.Gensler’s survey also looked beyond the office walls. UAE employees showed a stronger-than-global-average preference for certain amenities both inside and around the workplace.Most valued in-office amenities:Preferred surrounding neighbourhood features:These preferences signal a broader desire for community-integrated, holistic work environments that support both professional productivity and personal wellbeing.","Only 31% of UAE office workers strongly agree that their current workspace enables them to do their best work.
