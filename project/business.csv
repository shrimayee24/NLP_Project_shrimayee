NEW DELHI: Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has dismissed media reports suggesting delays in the manufacturing of Vande Bharat sleeper train due to resign clearance problems. Addressing the media on Thursday, Vaishnaw said that the design process was never an issue with the Russian firm Transmasholding (TMH), contracted to produce the train sets.Earlier reports claimed Indian Railways requested design modifications, including the addition of toilets and pantry cars, which allegedly delayed the ministry’s approval of the revised design.Vaishnaw refuted these claims, saying the delays were actually due to TMH’s limited manufacturing capacity , as the company is accustomed to producing trains with only six to eight coaches—standard in Russia.The minister clarified that Indian Railways had provided TMH with the Vande Bharat design and explicitly specified the requirement for train sets with 16, 20, or 24 coaches, reflecting India’s larger population and higher passenger demand .""The firm doesn't have experience to manufacture a train set of more than six or eight coaches. We had clearly told them that we will give them design of Vande Bharat to follow. What they need is more manufacturing teams,"" Vaishnaw said.He added, ""I want to clarify that when the contract was signed, it clearly said that they have to manufacture train sets with coaches 16/20/24.""Vaishnaw also mentioned that some routes in India require 24-coach trains, while others need 16-coach configurations, and TMH was initially unprepared to meet these demands. He added that the issues have been resolved, and production will commence soon.The minister reiterated Indian Railways’ commitment to the timely execution of the project and expressed confidence in TMH’s ability to adapt to the unique requirements of India’s rail network.The contract requires TMH to manufacture 1,920 sleeper coaches , crucial for the expansion of the Vande Bharat fleet.","Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw dismissed media reports suggesting delays in the manufacturing of Vande Bharat sleeper train due to resign clearance problems.

NAVI MUMBAI: India’s first largescale ocean floor cleanup operation was launched in Maharashtra’s Sindhudurg coral reefs Wednesday, with seven certified scuba divers collecting around 250kg of non-biodegradable waste from the seabed. This pioneering initiative to restore marine biodiversity and ecosystems, led by state agencies and involving several NGOs, targeted a 150m radius near Sindhudurg Fort. The cleanup involved careful extraction, bundling, and disposal of mainly discarded or lost nylon fishing nets, which are complicated further by underwater challenges.Maharashtra-based senior scientist Ashok Kadam of Fisheries Survey of India told TOI, “This is the first ocean floor cleanup drive to be organised by govt and private bodies together. The programme was conceptualised by ministry of environment, forest, and climate change to raise awareness about our ocean conservation and keeping our coasts clean, plastic free. Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and fisheries department have taken the lead in this regard.” The initiative was led by MPCB, Fisheries Survey of India (Mumbai base), NGO Vanashakti along with local partners like state fisheries department, Malvan Nagar Parishad, Neelkranti, Youth Beats for Environment, Maharashtra Maritime Board, and Malvan Tourist Group.Kadam further said that the Union ministry has earmarked funds of around Rs 40 crore for conducting awareness programmes with regards to keeping our oceans and coasts clean. School and college students will also be involved in future cleanup drives, he added.Marine debris, including ghost nets abandoned or lost during fishing operations, often drifts with ocean currents, entangling corals and devastating marine life. “Additionally, these ghost nets detract from the natural beauty of the region, impacting tourism in Malvan, a hotspot for coral reef exploration and marine education,” said environmentalist D Stalin of Vanashakti.

If the Indian team travels, why is this not good?"" the RJD leader said.The controversy arises from India’s refusal to participate in the tournament, citing security concerns. This decision has led to a stalemate between the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), with the ICC yet to find a resolution. The Champions Trophy, scheduled for February 19 to March 9, 2025, has been overshadowed by growing political tensions, further worsened by recent instability in Pakistan.On Tuesday, Sri Lanka’s A team withdrew from their tour of Pakistan mid-series due to unrest in Islamabad, fuelling concerns among other cricketing nations about safety. This has strengthened the case for either a hybrid model, where some matches are played in neutral venues, or relocating the entire tournament outside Pakistan. However, PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi remains firm on hosting the event, dismissing the hybrid model and calling for equality in cricketing relations. “Our stance is clear. If we play in India, they should play here,” he said.The PCB has urged the ICC for clarity on India’s objections, emphasising that decisions must prioritise the sport's interests. The ICC Board is expected to meet on November 29 to address the impasse, with Pakistan insisting that any resolution respects the principle of fairness.","RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav criticises India's decision to skip the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in Pakistan.

However, the deal has recently drawn scrutiny amid allegations by the US that Adani Group bribed officials at SECI to secure favourable contracts and advantages in renewable energy auctions. Both Adani Group and SECI have denied any wrongdoing.Former CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, during whose tenure the deal was signed, refuted allegations of bribery. The current TDP-BJP govt under CM N Chandrababu Naidu is currently weigh ing its options on scrapping the deal, while also aiming to avoid burdening citizens. Kumar said, the PSA is a legally binding agreement, and any move to cancel it without valid reasons could lead to litigation and hefty compensation.Sources in the energy department said there are no specific allegations against SECI or its officials. The PSA was exclusively between SECI and the discoms, not with private firms such as Adani Group. Still, officials have been instructed to seek legal opinions and prepare a list of potential actions, including the possibility of a probe into the alleged bribery angle.","In 2020, AP discoms signed an agreement to procure 7,000MW of solar power from SECI.

Over 140 candidates belonging to the economically weaker section (annual family income less than Rs 8 lakh) have chosen postgraduate seats in clinical specialties from the management and NRI quotas of private medical colleges for which tuition fees alone range from Rs 25 lakh to over Rs 90 lakh per annum. This has led to many aspirants questioning how these candidates managed to get the EWS certificate if they could afford to pay over a crore for a threeyear postgraduate course. The first round of allotment of postgraduate seats in medical colleges was announced on Nov 20.Out of more than 24,600 seats allotted in this round, 135 seats from the management quota in private medical colleges have been allotted to candidates who registered as EWS. Eight NRI seats have been allotted to EWS candidates.For instance, an MS Orthopaedics seat in the management quota of Sri Lakshmi Narayana Institute of Medical sciences in Puducherry, for which the tuition fee comes up to Rs 1.6 crore for the entire course, has been allotted to an EWS candidate.

"Kerala, Adani arm ink supplementary pact on port project",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-adani-arm-ink-supplementary-pact-on-port-project/articleshow/115787320.cms,"Now handling 4.5 million containers, Vizhinjam port will be southern India’s largest freight terminal

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala signed Thursday a supplementary concession agreement with Adani Vizhinjam Port Pvt Ltd , paving the way for earlier-than-expected revenue gains from Vizhinjam deep-water international seaport near Thiruvananthapuram. The Rs 7,700-crore port, built as a public-private partnership with Adani Group , is now set to be fully operational by Dec 2028.“With the capacity expansion to be completed by Dec 2028, the port’s total revenue projection has increased from Rs 54,750 crore to Rs 215,000 crore over the 36-year operational period. Govt’s revenue share will also increase from Rs 6,300 crore to Rs 35,000 crore,” minister for ports VN Vasavan said Thursday.The revised agreement ensures that the state will begin receiving its share of revenue from the project as originally planned in 2034, despite delays in construction. Under the previous pact, revenue sharing could have been delayed until 2039 due to project setbacks. The updated deal also broadens the revenue-sharing scope. Initially, the state was entitled to profits generated solely from the first phase of the port. Under the new terms, Adani Ports will share profits from all four phases starting in 2034.Indirect revenue for the state is projected to rise too. Kerala’s GST income from port operations is expected to total Rs 29,000 crore over the contract period. Corporate income tax revenue is also anticipated to grow. These changes will yield an additional Rs 48,000 crore in revenue, including the state’s share and GST over 36 years.

NEW DELHI: Should India ban the use of social media among children? With the Australian parliament passing a bill to ban social media use among children under 16, the question has gained a lot of traction. However, experts say, while the decision is well intended, it is difficult to implement.Recently, the American Psychological Association (APA) also issued a health advisory on social media use in adolescence, and it stated that excess or ""problematic social media use"" could impair the ability to engage in daily roles and routines among adolescents. It can also present risk for more serious psychological harms over time, the advisory said.Banning the use of social media among children is a welcome step but it will be difficult to implement a complete ban. ""There is a need for promotion of healthy use,"" Dr Rajesh Sagar, professor of psychiatry at AIIMS-Delhi, said.Dr Pramit Rastogi, child and adolescent psychiatrist at STEPS Center for Mental Health, said that the ban proposal captures the reality that children whose minds are not developed enough to have access to and to regulate screen-time are being given these devices without the necessary checks and balances in place.""Having said that, this will run into second order difficulties like development of unregulated and illegal social media channels. We should let the west first go through one iteration of this so that we can learn from it and then introduce the second generation level of social media ban. For example, inability to access mainstream social media on school premises, internet providers offering these parental controls at the provider level rather than individual device level checks and balances, which parents have to do right now,"" he said.According to Dr Roma Kumar, senior consultant psychologist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, widespread access to digital and social media has drastically altered the nature of adolescents' interpersonal connections. ""Depression, anxiety and suicidality have all sharply increased in adolescents over the past decade,"" she said.","Australian parliament passed a bill to ban social media use among children under 16.

NEW DELHI: Amid opposition uproar in Lok Sabha on Thursday, the House extended the tenure of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill till the last day of the Budget session next year. The Bill was earlier listed by the govt for discussion and passage in the ongoing winter session of Parliament.Barring the extension of the JPC's tenure, proceedings of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were almost washed out for the third day with opposition members demanding suspension of business to discuss allegations of corruption against the Adani group, the violence in UP's Sambhal and the continuing ethnic strife in Manipur.The Lower House was first adjourned for an hour soon after it assembled, and later at 12 noon, the Chair adjourned it for the day, after the extension of the JPC's tenure was approved by a voice vote.The JPC, headed by BJP's Jagdambika Pal, had reached a consensus to extend the tenure from Nov 29 to the last day of the budget session after opposition MPs walked out of the committee's meeting on Wednesday, when Pal had said the panel's report was ready for tabling in Parliament. While BJP has said the amendments proposed in the Bill will bring transparency and accountability in the functioning of Waqf boards, opposition parties have said they are targeted against the Muslim community and violate its religious rights.As the uproar continued in Lok Sabha, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju criticised the opposition members for not letting the House transact business, despite the govt cooperating with them on extending the JPC's tenure and agreeing to hold discussion on other issues. ""I condemn the attempts by Congress and its allies in disrupting House proceedings,"" he said.In Rajya Sabha, opposition MPs, including from Congress and CPM, had submitted 16 notices for adjournment of scheduled business under Rule 267, but chairperson Jagdeep Dhankhar rejected all of them. The Lok Sabha Speaker, too, rejected all adjournment motions moved by the opposition.""Parliamentary disruption is not a remedy, it's a malady. It weakens our foundation.

NEW DELHI: A day after Eknath Shinde said he would accept the BJP leadership’s decision on who should be next Maharashtra CM, Mahayuti partners got down to working out details of the govt, which is likely to be formed on Dec 2. Home minister Amit Shah met three chiefs of the alliance — Shinde, Devendra Fadnavis & Ajit Pawar — Thursday evening.BJP’s Fadnavis looked set to return as Mantralaya boss and the focus of talks at Shah’s residence was on devising ways to fit Shinde into his team as one of the two deputy CMs in a way where the pain of the loss of the top job was softened. Ajit Pawar is a certainty as the other deputy CM with finance portfolio.BJP is set on rehabilitating Devendra Fadnavis, something that would ""right the wrong"" that was done to him when he was made to play second fiddle for the party's sake. But it is equally desirous of Eknath Shinde joining the team as deputy chief minister in order to project the message of unity.Although Shinde had said that he would abide by the choice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, BJP wants him to feel valued. ""Besides, having him on its side will also help the party minimise its reliance on Ajit dada,"" a source reasoned.While many argued that after serving as CM, becoming deputy CM may not be acceptable to Shinde, sources said this was not an issue in Maharashtra politics, and cited the example of Fadnavis as well as several others, including some veterans. They also dismissed suggestions that having two Marathas as deputies may not go down well with voters, pointing out that the outgoing leadership team also had two Marathas - Shinde and Ajit Pawar.""I cleared my role in the press conference yesterday that there are no obstacles regarding CM of Mahayuti. This 'ladla bhai' has arrived in Delhi and the 'ladla bhai' is a designation higher than anything else for me. A meeting will be held on everything,"" Shinde said, reiterating his position amid some of his party colleagues still staking a claim for the top post for their boss.There is recognition of the need to appoint a BJP CM given that the party bagged 132 seats in the 288-member House, and has also got the support of five more MLAs, leaving it just eight short of the majority mark on its own.As reported by TOI on the day election results were announced on Nov 23, Ajit Pawar has conveyed his support to Fadnavis, reducing the manoeuvring space for Shinde's party. In any case, sources said the allies had jointly decided on seat allocation ahead of the polls and there was clear agreement on the issue.","BJP is set on rehabilitating Devendra Fadnavis, something that would ""right the wrong"" that was done to him when he was made to play second fiddle.

NEW DELHI: In his first reaction to the charges leveled against him, former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday dismissed allegations regarding the payment of bribes to Andhra Pradesh officials by the Adani Group for solar power purchases during his party-led government (19-24). The YSRCP chief said that the deal was purely between government agencies and claimed that there was no third party involved in the power purchase agreement with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).'The bribery charge is all hearsay, and nobody has said that I or anyone else has taken bribes,' he said, according to news agency PTI.The YSRCP chief defended the state's power deal with SECI, saying he had met Adani several times during his tenure as CM of Andhra Pradesh, adding that there was nothing 'unusual,' as it is ordinary for businessmen to meet heads of states.This comes after the US court's indictment order on Adani, which mentioned a high-ranking official of Andhra Pradesh allegedly being involved, and subsequent demands from opposition parties to reveal details of his alleged meeting with industrialist Gautam Adani.The YSRCP chief clarified that his name was not included in the US court's indictment and denied any claims of receiving incentives. ""Nowhere it mentions that incentives were offered to me because there is no way anybody can offer incentives to me, first of all. And businessmen meeting heads of states is not unusual. This in fact is an ordinary practice,"" he said.The former CM said that the power supply agreement with the SECI had resulted in the state saving over Rs 1 lakh crore over 25 years.Jagan also announced plans to file a defamation suit worth Rs 100 crore against certain local newspapers for allegedly distorting facts and publishing misleading stories on this matter.Recently, the US Department of Justice charged Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani for his alleged involvement in a long-running scheme to bribe Indian officials with substantial sums in exchange for favorable solar power contracts. The Adani Group has denied these allegations.""The allegations made by the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission against directors of Adani Green are baseless and denied. As stated by the US Department of Justice itself, ""the charges in the indictment are allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty."" All possible legal recourse will be sought. The Adani Group has always upheld and is steadfastly committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance, transparency and regulatory compliance across all jurisdictions of its operations. We assure our stakeholders, partners and employees that we are a law-abiding organisation, fully compliant with all laws,"" the Adani group said after allegations surfaced.On Wednesday, calling media reports of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) violations against the executives 'incorrect,' Adani Green Energy said in a statement that “media articles state that certain of our directors namely Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain have been charged with violation(s) of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in the indictment.

Australia passes law banning social media for children under 16,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-passes-law-banning-social-media-for-children-under-16/articleshow/115774949.cms,"Australian Senate on Thursday passed a world-first law banning children under 16 from using social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, with tech companies facing fines of up to AUD 50 million (£26 million) for non-compliance.The ban, designed to protect young people from online harm, has ignited a national debate. While advocates hail it as a vital step in addressing youth mental health issues, critics warn of privacy infringements and unintended consequences for vulnerable groups.The law seeks to address rising concerns about social media’s impact on youth mental health, particularly among teenage girls. Senator Sarah Henderson of the Liberal Party cited global trends linking social media use to mental health crises, stressing the urgency of regulation.However, critics, including Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, dismissed the legislation as out of touch. “This is boomers trying to tell young people how the internet should work,” she argued, adding that the year-long delay before enforcement undermines its credibility.Privacy advocates have also raised alarms about potential data misuse. The legislation prohibits platforms from demanding government-issued IDs for age verification but leaves unresolved questions about how age checks will be conducted without infringing on user privacy.While many countries have proposed social media age restrictions, Australia's absolute ban is among the most stringent. Critics argue it may alienate vulnerable groups, including LGBTQIA+ youth, who rely on online communities for support. The Australian Human Rights Commission voiced concerns about potential human rights infringements, warning of social exclusion for young people.Tech companies have also criticised the law as rushed and impractical. A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argued the legislation “ignores evidence” from child safety experts and imposes unrealistic demands on parents and teens.","The law seeks to address rising concerns about social media’s impact on youth mental health, particularly among teenage girls.

List of unsold player in IPL mega auction

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn. Notable names like David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, and Kane Williamson , who have been cornerstones in the IPL for years, found themselves without bids.Each had a base price of Rs 2 crore, but despite their immense experience and proven track records, none of them attracted offers. Their absence from the auction table raised questions, particularly given their global stature in T20 cricket. It’s a stark reminder of how the dynamics of the auction can sometimes overshadow established stars in favour of fresh talent.In addition to these marquee international names, other seasoned players like Shardul Thakur Ajinkya Rahane , and Glenn Phillips also went unsold. Rahane, a reliable middle-order batsman, and Thakur, an all-rounder with vast IPL experience, both entered the auction with a base price of Rs 1.5 crore, but failed to secure a contract.Similarly, Phillips, known for his explosive batting and wicketkeeping skills, and Thakur, a consistent bowler, were left out despite being integral parts of their national teams. This reflects the fierce competition in the auction, where franchises appear to be banking on younger, more explosive talent rather than experienced hands.Perhaps the most surprising snub was former U-19 captain Prithvi Shaw , who had once been considered one of India’s brightest young talents. With a modest base price of Rs 75 lakh, Shaw was expected to generate significant interest.However, despite his impressive domestic performances, Shaw failed to attract any buyers. This highlights a growing trend in the IPL, where franchises are increasingly looking for players who can deliver immediate impact, while the burden of expectation weighs heavily on players like Shaw, who have not yet lived up to their early promise.The unsold list also includes several uncapped players, such as Yash Dhull, Kartik Tyagi, and Piyush Chawla, who could have added value to any team. With base prices ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, these players were considered potential investments, but their inability to secure deals underscores the auction's unpredictable nature.As franchises continue to focus on emerging talent from India and abroad, the auction results serve as a reminder that the IPL is not just about star power but also about fitting the right players into the right roles, irrespective of their past achievements.","IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn.

SP Balasubrahmanyam ’s son SP Charan said that he and his family declined to grant permission for recreating the late singer’s voice using artificial intelligence (AI). In a recent interview with Vikatan, expressed his concerns against AI replication of singers’ voice, particularly the recreation of late singer Malaysia Vasudevan 's voice in Vettaiyan's Manasilaayo.He stated, “Malaysia Vasudevan sung brilliant songs such as Poongaatru Thirumbuma. You cannot replicate those songs. You can replicate the voice, but you cannot replicate the emotion that comes with listening to those songs nowadays.""SP Balasubrahmanyam is one of the legendary singers in Indian cinema. He passed away at the age of 74 in September 2020 due to cardio-respiratory arrest, following over a month of hospitalization.Stating that many have approached him seeking permission to use the legendary singer’s voice, he said “I vehemently say no. My family and myself do not want his voice to be heard in any Tom, Dick and Harry's music. Even if it's a responsible music director with a clarity in thoughts, I say no. He is there. Let him be.”While many composers see replicating a popular singer's voice using AI as a way to honor their legacy, SP Charan highlighted the downsides of this trend, explaining the ethical and emotional concerns surrounding it.“For example, Manasilaayo [from Vettaiyan] can be a great song. No hard feelings to anybody. It might be a great song. If SPB was alive today and if he had received that opportunity, he could have also said no to the song after listening to it. A singer has the right to choose whether he wants to sing the song or not. By AI, you are not giving the singer the opportunity. It's not right if all the songs can be sung by SPB or Malaysia Vasudevan because of the love you have for them.”","SP Balasubrahmanyam’s son SP Charan said that he and his family declined to grant permission for recreating the late singer's voice using artificial intelligence (AI) In a recent interview with Vikatan, expressed his concerns against AI replication of singers’ voice.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115772386,imgsize-17340,width-400,resizemode-4/115772386.jpg"

Rob Gronkowski skips FOX Sunday after Terry Bradshaw’s apology to honor $16 Billion company commitment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/rob-gronkowski-skips-fox-sunday-after-terry-bradshaws-apology-to-honor-16-billion-company-commitment/articleshow/115739306.cms,"Rob Gronkowski skips FOX Sunday after Terry Bradshaw’s apology to honor $16 Billion company commitment

Real reason behind Gronkowski’s absence from Fox NFL Sunday



Rob Gronkowski just might be retarded

Is there tension between Rob Gronkowski and Terry Bradshaw?



Rob Gronkowski ’s absence from Fox NFL Sunday this past week sparked rumors and speculation, especially after a playful jab from co-host Terry Bradshaw . Fans quickly wondered if the two were involved in some sort of on-air fallout. However, the truth behind Gronkowski ’s missing appearance is far simpler than the gossip suggests.Rob Gronkowski, former Patriots star, made headlines when he missed this Sunday’s Fox NFL Sunday broadcast. Speculation quickly swirled—did Terry Bradshaw’s recent jab at Gronk’s on-air analysis play a part in his absence? The two have co-hosted the show for two years, but this week, Gronk wasn’t there.The truth behind Gronkowski’s absence is much simpler and a bit less dramatic. He was actually in New Hampshire on November 24 to honor a commitment with Dick’s Sporting Goods, a date he’d set before the so-called ""beef"" with Bradshaw even happened. So, despite rumors, there was no falling-out or retirement plans at play here.Still, Bradshaw’s comment about Jimmy Johnson filling in for Gronk sparked curiosity. Johnson, who retired from his role last year, was replaced by Gronkowski two years ago, and his name resurfaced after Bradshaw’s November 17 remark about the four-time Super Bowl champion. The speculation about a rift between Bradshaw and Gronk was fueled, but it seems there’s no drama, just a prior commitment for Gronk.So, despite the chatter, Gronkowski’s absence had nothing to do with any tension with his co-host.Also Read: Andy Reid’s Chiefs highlight major TE injury as Travis Kelce struggles against NFL veteran After the Lions' dominant 52-6 victory over the Jaguars on November 17, the Fox NFL Sunday crew shared their thoughts on the game. Rob Gronkowski, a broadcaster for the show since 2022, highlighted how the Lions’ performance reflected Bill Belichick's philosophy of never underestimating an opponent.However, Terry Bradshaw couldn’t resist poking fun at Gronkowski’s analysis.“The guy whose seat you’re sitting in right now, while he’s on vacation” Bradshaw joked, referring to his absence.Gronkowski, slightly nervous, responded,“I’m part of the show, Terry, okay? Where are you going with that?” Bradshaw quickly backtracked, apologizing with, “I apologize Gronk, you know I love you.” (via: EssentiallySports)While the comment may have caught Gronk off guard, it was all in good fun—especially after the 35-year-old legend jokingly confirmed why his 76-year-old co-host sees him as a “part-time” worker due to his commitments to a $16 billion company.","Rob Gronkowski made headlines when he missed this Sunday’s Fox NFL Sunday broadcast.

Why BSE Sensex and Nifty50 crashed today:

Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, crashed in trade on Thursday. While BSE Sensex tanked over 1,300 points, Nifty50 went below 24,000. BSE Sensex ended the day at 79,043.74, down 1,190 points or 1.48%. Nifty50 closed the day at 23,914.15, down 361 points or 1.49%.Indian equity markets experienced a significant decline on Thursday, with both Sensex and Nifty dropping more than 1% due to IT sector selloff. The decline was influenced by uncertainties regarding U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's policies and U.S. interest rate decisions.The total market value of BSE-listed companies decreased by Rs 1.52 lakh crore to Rs 442.96 lakh crore, according to an ET report.Recent U.S. inflation data indicated slower-than-anticipated rate cuts, causing IT stocks to decline up to 4%. The Nifty IT index fell 2.3%, with LTTS, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, and HCL Tech showing notable losses.The Sensex decline was largely attributed to Infosys, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries, TCS, M&M, and HDFC Bank, which collectively contributed 570 points to the fall. Additional pressure came from Axis Bank, HCL Tech, and Bharti Airtel.The India VIX, which measures market volatility, increased by 4% to 15.22.Conversely, Adani Group shares showed significant gains, rising up to 9.3% following clarification that key executives were not charged under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in recent indictments.Adani Energy Solutions and Adani Total Gas led the gains with 9% and 9.3% increases respectively. Adani Green Energy rose 8.3%, reaching Rs 1,072. Other group companies, including Adani Power, Adani Enterprises, Adani Wilmar, and Adani Ports, increased by up to 5%.The group's market value increased by approximately $14 billion on Wednesday, recovering partially from the $34 billion loss experienced since the indictment through Tuesday.1) US consumer expenditure exceeded forecasts in October, triggering inflation worries. The spending increased by 0.4%, above the anticipated 0.3%, following September's adjusted 0.6% rise. Despite demonstrating economic strength, inflation remains higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% goal.Sustained inflation coupled with possible increased import duties could restrict the Federal Reserve's capacity to reduce interest rates in 2024.2) The Federal Reserve anticipates a third rate reduction in December, yet records from the November 6-7 Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed disagreements regarding future rate adjustments, causing investor unease.LSEG data indicates traders anticipate a 65% likelihood of a December rate cut, projecting total reductions of 75 basis points through 2025's end.3) The Nifty IT index declined by over 2.3% following US inflation reports suggesting slower rate reductions. Every Nifty IT component decreased, with LTTS and Infosys showing the largest drops at nearly 3.5%. HCL Tech, LTIMindtree, Mphasis, Tech Mahindra, and TCS experienced 2-3% decreases.US rate reduction delays affect consumer spending, subsequently impacting Indian IT sectors.4) Indian markets reflected Asian share declines amidst concerns over the Fed's careful approach to rate cuts following robust US inflation data.Market sentiment weakened due to potential tariff conflicts from US President-elect Trump's policies and Ukrainian city explosions.MSCI's Asia-Pacific share index excluding Japan decreased 0.4%. US markets declined previously, with S&P 500 dropping 0.38%, Nasdaq Composite falling 0.59%, and Dow Jones reducing 0.31%.5) Elevated US Treasury yields (10-year at 4.25%, 2-year at 4.23%) and strengthened US dollar (index at 106.39) pressure Indian equities . Higher yields enhance US asset attractiveness, prompting emerging market outflows.A stronger dollar increases foreign capital costs, reducing investment appeal.6) FIIs returned to Indian equities, purchasing Rs 11,100 crore worth stocks over three sessions, reversing 38 sessions of outflows.The third day showed reduced buying at Rs 7.78 crore, suggesting declining momentum.FPIs remain November's net sellers, reducing holdings by Rs 15,845 crore, following October's Rs 94,017 crore outflow. Year-to-date outflows total Rs 9,252 crore.7) Market pressure increased due to monthly expiry.""We have seen a lot of swings and market volatility. Of course, the monthly expiry cannot be ruled out. The factors still indicate that there will be mixed cues for the rest of the day, and we are looking at 24,000 as a crucial make-or-break zone,"" Shivangi Sarda of Motilal Oswal Financial Services told ET Now.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, crashed in trade on Thursday.

Athlete Ashwini Nachappa raises concern over 'drug use' at national school games in Lucknow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/others/athlete-ashwini-nachappa-raises-concern-over-drug-use-at-national-school-games-in-lucknow/articleshow/115790857.cms,"No complaints received, says organiser; promises clean-up

LUCKNOW: An 'X' post by former Asian athletics champion Ashwini Nachappa has ignited a debate over drug use at the ongoing 68th National School Games Athletics Under-17 championship at Guru Gobind Singh Sports College in Lucknow. The post highlights concern over doping and the lack of oversight at the event, where discarded syringes and drug packaging were found near the venue.Ashwini, known for her track and field achievements, called for a ""clean-up"" of the event and urged for the mandatory presence of the National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada) to ensure fair play. In her post, she wrote, ""The ongoing School Games Federation of India's athletics nationals in Lucknow needs a clean-up. NADA's presence at such events should be mandatory to protect clean athletes. The lack of oversight only fuels doping issues and it's no surprise India remains high on WADA's doping list."" She also tagged the Athletics Federation of India (AFI), the Ministry of Sports, and the Prime Minister's Office, drawing attention to the issue.Accompanying her post, Ashwini shared a disturbing image showing a packet of syringes and banned drugs. According to a professor from the pharmacology department of King George Medical University, the drugs in the picture are anabolic steroids used to rapidly increase red blood cell production, often prescribed to cancer patients or those with chronic kidney disease.In a chat with TOI, Ashwini emphasized the urgency of addressing the problem. ""Any authority organizing national events should stay in touch with NADA. I've seen such things happen in many places, especially at junior-level meets. We observed this earlier in Delhi and Karnataka as well. Attention needs to be paid to this issue. If young athletes start using these substances now, what will their future be,"" she questioned.Ashwini further explained that the responsibility lies with event organizers to ensure that NADA is briefed and involved in preventing doping and stressed that this issue often goes unnoticed until it's too late. ""I thought it was important to bring awareness of this to all concerned,"" she added. ""I know it is a rampant issue in India, but I believe we need to address it seriously.""TOI spoke to Pradeep Kumar, the organizing secretary of the 68th National School Athletics Under-17 championship. He said that, to their knowledge, no complaints had been filed by any teams or players regarding the issue. Referring to the viral video, he explained that the medical camp shown in the footage was set up behind the LED screen, where only minor first aid was provided. The area depicted in the video is reportedly located nearby, and it seemed unlikely that players would have been in that area.Now that the issue has come to light, Pradeep promised that all necessary safety measures would be implemented moving forward, and he vowed to keep the process transparent. He also confirmed that appropriate measures would be put in place to monitor the situation and prevent such incidents in the future.","Former Asian athletics champion Ashwini Nachappa has ignited a debate over drug use at the ongoing 68th National School Games Athletics Under-17 championship at Guru Gobind Singh Sports College in Lucknow.

Tips to avoid falling victim to digital arrest scam:



A quick-thinking employee at the State Bank of India (SBI) has prevented a major financial loss for a senior citizen, highlighting the growing threat of digital scams targeting vulnerable individuals.According to an online report by NDTV, a 61-year-old child specialist and a long-time customer of the SBI's AC Guards branch in Hyderabad, was targeted by fraudsters claiming he was under ""digital arrest."" The scammers instructed him to withdraw his money and break his fixed deposits to avoid further legal trouble.An alert bank officer at the AC Guards branch of State Bank of India (SBI) in Hyderabad successfully prevented a senior citizen from falling victim to a 'digital arrest' scam, saving the individual from a potential loss of Rs 13 lakh.As per the report, SBI staff member Surya Swathi noticed the senior citizen's anxious demeanour during his first visit to the branch. Upon inquiring about his large withdrawal request, inconsistencies in his story and a lack of clarity on how he planned to use the funds raised suspicion.Swathi, along with branch manager Kumar Gaud, remained vigilant and employed several tactics to help the customer. They observed his tense behaviour during subsequent visits, noticed him seemingly on a call with the scammers, and even showed him news articles debunking the ""digital arrest"" scam.Finally, after several visits and concerned conversations with SBI staff, the senior citizen realised he was being targeted. He disconnected from the scammer's call and thanked the bank employees for their persistence and intervention.* Never share personal financial information over the phone or email.* Verify the legitimacy of any calls claiming to be from banks or law enforcement agencies.* If unsure about a request, contact your bank directly through a verified phone number.* Educate yourself about common cyber scams to stay vigilant.","A 61-year-old man was targeted by fraudsters claiming he was under ""digital arrest"" The scammers instructed him to withdraw his money and break his fixed deposits to avoid further legal trouble.

Since the advance hotel booking was a must for clearance, the Greece embassy in India didn't clear the contingent's visa application. It's been learnt that there was a delay in payment from authorities to the hotel booked by the organisers.It's the third such instance when the Indian judokas were denied the opportunity to compete in an international tournament. Earlier this month, the team was forced to withdraw from the Gyor Cadet European Cup from Nov 9 to 10 in Hungary for the same reason: visas were denied after details about their intended stay weren't provided.Prior to that, the Indian team missed participating in the prestigious Asian Cadet Championships from Aug 29 to 30 in South Korea's Mungyeong.","Cadet judokas were forced to return from the Delhi airport after they were denied visas for a tournament scheduled in Greece.

2024 ‘Black Friday’ sale targets inflation stricken US customers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/2024-black-friday-sale-targets-inflation-stricken-us-customers/articleshow/115789592.cms,"As November ends, Black Friday kicks off the US holiday shopping season , a time known for finding the best deals. However, this year, retailers are preparing for shoppers who are more focused than ever on finding the best bargains and maximizing the value of their money.Though inflation has stabilized after the substantial price hikes during the Covid pandemic, consumers are still feeling the financial strain. Consequently, bargain-hunting strategies like grabbing early giveaways and waiting for last-minute steals have become a trend.Vivek Pandya, leading insights analyst at Adobe Digital Insights told AFP that as compared to previous years, 2024 holiday shoppers are ""even more preoccupied and very focused around value and discounts.""""We do see stronger price sensitivity on the part of the consumer and they are very responsive to deals and event-tie deals,"" he said.This year, consumers have eagerly participated in special discount events like Memorial Day sales and Amazon's ""Prime Day.""Black Friday, marking the beginning of the gifting season, falls the day after Thanksgiving and kicks off a busy shopping weekend that also includes ""Small Business Saturday"" and ""Cyber Monday.""To combat the ever evolving concern of inflation, major retailers like Target have shifted their ""Black Friday"" promotions to October or even earlier.Consumer prices on average were 22 percent higher in August 2024 compared with January 2020, according to Pew Research, and popular discontent with inflation is one reason Donald Trump won the US presidency in November.In August 2024, prices surged by an average of 22 percent compared to January 2020, according to Pew Research. Inflation is also believed to have played a role in Donald Trump's victory in the November elections.Inflation continues to influence retailers' discounting strategies as they aim to meet the demands of the market.At Target, shoppers have become accustomed to gathering at the chain's ""Circle Week"" savings events, held almost once every quarter. These events have resulted in reduction in purchases a week before and after the events, as per the executives.After a lengthy period of inflation, ""consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell told analysts.""They're becoming increasingly resourceful in their shopping behaviors, waiting to buy until (the) last moment of need, focusing on deals and then stocking up when they find them,"" he said.For the 2024 season, the National Retail Federation has forecasted holiday spending growth of 2.5 to 3.5 percent, compared to the previous year, reaching as much as $989 billion over the two-month period.Economists have pointed to an easing of gasoline prices as a supportive factor, along with an ebbing in the costs of some food items.Economists also signalled lowered prices for certain food items, supported by relaxation in gasoline prices.The inflationary environment has had a particularly weighted down lower-income households, with banks citing rising charge-off rates as a sign of growing financial stress.However, some chains, like off-price apparel retailer Burlington Stores, have seen improvements for this group of consumers. According to Burlington CEO Michael O'Sullivan, some of the company’s strongest sales have come from stores located in low-income zip codes.""Maybe for the first time since 2021, it looks like their real incomes are finally edging up,"" O'Sullivan said on a conference call this week.Thanksgiving, which always falls on the fourth Thursday in November, lands on its latest possible date in 2024. As a result, retailers are adjusting to a holiday season that is five days shorter than last year.A week before the national holiday marking the start of the gifting season, the electronics chain Best Buy also kicked off its Black Friday sale. This year, it reintroduced its ""Doorbuster"" sales every Friday, both in stores and online—an event many retailers had discontinued in recent years due to concerns over crowded lines and the risk of injury.Adobe Digital Insights reported on Wednesday that online sales during the first 24 days of the holiday season had increased by 9.6 percent year-over-year, surpassing the 8.4 percent growth projected for the season.","In August 2024, prices surged by an average of 22 percent compared to January 2020, according to Pew Research.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Champions Trophy Drama: Will India Visit Pakistan or Shift to Neutral Venue? All you need to know

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has described the standoff between the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) and the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) over the 2025 Champions Trophy as a clash of politics and sports. He highlighted how the situation raises concerns about fairness and the governance of international cricket.Afridi voiced his concerns on social media, urging the ICC to uphold fairness and assert its authority amid the escalating tensions.Afridi criticized the BCCI’s stance, noting Pakistan’s past willingness to tour India despite significant security concerns and political strife, and expressed support for the PCB’s rejection of a proposed hybrid hosting model .""By intertwining politics with sports, the BCCI has placed international cricket in a precarious position. Fully support the PCB's stance against the hybrid model - especially since Pakistan (despite security concerns) has toured India five times, including a bilateral white-ball series, post-26/11. It's time for the ICC and its Board of Directors to uphold fairness and assert their authority,"" Afridi wrote on X.The conflict stems from India’s refusal to play matches in Pakistan, citing longstanding security concerns following the 2008 Mumbai attacks.The PCB, firm on hosting the event in Pakistan, has dismissed proposals to split matches between Pakistan and the UAE.This disagreement has left the ICC in a precarious position, with broadcasters like Jio Star pressuring for a resolution due to delays in the tournament schedule.The hybrid model, potentially hosting the group stages in the UAE and knockout matches in Pakistan, seems the most viable compromise.However, if India progress to the knockouts, further venue adjustments might be necessary, creating additional logistical and political challenges.The Champions Trophy, a marquee ICC event, heavily depends on the financial and viewership draw of an India-Pakistan clash, a match broadcasters deem crucial for the tournament's success.Simultaneously, any withdrawal or boycott by the PCB could strain Pakistan cricket’s financial health, already fragile due to limited bilateral series and reduced international exposure.As the ICC Board of Directors prepares to meet on Friday, the global cricketing community awaits a resolution that balances the interests of all stakeholders.","Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi criticizes India-Pakistan stand-off over 2025 Champions Trophy.
