'Hanuman ji first to travel to space': Anurag Thakur’s interaction with students sparks row; DMK says 'science is not mythology',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hanumanji-first-to-travel-to-space-anurag-thakurs-interaction-with-student-sparks-row-dmk-says-science-is-not-mythology/articleshow/123493296.cms,"India’s Space Dream: PM Modi Vows To Build Nation’s Own Space Station After Gaganyaan On Space Day

DMK’s response: ‘Science is not mythology’



Thakur hails India’s space strides



NEW DELHI: BJP MP Anurag Thakur, during an interaction with school children on National Space Day, asked “who was the first person to travel to space.” When the students answered “Neil Armstrong,” Thakur responded, “I think Hanuman ji was the first person to travel to space. ” The exchange has drawn sharp criticism from the opposition, with the DMK accusing him of “confusing fact with fable.”While interacting with students at Shri Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Una, Himachal Pradesh, on National Space Day, Thakur argued that knowledge traditions should extend beyond what he described as “textbooks given to us by the British.” He urged teachers to look towards “our veds, our textbooks and our knowledge,” saying this would allow students to see “a lot more.”The remark triggered an immediate backlash from the DMK. Party MP Kanimozhi, in a post on X, said: “A member of parliament and former union minister asking school children who first set foot on the moon, and insisting that it was not Neil Armstrong but Hanuman, is deeply troubling. Science is not mythology. To mislead young minds in classrooms is an insult to knowledge, reason, and the spirit of scientific temper enshrined in our Constitution.India’s future lies in nurturing curiosity, not confusing fact with fable.”At the same event, Thakur highlighted India’s recent achievements in the space sector, noting the Chandrayaan-3 success in 2023 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s role in supporting scientists. He said India is aiming to set up its own space station by 2035 and achieve a crewed lunar landing by 2040.He also pointed to India’s growing space economy, the development of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, and milestones such as launching 104 satellites in one flight and the successful testing of the reusable launch vehicle. “Earlier we had to seek help from foreign countries to launch our satellites, but now foreign nations seek help from us,” Thakur told students.The occasion marked the second National Space Day, commemorating India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission. This year’s theme, “Aryabhatta to Gaganyaan: Ancient Wisdom to Infinite Possibilities,” linked India’s ancient astronomical traditions with modern space ambitions.Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to travel into space in 1961, while American astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first person to set foot on the Moon in 1969.","BJP MP Anurag Thakur asked school children who was the first person to travel to space.

SC makes granting sand-mining leases more difficult,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-makes-granting-sand-mining-leases-more-difficult/articleshow/123491912.cms,"NEW DELHI: In an important judgment, the Supreme Court has linked quantum of sand mining to the river's replenishment capacity, a ruling that would prevent degradation of riverbeds, consequently making grant of leases for extraction of a key construction raw material from riverbanks difficult.Taking the regulatory regime for sand mining a step forward, a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said extraction of sand from riverbeds must be in sync with the river's capacity to replenish, akin to felling of timber in a forest being linked to its capacity to grow trees.The bench said, ""Just as forest conservation requires assessment of tree growth rate before permitting timber harvesting to ensure that felling of trees does not exceed tree growth, a replenishment study enables us to take an informed decision as to whether sand mining can be permitted without degrading the rivers' natural balance.""The Justice Narasimha-led bench mentioned its judgment earlier this year declaring that a valid and subsisting District Survey Report (DSR) is mandatory for grant of environmental clearance (EC) for sand mining. ""The purpose and objective of preparing such District Survey Report is to scientifically locate the place for sand mining after calculation of annual rate of replenishment for allowing mining in the area,"" it said.""It is, therefore, compelling to hold that a DSR is valid and tenable only when a proper replenishment study is conducted,"" the bench said, adding that absence of a replenishment study renders a DSR fundamentally defective.This ruling came from the bench while dismissing appeals by the J&K govt and the National Highways Authority of India, which had challenged a National Green Tribunal order setting aside the permission for sand mining, without a proper replenishment study, to a project proponent which awarded the construction of a four-lane bypass-ring-road around Srinagar city.","Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said extraction of sand from riverbeds must be in sync with the river's capacity to replenish.

Adlam, 60, was in India from Feb 24 to 28 on a tourist visa.The court's three-page order quotes Sharma, a former lieutenant commander of the Indian Navy, as terming the alleged breach ""a threat to national security"".The ordnance factory recently received ""brake parachute technology transfer"" for Sukhoi Su-30 aircraft, and contributes to space projects like Gaganyaan and drone development.Deputy general manager Himmatlal Kumawat, a 2011-batch Indian Ordnance Factory Services officer, stands accused of trying to pressure Sharma into allowing Adlam to visit the facility by bypassing the mandatory security clearance.The complaint names another official of the same rank, Vipin Kathiyar, as siding with Kumawat.When Sharma didn't relent, Kumawat allegedly facilitated Adlam's unauthorised tour without his knowledge. The DGM had allegedly assaulted Sharma in his office on Feb 21 after an argument over the foreigner's planned visit. The court document states that witnesses, including a security guard and a contract worker, intervened to separate the duo.The alleged breach occurred barely two weeks before UP Police's Anti-Terrorist Squad arrested Ravindra Kumar, a chargeman who reported to Kumawat at the factory. Ravindra was arrested on March 14 for allegedly using his smartphone to share classified documents with a suspected ISI agent.An internal investigation revealed that Himmatlal and Vipin had previously allowed staff to use smartphones inside the facility in violation of security protocol.CJM Diwakar said during a hearing on Aug 8 that entry into a defence facility without authorisation was a cognisable offence. He directed police to register an FIR and submit the findings of the investigation within 24 hours.

"Cleanliness in toilets & coach, major irritants for long-distance train passengers: CAG audit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cleanliness-in-toilets-coach-major-irritants-for-long-distance-train-passengers-cag-audit/articleshow/123489089.cms,"The findings are based on a detailed survey of 2,426 on-board passengers across 96 selected trains, conducted by audit offices from 16 zones.

NEW DELHI: In a telling indicator of the persistent cleanliness issues on long-distance trains — from choked toilets and unclean washbasins to lack of water and dirty vestibule areas — an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has found that over 40% of passengers were dissatisfied with toilet cleanliness, while more than half expressed dissatisfaction with on-board housekeeping.The findings are based on a detailed survey of 2,426 on-board passengers across 96 selected trains, conducted by audit offices from 16 zones. The results are a part of the CAG’s report titled “Cleanliness and Sanitation in Long Distance Trains” for 2018-19 to 2022-23 period.However, the auditor noted that 89% of complaints related to toilet cleanliness were addressed within the stipulated time frame, indicating a degree of responsiveness.The audit has highlighted inadequate deployment of manpower and cleaning equipment, along with poor and irregular monitoring by railway officials, as key reasons behind the poor sanitary conditions on long-distance trains.According to the report, bio-toilets in AC coaches were found to be in better condition than those in non-AC coaches. Passenger dissatisfaction exceeded 50% in five zones, including East Coast, Western, and Eastern Railways.In contrast, satisfaction levels crossed 90% in Northern and North Central Railways.Identifying improper usage as a major contributing factor, the CAG recommended “special efforts to raise passenger awareness regarding the proper use of bio-toilets, especially in cases involving non-availability of water or filth in common areas such as near sinks.”On the issue of water availability, the audit surveyed six selected trains in each zone and recorded passenger feedback. Out of the 2,426 passengers surveyed, 366 (15%) reported lack of water in toilets or washbasins. The report also noted that over one lakh complaints regarding water shortages in train toilets and washbasins were registered via the Rail Madad app in 2022-23.To address this, the CAG recommended ensuring enroute water refilling arrangements, especially for long-distance trains and at stations which recorded more frequent complaints.For the assessment of On-Board Housekeeping Services (OBHS), joint inspections were conducted along with railway officials on 15 trains. Service deficiencies were found in 13 of them, which included choked washbasins at doorways, dirty lavatories in sleeper coaches, waterlogging in toilets, and unclean vestibule areas.The audit also reviewed the performance of the Clean Train Stations (CTS) scheme, introduced to provide mechanised cleaning of key coach areas, such as bio-toilets, doorways and vestibules, during brief halts at enroute stations. The report stated that the intended benefits of the scheme were not fully realised due to railway authorities failing to enforce contractual obligations, including the deployment of adequate resources within the scheduled halt time.During joint inspections of 29 CTS across 12 zones, the audit observed limited cleaning of toilets and other areas, and shortfall in usage of machines and deployment of manpower.The report also flagged how the authorities at zonal level failed to ensure compliance with the norm of police verification of contractual staff deployed on trains despite several instances of crime involving such staff having been reported, including rape of a passenger by an attendant on Delhi-Ahmedabad Swarna Jayanti Rajdhani train.","The findings are based on a detailed survey of 2,426 on-board passengers across 96 selected trains.

Ethanol-blended petrol push: PIL in Supreme Court challenges nationwide sale of E20; claims 'engines are suffering',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ethanol-blended-petrol-push-pil-in-supreme-court-challenges-nationwide-sale-of-e20-claims-engines-are-suffering/articleshow/123457552.cms,"India's E20 Push



Is all petrol in India now E20?



How is E20 different from E10 or E15?



What impact does E20 have on vehicles?



What Government said?



NEW DELHI: A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the nationwide rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20), claiming that millions of motorists are being forced to use fuel their vehicles are not designed for.The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the ministry of petroleum & natural gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.The PIL argues that cars and two-wheelers manufactured before 2023 and even some newer BS-VI models, are not compatible with high ethanol blends like E20.""Direct the respondents to ensure that consumers are informed about ethanol compatibility of their vehicles at the time of fuel dispensing. Engines are suffering corrosion, fuel efficiency is dropping, and repair bills are mounting, while insurance companies are rejecting claims for damage caused by ethanol fuel,"" the plea stated.The petitioner further sought clear labelling of ethanol content at all petrol pumps and dispensing units so that consumers are fully informed about what they are purchasing.The petition highlighted that global practices differ sharply.In countries like the US and EU, ethanol-free petrol continues to be widely available, and pumps clearly display the ethanol content.In India, however, only ethanol-blended petrol is sold, and there is no disclosure of composition at dispensing units, the plea added.India has accelerated its transition to E20 fuel, a blend of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol, as part of its efforts to cut carbon emissions and reduce dependence on imported crude oil.The nationwide rollout, originally planned for 2030, has now been advanced to 2025. While the government has set ambitious targets, questions remain over the availability of compatible vehicles, supply logistics, and consumer awareness.Not yet. Many petrol pumps are still offering E10 (10% ethanol), while E20 is being gradually introduced in select regions. The government’s aim is to achieve 100% E20 availability across India by 2025.The number indicates the ethanol percentage in the fuel blend. For example, E10 has 10% ethanol, E15 has 15%, and E20 contains 20%. The higher the ethanol content, the lower the reliance on crude oil imports.According to several reports, many motorists have expressed concerns about the impact of E20 fuel, particularly on fuel efficiency.While ethanol has lower energy density than petrol, the mileage impact is relatively small. For E10 vehicles tuned for E20, the drop is just 1-2% .In other vehicles, the reduction could range between 3-6% and even that can be minimised with proper engine tuning, reported ANI.The ministry of petroleum and natural gas issued a statement rejecting all viral social media posts alleging that E20 causes a major fall in fuel efficiency.Calling the claims ""factually incorrect,"" the ministry said they lack any scientific backing or expert validation.","A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20) The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the ministry of petroleum & natural gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123458210,imgsize-58496,width-400,resizemode-4/123458210.jpg"

The agency then sent the seized NRI certificates to Indian embassies and missions for verification. Most of them were found to be forged or fake. The probe further revealed these medical colleges were paying agents to have fake NRI documents prepared.The agents also prepared fake family trees of NRIs, wherein these unrelated NRIs were shown as relatives of students to help secure admissions under the NRI quota. In some cases, the agents and medical colleges used documents of one NRI for admissions of multiple candidates, who were unrelated to the NRI sponsor and to each other.The promoters of these medical colleges were found to be behind the illegal admission racket, with their agents spread across the country bringing ""clients"" and helping them generate huge ""proceeds of crime"".The Centre has since revised its NRI admission policy, with the DG of health services issuing fresh guidelines wherein each NRI certificate has to be authenticated by embassies and missions before admission is granted on its basis. This happened after coordinated action involving multiple Union ministries.The MEA too has issued fresh guidelines to its embassies and missions abroad, for strict due diligence in issuance of NRI certificates, outlining the eligibility criteria and clearly delineating 'first degree' and 'second degree' relatives in respect of whom NRIs can get certificates for admissions under the quota in India.The involvement of some NRIs has also come to light. They allowed their names to be used after receiving bribes from the agents of the medical colleges. ""The agents approached and obtained credentials of unrelated NRIs by paying money to them,"" the investigation found.The existing rules specify that the fees of the NRI student must be paid by the NRI sponsor. However, the investigation found that in a majority of the cases fees were paid by the family of the student and not the NRI sponsor, thereby defeating the very purpose of the policy, which is to earn foreign exchange, sources said.Probe revealed many NRI sponsors were not present in India on the dates affidavits were notarised and signed, a senior official said.","ED had conducted searches at various medical colleges in West Bengal and Odisha.

Nikki Haley Warns Donald Trump of ‘Strategic Disaster’ as 50% US Tariff on India Nears Deadline

US president Donald Trump ’s sweeping tariff hikes on imports could shrink the US deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade, the Congressional budget office (CBO) said on Friday.According to CBO, Congress’ nonpartisan analyst, higher tariff revenue would reduce primary deficits by $3.3 trillion and trim federal interest payments by $0.7 trillion. The new estimate marks a sharp increase from June, when CBO forecast a $2.5 trillion reduction in primary deficits and a $500 billion drop in interest costs.The revenue boost could help offset the effects of the Republicans’ tax-cut and spending package passed earlier this year, which CBO said will widen the deficit by $3.4 trillion over 10 years.The US federal debt stands at $37.18 trillion, treasury department data shows, and continues to climb under both Republican and Democratic administrations as spending outpaces revenue. Lawmakers must pass new spending bills by the end of September to avoid a government shutdown according to Reuters.CBO cautioned that the current top tariff rates may not last, with trade negotiations and international legal challenges still in play.Tariffs across countries and products averaged 16.7% in August, up from 15.1% in June, according to Oxford Economics. US customs and border protection has already assessed more than $26 billion in duties this fiscal year, far above the hundreds of millions collected in the previous year, the analysis found.",US president Donald Trump ’s sweeping tariff hikes on imports could shrink the US deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade.

"Karnataka GST Rate Cut: Wary of Rs 15,000 crore revenue loss, Karnataka to oppose Centre’s GST rate cuts; seeks compensation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/wary-of-revenue-loss-karnataka-to-oppose-centres-gst-rate-cuts/articleshow/123486733.cms,"BENGALURU: The state govt is wary of the Centre's decision to reshuffle and reduce goods and services tax (GST) rate slabs, suggesting that it could result in a massive revenue shortfall for the cash-strapped state.In his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced ""next generation tax reforms"", following which the group of ministers (GoM) on GST rate rationalisation met and accepted the Centre's plan to compress the existing slabs of 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28% into a simpler two-rate system of 5% and 18%.The GST Council is slated to meet on Sept 3 and 4 to finalise the decision. If the council ratifies the proposal, prices of many consumer durables and electronics, currently taxed at either 12% or 28%, are expected to decline.Computer monitors, carbonated beverages, fruit juices, and construction materials like cement besides other goods — all currently taxed at 28% — may be moved to the 18% slab. Likewise, readymade garments priced above Rs 1,000, currently under the 12% bracket, may draw a lower 5% GST.""Rationalisation of GST slabs makes economic sense, as it ensures more money in the hands of consumers, benefits trade and increases revenue to the exchequer,"" said BT Manohar, a member of Karnataka State GST Advisory Committee.But while consumers and trade groups are optimistic, the state has voiced serious concerns over the fiscal impact. Chief minister Siddaramaiah's budget has set an ambitious GST revenue target of Rs 1.2 lakh crore for the current financial year. The state's commercial taxes department projects a potential revenue loss of more than Rs 15,000 crore if the rate cuts are implemented.Revenue minister Krishna Byre Gowda, Karnataka's representative at the GST Council, said states had expressed concerns at the GoM meeting, estimating cumulative losses ranging from Rs 85,000 crore to Rs 2 lakh crore.""Karnataka supports rate rationalisation, but this exercise will leave a permanent hole in the revenues of all state govt,"" Byre Gowda said. ""GST is a federal arrangement. In a federal system, no decision should be unilateral. States and the Centre should both agree.""Byre Gowda said states are demanding revenue protection until the tax inflow stabilises. He will also oppose the rate cut proposal at the GST council meeting.""If Karnataka's revenues take a big hit, should we be dependent on the central govt to run our govt?"" he asked. ""Karnataka has already suffered gross injustice from the central govt. While we support rate rationalisation, we have also demanded protection for loss of revenue.""Basavaraj Rayareddi, the CM's economic adviser, echoed the sentiment saying the Centre must provide adequate compensation to states, like the compensation formula adopted from 2017 to 2022 immediately after GST was introduced.""Considering the immediate impact, the Centre must either compensate states, or it should change the share to 75:25 [larger share for states] between states and Centre from the present 50:50,"" said Rayareddi.Rayareddi said Siddaramaiah is expected to soon convene a meeting of finance ministers from all states in New Delhi to forge a national consensus on the issue.","The state govt is wary of the Centre's decision to reshuffle and reduce goods and services tax (GST) rate slabs.

During the previous government's tenure, on Nov 24, 2021, the tourism department allotted 20 acres of land at Alipiri to the Oberoi Hotel. This land, located at the foothills, is considered sacred by Hindu groups, Swamijis, and devotees, who have expressed strong objections since the allotment came to light.In response, the TTD board meeting held on Nov 18, 2024, through Resolution No. 102, recommended to the government that the sacred land should not be allotted to the Oberoi Hotel but instead should be transferred to the TTD. Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, during his visit to Tirumala on March 21, 2025, reiterated that no unauthorised activities would be permitted in the region to protect its sanctity.Following this, the tourism department agreed to transfer the land adjacent on the north side to TTD and requested that land on the opposite side of the road be allotted to them in exchange.Accordingly, in the TTD board meeting on May 7, 2025, under Resolution No. 250, the TTD consented to this land exchange. Subsequently, on July 22, 2025, the TTD board approved the transfer of TTD-owned land on the south side of the road to the Tourism Department in exchange for the land on the north side, as per Resolution No.385.To preserve the sanctity of Tirumala, TTD plans to utilize the sacred land on the north side of the road to develop facilities for devotees, addressing future needs. Meanwhile, several constructions have already taken place on the south side of the Alipiri-Cherlopalli road.Thus, the south-side land was allotted to the tourism department, while the sacred north-side land adjacent to Tirumala hill was acquired by TTD due to its significance for the sanctity and security of Tirumala. Given these facts, it is inappropriate to make allegations on an issue deeply connected to devotees' sentiments.","During the previous government's tenure, the tourism department allotted 20 acres of land at Alipiri to the Oberoi Hotel.

Unconventional leadership and office creativity

Monthly “work church” meetings with grammar lessons

Other companies embracing unconventional office setups



A billionaire breaking the mold

Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company, yet she has never taken a single share for personal use. Instead, she has committed to giving away nearly all her wealth to philanthropic causes, signing Bill Gates’ Giving Pledge in 2015 to donate 99% of her fortune. Beyond finances, Faulkner has created a corporate culture that values creativity, curiosity, and learning. From whimsical themed office buildings to innovative company-wide gatherings, she proves that leadership and generosity can coexist, while setting an example for other business leaders that success can be measured not only in profits but also in positive impact on employees and society.Faulkner, together with her husband, launched Roots & Wings to provide grants to nonprofits dedicated to improving the health, education, and well-being of children and families. Since its inception, the foundation has grown into a major philanthropic vehicle: in 2020, it granted $15 million to 115 organizations, and by 2024, it projected $67 million in grants to 305 nonprofits nationwide. Faulkner intends to steadily expand giving, aiming to distribute $100 million annually by 2027. To responsibly manage the sale of her non-voting Epic shares without destabilizing the company, she established a trust that governs these transactions. This careful planning ensures that her philanthropic mission can continue without affecting Epic’s stability or long-term growth.Epic Systems’ 1,670-acre campus in Wisconsin is far from a conventional office environment. Its 28 buildings feature fantastical themes ranging from Harry Potter and Alice in Wonderland to The Wizard of Oz, organized into mini-campuses such as Prairie Campus, Wizards Academy, and Storybook Campus. Inside, employees help source artwork and whimsical installations, including chocolate chip trails leading to a mock chocolate factory, hanging bridges to treehouses, and magical sculptures scattered across the grounds. This imaginative setting reflects Faulkner’s philosophy that creativity, play, and aesthetic engagement foster learning and productivity, making the workplace not just a location for tasks but a space for inspiration and collaboration.Once a month, Epic employees gather in the underground auditorium called Deep Space for a mandatory meeting affectionately nicknamed “work church.” These gatherings cover essential business news, company updates, and operational targets. Yet Faulkner adds unique elements that transform standard corporate meetings into engaging learning experiences. For instance, she incorporates grammar lessons, teaching employees proper usage of words such as “who” and “whom,” and emphasizing communication skills alongside company strategy. By blending education with corporate updates, these meetings reinforce a culture of continuous learning, intellectual curiosity, and attention to detail, encouraging employees to grow professionally and personally within the company. Her story demonstrates that visionary leadership can redefine both corporate culture and philanthropy on a global scale.Epic Systems is part of a broader trend of companies reimagining office culture to enhance employee engagement. Wellstar Health System, for example, offers wellness rooms with massage chairs, calming music, and healthy snacks, resulting in a 10% drop in employee turnover in 2024. Nonprofit Understood designs offices specifically for neurodivergent employees, with adjustable lighting, temperature zones, and assistive listening systems to support diverse needs. Even CEOs like Jeff Bezos favor “messy meetings” over rehearsed discussions to stimulate open debate and creativity. These examples show that unconventional setups, when thoughtfully implemented, can increase productivity, employee satisfaction, and innovation across industries.While many billionaires sign high-profile pledges without fully following through, Faulkner stands apart as a rare example of commitment and action. By giving away nearly all her wealth through philanthropy, cultivating a creative and educational workplace, and fostering employee engagement through unconventional office design and corporate rituals, she sets a benchmark for responsible, visionary leadership. Her approach demonstrates that a CEO can combine financial success, ethical responsibility, and innovation to create a lasting impact—not just on a company’s bottom line, but on the lives of employees, communities, and society at large. Faulkner’s legacy shows that generosity and innovation are not mutually exclusive but can reinforce each other. Her model inspires future leaders to pursue business success with purpose, creativity, and a commitment to societal well-being.","Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

TikTok website is live in India. After a five-year absence, the Chinese short video app TikTok has sparked excitement among its former Indian user base. The platform's website has become accessible for some users in India, leading to widespread speculation of a potential comeback. However, the app remains unavailable on Google Play Store and App Store, and there is no statement from the company regarding a return.Notably, the move is not without its caveats. While some users have reported being able to access the website, others on X say it remains blocked. When the members of the Times of India tech team checked, they were able to access the homepage but not any other page.When clicked on “Newsroom” a message flashes saying, “You don't have access to this page Our services aren't available in your country or region.” Additionally, a click on “Careers” returns “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” message. The 'Contacts' link on the page too is opening. It is taking to a page that shows 'Partners', 'Media Enquiries', 'Legal Enquiries' and 'Privacy'.The development has reignited conversations around the 2020 ban. The government initially blocked TikTok along with 58 other Chinese apps, including Shareit and CamScanner, citing national security concerns. The Ministry of Electronics and IT stated that the apps were “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”Meanwhile, TikTok is also facing a ban in the US. However, President Donald Trump has said that he has American buyers ready to acquire TikTok, and he is open to extending the deadline for its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app’s US assets.The company is also laying off several employees in the UK and said that this move is part of a “reorganisation” to centralise its operations and increase its reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) for moderation.","TikTok website is live in India, some users able to access it.

The job cuts represent about a third of the staff at the studio, which is developing the next instalment in the popular BioShock series. The layoffs, which took place this week, are reportedly part of a broader reorganisation. As a result, the new BioShock game, which was previously expected to be released in late 2026 or early 2027, will now be delayed, a report claims. The move comes after rumours claimed that Cloud Chamber had replaced its studio head and creative director due to development issues.According to a report by Bloomberg, 2K Games, the Take-Two label behind BioShock has confirmed the job cuts but did not disclose how many employees were affected. When asked for comment, a spokesperson pointed to an internal email sent to the studio's staff by 2K President David Ismailer .Ismailer wrote in his statement.The new BioShock has been in development for over a decade, cycling through multiple studios and leadership teams since 2014. After failed attempts with Certain Affinity, 2K formed Cloud Chamber in 2017, bringing in veterans and shifting development to Unreal Engine 5, which extended the timeline, the report notes.Despite promising demos, the project has faced technical hurdles, leadership departures, and narrative issues. Internal reviews deemed it solid but not exceptional, prompting leadership changes. Following layoffs at Cloud Chamber, 2K has appointed industry veteran Rod Fergusson, known as a project “closer,” to help steer the game to completion, the report adds.","2K Games has laid off more than 80 employees at its Cloud Chamber studio.

TCS responds to the layoffs



Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT services is presently facing backlash after announcing its plans to layoff around 12000 employees. Layoffs have reportedly led to protests across some cities outside TCS offices. The protests are organised by Union of IT & ITES Employees (UNITE).UNITE also took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the protests. “TCS is retrenching workers not out of necessity, but for profit. Targeting senior employees & pushing illegal layoffs is an attack on job security across IT. Workers are not numbers on a balance sheet — we demand justice!” UNITE wrote on X.UNITE supported by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), staged demonstrations this week, demanding that TCS reverse its decision and urging government intervention. “Union of IT And ITES Employees protested tofay in Chennai against the announced TCS layoff of 12000 employees and the government inaction,” wrote the Union association in a post shared on X.The union alleges that the layoffs have disproportionately targeted experienced mid-level and senior level professionals. The union also accuse the company of firing professionals with strong performance record and leadership credentials.UNITE is now planning to escalate its campaign globally if the authorise doesn’t act in time.In an official statement the Indian IT services giant TCS said: ""TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation… As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2% of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year.""This transition is being planned with due care to ensure there is no impact on service delivery to our clients… We understand that this is a challenging time for our colleagues likely to be affected. We thank them for their service and we will be making all efforts to provide appropriate benefits, outplacement, counselling, and support as they transition to new opportunities,” added the company.TCS has also announced that it will give proper benefits, counselling, outplacement and support to the impacted employees. Along with this, the company will also be giving notice period compensation and severance benefits to the affected employees.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT services is facing backlash after announcing its plans to layoff around 12000 employees.

"'Sudharma': India’s only Sanskrit newspaper completes 55 years of printing; publishes only inspiring news, read worldwide from the USA to Japan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/sudharma-indias-only-sanskrit-newspaper-completes-55-years-of-printing-publishes-only-inspiring-news-read-worldwide-from-the-usa-to-japan/articleshow/123493674.cms,"BENGALURU: House No. 561 on 2nd Ramachandra Agrahara in Mysuru has no nameplate but is an address recognised globally. It’s where Sudharma, India’s only Sanskrit daily newspaper, is typeset. Sudharma celebrated its 56th year of unbroken publication on July 15.At its helm is scholar Jayalakshmi Sampath Kumar, a woman whose resolve and passion have kept the ancient language of Sanskrit alive in modern newsprint, defying odds and rewriting history.For the 59-year-old, editing ‘Sudharma’ is not just a job — it’s a sacred vow. “It’s like breathing life into a language every single day,” she says, her eyes gleaming with purpose. She spends 14 to 15 hours every day at work, from chasing news late into the night to rising at dawn to craft stories in crisp, accessible Sanskrit.Jayalakshmi says that her father-inlaw, late Varadaraja Iyengar, and her husband, late KV Sampath Kumar, ensured Sudharma never missed a single day of publication since its inception in 1970. “I am carrying forward their dream,” she says, in a steady voice tinged with pride.Varadaraja Iyengar, a visionary Sanskrit scholar and book publisher, was instrumental in launching the Sanskrit news bulletin on All India Radio. He founded Sudharma on July 15, 1970, challenging the notion that Sanskrit was a “dead” language.Priced at a modest two paisa for its inaugural issue, released at the Government Maharaja Samskrita Maha Patashale, the newspaper took upon itself a mission to democratise Sanskrit, making it a living, breathing medium for the common reader. Even during the tumultuous months of Emergency, when several printing presses fell silent, Sudharma stood resolute, its pages a testament to resilience.Jayalakshmi’s journey with Sudharma began in 1992, when she married KV Sampath Kumar, the son of the founder. A Sanskrit scholar herself, she was no stranger to the language, having studied it since childhood.At Sudharma, she honed her craft by immersing herself in the daily’s operations — writing, editing, printing, and engaging with readers. When life took a cruel turn with Sampath Kumar’s passing on June 30, 2021, Jayalakshmi stepped into the editor’s shoes, undaunted.“Running a Sanskrit daily is unlike operating any other newspaper,” Jayalakshmi explains. In one page, Sudharma packs eight stories, each crafted in simple Sanskrit to promote the language’s accessibility.“Our goal has always been to make Sanskrit relatable,” she says. The editorial policy is unique: no crime or negative news, only stories that inspire and educate.Sports, especially modern ones like tennis, find prominence on Sudharma’s pages as they offer a chance to coin new Sanskrit words for contemporary concepts. “We’re not just reporting news; we’re expanding the language’s vocabulary,” she says with a smile.The daily’s reach extends far beyond Mysuru. Since launching its e-paper in 2008, Sudharma has garnered over 5,000 subscribers, many from countries such as the USA, UK, and Japan, where Sanskrit scholars and enthusiasts eagerly await each edition. A subscription, priced at Rs 600 annually for both print and online versions, keeps the presses running.The newspaper also introduced a Sanskrit calendar in 1995, a cultural gem that details Indian festivals, historical notes, and mythological insights, further enriching its readers’ connection to India’s heritage.In 2020, she and her husband were honoured with the Padma Shri, a nod to their unwavering dedication to preserving Sanskrit.A team of erudite scholars, including Vidwan HV Nagaraja Rao, the honorary editor who joined a day after Sudharma’s launch, supports her. “From day one, our mission was to deliver news in simple Sanskrit,” says Nagaraja Rao, who has translated numerous works between Kannada and Sanskrit.Sanskrit language stalwarts VD Hegde, TV Satyanarayana, Srivatsacharya, HM Sudheer, and Balachandar contribute through editing, translations, and articles, ensuring Sudharma remains a beacon of scholarship.","Sudharma, India’s only Sanskrit daily newspaper, celebrated its 56th year of unbroken publication on July 15.

Bill Gates reveals the one job he cannot do



Microsoft co-founder shared a fresh perspective on how can one tackle the tricky and most feared job interview questions : ""What are your salary expectations for this job?”. Instead of giving a specific number, Gates moved the conversation towards long-term vision. He also advised to focus on stock options and not just think about immediate cash. In a 2020 mock interview with NBA star Stephen Curry, Gates talked about various topics which play an important role during a job interview.As reported by Business Insider, when asked how he would respond to the salary expectations question, Gates said, “I hope the option package is good, and I'm able to take risks. And I think the company has a great future, so I'd prefer to get stock options, even more than cash compensation. I hear some other companies are paying a lot but treat me fairly and emphasize the options.”It is a simple answer but shows the vision and clarity Gates has. A part of Gates wealth is because of his shareholding in Microsoft. Instead of focusing on instant cash and giving a specific number, his approach invites transparency and trust.As per experts, Gates response is seen a masterclass in negotiation and it also demonstrates confidence and ambition. By prioritising the stock options, Gates signals that he is ready to take risk and also believes strongly in the potential of the company. Gates’ answer also aligns with his broader philosophy on leadership and meritocracy—letting results speak louder than demands.During the same interview, Bill Gates also talked about his professional preferences and admitted that there’s one Job role that he’d prefer to avoid which is of a salesman or marketing position. When asked about his weakness, Bill Gates who adorned the character of a young engineering dropout revealed, “I'm not a natural at sales or marketing; I would rather focus on product creation and definition.” Gates admitted that marketing and sales are for his forte and he would not enjoy being in a role that required them.","Bill Gates reveals the one job he cannot do which is of a salesman or marketing position.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "".

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

How Roshan Shah was caught







A 21-year-old India has been charged in Wisconsin for fooling people into believing that they need to part with their gold so that the gold can be kept in a safe box in Washington DC, otherwise they will become targets of a scam and all their money will be gone. According to the Justice Department, Shah was in Canada on a student visa before entering the US on a visitor's visa.The court document said Shah traveled to different states and picked up cash and gold from various fraud victims. He was not alone in this, he had a racket of conspirators who used to get the proceeds from this elaborate scam.Police arrested Shah after he attempted to pick up gold from his fraud victims in New Berlin, Wisconsin. Details of his co-conspirators are not yet known, but they played key roles in the scam as they posed as law enforcement officials and convinced gullible victims that they needed to transfer their assets to gold and then a courier would pick that and put it in a safety box in DC. Shah said he was just a middleman.The victims had previously given over $500,000 worth of gold to couriers the victims believed to be working with the federal government, the court document said.If convicted, Shah will face up to 20 years in prison and forfeit property in an amount equal to the value of the property involved in the offense.A New Berlin couple went to police July 30 to report that they were probably being scammed out of over $526,000 between June 11 and the end of July through a series if transactions involving gold coins. They said they had seen a TV news report about a scam involving gold coins and realized they likely were victims of itThe couple said they responded to a pop-up ad on their computer and called a number. A person told them he was a special agent with the US Treasury. He told them they were the victims of a massive fraud scheme across the US also being investigated by the CIA and Federal Trade Commission.The man requested identifying information from the couple, and sent them images of a badge and credentials to show them that they were indeed from the government. Police later determined all those were fake. Another associate of that man, identified as a “Scott Bessent,” said he was a chief investigator for the Office of the Inspector General, and the couple was advised to keep in contact with both men, whom they said had Middle Eastern accents and sounded as though they were calling from a call center, the complaint said.The couple was asked to forward gold coins to a safety deposit box opene din their name in the George W. Bush Federal Building in Washington, D.C., which does not actually exist. The couple engaged in a series of password-protected courier transactions but in the middle of the entire process, they suspected that something was amiss.Shah told police he arrived in the US on June 17 from Canada, only to be a courier for this scam. He arrived in the US in June and has done 10 or 11 jobs, including in Florida, Texas, Colorado, Arizona, Virginia, Illinois, Indiana and Milwaukee.","Roshan Shah was in Canada on a student visa before entering the US on a visitor's visa.

Afghanistan’s water push: Kabul seeks control of rivers; Taliban’s canal projects raise alarms as neighbours fear flow cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/afghanistans-water-push-kabul-seeks-control-of-rivers-talibans-canal-projects-raise-alarms-as-neighbours-fear-flow-cuts/articleshow/123342966.cms,"New Canal, Afghan Valley

Poll Do you think Afghanistan's control over its water resources will lead to more regional disputes? Yes No

Iran revives Helmand dispute

Pakistan watching Kabul basin closely

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.
