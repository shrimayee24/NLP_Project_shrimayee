CHANDIGARH: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi accused BJP of driving Haryana's youth to sell their land and move abroad, often illegally, due to widespread unemployment and lack of opportunities under the party's governance since 2014. His campaign rallies in Assandh and Barwala for the Oct 5 assembly elections also served as a show of unity between Congress arch-rivals Kumari Selja and Bhupinder Singh Hooda Gandhi criticised the Agnipath scheme , claiming it deprived soldiers of stable jobs and pension benefits allegedly to favour the Adani Group. He accused the conglomerate of benefiting from the defence budget, acting as an intermediary in arms deals.Gandhi said Agnipath was introduced to offset expenses incurred from the ""one rank, one pension"" (OROP) initiative, with the saved funds being directed to private conglomerates. He claimed these conglomerates purchased arms from Israel, reselling them to India with their label.""The recruitment system is being destroyed systematically by BJP,"" he alleged. ""The morale of soldiers recruited under Agnipath is down as they are working with soldiers recruited under the old recruitment policy.""Reflecting on his recent visit to the US, Gandhi shared experiences of meeting young people from Haryana who had risked their lives to reach America via ""donkey routes"". ""Most of them had either sold their farmland or taken loans on hefty interest rates to go abroad for jobs. After interacting with them and their families, I have come to know it was because of unemployment, a non-conducive environment for business, high inflation, and the BJP govt's new recruitment policy in the Army,"" Gandhi said.With BJP ramping up criticism of Congress over Selja's absence from the campaign, efforts from Hooda's camp have been made to reconcile with her. Tensions arose when loyalists of Selja were denied tickets in key constituencies. As a prominent Dalit politician, Selja's influence is crucial in a state where 21% of voters belong to the community and 17 assembly seats are reserved for scheduled castes.Hooda's faction included Selja's photographs on their posters and began mentioning her in speeches to smooth over the rift. Gandhi used his platform to appeal for unity across caste lines and urged voters to support Congress. He reiterated Congress's commitment to conducting a caste census.Presenting the Congress manifesto for Haryana, Gandhi promised Rs 2,000 a month to women, LPG cylinders for Rs 500, MSP guarantee for farmers, instant crop insurance payments, and 100-square-yard plots for the poor.Accompanied by Olympic medallist Bajrang Punia, Gandhi praised wrestlers but condemned the sexual harassment of athletes. ""Women wrestlers are being sexually harassed and are crying for justice, but BJP has been protecting that man,"" he said.(Inputs: Vijender Kumar)","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi accused BJP of driving Haryana's youth to sell their land and move abroad, often illegally.

Water shortage in Bengaluru: Tanker bill per house goes up to Rs 25k here,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/water-shortage-in-bengaluru-tanker-bill-per-house-goes-up-to-rs-25k-here/articleshow/113683003.cms,"The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand.

BENGALURU: Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now, forcing them to rely on very few private water tankers to meet their daily needs. The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand, and each household is spending anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 every month on water.BWSSB officials attribute the delay in addressing the issue to the pending activation of Cauvery Stage 5.Rishabh Aditya, a software engineer and new father, shared the difficulties faced by his family due to irregular water supply. ""I have an infant at home, and water has become a top priority for us. We need it for cooking, cleaning, and giving warm baths to the baby. Unfortunately, we receive no support from BWSSB, and we are forced to rely on tankers,"" he said.Aditya described the frustration of having to stay awake until late at night to ensure water delivery. ""Tankers supply water based on who books first. With more than 100 people in the layout, we often have to wait until 1am, which is exhausting,"" he said.The cost of water from tankers varies, with residents paying anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000 for a 5,000-litre load. For larger families, the expenses quickly add up. Naveenchandra Keshavmurthy, another resident, shared that his household spends Rs 20,000 to Rs 35,000 each month on water. ""We are in absolute misery because of the lack of BWSSB water supply. Despite our complaints, nothing has been done,"" he maintained.Senior citizens living in the area are also feeling the pinch, especially those who rely on pension and savings. Jaishankar V, an elderly resident, expressed concern over the financial strain caused by the ongoing crisis. ""It is painful for us, especially those who are retired. Depending on tankers every day is draining our savings, and monthly costs are overwhelming just for basic water supply,"" he lamented.Venkateshwar, a local tanker owner, said the challenges faced by operators in sourcing and supplying water to the area. ""There is a huge demand for water here, and it is difficult for us to source enough to meet everyone's needs. We charge reasonable rates, but residents still complain.""The residents approached BWSSB officials multiple times, but have only received assurances. According to BWSSB chairman Ram Prasath Manohar, the delay is due to the pending release of Cauvery Stage 5 water. ""These layouts, including Kamadhenu, were developed in 110 villages, and water supply was not originally allocated for them. However, in a few weeks, they will receive water from BWSSB. We are working to address the tanker mafia problem in the area,"" he said.","Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now.

Bilkis Bano convicts' case: SC refuses to review its 'extreme observations' against Gujarat government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bilkis-bano-convicts-case-sc-refuses-to-review-its-extreme-observations-against-gujarat-government/articleshow/113703829.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the Gujarat government 's plea seeking a review of its January 8 verdict in Bilkis Bano convicts' case over certain observations made against the state.“We are satisfied that there is no error apparent on the face of the record or any merit in the review petitions, warranting reconsideration of the order impugned.The review petitions are, accordingly, dismissed,” the apex court said.The Gujarat government in February had filed a petition requesting a review of Supreme Court's January 8 judgment that overturned the remission granted to the 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano case. The government contended that certain remarks made in the judgment were not only ""highly inappropriate and contradictory to the case record"" but had also ""caused significant harm to the state"".The Gujarat government had objected to the Supreme Court's observation in its January 8 judgment, which stated that ""the state of Gujarat acted in tandem and was complicit with Respondent No3/accused"". The government argued that this remark was unwarranted, contrary to the case record, and had seriously prejudiced the petitioner-state of Gujarat.In its review petition, the Gujarat government cited nine grounds to assert that the apex court erred in making the remark by not appreciating the correct facts of the case. The government clarified that it had sought opinions from all relevant authorities, including the Mumbai court that conducted the trial and the SP, through the superintendent of Godhra sub jail where the convicts were lodged. The proposal was sent to the Maharashtra government in November 2011, but no response was received.The Supreme Court, in its January judgment, noted that had the Gujarat government brought it to the court's notice that it was not the ""appropriate government"" to decide on the remission of the 11 life convicts in the 2002 Bilkis Bano case, the ensuing litigation could have been avoided. The court stated that the Gujarat government usurped the power of the Maharashtra government in deciding on the release of the convicts, as the trial was conducted in a CBI court in Maharashtra.Ultimately, the Supreme Court overturned the Gujarat government's decision to grant early release to the 11 convicts in the 2002 gang-rape of Bilkis Bano and the murder of seven of her family members during the communal riots in the state.","The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the Gujarat government's plea seeking a review of its January 8 verdict in Bilkis Bano convicts' case.

(KMF)

How KMF functions today

NEW DELHI: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam ( TTD ) has appointed ‘ Nandini ’ as the new ghee supplier, with the supply order already issued to the company. The Andhra Pradesh government took this action amid controversy over the alleged adulteration of laddus at the Tirupati temple, following claims of the use of animal fat and other substances.‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.It is Karnataka’s biggest milk brand and is also recognised in neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Goa. The ‘Nandini’ brand is owned by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Limited ( KMF ), the second-largest dairy cooperative in India, after Gujarat’s Amul.The current managing director and CEO of KMF is Karnataka administrative service officer MK Jagdish.KMF’s history dates back to 1955, when the first dairy cooperative was established in the Kodagu district of Karnataka. At that time, there was no system of packaged milk, and farmers delivered milk directly to households. There was also a shortage of milk. It wasn't until the 1970s, during India’s ‘White Revolution,’ that efforts to increase milk production took hold, supported by World Bank projects.In 1974, the Karnataka government created the Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (KDCC) to implement these dairy projects. By 1984, KDCC was renamed the Karnataka Milk Federation, and it began selling packaged milk and other products under the brand name ‘Nandini.’ Over time, ‘Nandini’ grew into Karnataka’s most popular dairy brand and expanded to neighbouring states.KMF operates 15 dairy unions throughout Karnataka, including the Bengaluru, Kolar, and Mysore Cooperative Milk Unions. These unions buy milk from village-level Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS) and deliver it to KMF for processing. According to the Karnataka Milk Federation’s website, KMF purchases over 86 lakh kilos of milk daily from 26 lakh farmers in 24,000 villages.One of KMF’s standout features is its daily payment system for milk suppliers, who are mainly small farmers and producers. The federation distributes more than Rs 28 crore in daily payments. KMF has 15 units that process and package milk, which is then sold through various channels.","‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.

"15.5 lakh Indians visited US till August, 2024 to see new high",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/15-5-lakh-indians-visited-us-till-august-2024-to-see-new-high/articleshow/113716835.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: A record number of Indians are all set to travel to the US this year. While CY 2023’s figure of 17.6 lakh desis in America had already overtaken the pre-Covid 2019 high of 14.7 lakh, this year in just eight months from Jan to Aug over 15.5 lakh Indians have been there. By the time student season Sept is over, last year’s figure could either have been matched or bested, setting a new high.While the strong Indian diaspora of 51 lakh in the US means large visiting friends and relatives travel from here, there is very strong business and student travel also.“India-US relations have never been better and people to people ties represent that. In Jan-Aug 2024, India has emerged as the second largest overseas source market of international visitors to the US,” Jonathan M Heimer, minister counsellor for commercial affairs in the US Embassy, Delhi, said Thursday. Canada and Mexico, which share a land border with the US, send the highest number of international visitors to the US. In 2023, India was the third largest overseas source country (not accounting Canada & Mexico) after the UK and Germany. This Jan-Aug, India has overtaken Germany. In 2019, India was the 10biggest source market overall for the US and eighth biggest overseas.While the US mission has been issuing record visas in India, the demand is so high that the wait period for an interview-required visitor visa (as on Thursday as per US State Dept website) was 477 days in Kolkata; 466 in Delhi; 433 in Chennai; 352 in Hyderabad and 312 in Mumbai. What is clearly paying off is the US policy of issuing 10-year, multiple entry visas to successful applicants, leading to a high number of repeat visits — something that can’t happen to nearer Europe due to Schengen States issuing mostly short term visas. So repeat visits mean going through the excruciating paperwork-heavy Schengen visa application process repeatedly for a majority of desi travellers.Canada and Mexico send the highest number of international visitors.

SC's collegium mulled transfer of Karnataka judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scs-collegium-mulled-transfer-of-karnataka-judge/articleshow/113715852.cms,"Justice V Srishananda (Photo credit: Karnataka judiciary website)

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court 's top five judges, part of the collegium for transfer of HC judges and comprised the bench that had taken suo motu cognisance of Justice V Srishananda 's unwarranted gratuitous remarks, had mulled transferring him outside Karnataka HC.Between September 20, when the bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud , and Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B R Gavai, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy took cognisance of Justice Srishananda 's remarks, and Sept 25, when it admonished him prior to closing the case, the collegium comprising the same five judges had weighed the option of shifting the judge outside his parent HC.As the Karnataka HC Registrar General's Sept 23 report, prepared in consultation with the HC chief justice N V Anjaria, referred to many past gratuitous and unwarranted observations of Justice Srishananda, the five-member Collegium deliberated on the option of shifting the judge to another HC to register SC's strong objection to such remarks.Interestingly, a day after the SC took suo motu cognisance of Justice Srishananda's June 6 gender insensitive remark and Aug 28 illogical reference to a Bengaluru locality as 'part of Pakistan', the judge during the post-lunch session of court proceedings on Sept 21 said that his observations were unintentional and tendered apology in open court.The regret and promise to mend his ways crept into deliberations of the collegium, with some judges opposing transfer proposal on three grounds - Justice Srishananda has realised and regretted his mistake and this, along with the clarification that he did not wish to hurt any individual or community and apology tendered suo motu should be treated as mitigating factors.They also cautioned that a transfer would become a precedent warranting transfer of all the outspoken judges as well as an incentive for the vigilantes who would be encouraged to pluck a seemingly controversial remark and wrench it from the context to set up a campaign against judges they don't like.The reservations saw the Collegium failing to reach unanimity on whether to transfer Justice Srishananda leading them to settle suo motu judicial proceedings being taken to the logical conclusion on Sept 25.Taking a larger view even as they admonished the erring judge, the five-judge bench Wednesday laid down basic parameters for a judge's conduct in a courtroom saying they, as well as all stakeholders including lawyers, should be mindful of what they say in a courtroom as live telecast and video conferencing facilities reach the judicial proceedings to a vast audience beyond the courtrooms.The bench closed the proceedings saying, ""Courts therefore have to be careful not to make comments which may be construed as misogynistic or prejudicial to certain sections of our society... We emphasise this point, as it is necessary for every stakeholder in the institution to understand that the values which must not die are the values enshrined in the Constitution (Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity).""",Supreme Court's top five judges had mulled transferring Justice V Srishananda outside Karnataka HC.

Tough bail terms not tool to keep people in jail: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rigid-bail-provisions-cant-be-used-as-tool-for-long-captivity-sc/articleshow/113715631.cms,"The Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Observing that rigorous bail provisions in statutes like PMLA , anti-terror law UAPA and NDPS Act cannot become a 'tool' to keep an undertrial accused in jail for unreasonably long time, Supreme Court on Thursday held that the requirement of expeditious disposal of cases must be read into these statutes as inordinate delay in the conclusion of the trial and the higher threshold for the grant of bail cannot go together.The directive to the executive to take a fresh look at the laws where the onus is on the accused to prove his innocence came from a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih while hearing the bail petition of the former Tamil Nadu minister Senthil Balaji . Though the bench agreed that there was a prima facie case against Balaji in a money laundering case arising from cash-for-jobs scam dating to his 2011- 2016 tenure as transport minister in AIADMK government, it decided to give him bail on the ground that the TN politician had already spent 15 months in jail and there was no likelihood of the case being concluded in near future, considering that the case involves 2,000 accused and 500 witnesses.Examining the evidence against Balaji, the bench said there is no reason, at this stage, to doubt its authenticity of the soft files and there is also prima facie material to show a deposit of cash amount of Rs.1.34 crore in his bank account. ""At this stage, the contention of the appellant regarding the deposit of remuneration received as MLA and agriculture income cannot be accepted in the absence of any prima facie evidence to show the existence of the appellant's cash income as MLA and the appellant's agriculture income. Therefore, at this stage, it will be very difficult to hold that there is no prima facie case against the appellant..,"" it said.The ED could not be permitted to use stringent bail provision Section 45(1)(ii) as a instrument to keep an accused in custody for long period, held Justices Oka and Masih. The bench imposed stringent conditions on Balaji- he has to report to ED every Monday and Friday and has to be present in courts holding trial in corruption and money laundering cases.A prominent politician who was was the target of an intense campaign by DMK which accused him of corruption, Balaji switched sides. He was a minister when he was taken into custody. The apex court court noted in its verdict that a higher threshold has been provided in these statutes for the grant of bail as reflected in Section 45(1)(ii) of PMLA, proviso to Section 43D(5) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and Section 37 of the NDPS Act, overriding the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code.""Considering the gravity of the offences in such statutes, expeditious disposal of trials for the crimes under these statutes is contemplated. Moreover, such statutes contain provisions laying down higher threshold for the grant of bail. It is a well-settled principle of our criminal jurisprudence that bail is the rule, and jail is the exception. These stringent provisions regarding grant of bail, such as Section 45(1)(iii) of PMLA, cannot become a tool which can be used to incarcerate the accused without trial for an unreasonably long time,” SC said.SC held that prolonged incarceration without trial is violative of rights of an accused and the court should step in to protect him and no provision can take away the power of constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of fundamental rights.“When trial of the complaint under PMLA is likely to prolong beyond reasonable limits, Constitutional Courts will have to consider exercising their powers to grant bail. The reason is that Section 45 (1)(ii) does not confer power on State to detain an accused for an unreasonably long time, especially when there is no possibility of trial concluding within reasonable time.”",Supreme Court held that the requirement of expeditious disposal of cases must be read into these statutes. The bench agreed that there was a prima facie case against Balaji in a money laundering case arising from cash-for-jobs scam dating to his 2011- 2016 tenure as transport minister in AIADMK government.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113715691,imgsize-804301,width-400,resizemode-4/113715691.jpg"

'UN remains prisoner of the past': Jaishankar



NEW DELHI: In a major boost to India's efforts to secure a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), President Emmanuel Macron of France said on Thursday that he was fully in support of expanding the body to make it more inclusive and representative of the changing world order.Addressing the UN General Assembly, Macron said: ""France is in favour of the Security Council being expanded.Germany , Japan, India and Brazil should become permanent members, as well as two countries that Africa would designate to represent it.""But this reform alone would not be enough to restore the Council's effectiveness, he warned, calling for a change in the body’s working methods, a limitation of the right of veto in cases of mass crimes, and more attention to operational decisions required for maintaining peace.“The time has come to regain efficiency in order to act better on the ground,” he concluded.The backdrop of this diplomatic push includes recent challenges faced by the UN in addressing global crises, such as the deadlock over conflicts like the Ukraine war and issues in Gaza. These situations have led to calls for reforming the UNSC to enhance its effectiveness and credibility. Jaishankar noted that as perceptions of the UN's weakening grow, so too do India's chances of securing a permanent seat.India's push for a permanent seat has gained momentum recently, particularly following a joint statement from the Quad nations—comprising the United States, India, Japan, and Australia—during their sixth summit.The statement reiterated support for UNSC reform and emphasized the need to make it more inclusive and representative.US President Joe Biden reaffirmed this support during bilateral talks with PM Narendra Modi, highlighting India's significant contributions to international peacekeeping and its status as the world's largest democracy.Moreover, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated America's support for India's bid during a recent summit at the UN General Assembly. He emphasized that reforming the UNSC should include permanent seats for India, Japan, and Germany, alongside representation for Africa and other regions.Blinken's remarks underscore a broader recognition among key global players that India's inclusion would enhance the legitimacy and functionality of the UNSC.Currently, only five countries are permanent members of UNSC and have veto powers: US, China, France, Russia and UK. Besides the five permanent members, there are ten non-permanent members in UNSC, who are elected for two-year terms by the UN General Assembly.All the permanent members, except for China, have in some way supported the expansion of the UNSC.The existing structure has been criticized for being outdated and unrepresentative of current geopolitical realities, particularly as the number of UN member states has grown from approximately 50 at its inception to 193 today.During his recent address at the 2nd G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting - held on the sidelines of UNGA 79 -- external affairs minister S Jaishankar said that the United Nations is a prisoner of the past and it must evolve with the world.""The areas of global governance reform... First is the reform of the UN and its subsidiary bodies. The world has evolved into a smart, interconnected, and multipolar arena, and its members have increased fourfold since UN's inception. Yet, the UN remains a prisoner of the past. As a result, the UN Security Council struggles to fulfil its mandate of maintaining international peace and stability, undermining its effectiveness and credibility,"" he said.Jaishankar said that the Global South must be given their legitimate voice.""Without reforms, including expansion in both categories of UNSC membership, its lack of effectiveness will only continue. Expansion and proper representation in the permanent category is a particular imperative. Asia, Africa, and Latin America- the global south cannot continue to be short-changed. They must be given their legitimate voice. Real change needs to happen and happen fast,"" he said.","President Emmanuel Macron of France said on Thursday that he was fully in support of expanding the body to make it more inclusive and representative of the changing world order.

"Very healthy, very democratic: Foreign observers on J&K polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/very-healthy-very-democratic-foreign-observers-on-jk-polls/articleshow/113679402.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the first time, elections in Jammu and Kashmir are being held under global spotlight, with senior diplomats from 16 countries invited to observe voting at polling stations in the Union territory. The international observers on Wednesday voiced their validation of the polls, with the US diplomat describing them as “very healthy and very democratic” and the Singapore representative calling them “comparable” to elections in her country.“It is great to see the enthusiasm... to see Kashmiris voting after a pause of 10 years. We are very excited to see the results... It looks very healthy and very democratic,” US deputy chief of the mission in Delhi, Jorgan K Andrews, was quoted by PTI as saying.“I am glad that all the voters showed up. That’s wonderful to see,” said Singapore deputy head of the mission in Delhi, Cheng Wei Wei Alice. South Korean diplomat Sang Woo Lim said it was special to witness how democracy works and appreciated the idea of all-women ‘pink polling stations’.On the invitation of the external affairs ministry, senior diplomats from the US, South Korea, Spain, Mexico, Singapore, South Africa, Norway, Nigeria, Tanzania, the Philippines, Guyana, Somalia, Panama, Rwanda and Algeria toured polling stations in Ompora (Budgam) and Amira Kadal and S P College, Chinar Bagh, which falls in Lal Chowk assembly constituency. These polling stations had recorded very low turnouts in 2019 Lok Sabha polls.With a 61.4% turnout in Phase 1 and over 57% (provisional) in Phase 2, chief election commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar on Wednesday described the J&K elections as “history in the making”. He told reporters here, “The people of J&K are standing in long queues outside polling booths at places where boycott calls were once given. It is a standing ovation for democracy..It is history in the making, echoes of which will be heard for posterity.”Wednesday’s overall turnout was higher as compared to the 2024 Lok Sabha polls (52.2%) but lower than the 61.8% turnout recorded in the 2014 assembly polls in the same districts. Turnouts were higher across the Valley’s Budgam, Ganderbal and Srinagar districts as compared to 2024 LS polls, but significantly lower in Ganderbal and Budgam, when compared with the 2014 assembly polls. Though Srinagar district recorded a low turnout of around 29.8% (provisional), it is better than the 24.8% and 27.7% polling recorded in both 2024 LS elections and 2014 J&K polls respectively.In Jammu division, all three districts — Reasi, Rajouri and Poonch — recorded lower turnouts than the 2014 assembly polls. Polling in Rajouri and Poonch was better than in 2024 LS elections, but slightly lower in Reasi. While Reasi, where the decline was the sharpest since 2014, had seen a major terror attack in June with nine persons killed after terrorists fired on a bus, Rajouri and Poonch have seen fierce encounters between the security forces and terrorists in the recent months.Both US diplomat Andrews and Alice from Singapore on Wednesday said the J&K polls were similar to those in their respective countries, with the US using schools and Singapore, government buildings, for polling stations.South Korean diplomat Lim said: “It is my first time here in Kashmir. It is special to witness how democracy works. This idea of a pink polling station is very ingenuous.

NEW DELHI: The Andhra Pradesh BJP has called upon YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to publicly ""declare his faith"" ahead of his planned pilgrimage to the Tirumala temple amid allegations over adulterated "" prasadam "" sold during the YSRCP leader's tenure.Jagan Reddy is scheduled to visit the Lord Venkateswara Swamy temple on September 28 at Tirumala Hills as part of a series of temple ceremonies organized by his party across the state.The YRCP's rituals are aimed at ""atoning for the sin"" allegedly committed by chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu , who accused the YSRCP of using substandard ingredients, including animal fat, in the making of Tirupati laddus .""We are given to understand that Jagan Mohan Reddy intends to visit Tirumala on the 28th of this month. The practice of declaring one's faith has been in vogue for decades in Tirumala. As per G.O. MS NO- 311 of AP Revenue Endowments -- 1, Rule no 16, Non Hindus must give a declaration at Vaikuntam que complex before darshan in the faith form. This is also as per TTD general regulations Rule 136,"" said Andhra Pradesh BJP chiefDaggubati Purandeswari .Purandeswari further said that the Andhra Pradesh ex-chief minister ""should give the declaration of his faith at the Garuda Statue itself at Alipiri"".As per rule number 136 and 137 of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD)'s general rules, only Hindus should be allowed to worship at the Tirumala temple and every non-Hindu should voluntarily inform TTD about his religion and seek permission to gain entry into the Tirumala temple after signing the declaration for non-Hindus.Though this guideline has been in vogue for several decades now, an amendment was brought to the rule in the AP Endowments Act in 2014, according to which TTD will have to identify the devotees' religion going by their facial features.CM Naidu sparked controversy by alleging that animal fat was mixed in the ghee used to prepare the famous Tirumala laddu during the term of the previous YSRCP government led by Jagan Mohan Reddy.YSRCP denied the allegations and said Naidu was making wild statements for political reasons . Naidu said that he was astonished to find that poor-quality material was used to prepare Lord Venkateswara's ""prasadam"".A day after Naidu's claim, his government made public a laboratory analysis report of the cow ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala temple trust for making its laddu.It revealed the presence of foreign fats including lard (clarified pig fat), tallow (beef fat) and fish oil. The report, however, is silent whether the adulterants were deliberately added or crept in through feeding conditions and other factors.Naidu's allegation and the NDDB's report have shocked millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe as the Tirupati laddus are considered Maha Prasadam and carry a high sentimental value.As the controversy spiralled into a massive outrage, the Centre weighed in and sought a full report on the issue and Union health minister JP Nadda assured that the government would further the matter and take suitable actions.During a press conference, Nadda said that he spoke to Naidu after the controversy erupted and announced speaking to state regulators for a thorough investigation. The temple trust prepares about three lakh laddus daily and the ""prasadam"" is held in high regard by devotees.After reports of beef fat and fish oil being found in the cow ghee samples used to make the Tirupati 'laddu prasadam,' the temple trust said that the sanctity of the ""prasadam"" was restored . The trust said that they have also stalled the use of cow-based products temporarily for making Srivari Prasadams.During YSRCP's tenure in government, TTD had given the ghee supply contract to a private contractor, replacing the ""Nandini"" brand of ghee, a product of Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF).Following the change in supplier, there were several complaints over the quality of the laddu. The NDA government on August 29 signed a contract once again with KMF for ghee. TTD utilises about 10,000 kg of ghee every day for the laddu ""prasadam"".","Jagan Mohan Reddy is scheduled to visit the Lord Venkateswara Swamy temple on September 28 at Tirumala Hills.

The high court of Bombay at Goa on Thursday pulled up the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) for sealing the fish market building and displacing two occupants of the higher floors who had status quo orders in their favour from a lower court.During the hearing, senior advocate J E Coelho Pereira, representing CCP, told the HC that the building was in a dangerous state and that continuous rain posed a threat to its stability.Based on a report from the talathi, it sealed the building, he said. However, the court said CCP should have gone to the court and sought vacation of the court order first.The division bench, comprising chief justice of the Bombay high court Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice M S Karnik, asked CCP who gave it the authority to defy orders passed by a competent court.The bench said it understood the need to demolish the building, but asked what happened to the rule of law.“This erodes the rule of law,” the bench stated.Besides these two occupants, several meat vendors operating on the ground floor of the building knocked on the HC’s doors seeking rehabilitation after CCP sealed the building last month.Over the past few hearings, the court has been asking CCP to find space for the meat vendors in the market, but CCP has been maintaining that the meat vendors are not their tenants and that there is no space in the market to rehabilitate them. It also said it would have to provide them with shops as they require electricity connections, and that it doesn’t have any shops to give themDuring the last hearing, CCP told the HC it is relocating vendors who sell fish below the same building.The HC will hear the matter again on Friday.",The high court of Bombay at Goa pulled up the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) for sealing the fish market building.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

(Picture credit: AP)

California governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law on Thursday, formally apologizing for slavery and its effects on Black Americans in the state.As per the news agency AP, this law is part of a series of reparations bills aimed at addressing racial disparities that have persisted for decades.""The State of California accepts responsibility for the role we played in promoting, facilitating, and permitting the institution of slavery, as well as its enduring legacy of persistent racial disparities,"" Governor Newsom said in a statement.Earlier, Newsom vetoed a bill that would have helped Black families reclaim or receive compensation for property taken through eminent domain . This bill could not take full effect because another bill to create a reparations agency was blocked.Though California has made significant progress, there was no legislation this year for direct payments to African Americans, disappointing some advocates. However, Newsom approved a budget in June that included up to $12 million for reparations legislation.Additionally, Newsom has signed laws to improve outcomes for students of colour in K-12 career education programs. Another proposal to ban forced labour as a crime punishment will be on the ballot in November.State assembly member Isaac Bryan, a Democrat from Culver City, authored a bill to increase oversight over books banned in state prisons . The new law allows the Office of the Inspector General to review and assess the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation reasons for banning certain books.""We need transparency in this process,"" Bryan said. ""We need to know what books are banned, and we need a mechanism for removing books off of that list.""California, although entering the union as a free state in 1850, implemented policies that hindered Black people from owning homes and starting businesses. According to a state reparations task force report, Black families faced terrorism, aggressive policing, and pollution in their neighbourhoods.While efforts to study reparations at the federal level have stalled, states like Illinois and New York and cities like Boston and New York City have taken steps to study reparations. Evanston, Illinois, launched a program providing housing assistance to Black residents for past discrimination.","California governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law on Thursday, formally apologizing for slavery and its effects on Black Americans in the state.

Kamala Harris: Kamala Harris' climate advocacy questioned as presidential campaign racks up millions in private jet expenses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-climate-advocacy-questioned-as-presidential-campaign-racks-up-millions-in-private-jet-expenses/articleshow/113715987.cms,"US vice president Kamala Harris (Photo: Reuters)

US vice president Kamala Harris ’ presidential campaign has come under debate for its extensive use of private jets , spending millions on air travel despite her strong advocacy for urgent climate action , as per Fox News . Harris secured the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden announced that he would not seek re-election. The campaign has spent at least $3.8 million on private flights in just six weeks, according to a review of Federal Election Commission (FEC) records.The Harris campaign made payments to various private jet companies, including Advanced Aviation Team, Private Jet Services Group, Principal Aviation, and FlexJet between July 24 and August 30.The largest share of the payments went to Advanced Aviation, a company offering luxurious aircraft ranging from smaller jets for short trips to ultra-long-range planes with amenities and flight attendants for journeys up to 16 hours.Harris’ campaign’s use of private jets has sparked criticism due to the significant environmental impact of such travel. According to the National Library of Medicine, private aviation is the most energy-intensive form of air travel, using 10 to 20 times more fuel per passenger than commercial flights.Harris has long positioned herself as a champion of climate action, referring to climate change as an “existential threat” to humanity. During a 2019 interview with CNN, she said, ""There’s no question we have to be practical. But being practical also recognises that climate change is an existential threat to us as human beings... it is well within our capacity to change our behaviours in a way that reduces its effects.""At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2023, Harris said, “The clock is no longer just ticking, it is banging... We need transformative change and exponential impact.” She has also expressed concern about the effect of climate change on younger generations, noting that “climate anxiety” has left some hesitant to have children.The Biden-Harris administration has set ambitious climate goals for the aviation industry, aiming for a 20% reduction in aviation emissions by 2030, with a target of net-zero emissions by 2050.","US vice president Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has come under debate for its extensive use of private jets.

Elon Musk has responded after being excluded from the United Kingdom government’s upcoming International Investment Summit set for October 14, reportedly due to his recent social media posts, as per BBC News .The billionaire, known for his often provocative remarks on X, aimed at the UK in response and said. ""I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts,"" he wrote on X.His comments referred to recent UK policies aimed at reducing prison overcrowding, though the government has clarified that no individuals convicted of sex offences were released.The tech tycoon exclusion follows last month’s UK riots, which erupted after a fatal stabbing in Southport, resulting in the deaths of three children. During the unrest, some were jailed for inciting violence via social media. Musk’s own posts during the period, including a now-deleted conspiracy theory about ""detainment camps"" for rioters on the Falkland Islands, sparked criticism. Officials at the time condemned his remarks as ""totally unjustifiable"" and ""pretty deplorable.""The International Investment Summit is a critical event where Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hopes to attract foreign investment to boost the UK economy.

""He behaves like a child and posts things that are deeply inaccurate and extremely damaging,"" Yelland told the BBC.While the government declined to comment on Musk’s absence from the summit, former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt expressed disappointment, calling it a ""big loss"" and noting that Musk had previously considered UK as a site for a new Tesla plant.","Elon Musk has responded after being excluded from the UK government's upcoming International Investment Summit.
