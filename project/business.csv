Pune GBS outbreak could be one of the largest in world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pune-gbs-outbreak-could-be-one-of-the-largest-in-world/articleshow/117811903.cms,"MUMBAI: As 18 of 140 patients with the debilitating neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), are on ventilator support in Pune, there is some cold comfort in knowing this isn't the worst outbreak in the world - yet. It could, however, be considered one of the largest GBS outbreaks as medical literature classified 30 to 50 cases as an outbreak until 2019 when Peru registered the worst flare-up.The South American country had 1,120 cases in 2019, with 683 cases reported in two months. Its annual caseload stood at 59 in 2017 and rose to 262 in 2018 before peaking in 2019. Cases were recorded from across the country, but there is little data on deaths. The story didn't end there; Peru witnessed an outbreak again in 2023, when 130 suspected cases were reported between June 10 and July 15.The problem with GBS, as a professor of medicine in a medical college in Mumbai said, is that it is an autoimmune condition that technically doesn't seem like an epidemic-causing condition. ""GBS has been seen as an independent disorder that is sporadically seen across the country, but we now need to change our mindset and accept it can emerge as an outbreak and study it epidemiologically to look for links between the patients,"" he said.The only link between Peru and Pune is microbe Campylobacter jejuni . Smaller studies from across the world show GBS following this infection is linked with higher disability and mortality rates.GBS has been so rare - India has a reported annual incidence of 1.75 to 2 per lakh population - that there are few in-depth studies. The first-ever detailed analysis of the prevalence and disability burden of GBS was conducted in 2021. Using data between 1990 and 2019, the analysis showed that Japan, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, South Korea, the US and Mexico had much higher than expected burdens, while countries and territories such as China, Fiji, Taiwan, and Guam had much lower than expected burdens.","18 of 140 patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome are on ventilator support in Pune.

Will this Budget make TDS less tedious for businesses?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-this-budget-make-tds-less-tedious-for-businesses/articleshow/117810066.cms,"Confusion Galore:

In its first full Budget on July 23, 2024, the re-elected govt had announced a revamp of the Income-Tax Act to make it simpler and easier to understand. This exercise has commenced, and with Budget 2025 almost here, businesses are expecting simplification of the tax deduction at source (TDS) provisions as part of the Budget itself, as govt is stated to be committed to easing tax compliance .The TDS system, a pivotal instrument for govt to pre-emptively collect taxes and gather transactional data, has become quite cumbersome over the years. A beginning to ease TDS compliance was made in Budget 2024 and one hopes this initiative continues in the coming Budget also.The present TDS framework has been criticised for its complexity and the administrative burden it imposes on both tax deductors and deductees. In Budget 2024, govt took steps towards simplification by harmonising TDS rates to a uniform 2% for certain transactions and decriminalising delays in TDS payment up to the due date of filing the statement. However, there are several other complexities and there is a call for further simplification.The current labyrinth of TDS rates with 30-plus sections prescribing rates ranging from 0.1% to 30% has been a source of confusion for taxpayers. The current regime still contains multiple rates such as 0.1% (on sale of goods), 1%/ 2% (on contract payments), 5% (on insurance commission), 10% (on dividend and interest) and 30% on lottery winnings and cryptocurrency gains), to illustrate a few. TDS rates may vary depending on the payee's status (company or non-company) and the nature of the payment. Thresholds also differ according to provisions, leading to a cumbersome process for payers.The rate differential also leads to classification challenges. For example, a rate of 2% is prescribed for fees for technical services while the same section provides for a rate of 10% on fees for professional services. As a result, payers tend to follow a conservative approach to avoid any tax challenges (such as disallowance of expenditure for short deduction of tax, and levy of penalty) and deduct tax at a higher rate in case of doubt.The Solution: Simplification could involve rationalisation of TDS rates and reducing the existing multi-tier rate structure to just 3-4 rates. This, coupled with eliminating redundant provisions, would alleviate administrative burden, allowing businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises, to focus on growth and innovation.Some of the TDS provisions were introduced by govt as a primary tool to collect information about the taxpayers such as TDS of sale of goods. With technological advancements and exchange of data between various departments such as with GST authorities, enough data is available with the government. In fact, due to the receipt of data in multiple formats and from multiple sources, there are often challenges in reporting at the tax department's end as well (such as disclosures in annual information statements). Hence, doing away with such TDS (introduced with the aim of data collation) can be considered.The Income-Tax Act has provisions for prosecution in case of wilful default in paying TDS. At present, however, there are no timelines prescribed for initiation and completion of such proceedings. Introducing time limits can lead to the proceedings being completed in a time bound manner and companies or directors will not have a sword hanging over them.The upcoming Budget is a good opportunity for govt to kickstart more simplification initiatives. A reduced compliance burden could translate into significant cost savings and operational efficiencies for businesses. The hope is that Budget 2025 will usher in a new era for the TDS system, making it more equitable, efficient, and straightforward.(The writer is director, tax & regulatory services, EY India.

"Kolkata weather: AQI improves as temperature rises, 5 of 7 stations in ‘satisfactory’ zone",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/temp-rises-aqi-improves-5-of-7-stns-in-satisfactory-zone/articleshow/117795741.cms,"KOLKATA: The city witnessed an extraordinary recovery in air quality on the last day of Jan, with five out of seven automatic air quality monitoring stations in the city registering ‘satisfactory' levels, marked by a light green AQI band (AQI: 51-100) for the first time this winter.This improvement was driven by a rise in the minimum temperature by 6 degrees Celsius, which largely negated the effects of thermal inversion that typically worsen air pollution during winter.Thermal inversion restricts vertical wind movement due to lower radiative temperatures at the ground level, creating calm wind conditions that prevent pollutants from dispersing, thereby leading to a spike in pollution levels.However, with the warming trend, dispersal mechanisms became more effective, allowing air quality to recover significantly across the city.Salt Lake, where the International Kolkata Book Fair is currently being held, emerged as the cleanest air zone, much to the relief of book lovers and visitors, as the air quality gradually improved throughout the day.Meanwhile, Ballygunge, which was the most polluted zone in recent days, showed the most significant recovery, returning to a ‘satisfactory' AQI level. In contrast, the Rabindra Bharati University (BT Road) monitoring station, which previously boasted the best air quality in the city, recorded a deterioration to ‘moderate' (AQI: 101-200), along with Victoria Memorial Hall (VMH), which was found to be the worst polluted zone in the city, said a PCB official.Hourly AQI readings reflected these trends. At 5 am, Ballygunge had an AQI of 84, which improved slightly to 81 by 11 am and remained steady through the afternoon before rising marginally to 83 by 7 pm.Salt Lake recorded an AQI of 76 at 5 am, improving to 68 by 11 am and maintaining that level throughout the day. Fort William's AQI remained consistently below 100, while Jadavpur showed a slight improvement from 90 at 5 am to 88 at 1 pm before stabilising.RBU (BT Road) showed a moderate AQI trend, starting at 102 and gradually worsening to 104 by 7 pm. Rabindra Sarobar displayed steady improvement, moving from 79 at 5 am to 72 by 7 pm.However, Victoria Memorial Hall stood out as the worst-affected area, with pollution levels worsening from 156 at 5 am to 164 by 7 pm, maintaining a ‘moderate' status throughout the day.While most of Kolkata saw an encouraging trend, the worsening pollution at Victoria Memorial and RBU is largely driven by automobile emissions and construction and demolition activities, respectively, said sources.","Kolkata saw an extraordinary recovery in air quality on the last day of Jan.

Although his govt, as Murmu stressed, has reduced the tax burden and has also widened and deepened the welfare net, there seems to be a feeling in govt that the affection of the two constituencies needed to be reciprocated. This ties in with the opinion of many economists that relief to the middle and new-middle classes will help govt's effort to accelerate growth by boosting consumption.Murmu flagged the recent decision to constitute 8th Pay Commission for central govt employees.""Govt employees are significant representatives of the middle class. So, this decision will lay the foundation for substantial salary increases for govt employees in the coming years,"" she said.""Centre has decided to provide 50% assured pension to lakhs of employees under Unified Pension Scheme, which is widely welcomed.

But in the past, marriages took place at a very young age. So, we included them to cover any such cases that might still exist today.""As per the Act, individuals seeking to marry or enter a live-in relation within these categories must obtain a certificate from their religious clergy confirming that such unions are permitted under their customs. UCC defines clergy as ""any person who conducts marriage ceremonies in accordance with customs and practices of the community concerned.""Gaur said even with a religious certificate, the registrar may still reject such applications if they violate public policy and morality.UCC rules explicitly state that a registrar can refuse to register a relationship if the applicants are closely related by blood or family ties and their marriage is either not permitted by their customs or, even if allowed, contradicts public policy and moral standards, he said, adding, applicants can appeal against such decisions before the registrar general within 30 days.Archana Pal, assistant professor of sociology at DAV college, said exceptions listed under the Act ""undermine its purpose of bringing uniformity."" ""When we provide exceptions, it creates loopholes and encourages society to find ways to come under the gambit of that exception,"" she said.Social organisations in Dehradun are planning an agitation to bring attention to concerns about the Act and to urge govt to address public fears.","Uttarakhand government has listed 37 ""prohibited relationships"" each for men and women under the newly-implemented Uniform Civil Code (UCC) These relationships, detailed in Schedule 1 of the Act, primarily involve blood relatives, extended family, and certain connections spanning three generations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117802034,imgsize-85986,width-400,resizemode-4/117802034.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has directed registration of FIR against the former SHO of Jyoti Nagar police station in the case of a group of men being forced to sing the national anthem and Vande Mataram while lying injured during the 2020 Delhi riots. The court said the cops had ""engaged themselves in hate crimes"", reports Vineet Upadhyay.The court also asked complainant Mohammad Waseem to approach the MP/MLA court to seek registration of an FIR against BJP's Kapil Mishra who had been identified by him on Feb 24, 2020, as allegedly leading an unlawful assembly. The court said the action taken report was silent about the former MLA and either the investigating officer had failed to conduct an inquiry against him or had tried to cover up the allegations.The alleged accused no.3 (Kapil Mishra) is in public eye and is prone to more scrutiny; such persons in society direct the course/mood of the public at large and, thus, responsible behaviour within the ambit of Constitution of India is expected from such persons.""Mishra has been fielded from Karawal Nagar constituency in north-east Delhi by BJP for the assembly elections this month.""Clearly, the SHO PS Jyoti Nagar, Tomar (complete name not provided) and other unknown police officials engaged themselves in hate crimes against the complainant/victim and they cannot be protected under the garb of sanction as alleged offences committed by them cannot be said to have been committed while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of their official duty,"" said the court.The directions from Udbhav Kumar Jain, judicial magistrate first class, came in an order dated Jan 18 while hearing the complaint filed by Waseem. It had sought filing of FIRs against Mishra, the then SHO and others involved in the alleged crimes committed against him and others.The court observed that the action taken report filed by the IO merely denied the allegations but had failed to enlist any substantive steps taken for conducting a preliminary inquiry.""The ATR is also silent on the aspect of CCTV footage pertaining to the date of the alleged incident, which should have been inquired by the IO. Thus, the inquiry pertaining to the alleged acts/offences against the complainant has not been conducted properly,"" said the court.The court directed the current SHO of Jyoti Nagar police station to depute a responsible officer not below the rank of inspector to conduct an investigation in the matter and probe the role of other unknown police officials involved in the commission of the alleged offences.The court said that the FIR should be registered against the former SHO for offences under Section 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code, 1860.Delhi HC had in August 2024 transferred the probe into the death of 23-year-old Faizan who was part of the group to CBI. It has been alleged that Faizan died due to custodial torture by policemen at the Jyoti Nagar police station.The incident relates to a video shot during the 2020 Delhi riots that had gone viral on social media. It showed some Delhi Police personnel beating up the men and forcing them to sing the national anthem and Vande Mataram to prove their patriotism. The policemen were also heard hurling communal slurs.

The next crucial step should have been to confirm whether Campylobacter jejuni , a bacterium commonly linked to GBS outbreaks, was the cause. This detection takes 48 hours.On day 2, Dr John said, health officials should have promptly verified potability of water and tested it for E coli. On the same day, an alert should've been issued warning the public of a possible contamination in the drinking water and urging them to boil it before consumption.By day 3, if the results were confirmed, he said, the municipal corporation should have implemented a hyperchlorination process to disinfect the water and identify the contaminated branches of the water supply.On day 4, with increasing GBS cases from different hospitals, health officials should have created a spot map, declared an outbreak, and announced that the water supply had been cleaned.Once these measures were implemented, Dr John noted, the outbreak would have likely subsided. ""This is how it happens in developed countries. We need to answer now if India has this protocol - that is what a robust public health system is.""A former disease surveillance officer said, ""The surveillance systems are well established, but they need to be fine-tuned to take into account the urban area's growing population. In this case, the health department took the necessary steps early on. However, there are many factors beyond the scope of the health department, such as the quality of water supplied in the city.""He said the outbreak was particularly complex, as GBS itself is not an infectious disease but rather a condition triggered by infectious agents.","Guillain-Barre Syndrome outbreak in Pune could have been controlled in four days.

PM Modi: People should reduce intake of edible oil by 10% to cut obesity risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/people-should-reduce-intake-of-edible-oil-by-10-to-cut-obesity-risk-pm/articleshow/117763507.cms,"NEW DELHI: While physical inactivity, junk food and other factors have drawn a lot of attention for their role in causing lifestyle disorders, and rightly so, edible oil has mostly escaped scrutiny. PM Modi, in his address at the 38th National Games opening ceremony, focused on it and called its excessive use a key factor for rising obesity, while urging for reduced oil intake in all households.Excess consumption of cooking oil, he said, was a key factor behind the rising incidence of obesity. ""Every age group of the country, and even the youth, are being badly affected by it. And this is also a matter of concern because obesity increases the risk of diseases like diabetes, heart disease,"" the PM said.PM Modi appealed to people to reduce oil intake, in addition to working out daily and focusing on a balanced and nutritious diet, leading many to wonder if it was a precursor to a plan focused on tackling obesity by, among other things, discouraging high consumption of edible oil.“In our homes, ration comes at the beginning of the month. Till now, if you used to bring home two litres of cooking oil every month, then reduce it by at least 10%. Reduce the amount of oil we use every day by 10%,” Modi said.He is not alone in sounding the alarm. According to Dr Vineet Kumar Surana, consultant diabetes and endocrinology at Manipal Hospital-Dwarka, when you add excess oil in cooking, it can add hidden calories without causing fullness leading to weight gain and obesity. “One should not consume more than 600-700 ml per month, which translates to approximately 20 ml/day (equivalent to roughly four teaspoons),” he said.Fortis C-Doc chairperson Dr Anoop Misra said, “Normally, people tend to consume double the recom mended amount of oil or more.” To make matters worse, he added, many people tend to reuse oil which is dangerous. “Re-using oil for frying food items leads to an increase in trans-fats that are known to increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke among others,” he said.Apart from quantity, the quality of oil is equally important. The ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (ICMRNIN), says though mustard oil and groundnut oil are very good for cooking, it is best to use a combination of oils either blended or by rotation. e.g. groundnut oil, soya bean oil, sunflower oil, rice bran oil so that one can get the benefit of all. The PM’s call, sources said, suggests the govt is looking to initiate dedicated programmes to tackle and prevent a potential crisis posed by it.The Economic Survey 2023-24 has warned that unhealthy food and sedentary habits don’t just raise the risk of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases and certain types of cancer but they also pose a threat to the country’s economic potential.“For India’s working-age population to be gainfully employed, they need skills and good health. Social media, screen time, sedentary habits and unhealthy food are a lethal mix that can undermine public health and productivity and diminish India’s economic potential,” the survey report said. It adds that the private sector has made substantial contributions to this toxic mix of habits, and that is myopic.It recommended Indian businesses to embrace traditional lifestyle, food and recipes. These have shown how to live healthily and in harmony with nature and the environment for centuries. It makes commercial sense for Indian businesses to learn about and embrace them, for they have a global market waiting to be led rather than tapped, the report said.","Excess consumption of cooking oil, he said, was a key factor behind the rising incidence of obesity.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Key Expectations from Union Budget 2025 for Education Sector

AI Integration in Education

Also See:

“A significant increase in AI funding—potentially 5-10% of the overall education budget—is required to match the ambitious goals outlined in NEP 2020. This investment should prioritize high-speed internet access, advanced digital tools, and dedicated AI labs in schools and colleges,”

Investing in Innovation and Teacher Training

Also See:

“It’s widely accepted that the traditional school system is obsolete. India must leapfrog, not just catch up, by bridging the gap between technology and education, 21st-century skills and today’s schools, and workforce needs and academia. We must create models of excellence—schools that exemplify what the future of education should be,”

“Leapfrogging won’t happen unless teachers and school leaders are ready, equipped, and energized to drive that transformation. This year’s budget must focus not only on capacity building but also on redefining the teacher’s role,”

GST Exemption and Affordable Education for Disadvantaged Students

“The 18% tax slab on higher and online education is excessive. Countries like Switzerland offer free education services, while China’s education tax rate is just 6%. India should take inspiration and make learning more accessible,”





Boosting Startups and Skill Development

Upgrading 1,000 Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) under a hub-and-spoke model.

Aligning course content with industry skill requirements.

Launching a centrally sponsored scheme under the Prime Minister’s skilling package.

Collaborating with state governments and industries to skill 20 lakh students over five years.

“It’s time for the government to ‘walk the talk’ by providing tangible support—financial subsidies, grants, and incubation assistance—to startups working on next-gen technologies like AI in education,”

Addressing Digital Gaps and Skill Development

“The Union Budget must focus on empowering education by bridging digital gaps. A reduction in GST on education services is essential to make learning affordable for middle-class families. Additionally, targeted investments in rural internet infrastructure are critical to integrating underserved communities into the digital economy,”

“Skilling initiatives in areas like digital literacy, green energy, and logistics will boost employability and drive long-term economic growth,”

As India gears up for the Union Budget 2025 , the general public eagerly anticipates significant reforms across various sectors, particularly in education. Expectations include reducing GST on education services, bridging the skill gap, boosting vocational training platforms, enhancing digital infrastructure, investing in innovation, improving teacher training, and reforming higher education and research.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present her eighth budget speech on February 1, 2025, with significant announcements expected for the education sector. In the Union Budget 2024, she emphasized the government's focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class for the next five years. Specifically, employment and skilling were identified as the second priority of the Modi government, with an allocation of ₹1.48 lakh crore for education, employment, and skill development.In March 2024, the Union Cabinet approved a ₹10,371.92 crore investment for the India Artificial Intelligence (AI) Mission to establish a robust AI ecosystem. The initiative, aligned with the vision of “Making AI in India” and “Making AI Work for India,” will be implemented by the Independent Business Division (IBD) under the Digital India Corporation (DIC). Key components include AI Compute Capacity, AI Innovation Centre, AI Datasets Platform, AI Application Development Initiative, AI FutureSkills, AI Startup Financing, and Safe & Trusted AI.With India’s education system on the brink of a technological revolution, the Union Budget 2025 is expected to reinforce AI’s integration into learning.Mridu Andotra, Founder & CEO of GeniusMentor, highlights that a dedicated budget allocation for AI in schools and colleges is necessary to empower India’s youth and establish the country as a global AI leader.Andotra said.Additionally, she emphasized that educator upskilling in AI pedagogy and hands-on AI learning experiences for students should be key priorities.Sandeep Rai, Founder of The Circle India, an NGO focused on transforming education for underserved communities, underscored the urgent need for investments in innovation to modernize schools.Rai stated.He further stressed the importance of teacher training and leadership development, urging the government to invest in preparing educators for meaningful change.he added.The financial accessibility of education is another crucial area. Prateek Maheshwari, Co-Founder of PhysicsWallah, advocates for a 100% GST exemption on educational expenses, including test-prep courses and job-oriented skill programs, for students from Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Low-Income Group (LIG) families.Maheshwari noted.In September 2023, UGC Chairman M. Jagadesh Kumar announced the goal of increasing India’s Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) to 50% by 2035. However, high tax rates create barriers to access, discouraging students from pursuing higher education.In the Union Budget 2024, the government introduced financial assistance of up to ₹10 lakh for higher education through e-vouchers and a 3% interest subsidy for one lakh students annually. Maheshwari urges that the Union Budget 2025 should focus on making degrees more affordable and rationalizing student loan interest rates, including interest-free loans for economically weaker students.The Union Budget 2024 introduced several initiatives for skill development, such as:To build on these efforts, the Union Budget 2025 should prioritize tangible support for startups, including financial subsidies, grants, and incubation assistance.Ram Ramalingam, Founder & CMO of GeniusMentor, emphasized that ed-tech startups will directly impact India’s global workforce quality.he said.Anthony Fernandes, Founder of Shaalaa.com, highlighted the need for strengthening digital infrastructure and skilling initiatives.Fernandes stated.He also underscored the need for vocational training platforms to address India’s growing skill gap.he concluded.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present her eighth budget speech on February 1, 2025, with significant announcements expected for the education sector.

By Surabhi Marwah

Increased focus on the adoption of the Concessional Tax Regime (CTR) by making it more attractive:

Reduction of maximum marginal rate to 39% from 42.744% Introduction of standard deduction Changes in tax slabs Increase in deduction from 12% to 14% of basic salary for employer’s contribution to National Pension System (‘NPS’) for private sector employees

Overhaul of the capital gains taxation with consolidated asset classes, simplified surcharge for long term capital gains and simplified holding periods

Significant push towards digitalization leading to quicker processing of income tax returns (average time for processing of tax return has reduced to 10 days in FY 2023-24). Enhanced transparency in availability of data to taxpayers through Annual Information Statement (AIS) and Tax Information Summary (TIS)

Allowing offset of Tax Collected at Source (TCS) against tax deductible at source on salary income

Income Tax: Key expectations from Budget 2025

1. Higher basic exemption limit under the CTR

2. Perquisite valuation for Electrical Vehicles (EVs)

Clarity on taxation of Virtual Digital Assets (VDA): Introduction of clear guidelines and tax structure for cryptocurrency and Non-Fungible Tokens (‘NFT’) transactions, including rules / guidelines for treatment of losses from such VDAs

Increase in the cap on house property loss set-off: Currently, there is a limit of INR 2,00,000 on the amount of loss from house property that can be set off against other income in the same financial year. It is expected to increase such cap / limit to allow for increased set-off in the same financial year against other heads of income

Expand the list of cities eligible for the 50% basic salary limit for the purpose of HRA exemption (e.g., Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Gurgaon, and Ahmedabad)

Tax deferral on ESOPs for all employees: Offer tax deferral on ESOPs until the stage of sale of shares (as against taxing it at the stage of Exercise) for all employees, extending the benefit currently available only to eligible start-ups

Accountability for Centralised Processing Centre (CPC) Interactions: Introduction of accountability provisions for interactions with the CPC to ensure timely and effective resolution of taxpayer issues and grievances

Budget 2025 income tax expectations : As we move closer to February 1, 2025, the nation is keen to listen to the Finance Minister's speech unveiling the Union Budget 2025 . In the recent years, several directional changes have been introduced in the personal tax landscape. A brief overview of the key directions emerging from the last four Union Budgets:These changes reflect the government's efforts and intent to streamline tax regimes, incentivize savings, and enhance the digital experience for taxpayers. Keeping up with the said intent, few expectations / wishlist from the upcoming Budget is provided below:Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Why standard deduction should be hiked under new tax regime With an intent to provide taxpayers with more disposable income, one may expect an increase in the basic exemption limit under CTR to INR 5,00,000 from INR 3,00,000.This would mean that the taxpayers with a taxable income between INR 15,00,000 to INR 50,00,000 may see a tax reduction of INR 10,400 and those with a taxable income between INR 50,00,000 to INR 1,00,00,000 would see a tax saving of INR 11,440 (subject to marginal relief) due to the increased basic exemption limit.Currently, the car perquisite valuation rules under the income-tax law are based on the cubic capacity of motor cars, which is not applicable to EVs as they do not have engines measured by cubic capacity. The lack of specific provision / mention of EVs in the perquisite valuation rules creates ambiguity in determining the taxable value of perquisite for EVs.Given the increasing adoption of EVs, one may expect the government to come up with a framework that provides clarity on the perquisite valuation of EVs.Also Read | Budget 2025 new vs old income tax regime: Will FM Sitharaman do away with the old regime soon?

Budget 2025 income tax expectations : As we all gear up for the Union Budget later this week, the big question for individual taxpayers is whether the Hon’ble Finance Minister will completely scrap the old tax regime ? Well, time will only give the answer but the moot question is – would it be prudent to do so?Let’s step back for a bit of analysis! The new income tax regime was introduced in 2020 as an optional regime for individual taxpayers. The primary objective was to introduce a more simplified tax structure by removing the plethora of deductions and exemptions. The Government also provided significant relief to taxpayers by reducing income-tax rates, thus nudging them to adopt the new income tax regime. It was quite apparent that the Government intended to phase out the old income tax regime in due course. As per media reports, there were very few takers of the new income tax regime in the initial years.To give a further push, vide Finance Act, 2023, the Government made the new income tax regime as the default regime and brought more attractive changes related to the new income tax regime, by reducing the income-tax rates further, capping the maximum marginal rate (MMR) at 39%, introducing the standard deduction of ₹50,000 for salaried individuals, increasing the income level for 100% tax rebate etc. The trend even continued for the subsequent year wherein vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2024, the slab rates were further tweaked for better, standard deduction for salaried individuals was hiked, deduction for employer’s NPS contribution increased by 4% etc. This seems to have worked its magic. As per Press Release issued by the Ministry of Finance on August 2, 2024, 72% taxpayers opted for the new income tax regime in FY 2023-24 ITRs filed until July 31, 2024.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Top personal tax changes on the wishlist While this appears to be a large percentage, one cannot disregard the fact that the 28% taxpayers opting for the old income tax regime in FY 2023-24 is still a considerable number. Furthermore, while we do not have the necessary data to understand clearly which section of taxpayers are still in favour of the old income tax regime, it is not difficult to guess. From salaried taxpayers’ perspective, the ones benefiting from popular tax exemptions and deductions such as, HRA, LTA, home loan interest, 80C deductions, insurance premia, charitable donations etc. would be still opting for old income tax regime.Also See: Income Tax Slab Given this, is it worth evaluating if the lower tax rates under the new income tax regime really offset the tax deductions/ exemptions which taxpayers have to forego?We have categorised individual taxpayers in four general baskets as per their annual gross income – (A) individuals having income up to ₹15 lakh, (B) individuals having income between ₹15 lakh - ₹1 Cr, (C) HNIs having income between ₹1 - ₹5 Cr and (D) ultra-HNIs having income beyond ₹5 Cr.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Why standard deduction should be hiked under new tax regime Category A represents the largest filing population, possibly young salaried taxpayers, many of them millennials, who may not have invested in long term assets like house properties and other savings schemes. Hence, they would typically prefer hassle-free filing and less burden of documentation proof, etc. At the other end of the spectrum are the ultra-HNIs who would prefer the MMR currently capped at 39% in the new income tax regime due to surcharge cap vis-à-vis 42.74% in the old income tax regime. For both these categories, new income tax regime seems to be the clear winner.It is the people in between who seem to make up the largest group as the old income tax regime filers. These individuals generally spend a significant part of their earnings and savings on rising house rent and home loan EMIs, children’s education, medical expenditure especially for their aged dependents and towards their own retirement savings. They also tend to donate to help a social cause. HNIs would comparatively spend, invest and donate more.The available standard deduction against salary income is definitely not commensurate with the rising YoY expenses. The continuity of existing tax benefits under the old income tax regime hence becomes a critical part of their financial planning to meet their cash budgets. As more consequential tax savings would be available to individuals in Categories B and C and their MMR in both the regimes is the same, they would generally find the old income tax regime more attractive. It is also important to remember that many of these tax deductions, e.g., for home loan interest, insurance premia, savings schemes, etc. were originally introduced to give a boost to the related industry, by incentivising taxpayers to spend on them.If discontinued, this could also have an adverse impact on such payee organisations and investee entities in meeting their objectives, fund requirements etc. In view of these, the Government should not rush to scrap the old income tax regime entirely, either in the existing income-tax law or the probable new Direct Tax Code, at least for a few more years till the average taxpayer develops the habit of prudent financial planning.In the interim, the Government could consider announcing its roadmap of phasing out the old income tax regime coupled with an additional carrot of lower tax rates to encourage this middle-income group to voluntarily adopt the new income tax regime.","Budget 2025 income tax expectations: In the interim, the Government could consider announcing its roadmap of phasing out the old income tax regime.

Taylor felt she was being used as a ""scare tactic"" after Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Lively claimed Swift's presence pressured him to follow scripted instructions.Justin and Blake supporters appear to have put their grievances aside and can be expected to have a very great time for Super Bowl LIX.

Tourism minister Rohan Khaunte has instructed the tourism director to initiate an enforcement drive to regulate the operations of shacks, water sports, adventure activities, and other tourism-related activities. Khaunte said the department will not tolerate Goans subletting their shacks to “Delhiwallahs” and outsiders.“Using technology, we will go to the next level and ensure each shack is monitored. From Mandrem to Calangute to the south, mapping has started,” said Khaunte.He said that shack operation was a traditional business of locals and that it “must remain with Goans”. He said the tourism department simplified the allotment process, agreed to all the demands of the Shack Owners Welfare Society , and issued permissions for shacks well in advance with the “belief that a Goan will not give away his own business” to a “Delhiwallah come here to make money”.The minister said that enforcement drives will be continuous. He also said Goan shack operators finding it unviable to operate the allotted shacks should surrender them so that those on the waiting list get a chance. “These Delhiwallahs come here to make money and these incidents happen. We have been very clear that these businesses cannot be allowed to be taken over by outsiders,” said Khaunte.Speaking about paragliding activities, Khaunte said extreme adventure sports are fraught with risks, which tourists and enthusiasts need to understand and accept. “Adventure activities come under extreme sports and such extreme sports will always have some danger. There needs to be safety standards in place. People are illegally doing it in panchayat areas. If there are safety standards and all permissions, anyone can come to the director and get an NOC,” said Khaunte.","Tourism minister Rohan Khaunte has instructed the tourism director to initiate an enforcement drive to regulate the operations of shacks, water sports, adventure activities, and other tourism-related activities.

The court passed the order while hearing a writ petition for protection filed by a married woman from Fatehabad in Haryana who is in a live-in relationship with a man from Sikar district.Separately, the single bench requested the chief justice to constitute a larger bench to address the question of granting protection to married individuals cohabiting with unmarried partners or married persons from different marriages living together without dissolving their respective marriages.Emphasising that a law on live-in relationships is the need of the hour, Justice Dhand said legislation should be framed by the Centre and state govt. ""Till the enactment of the appropriate legislation by the govt, let a competent authority be established in each district of the state to look into the matter of registering such live-in-relationships, which will address and redress the grievances of such partners or couples who have entered into such a relationship and the children being born therefrom. Let a website portal be launched in this regard for redressal of the issue arising out of such a relationship,"" the court said.The HC sought fixing the liability of male and female partners in the form of a plan to bear the responsibility for education, health and upbringing of children born of such relationships. Additionally, the court said the liability of the male partner must be fixed for maintenance of his non-earning female partner in such a relationship and the children born of such a relationship.Though such relationships are often disapproved of by the society, they are not legally prohibited, the court said, pointing to couples in live-in relationships seeking judicial protection against threats from their families. ""Several couples in live-in relationships are facing threats from families. They approach constitutional courts seeking protection. Courts are inundated with such petitions. Every day dozens of petitions are submitted,"" the judge noted.Given the differing opinions of coordinate benches, Justice Dhand said it was necessary to refer the matter to a special bench for a definitive ruling. ""This seeks to ensure uniformity in handling such cases, considering the numerous protection requests from couples in various live-in arrangements,"" he said.",Rajasthan High Court orders that live-in relationships must be registered by a govt established authority or tribunal.

Union Budget 2025: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to present record 8th Budget; what can we expect?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2025-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-to-present-record-8th-budget-key-expectations-income-tax-education-healthcare-msme-agriculture-travel-tourism-railways/articleshow/117811080.cms,"Here are key expectations from the Budget:



The country has seen significant growth in women-led enterprises, but challenges like access to capital, skill development, and policy support persist. The budget is expected to introduce measures such as low-interest credit lines, dedicated venture capital funds for women-led startups, and increased government procurement from women-owned businesses. These steps will enhance women's economic participation, drive innovation, and create jobs.

India's manufacturing sector requires robust support for digitalization and sustainability. Encouraging smart manufacturing, AI-driven automation, and clean energy initiatives will boost efficiency and global competitiveness. Prioritizing tax benefits for companies adopting green technologies and carbon-neutral strategies will help align with India's net-zero goals.

MEIL has been a key driver of India's infrastructure and manufacturing growth, contributing significantly to the energy, water, and transportation sectors. The budget is expected to focus on boosting investments in large-scale infrastructure projects, simplifying approval processes, and promoting public-private partnerships (PPPs). Strengthening the infrastructure sector will improve logistics, enhance industrial productivity, and attract global investments.

The MSME sector seeks research grants, easier access to low-cost financing, relaxed incentive criteria, and extended timelines for domestic value addition. These initiatives aim to develop homegrown leaders capable of positioning India’s manufacturing ecosystem in the global supply chain.

The Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme has significantly boosted growth across multiple sectors. With the upcoming budget, it's essential to expand this support to sub-assembly and component manufacturing. Lowering customs duties on essential raw materials would be a strong first step in this direction.

A skilled workforce is crucial for long-term growth. The budget is expected to increase funding for technical and vocational training, especially for women, in fast-growing sectors like renewable energy, aerospace, and digital technology. Encouraging industry-academia collaborations will help bridge the skill gap and equip young talent for future job markets.

Another anticipated aspect of the budget is tax relief for individuals and businesses. Taxpayers are hoping for changes in tax slabs under the new tax regime, with expectations of higher exemption limits and standard deductions.

The healthcare sector is calling for an increase in spending to 2.5% of GDP, a reduction in GST on health insurance premiums, incentives for digital health innovations such as telesurgery and electronic health records, and lower import duties on medical equipment.

Travel and tourism industry experts have outlined their key expectations, focusing on tax reforms, improved funding, infrastructure development, and more.

Infrastructure development and export competitiveness remain key priorities. The budget is expected to emphasize sustained investments in roads, railways, and other essential infrastructure.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the eighth Union Budget 2025 on Saturday. As India moves toward a $5 trillion economy, the Budget presents a vital opportunity to drive industry growth, enhance infrastructure, and promote inclusivity, particularly for women in business and leadership.The Economic Survey 2024-25, presented in Parliament on Friday, projects India's economy to grow between 6.3% and 6.8% in FY26.Meanwhile, the outlook for core inflation remains stable, aided by lower global energy and commodity prices, although global political and economic uncertainties still pose challenges.Additionally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his pre-Budget session address, invoked the blessings of goddess Lakashmi for the poor and the middle class hinting at some income tax relief.""I pray that Goddess Lakshmi showers the poor, middle class with blessings. It is a matter of great pride that India completed 75 years as a democratic nation. India has established itself well on the global pedestal...This is the first complete budget of my third term. I can confidently say that in 2047, when India will complete 100 years of Independence, India will fulfil its aim of Viksit Bharat and this budget will give new energy and hope to the nation.,” PM Modi said.","The Economic Survey 2024-25 projects India's economy to grow between 6.3% and 6.8% in FY26.

"Red walls, real stories",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/red-walls-real-stories/articleshow/117812298.cms,"It was the early 2000s, and Kottayam’s bus station buzzed with the usual chaos of vendors and passengers. Among the crowd, a group of seven transgender activists from Tamil Nadu waited for their ride home, exhausted after a spirited discussion at the School of Letters, Mahatma Gandhi University.Among them was Kalki Subramaniam , clutching a local newspaper featuring their image for the first time.But as she read, insults swirled around them—men ridiculing their gender identity, forcing them to flee the spot.Fast forward to 2025, Kalki, now a noted trans rights activist, recently hosted ‘Shattered Silence: Voices of Transgender Experiences at Kochi’s Durbar Hall.’ This time, the atmosphere was markedly different.There was no mockery or harassment. Young and old alike gathered to offer solidarity and admiration for the vivid, unapologetic depictions of trans struggles.The exhibition’s centrepiece was the Redwall Project, a gut-wrenching testament to transgender experiences. Handwritten notes and red-painted palm prints in six languages documented over 500 stories of harassment, systemic violence, and daily battles for dignity.One testimonial recounts a harrowing incident at Thrissur’s bus station: “I was berated and beat- en by the police just for waiting for a bus. It took a month to recover, physically and emotionally.Nobody came to fetch me back to my hostel. That loneliness—it wounded me deeply,” wrote a transgender woman. The exhibition also featured AI-generated paintings exploring transgender identity.A theatrical performance conducted as part of the show added another layer of raw authenticity. Directed by Kalki and performed by her childhood friend Prema Natarajan, Vila (The Price), an autobiographical play, reenacted real-life struggles. Prema, ostracized by her family in Coimbatore, was sold to an older transgender woman who led a group engaged in begging for survival.“My family sold me for Rs 15,000 to a transwoman in Mumbai, whom we called Nani. For 20 years, I worked for her, seeking alms and giving blessings to those who donated,” Prema revealed during the performance.In 2017, she managed to escape and return to Coimbatore. The play portrayed her attempt to reunite with her family, only to be rejected again, forcing her back to begging on trains.“One day, I got a Facebook message from her,” Kalki recalled. “She called herself Silk Smitha because she loved the actress. We exchanged numbers, and I was shocked to hear her story. Since then, she has accompanied me.” Kalki’s activism is deeply personal, shaped by losses—friends lost to HIV and suicide.These tragedies fuelled her to establish Sahodari, an organization working for transgender empowerment. According to trans activist and actor Sheetal Shyam Kalki’s involvement has been inspiring, and her public presence has brought greater visibility to Kerala’s trans community. Kerala, Kalki believes, has made remarkable strides.“Tamil Nadu may have pioneered transgender welfare, but Kerala empowered us in ways others didn’t. It was Kerala that launched India’s first transgender welfare policy. Nowhere else does the govt support gender affirmation surgeries like here.”Despite these advancements, the battle for equality is far from over. The transgender community in India still lacks basic rights such as marriage equality and adoption. “Now, I hear companies like OYO saying only married people can get accommodation,” she says. “What happens to transgender individuals and queer couples? These policies push us further into the margins.”She also criticized the central govt’s ban on blood donations by transgender and gay individuals. “Why can’t we donate blood? It is a discriminatory policy that reinforces stigma against us,” she asserts.Kalki’s vision extends beyond national borders. Through the Sahodari Foundation , she aims to build global alliances against transphobia.“In many countries, trans rights are being reversed by right-wing governments. Even in the US, anti-trans policies are rising. We must unite globally to resist these regressions.”","Kalki Subramaniam is a noted trans rights activist.

"Hiked Capex, fiscal consolidation and demand push expected from Union Budget 2025-26",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hiked-capex-fiscal-consolidation-and-demand-push-expected-from-union-budget-2025-26/articleshow/117811848.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Union Budget 2025-26 is set to be presented on Saturday, anticipating to strike a balance between economic growth and fiscal prudence while addressing the expectations of taxpayers, businesses, and key industries.Industry leaders and experts are hoping for measures that drive consumption, incentivize capital expenditure , and support critical sectors such as real estate, MSMEs , healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI), electric vehicles (EVs), and renewable energy.Furthermore, continued fiscal consolidation remains a key expectation.One of the most awaited aspects of the budget is tax relief for individuals and businesses. Taxpayers are expecting changes in tax slabs under the new tax regime, with hopes of an increase in exemption limits and standard deductions. There is a demand for making annual income up to Rs10 lakh tax-free.Taxpayers are also expecting an increase in the standard deduction limit, currently set at Rs50,000 under the old tax regime and Rs75,000 under the new tax regime.Businesses expect a growth-oriented budget while maintaining fiscal discipline. A survey by FICCI found that 68 per cent of businesses favor at least a 15 per cent increase in capital expenditure allocation to fuel economic growth.The government is expected to continue its fiscal consolidation roadmap, bringing down the fiscal deficit from 4.9 per cent in FY25 to 4.8 per cent, with a target of 4.5 per cent in FY26.Industry stakeholders from key sectors have also outlined their expectations. The real estate sector is advocating for tax rationalization, an increase in the home loan interest deduction limit under Section 24(b) from Rs2 lakh to Rs5 lakh, and relief in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax.The healthcare sector is seeking increased spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP, lower GST on health insurance premiums, incentives for digital health solutions like telesurgery and electronic health records, and reduced import duties on medical equipment.MSMEs demand better credit access and technology adoption incentives to drive sectoral growth, while new-age sectors like AI, EVs, and renewable energy expect policy incentives and financial support to enhance innovation and industry adoption.Tax reforms and simplification measures are another key area of focus. The government is expected to introduce a modernized Direct Tax Code (DTC) to simplify the 63-year-old Income Tax Act, similar to how GST transformed indirect taxation. Industry stakeholders seek simplification of complex TDS/TCS provisions to reduce litigation and compliance burdens.With India's economic momentum strong, 60 per cent of businesses expect GDP growth between 6.5 per cent and 7 per cent in FY25. There is a growing focus on strengthening collaboration between educational institutions and industries to ensure a job-ready workforce, particularly in IT, healthcare, and manufacturing.Infrastructure development and export competitiveness are also key expectations. Continued investments in roads, railways, and other critical infrastructure are expected to be a major budgetary focus.Businesses are pushing for logistics efficiency improvements and an extension of interest equalisation schemes to strengthen India's global trade standing.","The Union Budget 2025-26 is set to be presented on Saturday.
