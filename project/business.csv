Agnipath faces ballot test in jawan heartland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agnipath-faces-ballot-test-in-jawan-heartland/articleshow/110378288.cms,"A part from basic issues, anguish against Centre’s much-touted Agniveer scheme , under which youngsters are engaged as soldiers for a short term of four years, seems to have taken centre stage in parliamentary polls in Haryana, especially in rural areas. Almost every political party campaigning in the state is promising to end this scheme, if voted to office, and reinstating the old pattern of recruitment that provides pension on completion of 15-year service.In a state with high unemployment, Agniveer — officially known as the Agnipath Yojana — has led to changes in aspirations of young Haryana men seeking job security.Pawan Jangra, a native of Pabra in Haryana’s Hisar district, always dreamt of joining the Indian Army but as he was close to achieving his childhood dream, it became his last option. He is now focusing on police jobs such as constable, relegating his dream job in Army to the end of his options. He is enrolled in an academy near Hisar that trains boys from rural background for the armed forces.Like Pawan, several other Army aspirants now prefer central police jobs over the Army because of restrictive options linked to Angiveer intake.“Even if we are selected under Agniveer scheme, our struggle would begin after release on completion of four years. It is better to work hard and choose police service or other similar jobs where we can at least serve till the age of superannuation,” says Deepak, a Hansi resident undergoing training at one of the academies.Joginder Punia, who runs a coaching academy in Hisar district, claims the number of applications under Agniveer in the Army recruitment office, Hisar, was around 22,000 in 2023. It has dropped to around 6,500 this year.“Army is no longer the first choice for the boys from rural areas of Haryana. I had two boys in my academy who were selected for Army under Agniveer scheme but, after the results for Group-D posts in Haryana were declared, they decided to opt for the Group-D post, which is equivalent to a peon’s job, because it is a permanent and secure job,” adds Punia.Pawan Berwal, a former soldier who is now running a coaching academy in Jind district, says that other ‘belt’ services (paramilitary and state police) used to be the last choice for youngsters in Haryana and they chose to opt for these only on passing the Army enrolment age. However, now the Army is their last choice, so much so that the craze to go abroad has replaced it.“When the Army was selecting youngsters based on the old pattern, prior to the Agniveer scheme, we used to have 400-500 residential students preparing for the Army physical and written tests. Now, this number has come down to 40 only. Youngsters in Haryana are preferring to go abroad after spending Rs 20-30 lakh so that they can get citizenship of another country in 3-4 years. That is a more secure option,” he explains.Dinesh Sangwan, who retired from the Indian Navy, is director of one of the academies in Rohtak district. He recalls a time when young men came armed with a strong ‘sifarish’ (recommendation) to get coaching for military recruitment. All his five hostels used to have 100% occupancy and aspirants even lived in nearby villages as paying guests to be able to train under him.“Now, very few students come to prepare for the Army and that too as their last choice. Around 6-7 academies in Haryana have shut down after the implementation of the Agniveer scheme. Boys from Haryana have a natural tendency to join armed forces, but they do not want to spoil the prime of their lives where there is no security after serving for four years,” adds Sangwan.TOI sent a detailed questionnaire to the headquarters of the Ambala recruiting zone, which looks after Agniveer recruitment in the region, but received no response despite several reminders.Indian Army has been the largest employer for youngsters from Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh with around one-fourth of soldiers selected yearly across the country hailing from this region.Per central govt data tabled in Parliament in Feb 2022, during the last recruitment drive held in 2019-20 for selection of jawans, a total of 18,798 youngsters were selected from this region.However, after suspension of the Army’s enrolment drive for two years due to Covid-19 pandemic, around 37,000 youngsters from the region were deprived of these jobs. Thereafter, Centre launched its much-touted Agniveer scheme.In all, 78,692 aspirants were selected by Army from across statesin the last recruitment drive completed per the old pattern in 2019-20. Thus, the region alone sent around 24% of the total recruits selected from all over the country.As per data, the intake of soldiers from Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal in 2017-18 was 4,988, 3,634 and 2,376, respectively, which increased to 7,813, 5,097 and 5,883, respectively, in 2019-20. There were three seats for UT Chandigarh, and these were increased to six in 2019-20. With this, a total of 18,798 young men from these three states and UT Chandigarh were selected by the Army in its last recruitment drive in 2019-20.","Agniveer scheme, under which youngsters are engaged as soldiers for a short term of four years, has led to changes in aspirations of young Haryana men seeking job security.

‘Don’t Want Group D Job’

‘Berozgaron Ki Baraat’

Who Can Deliver?

Manju (26) and Ashish Balhara had their future mapped out when they tied the knot three years ago in Rohtak’s Bahu Akbarpur village. Both were certain their qualifications — Manju is an MSc (maths) and a BEd, and Ashish has an MBA degree — would land them govt jobs. Neither found one.Ashish took up a job with a private company in Gurgaon. Manju, who tried for three years to get a teaching job in a govt school and cleared both state and central teacher eligibility tests, has resorted to her last career choice — giving tuitions to children in the village.“The state does not have any openings for TGT (trained graduate teacher) and PGT (postgraduate teacher) posts in Mathematics. I registered on HKRN too, but I haven’t received any response,” she said, referring to govt’s Haryana Kaushal Rojgar Nigam platform for job seekers.“You’ll find many unemployed graduates when you go to villages. Youngsters like us study so we can get work. We can’t rely on farming. It doesn’t pay anything,” Ashish said. He isn’t off the mark. Ask Deepak Kaushik, a graduate who runs a grocery store in Pehrawar village of Rohtak. Or Bharat Singh, a graduate who lost his job and now drives an autorickshaw in Bhiwani’s Kalinga for a living.The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) released by the Union ministry of statistics and pro gramme implementation ranked Haryana third on the list of states with highest unemployment rates between July 2022 and June 2023. At 6.1%, Haryana’s joblessness rate is almost double that of the national average of 3.2%. The unemployment rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 9.5% for the 15-29 age group, up from 8.3% the previous quarter, latest PLFS data shows.Other than farming, there are few career avenues beyond the glass walls of Gurgaon’s corporate offices. Most aspire for govt jobs (Group C and D posts), become teachers or join the forces — police and military. But govt recruitment has now dipped. And, since Centre announced its Agnipath scheme in 2022 for recruiting defence personnel below officer rank, perception of the most coveted job has changed among the youth.As the state goes to polls on Saturday, youngsters in villages in five districts TOI visited — Rohtak, Jhajjar, Sonipat, Bhiwani and Charkhi Dadri — had a common refrain: lack of employment. Their primary concern will drive their vote, which they said would go to the party that creates jobs evenly across villages and towns.“In 2019, 75% reservation for locals was promised by govt. They knew that it would be challenged in courts. It was just a gimmick. They glorify more and execute less on the ground. Similarly, Agniveer was a big loss for us in Haryana,” said Pinaki Dev, a resident of Bahu Akbarpur in Rohtak. Govt told legislators in Vidhan Sabha last year that 13.9 lakh youngsters enrolled in district employment offices between 2015 and 2022. Of these, around 1 lakh got permanent jobs.“I tried to get a private job, but salaries were too low. I registered with HKRN, but there are no vacancies for mechanical engineers. I don’t want to take up a Group D job with an engineering degree… So, I’m helping my family on the farm and preparing for Staff Selection Commission (SSC),” said Sachin Balhara (24), also of Bahu Akbarpur.Group D category is for non technical jobs such as sanitation staff, gardener, peon and driver.Deepak Kaushik (32), who runs a grocery store in Pehrawar, 20km away, said: “Recruitment exams are held for posts like gram sachiv (secretary) but the results aren’t declared. This keeps candidates in a limbo.” He added: “While the PM is 73 and running for a third term, there are schemes that say youngsters can only serve in the Army for four years. Is that fair?”Kaushik’s friend Mukul (26) said recruitments came to a halt during Covid, and paper leaks have hit their confidence. “For young people, caste politics holds little significance. We want candidates who promise to deliver employment opportunities,” he said.Two large groups of govt job applicants have, meanwhile, taken to the streets to protest. In the election season in Haryana, applicants for govt jobs and posts of TGTs have been organising ‘Berozgaron ki Baraat’ (procession of unemployed) in different districts.TGT candidates who took their exams last April are still waiting for their results, as are Group C job applicants who appeared for the exams conducted by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) last Aug because of subsequent court moves.Vidya from Sonipat, who was part of one such procession, said, “PM talks about ‘Modi ki guarantee’. And govt says ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’. We have studied, but there are no jobs. We are on the streets despite our education,” she said.In Sonipat’s Kharkhoda, Randeep Dahiya (56), who runs a gaushala, was worried whether his two children would get jobs. “My son is 26 and has completed BCom, MCom and BEd. He is now studying law. My daughter (24) has done MSc in agriculture and is preparing for a PhD. Since they did not get jobs, they decided to study further,” Dahiya said, adding: “Logon ko badlaav chahiye (people want change).”Some 90km west of Kharkhoda, a 24-year-old standing at a food stall in Bhiwani’s Kharak, asked where the private jobs were beyond Gurgaon-Manesar. Vishnu Parmar worked at an auto spare parts factory in Manesar. “The company shut down and now I can’t support my elderly parents. I have been job-hunt ing. I have ITI certification, too. But nothing seems to be of use,” he said, adding BJP was the only party that he believed could provide “jobs without reservation”.Satish Sharma, who has switched to selling fast food in the village market, says he gave up on his dream of joining the Army. “I don’t have a choice anymore. Things have changed after the Agnipath scheme.”There are 2.6 lakh people currently enrolled in govt’s Saksham Yuva portal that helps youngsters get jobs. Among them are 22,400 postgraduates, 70,226 graduates and 1.6 lakh with intermediate degrees.Contract JobsAn independent association of trade unions called Sarv Karmchari Sangh has been demanding that the govt dissolve HKRN. It claims govt is offering only contractual jobs through the portal, likening it to “giving peanuts when people need an actual source of earning and stable work”.Congress sees evidence of people’s frustration with 10 years of BJP rule in the bleak jobs scene. Udai Bhan, state president of Haryana Congress, told TOI, “The CM is ending the practice of providing regular govt jobs that students grow up aspiring for with HKRN’s contractual mode. It has been years since a recruitment exam has not ended up in court. There is no system of reservation in HKRN jobs. Students from the marginalised communities have no way into the system due to lack of appointments. Youths have been preparing for govt jobs for years. Those who cracked recruitment exams in 2016-17 are still waiting for job adverts. They have gone into depression, and ultimately, coerced by the situation into accepting whatever little this govt has to offer.”BJP, however, believes this is a negative campaign by the opposition and the voters will see through it.Arvind Saini, state media incharge of BJP, said, “The current BJP govt has made significant strides in addressing the problem of unemployment by introducing a transparent and fair appointment process. Unlike the previous Congress regime, where the use of ‘parchi’ and ‘kharchi’ was prevalent, BJP has worked to eliminate corrupt practices. By doing so, govt has ensured qualified candidates have an equal opportunity to secure employment based on merit, rather than through nepotism or bribery. As a result, the issue of unemployment has taken a backseat in the current election, as voters recognise efforts made by the BJP govt.”","At 6.1%, Haryana’s joblessness rate is almost double that of the national average of 3.2%. The unemployment rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 9.5% for the 15-29 age group, up from 8.3% the previous quarter.

Cyber Fraud: 46% of cyber fraud in India stems from Southeast Asia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/46-of-cyber-fraud-in-india-stems-from-southeast-asia/articleshow/110374898.cms,"Large number of Chinese known to work in cybercrime hubs: I4C chief

NEW DELHI: Jamtara and Mewat have been upstaged as hotspots of financial cyber fraud in India, with 46% of defrauded money now bring lost to cybercrimes originating in southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos.I4C and state law enforcement agencies have cracked down on some of these illegal recruitment agents. The foreign ministry has so far facilitated the return of 360 Indians trapped in these cybercrime units, with 60 more due to return from Cambodia soon.According to Kumar, Rs 1,420 crore was lost to 62,587 investment scams, Rs 222 crore to 20,043 trading scams, Rs 120 crore to 4,600 digital arrest scams and Rs 13 crore to 1,725 romance/dating scams, all originating from southeast Asia between Jan and April this year. Last year, more than one lakh investment scams originating from the region were reported on Indian national cybercrime reporting portal and 10,000 FIRs registered.Not ruling out China's involvement in these scams, the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) chief said that a large number of Chinese people were known to work in these scam hubs and many of the suspected apps used for to defraud people are in Chinese language.Amid an overall increase in big ticket frauds reported in 2024, with over six lakh complaints involving a total amount of Rs 7,061 crore received on the national cybercrime reporting portal, I4C has intervened to save Rs 812.7 crore from being defrauded.Collaboration between I4C and law enforcement agencies has helped debit-freeze 3.2 lakh mule accounts in last four months, get more than 3,000 URLs and 595 apps blocked under Information Technology Act, 5.3 lakh SIM cards and over 80,000 IMEI numbers suspended since July 2023. Also, there have been 3,401 cases of unlawful content being taken down from social media, websites and WhatsApp in last two months.Indians who are lured to southeast Asia's organised cybercrime factories with fake jobs advertised by illegal recruiters - detected in states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Delhi - are pushed into defrauding unsuspecting victims in India through social media advertisements and messaging promising quick financial gains on their investments or through gaming, digital arrests where the cyber offenders pose as as a law enforcement personnel; or romance, dating scams. ""These gangs work in an organised manner, from scam compounds... many of them were linked to casinos earlier,"" said Kumar.The illicit gains from these cybercrime activities originating in southeast Asia are laundered through sophisticated financial channels including Indian bank accounts, cryptocurrency transactions, cash withdrawals, etc, he added.In May this year, Visakhapatnam cybercrime police had arrested three illegal recruitment agents who were sending gullible youth to Cambodia.Similar arrests were carried out in Odisha. Ministry of external affairs has been working with Phnom Penh to rescue the Indians trapped in these compounds and get them home.Govt had earlier this month set up an inter-ministerial committee comprising various law enforcement and intelligence agencies to tackle the ""spurt"" in transnational organised cyber crimes being launched against Indians from southeast Asian countries.","46% of defrauded money now bring lost to cybercrimes originating in southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos.

This appeal comes amidst a scandal involving the MP and the emergence of alleged obscene videos .The letter, penned by Siddaramaiah to PM Modi , highlights the severity of the accusations leveled against Prajwal Revanna, emphasizing the shock and concern felt not only in Karnataka but across the nation. It underscores the disgraceful act of Prajwal Revanna fleeing the country to Germany on April 27, 2024, using his diplomatic passport, shortly after the news of his alleged heinous actions surfaced and just hours before the filing of the first FIR against him.The CM expressed deep concern over Prajwal Revanna's abuse of diplomatic privileges to evade criminal proceedings and accountability for his actions.

IndiGo scales $1 bn annual profit peak; to get comfy also with business class by year-end,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indigo-clocks-1-bn-annual-profit-in-fy-24-to-launch-business-class-by-year-end/articleshow/110366666.cms,"Business class:

Result:

NEW DELHI: In a first for Indian carriers, IndiGo clocked nearly $ 1 billion in annual profit last fiscal. The profitable airline is also planning to get comfortable for premium passengers by introducing a “tailor-made” business class on “India’s busiest and business” routes by the year-end — a major evolution in its 18-year-old no frills policy.With such a strong balance sheet, IndiGo on Thursday announced the next big step in its evolution — business class on some routes by the year-end. For the last 18 years, Elbers said, the airline focussed on three customer promises — “affordable fares, on-time performance and hassle-free, courteous service”.Now “almost 18 years and all grown up – it’s time to take the next step in the evolution of IndiGo. Considering India’s soaring economy and the evolving aspirations of Indian society, it’s time for IndiGo to redefine premium travel in India, increasing availability of this service for the nation. It will create a desired option for many who are aiming to travel business, perhaps for the first time in their lives,” the airline said in a statement.Next year, IndiGo will start getting the Airbus A321XLRs (extra long range) that can fly nonstop between India and western Europe to the west; Japan to the east and more countries in Africa. Then in 2027, it will start getting the 30 wide body A350s ordered recently which can fly nonstop to pretty much anywhere to earth from India. These planes are widely expected to have a premium class for IndiGo to tap the high-paying travellers too — who would otherwise choose between the business/premium economy offerings of competing Indian (read AI) and foreign airlines. Also passengers on long journeys (over 4-5 hours) need hot food and IndiGo planes currently don’t have ovens.IndiGo has taken a step in that direction by introducing a tailor-made business class by the year-end. Details on the business class product offerings, launch date and routes will be announced this August, around IndiGo’s anniversary.Among Indian LCCs, erstwhile GoAir for some time used to have a business class in its first two rows where the regular 3x3 seating configuration was retained but the middle seat was kept vacant. Priority boarding and baggage claim, meal and beverage were given as part of Go business package. This allowed the airline to offer business on routes where there was demand for the product without any need to have aircraft in different “layout of passenger accommodations” (or seating configurations).Among current LCCs, AI Express and Akasa has 2x2 seats in first few rows on some of their new Boeing 737 MAX. But that is a temporary phenomenon. Because of supply chain constraints these two airlines took whatever MAX (ordered in that configuration by other foreign airlines) were available and not delay induction by waiting for their all-economy planes. They will change to seating to all-economy as more planes join the fleet. SpiceJet also has a business offering.Which version IndiGo has chosen will be known in three months. Elbers said: We believe as India gears up to become the third largest economy in the world, it’s our privilege to provide the New India even more options to choose from as they travel business. We are excited with this new phase and tailor-made product in IndiGo’s evolution and strategy and aim to further give wings to the nation, by connecting people and aspirations.”The Rahul Bhatia-founded LCC Thursday reported a profit of Rs 1,895 crore this January-March, up 106% from Rs 919 crore in Q4 last fiscal. It reported an annual profit of Rs 8,172.5 crore in FY 2024, against a loss of Rs 306 crore in the previous fiscal. The airline’s scrip closed at Rs 4,400.55 on BSE Thursday, up 0.9% when the broader market was up 1.6%. The result was declared post trading hours.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said: “For the full financial year 2024, we reported our highest ever total income of around Rs 71,200 crore (up 27% over FY23)… all four quarters in FY24 (were) profitable.” India’s largest airline by market share had a total cash balance of Rs 34,737.5 crore this March-end.","The Rahul Bhatia-founded LCC Thursday reported a profit of Rs 1,895 crore this January-March.

The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday permitted the de-sealing of four shacks at Ozrant , Chapora and Vagator beaches . The shacks were sealed following the HC’s directives after they were found to be operating illegally.The shack operators filed applications in the HC seeking the de-sealing of their shacks to remove goods and articles, and to dismantle the structures ahead of the monsoon.After hearing the applications, the HC directed the Anjuna panchayat to de-seal the shacks and ensure that they are dismantled.It further directed the panchayat to ensure that no activities, including commercial, are undertaken once these shacks are dismantled.The HC also called for a compliance report accompanied by photographs.The court is hearing a suo motu petition on the illegal constructions at Anjuna. In April, the HC had directed the secretary of the panchayat to remain present in court. By then 100 demolition orders had been issued by the panchayat, some of which had been taken to the additional director of panchayats, seeking directions for a stay or for setting the orders aside.The amicus curiae in the matter, Abhijit Gosavi, had pointed out that after the 100 demolition orders were issued, the additional director of panchayats with ‘utmost speed’ proceeded to set aside 24 orders of demolition and also issued stay orders.Structures which prima facie had no permissions or trade licences are carrying on commercial operations, the HC had observed.","The shack operators filed applications in the HC seeking the de-sealing of their shacks.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
US senators tell Trudeau to meet Nato defense spending pledge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-senators-tell-justin-trudeau-to-meet-nato-defense-spending-pledge/articleshow/110379096.cms,"A bipartisan group of US senators urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to produce a plan to meet a Nato commitment to increase defense spending to 2% of gross domestic product.Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Thom Tillis, co-chairs of the Senate Nato observers group, and 21 other senators signed a letter to Trudeau on Thursday, demanding that Canada hit the defense spending target agreed to by members of the security alliance in 2006 and reaffirmed as recently as 2023.Trudeau’s government released a policy update in April that projects defense spending will rise to 1.76% of GDP by 2030. The new plan places a heavy emphasis on securing Canada’s Arctic, which faces growing threats from Russia and China.The US senators wrote that they’re “concerned and profoundly disappointed” that Canada may still fall short of the 2% pledge. It’s certain to be a topic when members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization gather in Washington this summer.“The United States’ commitment to Nato is unwavering,” they wrote. By the time of the July summit, “we will expect your government and every Nato member that has not met the 2% defense spending threshold to have a plan to reach this benchmark as soon as possible.”Other signatories to the letter include Democrats Joe Manchin, Tammy Duckworth and Jeff Merkley and Republicans Dan Sullivan, Tim Scott, Mitt Romney and Ted Cruz.Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair told reporters in Ottawa that the government’s defense budget will increase by 27% next year compared with this year and that the recent defense policy update applies a “very significant and necessary focus on continental defense.” He pointed to a promised investment of nearly C$40 billion ($29.1 billion) in upgrading systems under Norad, the North American Aerospace Defense Command.“We know that Canada needs to invest in other capabilities that are not yet included in this year’s budget,” Blair added, mentioning submarines and air missile defense systems that are expected to lift Canada closer to 2%.The senators’ letter comes just over a week after Blair visited Washington to meet with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.“I’m sure I’d be able to assure those concerned senators that Canada will be a ready and capable ally to Nato in North America and NORAD and around the world,” Blair said.",US senators urge Canada to meet a Nato commitment to increase defense spending to 2% of GDP.

He also noted that inflation has returned to normal levels, indicating that his government's plans and priorities are effective.""I've just come back in from calling the general election, and I wanted to explain to you why our economy is now growing faster than France, Germany and the United States. And this morning, we received the welcome news that inflation has returned to normal,"" Sunak said in the video.The Prime Minister acknowledged that the journey hasn't been easy and that the benefits are only starting to be felt by the public. However, he emphasized that the hard-won economic stability was merely the beginning. ""Now, I believe that our plan and the bold actions that we're prepared to take will deliver a secure future for you, your family and our United Kingdom,"" Sunak added.The decision to call for a general election comes as a surprise, as Sunak was not required to hold a vote until January 2025. The announcement follows a drop in inflation rates, which set the stage for his decision. The six-week campaign is widely expected to result in the fall of Sunak's Conservative government, with the opposition Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, leading in opinion polls.In other news, the British Parliament recently passed a controversial Bill allowing the government to send asylum seekers to Rwanda for their claims to be considered. The legislation has faced opposition in Parliament and challenges in British courts, with lawmakers and activists seeking to block it on human rights grounds. The policy aims to prevent irregular migration into the UK, particularly via illegal and dangerous small boats from France, arranged by criminal gangs.","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced a snap general election for July 4.

Aftermath and safety protocols

Investigations and future precautions

A Singapore Airlines flight from London to Singapore encountered severe turbulence, causing a rapid ascent and descent of 400 feet within a minute, resulting in the death of one passenger and injuries to at least 30 others. The Boeing 777-300ER, which departed from London’s Heathrow Airport, was diverted to Bangkok, where it made an emergency landing.The turbulence hit about 10 hours into the flight, as the plane flew over the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar, a region known for severe weather conditions.The aircraft, carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew members, was at an altitude of 37,000 feet when it suddenly encountered ""sudden extreme turbulence,"" causing it to drop 6,000 feet in about three minutes.Andrew Davies, a 54-year-old passenger from London, recounted his experience during the turbulence to the Wall Street Journal. He was deciding between taking a nap and watching a movie when the seatbelt sign flashed on. Just as he secured his seatbelt, the plane began to drop violently. ""Pillows, plates and cups were thrown in the air. His seat belt tugged at his waist, and he found himself covered in his neighbor’s coffee. Oxygen masks dropped down,"" Davies told the WSJ.The chaos in the cabin was immediate and severe. ""I saw a woman with a deep gash on her head, covered in blood. Flight crew members also appeared bloody and injured, hobbling around trying to help passengers,"" Davies added. An elderly passenger, identified as Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old British national with a history of heart problems, likely suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by the crew to perform CPR for 20 minutes, they were unable to revive him.The plane's abrupt altitude change was documented by FlightRadar24, which reported a ""rapid change in vertical rate, consistent with a sudden turbulence event."" The turbulence was likely clear-air turbulence (CAT), which is difficult to detect and can occur without warning. ""Developing thunderstorms often have strong updrafts, a zone of upward moving air, that rises very rapidly, sometimes at more than 100 mph, and can leave pilots little time to react if it occurs directly in front of the plane,"" explained Dan DePodwin, Senior Director of Forecasting Operations at AccuWeather.Former pilot Marco Chan noted the turbulence likely occurred within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, notorious for thunderstorms. ""With turbulence of such magnitude, it is likely the [Singapore Airlines] flight was navigating through difficult thunderstorms,"" he said.Following the incident, Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong expressed condolences and assured that the airline was providing necessary support to affected passengers and their families. ""We are very sorry for the traumatic experience that everyone on board SQ321 went through,"" Goh said.Of the injured, 18 were hospitalized, with seven in critical condition. The Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok treated 71 passengers. The incident has renewed calls for strict adherence to safety protocols, emphasizing the importance of wearing seatbelts at all times during a flight. ""It is a matter of life and death,"" said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.This event marked the first fatal incident involving Singapore Airlines in almost 25 years. The airline, recognized as one of the world's leading carriers, has a strong safety record, with its last major accident occurring in October 2000.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the US and Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau are investigating the incident. Preliminary findings suggest that climate change may be increasing the frequency and intensity of turbulence events. ""For clear-air turbulence, climate change is increasing the temperature difference across the jet stream between the cold poles and the warm tropics,"" explained Dr Paul Williams, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading.As investigations continue, the aviation industry is urged to enhance real-time weather data sharing and improve safety protocols to better prepare for such unpredictable turbulence events.(With inputs from agencies)","Singapore Airlines Flight SQ321 was flying from London’s Heathrow airport to Singapore.

Almost 30% of Americans say college not worth it in Pew poll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/almost-30-of-americans-say-college-not-worth-it-in-pew-poll/articleshow/110379656.cms,"Close to 30% of Americans said a college degree isn’t worth it in a survey from Pew Research Center that highlights the drag soaring costs have had on views about higher education in recent decades in the country.Almost half of US adults in the report think college is worth the cost — but only as long as they don’t need to take out a loan. Only 22% of respondents said a college degree is worth it even with student debt.Four in 10 Americans said having a four-year degree is not too or not at all important to getting a well-paying job, according to the poll, compared to just a quarter of respondents who said it was extremely or very important.The survey results come as tuition costs are climbing, student loan payments resume for millions of Americans, and some of the relative economic benefits of college are declining. All together, these trends have left students and parents facing increasingly difficult decisions about higher education.For Brad Cohen, a senior loan officer at First Heritage Mortgage and a college graduate himself, the cost-benefit analysis has shifted against four-year degrees as prices have risen.“I think college is one of the biggest wastes of money that there is, unless you’re going to be a doctor or unless you’re going to be a lawyer, or certain specialized professions,” Cohen, a father of two, said in an interview. “It’s just absurd how expensive it is.”Cohen’s daughter is set to study business management and marketing this fall at the University of Arizona, after he dissuaded her from studying interior design. Cohen said he’s saved money for his 14-year-old son to attend college as well, but that he’s encouraging him to pursue a passion for cars by studying at a trade school.“Society thinks people should go to college, but more and more people are realizing that, you know what, I don’t need to go to college. I don’t need to have this financial burden over me that’s going to literally be like a weight upon me for the rest of my life,” Cohen said.Even 13 years ago, a majority of Americans thought the higher education system failed to provide good value for the money spent. At the same time, 86% of the college graduates surveyed in the Pew report from 2011 said higher education had been a good investment for them personally.Like Cohen, many parents who deem the costs too high continue to send their children to universities. Even though wages have been rising for some workers without degrees, particularly since the Covid-19 pandemic, earnings and total wealth for college graduates remain well above those for Americans who don’t go to university. And the unemployment rate for graduates is consistently lower than that of the broader population.A recent report from the Federal Reserve showed Americans for the most part see education as a path to greater financial well-being, and most who completed a bachelor’s degree or higher said it was worth the cost.",Almost half of US adults think college is worth the cost — but only as long as they don’t need to take out a loan.

How algebra in US schools became a national flashpoint,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-algebra-in-us-schools-became-a-national-flashpoint/articleshow/110377114.cms,"From suburbs in the Northeast to major US cities on the West Coast, a surprising subject is prompting ballot measures, lawsuits and bitter fights among parents: algebra . Students have been required for decades to learn to solve for the variable x, and to find the slope of a line. Most complete the course in their first year of high school. But top-achievers are sometimes allowed to enroll earlier, typically in eighth grade.The dual pathways inspire some of the most fiery debates over equity and academic opportunity in American education : Do bias and inequality keep Black and Latino children off the fast track? Should middle schools eliminate algebra to level the playing field?The questions are so fraught because algebra functions as a crucial crossroads in the education system - students who fail it are far less likely to graduate. Those who take it early can take calculus by 12th grade, giving them a potential edge when applying to elite universities and lifting them toward society's most high-status and lucrative professions.But racial and economic gaps in math achievement are wide in the US, and grew wider during the pandemic. In some states, nearly 4 in 5 poor children do not meet math standards. To close those gaps, former New York City mayor Bill de Blasio adopted a goal embraced by many districts elsewhere. Every middle school would offer algebra, and principals could opt to enrol entire eighth graders in the class.San Francisco took an opposite approach: If some children could not reach algebra by middle school, no one would be allowed to take it.The central mission in both cities was to help disadvantaged students. But solving the algebra dilemma can be more complex than solving the quadratic formula.New York's dream of ""algebra for all"" was never fully realized, and Mayor Eric Adams' administration changed the goal to improving outcomes for ninth graders taking algebra. In San Francisco, dismantling middle-school algebra did little to end racial inequities among students in advanced math classes. After a huge public outcry, the district decided to reverse course.""You wouldn't think that there could be a more boring topic in the world,"" said Thurston Domina, a professor at the University of North Carolina. ""And yet, it's this place of incredibly high passions.""'Things run hot,' he said.In some cities, disputes over algebra have been so intense that parents have sued school districts, protested outside mayors' offices and campaigned for the ouster of school board members. Teaching math in middle school is a challenge for educators in part because that is when the material becomes more complex, with students moving from multiplication tables to equations and abstract concepts. Students who have not mastered the basic skills can quickly become lost, and it can be difficult for them to catch up.Many school districts have traditionally responded to divergent achievement levels by separating children into distinct pathways, placing some in general math classes while offering others algebra as an accelerated option. Such sorting, known as tracking, appeals to parents who want their children to reach advanced math as quickly as possible.But tracking has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on inequality. Around a quarter of all students in the United States take algebra in middle school. But only about 12% of Black and Latino eighth graders do, compared with roughly 24% of white pupils, a federal report found.""That's why middle school math is this flashpoint,"" said Joshua Goodman, an associate professor of education and economics at Boston University. ""It's the first moment where you potentially make it very obvious and explicit that there are knowledge gaps opening up.""","Algebra is a crucial crossroads in the education system.

The mystery behind Vivek Ramaswamy purchasing stakes in BuzzFeed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-mystery-behind-vivek-ramaswamy-purchasing-stakes-in-buzzfeed/articleshow/110369188.cms,"Top Picks For You BuzzFeed shares soar as Vivek Ramaswamy takes stake

NEW DELHI: The unexpected move by Vivek Ramaswamy , a former presidential candidate and known supporter of Donald Trump, to acquire a significant stake in BuzzFeed has sparked a wave of speculation and theories. The acquisition , which seemed improbable given Ramaswamy's political and business background, has left many puzzled about his intentions and the future direction of the digital media outlet.The Business Insider, in a report, talks about four primary theories circulating regarding Ramaswamy's motivations:Diversification strategy: Some analysts believe Ramaswamy's purchase is part of a broader strategy to diversify his business interests. Ramaswamy, known for his success in the biotechnology sector, might be looking to expand his portfolio into digital media. BuzzFeed's extensive digital media presence could offer him a new platform to influence public opinion and expand his reach into an industry that has significant cultural impact. This move could also provide a hedge against market fluctuations in his other business ventures.Political Influence : Another prevailing theory suggests that Ramaswamy's investment is aimed at gaining political leverage. By controlling a popular media outlet, he could potentially shape the narrative in favor of his political beliefs and those of his allies. Given his outspoken support for conservative causes and figures, owning BuzzFeed could offer a unique opportunity to influence a younger, more progressive audience, potentially swaying public opinion and political discourse. ""This acquisition could be a strategic move to insert his viewpoints into mainstream media and balance the predominantly liberal slant,"" said a political analyst.Economic Opportunity: There is speculation that Ramaswamy sees untapped economic potential in BuzzFeed's brand and audience. Despite its financial struggles, BuzzFeed's loyal user base and its innovative approach to digital content creation might present a lucrative opportunity for a strategic investor. Ramaswamy could leverage his business acumen to revitalize BuzzFeed's financial health, possibly exploring new revenue streams such as expanded e-commerce, premium content, or strategic partnerships. ""BuzzFeed's engagement metrics are impressive, and with the right investment and strategy, it could become a powerhouse in digital media,"" suggested a media expert.Personal Interest: Lastly, some propose that Ramaswamy's decision could be driven by a personal interest in the media industry or a particular affinity for BuzzFeed's content and community. Ramaswamy, known for his intellectual pursuits and public commentary, might be attracted to the idea of owning a platform that can disseminate ideas and foster discussion. ""He may see BuzzFeed as a vehicle to promote the values of innovation and free speech that he often champions,"" noted a close associate.The acquisition has certainly turned heads, with observers keenly watching how Ramaswamy will integrate his new stake in BuzzFeed into his broader business and political endeavors. The purchase has not only surprised industry insiders but also led to a mix of excitement and apprehension among BuzzFeed's staff and audience.","Vivek Ramaswamy, a former presidential candidate and known supporter of Donald Trump, to acquire a significant stake in BuzzFeed.

"In a first, more Americans smoke marijuana daily than drink alcohol: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-a-first-more-americans-smoke-marijuana-daily-than-drink-alcohol-study/articleshow/110364675.cms,"NEW DELHI: A new study has revealed that the number of Americans who use marijuana daily has surpassed those who consume alcohol with the same frequency. According to research conducted by Carnegie Mellon University , an estimated 17.7 million Americans used cannabis daily or almost daily in 2022, compared to 14.7 million daily alcohol drinkers.This marks the first time in history that daily marijuana use has exceeded daily alcohol consumption. ""A good 40% of current cannabis users are using it daily or near daily, a pattern that is more associated with tobacco use than typical alcohol use,"" explained Jonathan Caulkins, the study's author and a researcher at Carnegie Mellon.The findings, published in the Addiction medical journal, are based on data from the US government’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health. While alcohol remains more widely used overall, it is not consumed on a daily basis by as many individuals.The surge in regular cannabis use coincides with increasing legalization across the US. Nearly half of all states have approved recreational marijuana use since Washington and Colorado led the way in 2012. Additionally, most states have legalized medical marijuana, and some have decriminalized possession for personal use.Daily marijuana use was at a low of fewer than one million Americans in 1992. Since then, per-capita rates of regular use have increased fifteenfold. Caulkins suggests this rise may be partly due to growing public acceptance, which has led more people to openly admit their regular use of the drug.Despite the growing acceptance and legalization, the US National Institute on Drug Abuse has issued warnings about the health risksassociated with cannabis use. These include breathing problems similar to those caused by smoking tobacco, an increased risk of heart attacks, and potential developmental issues during and after pregnancy. Long-term use can also lead to mental health problems such as paranoia, hallucinations, and an exacerbation of schizophrenia symptoms.Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have linked addictive marijuana use to an increased risk of psychosis. ""There is a lot of misinformation in the public sphere about cannabis and its effects on psychological health , with many assuming that this drug is safe to use with no side effects,"" stated David Gorelick, a psychiatry professor at the University of Maryland. He added that nearly half of people with cannabis addictions have another psychiatric condition.",An estimated 17.7 million Americans used cannabis daily or almost daily in 2022.

3-year-old booked for electricity theft in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/3-year-old-booked-for-electricity-theft-in-pakistans-khyber-pakhtunkhwa/articleshow/110327584.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: A 3-year-old toddler was booked for electricity theft in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province after an FIR was filed against the minor, as reported by ARY News.The Peshawar Electric Supply Company (PESCO) and the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) filed the complaint , leading to an FIR against the minor. The child was brought before the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, where his legal representative asserted that the judge dismissed the case after receiving an affidavit.Officials from WAPDA and PESCO expressed uncertainty regarding the child's involvement in the alleged offense.This incident follows a significant revelation last month, where power theft within Power Distribution Companies (DISCOs) reportedly caused a loss of PKR 438 billion to the national treasury. Sources indicated that these losses were a considerable portion of the total annual billing of PKR 723 billion.The power division identified the poorest performing DISCOs, highlighting companies in Hyderabad, Sukkur, Peshawar, Quetta, and Tribal areas for their records. On April 7, the Punjab energy department raised concerns about power distribution companies overcharging government institutions, which it labeled a burden on the provincial exchequer.The department noted that Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO), Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) were overcharging government departments.The department reported that there are over 102,000 electric connections across provincial departments, with a significant discrepancy between actual consumption and billed amounts. For the financial year 2022-23, the provincial departments consumed electricity worth over PKR 1.91 billion but were billed PKR 76 billion.In response to this issue, the federal government approved the deployment of Federal Investigation Officers (FIA) to electricity distribution companies (DISCOs) to curb power theft and enhance revenue recovery. This measure was in line with demands from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as reported by ARY News.","A 3-year-old toddler was booked for electricity theft in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

IMF asks Pakistan ensure transparency in working of Special Investment Facilitation Council,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-asks-pakistan-ensure-transparency-in-working-of-special-investment-facilitation-council/articleshow/110302522.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The IMF has asked Pakistan to share a draft of the under-preparation investment policy and ensure transparency in the working of the much-hyped Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) as the cash-strapped country is seeking a fresh bailout package from the global lender, a media report said on Tuesday. The SIFC was established in June last year under an "" economic revival plan "" devised by civilian and military leaders to capitalise on ""untapped potential in key sectors"" and attract foreign direct investment (FDI). The hybrid government body promises to create an enabling business environment in the country and offer a one-window solution to investors.A visiting team of the Washington-based lender , which is on a sort of assessment mission, has not yet converted ongoing engagement into formal talks with the Pakistani authorities, The News International reported.Both sides expressed divergent views on the macroeconomic framework for the next fiscal budget for 2024-25, the newspaper said.The Pakistani authorities informed the International Monetary Fund's assessment team that the new investment policy was under preparation and would be announced after conducting due deliberations, the report said.The IMF asked for transparency in the working of the SIFC. The assessment team also inquired about the potential investment in different projects and especially asked for privatisation of the national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and other state-owned enterprises (SOEs).Envisaging the CPI-based inflation on the higher average rate of 12.7 per cent for the next budget 2024-25, the Washington-based lender also inquired about the tax exemptions offered by the government for the upcoming Special Economic Zones (SEZs) under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The IMF wants maximisation of non-tax revenues as the proposal under consideration is to increase the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL) for increasing collection up to Pakistani Rs 1.08 trillion in the next fiscal year or slap a carbon levy to compensate the zero rate of GST on petroleum products, The News International reported.The international lender has recommended imposing 18 per cent GST on petrol and diesel along with PDL.The IMF has refused to accept the macroeconomic framework of the Finance Ministry and so far pitched the macroeconomic framework for the next budget 2024-25 including a real GDP growth rate of 3.5 per cent while the CPI-based inflation was projected on the higher side at 12.7 per cent.The Ministry of Finance has prepared a macroeconomic framework whereby the GDP growth was envisaged at 3.7 to 4 per cent while inflation was kept on average in the range of 11 to 12 per cent, the report said.For the outgoing fiscal year 2023-24, the provision GDP growth figure may hover around 2 to 2.5 per cent of GDP against the official target of 3.5 per cent, it said.Pakistan has made a formal request for a fresh bailout package of USD 6 to USD 8 billion under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the possibility of being augmented through climate finance. If successful, it would be the 24th IMF bailout programme for the country.Last month, Pakistan completed a short-term USD 3 billion programme with the IMF, which bailed the country out of any default.It was unclear whether the IMF mission would end with a formal staff-level agreement for the next bailout package, according to The Express Tribune newspaper.The duration, instrument, and size of the next IMF programme were open to discussion, the report said, quoting sources.Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high of 38 per cent last May.The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall, and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around two per cent this year compared to negative growth last year.","The IMF has asked Pakistan to share a draft of the under-preparation investment policy and ensure transparency in the working of the Special Investment Facilitation Council.

Of these, 127,000 Indians came to work and 115,000 Indians came to study, and 9,000 came for other reasons. The next largest nationality to immigrate were Nigerian (141,000), Chinese (90,000), and Pakistani (83,000).Net migration to the UK fell 10% last year to 685,000 after hitting a record high in 2022 of 764,000, the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics show. In UK, foreigners arriving to study or work are also counted in immigration numbers.Of these, 85% were none-EU arrivals, in sharp contrast to pre-2021 when EU nationals made up the largest component of long-term immigration.The main reason for immigration to the UK among non-EU nationals is now work, rather than study; 423,000 non-EU nationalscame to UK to work in the year ending Dec 2023, an increase of 53% from the year before when there were 277,000. Of these, 219,000 weredependant applicants and 204,000 were for main applicants, meaning the number of non-EU nationals arriving as dependants of those on long-term work visas has overtaken the number of main applicants.

Inside Rishi Sunak’s Hail-Mary plan to win UK general election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/inside-rishi-sunaks-hail-mary-plan-to-win-uk-general-election/articleshow/110370779.cms,"Rishi Sunak said he would begin deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda in the days after the general election on July 4 if he’s still prime minister, setting out his core message for the six-week campaign to try to keep Keir Starmer ’s poll-leading Labour Party from taking power.“If I’m elected, we will get the flights off,” Sunak told LBC Radio early Thursday, hours after surprising his Conservative Party by calling a snap vote almost everyone expected in the autumn. Pressed further on timing, he said: “No, after the election. The preparation work has already gone on.”With polls putting Labour 20 points ahead or more, the campaign battle lines are rapidly taking shape. For Starmer’s party, it’s about underscoring the turmoil of the Conservative Party’s 14-year record in office, via Brexit, the pandemic, Liz Truss and an historic cost-of-living crisis. The Labour leader is tapping into voters’ demand for change, while emphasizing a return to stability and what he calls a “politics that treads lighter on people’s lives.”Faced with skepticism about achieving anything more than damage limitation, Sunak is taking a starkly different approach. He wants voters to look past the turmoil and focus on improving economic data to imagine better times ahead. But he’s also talking up various domestic and geopolitical risks, adopting a Tory attack line from past elections that the UK would be less safe under Labour.People familiar with Sunak’s campaign plans said his focus on Rwanda during a morning broadcast round on Thursday was no accident — despite the awkward acknowledgment that deportation flights would not come before the vote.The prime minister is trying to frame the election as a choice between deportation flights under the Tories or a Labour government scrapping what Sunak regards as a key deterrent, a senior Conservative official told Bloomberg, speaking on condition of anonymity discussing campaign strategy.Sunak has long tried to present himself as tough on migration to try to win over voters attracted to the right-wing Reform UK, which is making inroads in districts the Conservatives desperately wanted to hold onto. Sunak got a boost Thursday when Reform’s founder Nigel Farage said he wouldn’t be a candidate — something Tory strategists feared would trigger a wipeout for their party.The aim now is to try to capitalize. Sunak’s team will use the opening campaign days to tell voters that with Farage out of the picture, Reform is not a serious force in British politics, people familiar with their strategy said.Conservative campaigners led by election chief Isaac Levido hope that repeating that message for two weeks will win back votes lost to Reform, eating into Labour’s poll lead and building momentum up to polling day, the people said.Reform UK leader Richard Tice accused Sunak of running scared over the threat posed by his party, saying he’d “bottled it” by calling an early vote.Using the promise of Rwanda flights immediately after the election was a key factor in the decision to call the surprise summer election, the people said. Over a month ago, Sunak aides pushing for a snap vote had proposed a slogan based on Rwanda deportation flights starting under Sunak and stopping under Starmer, Bloomberg reported at the time. Home Secretary James Cleverly used that line at a campaign event after Sunak called the election on Wednesday.To be sure, with Labour well ahead in opinion polls and against a backdrop of more asylum-seekers crossing the English Channel so far this year, other Tories question whether Sunak’s team has found a winning strategy. One aide said it seemed more like an attempt to reduce the scale of the defeat.Katie Hile, who worked under Sunak at the Treasury as a former head of economy and public spending communications, told Bloomberg Radio the prime minister’s strategy will likely be similar to the Tory leadership contest in 2022, when he lost out to Truss but narrowed her lead as the campaign went on. “He’ll take a similar approach of being the candidate of stability,” she said.Statistics published Thursday also illustrated the challenge facing Sunak to build a campaign around tackling migration. While net migration to the UK did fall from a record last year, it was still at an historically high level. Reform will use that to accuse the Tories of broken promises on migration dating back to 2010.In his own event, Starmer tore into Sunak’s migration lines. He said Labour’s focus would be on tackling the gangs arranging the migrant crossings, and accused the prime minister of misleading the public on his Rwanda plan.“Rishi Sunak clearly does not believe in his Rwanda plan,” Starmer told supporters in Kent, where Labour is targeting seats where the migration issue is prominent. “He’s not going to get any flights off. He has called an election early enough to have it not tested before the election.”Despite the prime minister’s bullishness on Rwanda, he cut a frustrated figure during a morning broadcast round when challenged on his decision to call an early election. Sunak said the moment was right because of economic data showing a decline in inflation to 2.3% and steady growth figures.He also defended his move to announce the election in the pouring rain, which was criticized by colleagues and generated a slew of negative newspaper front pages. “I’m not a fair weather politician,” Sunak said on BBC Radio 4, trying to make light of what many saw as a disastrous campaign launch.Still, Sunak will likely see the absence of Farage as a significant win. Had the Brexit campaigner entered the fray, the flow of Tory voters to Reform would likely have accelerated. For months, there has been the suggestion that Farage was enjoying mocking the Conservatives but that his real interest lies in helping Donald Trump become US president again. On Thursday, he made that official.",Rishi Sunak said he would begin deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda in the days after the general election on July 4 if he’s still prime minister.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called for an early general election in the UK to be held on July 4th, 2024. The decision comes at a time when the Conservative Party , which has been in power since 2010, faces significant challenges and controversies. Sunak, who has been Prime Minister since October 2022, made the announcement amidst economic turbulence, a cost-of-living crisis, and ongoing debates over immigration and public services. The election, initially expected to take place in the autumn or as late as January 2025, has been brought forward in what appears to be a strategic gamble by Sunak and his party.The Conservative Party, currently lagging behind Labour in the polls, is confronted with deep internal divisions and a series of crises. These include the fallout from Brexit, economic instability, and frequent leadership changes, with Sunak being the latest in a line of recent Prime Ministers. The Labour Party , led by Keir Starmer, is seen as the front-runner, promising economic stability and improved public services. The upcoming election will determine the future direction of the UK government, with all 650 seats in the House of Commons up for grabs.Rishi Sunak called for an early election on July 4th to address the prolonged distraction and distortion in politics caused by the looming election.Critics and observers are divided on Sunak's gamble. Some view it as a potentially shrewd move to reset the political conversation and address the government's priorities headlong. Others, including cautious voices from the Economist, regard it as a leap into political lunacy given the adverse polling numbers. ""Given the enormous poll lead enjoyed by the Labour Party, the hope that things might somehow improve seemed to most observers like the Tories’ only reasonable strategy,"" highlights the precarious position from which Sunak is choosing to advance.Sunak's decision, described as either ""political genius or lunacy"", aims to tackle the deep-rooted problems that the Conservative government has been unable to solve due to internal factionalism and policy failures.Several factors influenced Sunak's decision to call an election earlier than expected:Positive economic news, such as inflation falling to 2.3%, may have encouraged Sunak to capitalize on this perceived success.The Conservative Party faces a significant electoral challenge, and some believe an early election might reduce the window for further decline in public support.Government Distraction: The prolonged anticipation of an election was distorting government priorities and politics, prompting a need for resolution.High inflation, slow economic growth, and a recent technical recession have raised questions about the government's economic policies.The controversial plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda has sparked significant debate, with critics arguing it violates international law and fails to address the root causes of migration.Healthcare: The National Health Service (NHS) is under strain with long waiting lists and stories of patients facing severe delays in receiving care.Sunak has backtracked on various environmental commitments, including delaying the end of sales for gasoline and diesel vehicles and authorizing new oil drilling, drawing criticism from climate advocates.The Conservative Party has struggled with declining public support due to a series of crises, including economic challenges and frequent leadership changes. The party has faced heavy losses in recent local elections and special elections, with some lawmakers defecting to Labour. Sunak's leadership has been marked by efforts to restore economic credibility, but internal divisions and policy controversies continue to plague the party.Labour, led by Keir Starmer, is currently favored in the polls and is campaigning on a platform of economic stability and improved public services. However, Labour also faces scrutiny over its interventionist policies and the legacy of antisemitism within the party under former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Other significant parties include the Scottish National Party (SNP), the Liberal Democrats, and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which could play crucial roles in forming a coalition government if no single party wins a majority.","Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called for an early general election in the UK to be held on July 4th, 2024. The election, initially expected to take place in the autumn or as late as January 2025, has been brought forward in what appears to be a strategic gamble by Sunak and his party. The upcoming election will determine the future direction of the UK government.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110367868,imgsize-1220866,width-400,resizemode-4/110367868.jpg"
