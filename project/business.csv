Kerala regulator warns herbal drug maker for misleading ad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-regulator-warns-herbal-drug-maker-for-misleading-ad/articleshow/119236705.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: The Ayush drug licensing authority in Kerala has warned a drug company for not complying with Rule 170 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act meant to prevent misleading advertisements. Kerala drug controller (Ayurveda) issued a warning to Pankajakasthuri Herbals India Pvt Ltd for publishing an ad without submitting it to the licensing authority for approval as stipulated by the rule.In January 2025, Pankajakasthuri advertised tablets and an oil for leg pain and reduced mobility featuring a former woman panchayat member, saying that it worked for her. “The wordings of the ad are misleading. Pain in the legs could be due to any reason or conditions such as varicose vein, deep vein thrombosis, inflammations or any infection. Patients with leg pain could be misled that the advertised drug can be used for any purpose,” said Dr Babu KV, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist who complained to the drug controller and asked if the ad had been submitted for approval before being issued.In response to Dr Babu’s RTI query, the drug controller’s office confirmed that the company had not submitted the ad for approval and added that a warning against engaging in such illegal activities in future was issued to the company. Dr Babu said that a mere warning was not a sufficient deterrent and sought exemplary punishment citing a violation despite the restoration of Rule 170 being widely reported.Though Rule 170 was inserted into the Drugs and Cosmetics Act in December 2018, it was stayed by the Mumbai high court in February 2019 on a petition filed by ayurvedic drug manufacturers. In May 2023, the Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani Drugs Technical Advisory Board (ASUDTAB) of the central Ayush ministry recommended the omission of Rule 170 and a notification dated July 1, 2024, was issued omitting it. However, on August 27, 2024 the Supreme Court stayed the July 2024 notification and restored Rule 170 saying that “till further order passed rule 170 shall remain on statute book and in force”.Under Rule 170, advertisement of ayurvedic, siddha and unani drugs have to be cleared by the licensing authority of the state where the manufacturer of the medicine is located or where the corporate office is located, in case the manufacturing is happening in more than one state. It was brought in through an amendment to the rules after consultations with ASUDTAB in response to an increasing number of misleading advertisements of Ayush products.",Kerala drug controller (Ayurveda) issued a warning to Pankajakasthuri Herbals India Pvt Ltd. The company advertised tablets and an oil for leg pain and reduced mobility.

Indian Army: CCS clears mega deal for big indigenous artillery guns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ccs-clears-mega-deal-for-big-indigenous-artillery-guns/articleshow/119234281.cms,"CCS clears mega deal for big indigenous artillery guns

NEW DELHI: Big indigenous guns are finally booming. The PM-led cabinet committee on security on Wednesday cleared the around Rs 7,000 crore deal to acquire advanced towed artillery gun systems ( ATAGS ) for the Army , in a major boost for home-grown capability to manufacture such heavy-duty howitzers .The deal is for 307 howitzers, which have a strike range up to 45-48-km, and 327 gun-towing vehicles to arm 15 artillery regiments of the Army, with the contract expected to be inked next week, top sources told TOI.Designed and developed by DRDO , the 155mm/52-calibre ATAGS will be produced by Bharat Forge and Tata Advanced Systems . Bharat Forge will manufacture 60% of the guns after it emerged as the L-1 (lowest bidder), while Tata will produce the remaining 40%.TOI was the first to report that the ATAGS deal would be inked within this fiscal after clearance from the CCS. The orders for ATAGS are likely to go up in the future because the Army plans to induct “more advanced versions” for a total requirement of 1,580 such guns.India, incidentally, has also secured a couple of export orders for the ATAGs, which officers say have “excellent” accuracy, consistency, mobility, reliability and automation, and can fire five-round bursts as compared to three-round bursts by other contemporary foreign guns.With ATAGS having an “all-electric drive technology” to ensure maintenance-free reliable operations over longer periods of time, India will be able to export the guns in large numbers in the years ahead, an officer said.The ATAGS, whose development began in 2013, has undergone a series of protracted field trials over the years. Finally, in 2021-22, the winter trials were successfully completed at high-altitude areas in Sikkim, which were followed by summer user-firing tests at the Pokhran field firing ranges.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has again driven home the operational utility of long-range, high-volume firepower. Consequently, the Army is progressively stepping up induction of howitzers, missiles, rocket systems and loiter munitions, as reported by TOI earlier.In Dec, for instance, the defence ministry inked a Rs 7,629 crore contract with L&T in collaboration with South Korean Hanwha Defence for the procurement of another 100 K-9 Vajra-T self-propelled tracked gun systems, which have a strike range of 28-38 km and can be deployed in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China.Then in Feb, the MoD inked contracts worth Rs 10,147 crore for high-explosive pre-fragmented extended rockets (45-km range) and area denial munitions (37-km) for the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems being inducted by the Army. Pinaka, too, is being exported to other countries.India has grappled with recurring scandals in import of artillery guns , from the Swedish Bofors in the mid-1980s to the South African Denel in 2005 and Singapore Technology Kinetics in 2009, repeatedly derailing the Army's modernization drive.","The deal is for 307 howitzers, which have a strike range up to 45-48-km, and 327 gun-towing vehicles to arm 15 artillery regiments of the Army.

Child's teary silence can't aid rapist's defence: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/childs-teary-silence-cant-aid-rapists-defence-supreme-court/articleshow/119233933.cms,"Can't equate girl's silence to that of adult prosecutrix: SC

NEW DELHI: Reversing the acquittal of a person in a 40-year-old rape case, Supreme Court said the silence of a little girl with tears rolling down her cheeks when asked about the incident in the trial court during cross-examination cannot be an indicator of innocence of the accused.Slamming the insensitivity of the Rajasthan HC judge for acquitting the accused, who was 21 when convicted and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment by the trial court in 1987 for raping the minor, SC also criticised HC for naming the rape survivor.HC took 26 years to decide the appeal of the convict and acquitted him through a six-page judgment. The Rajasthan govt's appeal, filed in 2013, was finally decided by an SC bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sanjay Karol after 12 years, indicative of the trend that while trial courts decide cases expeditiously, it is the constitutional courts where appeals linger for decades.The trial judge had recorded the child rape survivor had not deposed anything about the commission of the offence during cross-examination and when repeatedly asked, ""she shed tears in silence"".HC had taken this as one of the grounds to acquit the convict.Writing the judgment, Justice Karol said, ""This, in our view, cannot be used as a factor in favour of the accused. The tears of 'V' (minor girl) have to be understood for what they are worth. This silence cannot accrue to the benefit of the accused. The silence here is that of a child. It cannot be equated with the silence of a fully realised adult prosecutrix...""""V has not turned hostile. Trauma has engulfed her in silence. It would be unfair to burden her young shoulders with the weight of the entire prosecution. A child traumatised at a tender age by this ghastly imposition upon her must be relieved of being the basis on which her offender can be put behind bars,"" Justice Karol said and proceeded to cull out other relevant evidence, medical and circumstantial, which unequivocally pointed to the guilt of the accused, Chhatra.The medical evidence pointed to the ghastly way Chhatra sexually assaulted the girl. After examining other evidence on the case records, Justices Nath and Karol allowed the appeal, set aside the HC judgment and upheld the conviction and sentence awarded to Chatra by trial court.Chhatra, who was 22 years of age when he was convicted by the trial court in 1987, would now be over 60 years and SC directed him to surrender before the authorities concerned within four weeks to serve the sentence.","HC took 26 years to decide the appeal of the convict and acquitted him through a six-page judgment.

Brace for detours as Dwarka Expressway section closed for 44 days for repairs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/44-day-closure-for-dwarka-expressway-section/articleshow/119176696.cms,"The closure will affect commuters from several sectors, causing congestion and delays. NHAI aims to ensure long-term durability with this work, amidst concerns over the expressway's frequent repairs.

GURGAON: Commuters using Dwarka Expressway will brace for disruptions as entry from the elevated service road at Daulatabad Chowk towards Delhi will remain closed for 44 days as NHAI has decided to replace an expansion joint.The highway authorities put up barriers at the entry of the connecting flyover of the main carriageway on Tuesday. It will be closed till April 30. The closure is expected to impact those travelling from Sector 99 to 106 and adjoining areas of Dhankot, Basai and Kherki Majra, who will now need to take the surface road and merge onto the main expressway after Bijwasan toll plaza.According to NHAI, an accident in Jan damaged the expansion joint, prompting immediate but temporary repairs. ""However, upon further assessment, it was required to replace expansion joints to ensure long-term durability of the structure. The work will be completed in 44 days,"" said an NHAI official.The highways authorities also maintained that ""all other traffic movements will remain unaffected"" on the expressway, but daily commuters anticipate congestion and delays, especially during peak hours.The surface road, already burdened by traffic from Old Railway Road, Daultabad Road and New Palam Vihar Extension, will carry a higher volume of vehicles, slowing movement.NHAI data indicated that Dwarka Expressway sees one lakh PCU daily. The elevated road's closure is likely to increase travel time for those heading towards Delhi from the city.""The elevated road was a major time-saver, and now traffic will pile up on surface roads. The alternative routes, like Najafgarh Road, are already in poor condition, making things worse. NHAI must ensure quality checks to prevent such recurring issues, especially after investing Rs 9,000 crore on this project,"" said Abhishek Vatsa, a resident of Sector 102, who takes the expressway daily.TOI last month reported that the expressway's city section had undergone several patchworks since its inaugural last year. Though NHAI called it ""routine maintenance"", many commuters raised concerns about the expressway's frequent repair work within such a short span.""It is worrying that different sections of the expressway have been closed for repairs multiple times within a year. We hope NHAI fixes these flaws permanently instead of carrying out just patch repairs,"" said Dhananjay Jha, president of Suncity Avenue RWA.In Dec, expansion joints on the elevated portion were reported damaged near Yashobhoomi on the Delhi section, prompting the highways authority to replace them. Although the Delhi section opened to traffic in March last year, most stretches remain under construction which is expected to finish by Aug this year. In July 2024, just four months after opening, a 70m stretch near Sector 102 developed minor cracks, raising further doubts about the expressway's construction quality. The corridor, built at a cost of Rs 9,000 crore, was envisioned as a high-speed link between Delhi and Gurgaon, serving as a critical route for travellers to Dwarka, IGI Airport, South Delhi and West Delhi.The 19km Haryana section of the 8-lane Dwarka Expressway includes two stretches — one 10.2km portion from Delhi-Haryana Border to Basai rail overbridge and another 8.7km section to Kherki Daula from there.The project, which now shows signs of wear and tear, was executed reduce congestion on NH-8 and offer better connectivity between Gurgaon and Delhi.","The highway authorities put up barriers at the entry of the connecting flyover of the main carriageway on Tuesday.

Be it H-1B visa holders and their kin, or international students, or even green card holders, US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas. India is not on the proposed travel ban list by the US, but still the fear remains.On Monday, TOI reported on similar advice being given to Green Card holders. The reasons range from delays in stamping at US consulates in home country, extreme vetting and cases of secondary inspection, including detention at US airports on return.Kripa Upadhyay, an immigration attorney in Seattle, said, ""This sounds heartless but foreigners (especially those needing to renew H-1B or F-1 visas) must think twice about leaving US right now.""The US department of state has updated eligibility requirements for interview waiver appointments (referred to as dropbox appointments). Earlier, applicants could qualify for interview waiver if they had been issued a non-immigrant visa in any category (except B visitor visas) and were applying within 48 months of expiration. Under revised rules, dropbox is available only to applicants renewing a visa in the same non-immigrant category that has expired within past 12 months. Thus, if you are an international student with an F-1 visa and now need an H-1B you must wait for an interview slot. If you have an H-1B and need an extension, but your earlier visa was issued more than 12 months ago, you must also wait for an interview slot, Upadhyay said.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, said, ""Delays due to visa appointment availability is only part of the concern. We know of individuals stuck in administrative processing for no apparent reason other than additional scrutiny and security clearances. This should not have happened if the individual had been previously approved for a visa multiple times. I think we can expect to see 'extreme vetting' similar to the tenure of the earlier Trump administration.""Also read: Fearing deportation, a Cornell university grad student files a pre-emptive lawsuit If US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has approved an H-1B, the consular officer has the right to refuse the visa and send the application back to USCIS for re-adjudication. Upadhyay added, ""In a situation like this, employees outside the country would be stuck for several monthsbefore they can return to the US."" Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, said, ""If travel is unavoidable, visa applicants and their employers should also try to have contingency plans in case of delayed stamping such as continuing work from their home country.""","US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas.

NEW DELHI: India and China should be partners contributing to each other's success and a cooperative ""pas de deux"" between the dragon and the elephant is the only right choice for the two countries, Beijing said while welcoming PM Modi's ""positive"" remarks in a podcast in which he had endorsed signs of a rapprochement in ties since Oct last year.In the interaction with Lex Fridman, Modi had also strongly backed Donald Trump's policies and the US president even shared the podcast on his social media platform, Truth Social.Modi had said on Sunday that the border situation with China was normalising since his meeting with President Xi Jinping in Kazan in Oct and trust would return in the relationship ""slowly but surely"". Seeking a cooperative relationship, he also said it was natural for India and China to have differences, and the focus should be on ensuring that these don't turn into disputes.Building upon PM Modi's remarks, the Chinese foreign ministry said that Sino-Indian ties were characterised by mutual learning and friendly exchanges for over 2,000 years."" China appreciated PM Modi's recent positive statements. The successful meeting between President Xi and PM Modi in Kazan last Oct provided strategic guidance for the improvement and development of bilateral ties. Both sides have earnestly followed through on the important common understandings of our leaders, strengthened exchanges and practical cooperation at all levels, and achieved a series of positive outcomes,"" a ministry spokesperson said, responding to a question at a media briefing.The official added China stood ready to work with India to implement the understandings that both leaders had reached in their meeting.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday has acknowledged that his initial criticism of India’s stance on the Russia-Ukraine war has left him with ""egg on his face."" Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue in Delhi, Tharoor admitted that India's neutral policy has positioned it as a key player in fostering lasting peace and has a Prime Minister ""who can hug both the president of Ukraine and the president in Moscow"".Tharoor, who had previously called for India to condemn Russia’s aggression, said during a session, ""I am still wiping the egg off my face because I was one of the few in Parliament who criticised India’s position in February 2022.""The Thiruvananthapuram MP explained that his criticism was based on the violation of the UN Charter and Ukraine’s sovereignty. However, three years later, he now recognises that India’s balanced approach has allowed Prime Minister Narendra Modi to engage with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky within weeks of each other.""All of those principles had been violated by one party and we should have condemned it. Well, three years later it does look like I am the one with the egg on my face because clearly the policy has meant that India has actually a prime minister who can hug both the president of Ukraine (Zelenskyy) and the president in Moscow (Putin) two weeks apart and be accepted in both places,"" he said according to news agency PTI.With the caveat that he was speaking in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the government as he is in the opposition, Tharoor suggested that India might be open to sending peacekeepers if there was an agreed peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine.He noted that Russia has ruled out NATO peacekeepers, making non-European forces more viable. ""As an Indian parliamentarian, I don’t think there would be strong resistance to the idea,"" he said, citing India's extensive history in peacekeeping missions.Tharoor recalled how, in 2003, India’s Parliament firmly rejected sending troops to Iraq after the US-led invasion. However, he stated, “I don’t see that happening for Ukraine.”India has participated in over 49 UN peacekeeping missions, reinforcing its long-standing commitment to global stability.","Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has acknowledged that his initial criticism of India’s stance on the Russia-Ukraine war has left him with ""egg on his face"" The Thiruvananthapuram MP said India's neutral policy has positioned it as a key player in fostering lasting peace.

However, I assure you, if any attempt is made to glorify his legacy through '', it will not succeed,"" Fadnavis said at an event that he attended to inaugurate a temple dedicated to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Thane district and lauded the Maratha king for fighting for '' and the country.""We are able to worship our gods freely today because of Shivaji Maharaj's efforts. He fought for Swarajya, for God, for our country, and our religion,"" Fadnavis was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Earlier, BJP's Satara MP Udayanraje Bhosale, who is also the descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, advocated for the removal of the Mughal king's tomb situated in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.Responding to Bhosale's request, Fadnavis clarified that despite sharing similar sentiments, actions must conform to legal procedures due to the site's protected status, which was established during the previous Congress administration.Fadnavis said, ""We all also want the same thing, but you need to do it within the framework of the law, because it is a protected site. The site was put under ASI's (Archaeological Survey of India) protection during the Congress regime some years back.""The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) protects historical tombs under the AMASR Act, 1958, ensuring their preservation. If a tomb is declared a protected monument, no construction is allowed within 100 meters, and activities in the 200-meter regulated area need approval. The ASI oversees conservation and prevents alterations or damage.Section 19(1) of the Act clearly states that no person, including government authorities, can destroy, remove, alter, or deface a protected monument without official permission.Further strengthening these protections, the AMASR (Amendment) Act, 2010, imposes strict penalties and imprisonment for unauthorised construction, alteration, or destruction of a protected monument. This means that even a state government cannot make changes to an ASI-protected tomb.Violating these rules leads to legal action, fines, or imprisonment. Unauthorized encroachments are removed, and restoration must maintain the tomb’s original character.Aurangzeb was the sixth ruler of the Mughal Empire, reigning from 1658 to 1707. He was the son of Emperor Shah Jahan and is known for expanding the Mughal Empire to its greatest territorial extent, covering almost the entire Indian subcontinent.Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb followed a more orthodox Islamic rule, enforcing religious policies that included the reintroduction of the jizya tax on non-Muslims and restrictions on certain cultural practices.Aurangzeb and Sambhaji Maharaj were fierce adversaries in the late 17th century. Sambhaji, the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji, was the second ruler of the Maratha Empire, while Aurangzeb was the Mughal emperor who sought to crush the Marathas and expand Mughal rule in the Deccan. Their rivalry intensified after Sambhaji ascended the throne in 1681 and continued his father’s resistance against Mughal domination.In 1689, Aurangzeb's forces captured Sambhaji near Sangameshwar through treachery. He was brutally tortured for refusing to convert to Islam and executed in an inhumane manner.His martyrdom made him a symbol of Maratha defiance, strengthening the Maratha resistance against Mughal rule. Sambhaji’s death fueled the eventual decline of Mughal power in the Deccan.","Devendra Fadnavis said it is ""unfortunate"" that the government has to protect Aurangzeb's grave.

India to step on the gas for indigenous 5th gen fighter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-step-on-the-gas-for-indigenous-5th-gen-fighter/articleshow/119090404.cms,"NEW DELHI: India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, with a top-level committee now working to evolve a clear-cut strategy and production-cum-business model for the swing-role advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).The committee chaired by defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, which includes IAF vice chief Air Marshal S P Dharkar, secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar and top officials from DRDO and Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), is slated to submit its report next month.This comes at a time when Pakistan is looking to acquire at least 40 J-35A stealth fifth-generation jets from China, which is now brandishing even sixth-generation prototypes.China has already deployed its fifth-generation Chengdu J-20 jets at its airfields facing India like Hotan and Shigatse, as reported earlier by TOI.Faced with this, coupled with the huge delay in production of the fourth-generation Tejas jets by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a source told TOI that the committee's aim is to ""devise how best to get AMCA from the drawing board into the air by shrinking timelines and improving efficiency, including a good workable production-cum-business model with much greater private sector participation"".The committee will also consider the plan for indigenous development of a 110 kilonewton thrust-class engine to power the 25-tonne AMCA with foreign technology collaboration. Aero-engine majors like US General Electric, French Safran and British Rolls-Royce are in the fray for this. The new panel was formed after another defence secretary-led committee chalked out a detailed roadmap for IAF's ""all-round capability enhancement"" to plug existing operational gaps in a time-bound manner. The report was presented to defence minister Rajnath Singh on March 3, as was then reported by TOI.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the full-scale engineering development of five prototypes of the twin-engine AMCA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore. The AMCA, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and ""serpentine air-intake"", however, will be ready for production only by 2035 at the earliest as per existing timelines. ""It will be a challenge to compress timelines but a major effort has to be made due to IAF's expanding technological shortfalls,"" another source said, in the backdrop of IAF currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised. At least eight more squadrons are slated for retirement over the next 10 years. IAF currently plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, which will also have AI-powered electronic pilot systems, netcentric warfare systems, integrated vehicle health management and the like. While the first two squadrons will be powered by GE-F414 engines in the 98 kilonewton thrust class, the next five will have 110 kilonewton engines.In the interim, the dwindling numbers are to be progressively made up by induction of 180 Tejas Mark-1A fighters (for around Rs 1.2 lakh crore) and 108 more capable Tejas Mark-2 jets .Parallelly, the long-pending project to manufacture 114 4.5-generation multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) with foreign collaboration as reported by TOI earlier.",India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet.

SC: Obligatory for promoter, appt owner to form association

NEW DELHI: In an important decision which will allow homebuyers to take charge of their societies even if the project has not been completed, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has held that once the Apartment Owners Association gets registered, management of the complex's common areas and facilities has to be transferred from the promoter to the association.A bench headed by chairperson of NCLAT Justice Ashok Bhushan said a real estate company has no right to resist handing over of maintenance to the association.The tribunal passed the order on a plea by the homebuyers' association of Supernova housing project in Noida, being developed by Supertech Ltd, that management of the complex be handed over to it. The bench directed the company to hand over the charge within seven days.Advocate Govind Jee, appearing for the homebuyers, told the tribunal that Supernova apartment owners had formed an association which was registered under Uttar Pradesh Apartment (Promotion of Construction, Ownership and Maintenance) Act and they should be allowed to take over management which was being looked after by a company called YG Estates. The homebuyers approached the tribunal as the project is under insolvency.Supertech argued that as per law, an association could be formed only when at least 33% of homebuyers had taken possession of their flats. In Supernova's case, only 27% of the total project has received occupancy certificate from Noida. There are 2,165 units in the project.The bench, also comprising members Barun Mitra and Arun Baroka, said it was a statutory obligation for the promoter and apartment owners to form an association.Rejecting the company's plea that 33% of apartments have to be handed over before an association is formed and that the present association was not a valid one, the tribunal said, ""We are of the view that the association having been registered and the registration of association still being valid it is not open for YG Estates to contend that registration of the association is not in accordance with the law. The issue with regard to non-fulfilment of the necessary conditions for registration of the association cannot be allowed to be raised in these proceedings nor can it be examined in these applications. When the association has been registered, it has to be presumed that registration was made after compliance of all necessary requirements.""As the parties raised questions on clearing the dues, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal directed them to appear before the Interim Resolution Professional and arrive at a settlement.""We are of the view that in these proceedings, the issues pertaining to outstanding of YG Estates or any amount accepted by YG Estates cannot be gone into or decided. We are of the view that such issues can be raised before the Interim Resolution Process who is overall in-charge of all projects and management. It is for the Interim Resolution Process to take a call and take necessary steps for settlement of accounts between the parties,"" it said.","National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has held that once the Apartment Owners Association gets registered, management of the complex's common areas and facilities has to be transferred to the association.

SC orders direct bank transfer of payout in road accident cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-orders-direct-bank-transfer-of-payout-in-road-accident-cases/articleshow/119233240.cms,"NEW DELHI: As an average of more than five lakh people die or get injured in road accidents every year and corresponding number of compensation claims get filed before tribunals, Supreme Court has ordered cutting down of delay in payment of recompense money to the kin or injured through direct bank transfer (DBT) method.In general, insurance companies, where the compensation amount claimed by the kin or injured is not disputed, deposit the money before motor accident claims tribunal (MACT), which delays the amount reaching the relatives of the dead or the injured as in many cases they remain unaware of such deposits made by the insurer. Enhancing the compensation payable from Rs 12 lakh, determined by HC, to Rs 36.8 lakh in a 2014 accident claim case, a bench of J K Maheshwari and Rajesh Bindal said “a direction can always be issued to transfer the amount into the bank account(s) of the claimant(s) with intimation to the tribunal.”SC said MACTs can ask the claimants at the initial stage to furnish their bank accounts and direct the insurer to directly transfer the undisputed amount to their accounts. It said that the same DBT method can be adopted by the insurers when the tribunal makes the final award on the claims. The bench passed this order considering the large number of deaths and injuries caused by road accidents in the last five years. For the year 2018, road accident deaths were 1.5 lakh, and 4.6 lakh were injured; 2019 — 1.5 lakh deaths and 4.4 lakh injuries; 2020 — 1.3 lakh deaths and 3.4 injuries; 2021 — 1.5 lakh deaths and 3.8 lakh injuries; 2022 – 1.6 lakh deaths and 4.4 lakh injuries. Mentioning that India has done wonders in popularising digital payments, the bench said the courts and insurance companies can adopt the same for direct transfer of money to claimants instead of making them wait for months to get compensation.","Supreme Court has ordered cutting down of delay in payment of recompense money to the kin or injured through direct bank transfer (DBT) method.

Ready for synergy with India on dual-use tech: Dutch minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ready-for-synergy-with-india-on-dual-use-tech-dutch-minister/articleshow/119232316.cms,"Ready for synergy with India on dual-use tech: Dutch minister

NEW DELHI: One of the global leaders in the semiconductor industry , which is also looking to ramp up its presence in the Indo-Pacific, the Netherlands wants to integrate its defence industry with India with collaboration in dual use technologies like drones, AI and semiconductors. Dutch defence minister Ruben Brekelmans told TOI in an exclusive interview that the 2 countries are looking to upgrade their ties to the level of a strategic partnership and it’s important to have a strong defence and security pillar to base it on.Brekelmans said that the Netherlands, one of the principal backers of Kyiv in Europe, seeks robust security guarantees for Ukraine to blunt Russia’s “imperial ambitions” and to prevent a return to the 19th century.“Both have strong maritime sectors and there’s more we could do on this. There are also some dual-use technologies , for example in drones, AI, semiconductors where there’s a lot of innovation in the Netherlands, also in India. It’d be interesting to look for synergies. India very often doesn’t just have knowledge but also the scale to produce in large numbers. That’s what we need right now. We need to ramp up our defence industries and if there’s also capacity from the Indian side, it can be important,’’ said the minister, before his meeting with counterpart Rajnath Singh this week. The Netherlands had imposed restrictions on the export of chip equipment in 2023, apparently under pressure from the Biden administration that wanted to curb supplies to China.Asked about the Indo-Pacific, where the Netherlands was one of the first European countries to have its own policy, Brekelmans said the Dutch intend to have maritime exercise every 2 years in the region. “So, we often have one of our frigates visiting multiple countries, India being one of the important ones of course. We also do air exercises, with our F-35s, to show indeed that we share the same values and principles. We have more people to people contacts with India and others, more military attaches to strengthen cooperation,’’ he said.On the threat to the transatlantic alliance from US President Donald Trump’s policies, Brekelmans said he had heard from his counterpart Pete Hegseth that Nato is more relevant today than ever and backed Trump’s call for Europe to spend more on defence. He, however, said the policy of reciprocal tariffs would hurt all.“There can be some tactical moves by the US to push allies and friends to do certain things and that’s fine. But it’s important that we remain close friends at the strategic level. It’s positive that the US has stressed multiple times that Nato is important. If there are some strategic decisions made by the US, for example to promote focus on Asia, it’s always better to do that together than make any unilateral move,’’ he said.With the Netherlands having committed military aid worth 10 billion euros to Ukraine, Brekelmans said there must be enough military power to ensure any peace deal is durable. “A peace deal should not lay the ground for future Russian aggression. Not just in Ukraine, but also other parts of Europe. It’s also important to have credible deterrence at other Nato borders. We have had 80 years of peace and we want another 80 years of the same,’’ said the minister.","Netherlands wants to integrate its defence industry with India with collaboration in dual use technologies like drones, AI and semiconductors.

NEW DELHI: Bearing the brunt of China’s aggressive expansionist tactics in the South China Sea , the Philippines now wants India to join the relatively new `Squad’ strategic alliance it has forged with the US, Australia and Japan to counter such threats in the crucial Indo-Pacific region .Pointing to China’s “illegal, coercive and disruptive Grey Zone” tactics to claim territory and build militarised artificial islands in the South China Sea region, Philippines chief of staff of armed forces General Romeo S Brawner said countries like India and South Korea should also be `included’ in the Squad.China was clearly the big dragon in the room when top military officers of the `Quad’ (India, US, Australia and Japan) and the Philippines got together to discuss maritime security challenges in the Indo-Pacific during the Raisina Dialogue here on Wednesday.“The three artificial islands created by China give it effective control over the South China Sea. They have built a 2.7-km runway, with air defence and other missile systems, on Mischief Reef…Moving forward, it is our belief that they will take full control of the South China Sea,” Gen Brawner said.China has been strong-arming its neighbours in the South and East China Seas as well as the Taiwan Strait to push its territorial claims, flouting all international norms. Japan, on its part, is doubling its defence spending to improve its current war-fighting capabilities and prepare for the future, said Japanese chief of joint staff Gen Yoshihide Yoshida.US Indo-Pacific Command chief Admiral Samuel Paparo, who also dwelt upon the prospect of China forcibly intervening in Taiwan, in turn, said all countries that believe matters should not be “settled by force” should build and maintain a strong deterrence posture.China, with the world’s largest Navy of 370 warships and submarines, now of course also deploys seven to eight naval vessels on a permanent basis in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), including dual-purpose research or spy ships to map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said India believed it was its responsibility to ensure IOR remains peaceful and stable, with unhindered passage of trade. “A Navy that does not deploy does not deter. So, we have been deploying far and wide…We are quite capable of maintaining MDA (maritime domain awareness) in the IOR. We are aware of who is doing what, where and how,” he said.India is “keeping a close watch” on dual-purpose and other naval vessels operating in the IOR, sharing intelligence, building bilateral, trilateral and multilateral partnerships, and helping island nations build capacity, Admiral Tripathi added.Former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed, sitting in the audience, asked whether the new Trump administration can be trusted to remain steadfast about its partners in the Indo-Pacific. The consensus, by and large, was that while the US may rollback from Europe, the Indo-Pacific would remain on the top of Trump’s radar screen.“We foresee an increase in support to the Indo-Pacific,” Gen Brawner said. Admiral Paparo added that the Trump administration had reiterated its commitment to the Indo-Pacific and its partners there. One of the first meetings of the new administration was of the foreign ministers of the Quad, he added.","China has been strong-arming its neighbours in the South and East China Seas as well as the Taiwan Strait to push its territorial claims, flouting all international norms.

LEH: Technology is breaking new ground in the arid reaches of Ladakh. This summer, it will automate water supply from its ice stupas, which the cold desert has come to rely on heavily for drinking and farming as glaciers melt and natural streams dry up because of climate change.In 1987, when the water crisis had already begun to manifest, civil engineer Chewang Norphel devised artificial glaciers - small dams on mountain slopes that slowed down water flow in winter and allowed formation of ice, which could then be tapped in spring. The Ice Man's groundbreaking work earned him the Padma Shri in 2015. Scientist Sonam Wangchuck improved on this by making the first ice stupa in 2013. These were easier to manage and melted gradually during the critical sowing season. The conical shape ensured it had the least surface area for the maximum volume and melted only on the side that received sunlight. So the stupa lasted a lot longer.Between 2014 and 2017, 12 stupas were built. Since 2018, more than 80 have come up, 27 of them in the last year, with Ladakh villages seeing in them an effective solution to the water scarcity problem. The ice stupas are a reliable water supply source for three critical agriculture months - April, May and June - for locals to grow crops like barley, buckwheat, vegetables, and fruits like apricots and apples.However, managing the stupas is extremely labour-intensive, requiring daily monitoring and adjustments. For example, when night temperatures drop too low, reaching -15 to -20 degrees Celsius, it causes the water inside the pipes to freeze, blocking the entire system. Someone must climb up, dig through the snow, and manually unfreeze the pipes. Besides, every morning, the pipes need to be carried to sunny areas to thaw.Wangchuck's Himalayan Institute of Alternatives , Ladakh (HIAL), in collaboration with HDFC Bank's Parivartan initiative, has been developing a system since 2023 in Phyang village that automates stupa management by regulating water flow and preventing pipe blockages. The stupa at Phyang, which this reporter visited, is 60 feet high and contains 3 million litres of water.Nishant Tiku, HIAL project coordinator, said, ""We have successfully developed smart stupas that require minimal human intervention. A similar automated system would typically cost Rs 20-30 lakh, but our in-house system has been built at one-tenth the cost. We are working to further reduce it to Rs 1 lakh.""The automated system consists of temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and motorised valves that control water flow. It operates on solar power. The sensors monitor internal pipe temperature and the surrounding environment. If it's too cold, water is diverted to prevent freezing within the pipe. When the conditions are favourable, flow into the pipe gets restored. ""People had to visit the stupas at least twice a day to regulate water flow. In extreme conditions, frozen pipes required up to six hours of labour to clear. Automation has reduced manual labour by 95%,"" said Aman Dedhia, automation specialist at HIAL.In Phyang, the stupa has become a tourist draw as well. Karma Phunchok, who runs Ice Cafe near the Phyang stupa, said on weekends, at least 500 people visit the site to see the system and setup. Local entrepreneur Konchok Namgyal is collaborating with HDFC Bank and HIAL to start ice-climbing near the stupa. ""Many people leave Ladakh in winter due to a lack of employment, but with water conservation and winter tourism, locals can find year-round income sources,"" Namgyal said.The reporter was in Ladakh on the invitation of HDFC Bank","Since 2018, more than 80 ice stupas have come up, 27 of them in the last year.

MUMBAI: Cyber fraudsters extorted Rs 20 crore from an 86-year-old Mumbai resident by threatening her with arrest, accusing her of money laundering. To make it seem genuine, they made her attend fake court proceedings online. For two months, they called her every three hours to check her location and ordered her to stay home. Two fraudsters have been arrested.The woman first received a call from a man claiming to be Sandip Rao from CBI, who alleged that a bank account was opened in her name and used for money laundering, including transfers to Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal's account.

He told her there was an arrest warrant, freeze warrant, and confidential agreement against her. She was warned that if she didn't cooperate, police would be sent to her house.Scared, she was told she need not visit the police station under ""Digital India Movement,"" and that her ""e-investigation"" would continue with cops monitoring her. She was asked to provide bank details under pretext of verifying funds linked to ""criminal activities.""The woman was kept in ""digital police custody,"" forbidden from speaking to relatives.

What is the three-language policy?



NEW DELHI: The Union ministry of education informed Parliament on Wednesday that it does not plan to ""impose"" any language on any state under the three-language formula of the National Education Policy (NEP).""No language to be imposed on any state under the three-language formula, languages learned by children to be choices of states and students,"" the education ministry said in the Rajya Sabha.This statement follows an ongoing disagreement between the Union government and the Tamil Nadu state government over the implementation of NEP in the state.Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has accused the Union government of trying to impose Hindi and has refused to implement the three-language formula under NEP.Tamil Nadu's refusal to adopt the three-language policy under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has revived the long-standing debate on language.The debate over NEP is focused on its three-language formula, which Tamil Nadu fears may lead to the introduction of Hindi in the state. Stalin has raised concerns that the policy gives more importance to Hindi over regional languages, which he believes affects the state's linguistic identity and autonomy.The central government, however, says that NEP encourages multilingualism and allows flexibility in language education. Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has denied that Hindi is being imposed, stating that states have the freedom to choose their languages under the policy.The dispute grew after the central government withheld ₹2,152 crore meant for Tamil Nadu’s Samagra Shiksha scheme, citing the state’s refusal to implement NEP. Tamil Nadu has historically opposed the three-language formula, considering it a step toward promoting Hindi, while the central government argues that the policy is intended to help students access job opportunities in different regions.The three-language formula proposed under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 differs significantly from the earlier policy introduced in 1968. The previous policy required Hindi, English, and a modern Indian language (preferably a southern language) in Hindi-speaking states, while non-Hindi-speaking states followed Hindi, English, and a regional language.NEP 2020 claims to offer greater flexibility and states that no language will be imposed on any state. However, it encourages the study of certain languages. The policy includes a dedicated section highlighting Sanskrit and promotes its inclusion as an option under the three-language formula. It also states that classical languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, as well as Pali, Persian, and Prakrit, should be available as language choices.To support learning in the mother tongue, NEP 2020 emphasizes the availability of high-quality textbooks in mother tongues. In 2024, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) released digital books in 104 regional languages and dialects, including Bengali, Khandeshi, Tulu, Ladakhi, Pashto, Bhili, Dogri, Lahuli (Pattani), and Car Nicobarese. NCERT officials have said that state education departments, through their respective State Councils of Educational Research and Training (SCERTs), are responsible for translating these materials.Some states have already taken steps in line with NEP 2020. In 2023, Andhra Pradesh introduced bilingual textbooks in Telugu and English. Assam followed suit by launching bilingual Science and Maths textbooks in English, Assamese, Bodo, and Bengali.","The Union ministry of education informed Parliament on Wednesday that it does not plan to ""impose"" any language on any state.

AAP's response

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government 's Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) has registered a case against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former public works department (PWD) minister Satyendra Jain over alleged corruption in a Rs 571 crore CCTV project, officials confirmed on Wednesday.As per ANI, the case revolves around claims that Jain waived liquidated damages worth Rs 16 crore imposed on Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) for delays in installing CCTV cameras across Delhi.In exchange, he allegedly accepted a bribe of Rs 7 crore through contractors who benefited from additional orders.An FIR was filed under Sections 7 and 13(1)(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 120B ( criminal conspiracy ) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) after obtaining approval under Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act from the competent authority.Joint commissioner of police (ACB) Madhur Verma said, “Bribery of Rs 7 crore was allegedly arranged to be paid to Satyendra Jain to waive off the Rs 16 crore penalty for delays in CCTV installation.”Despite repeated delays, BEL was awarded further contracts for an additional 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras, raising concerns over the project's execution.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva strongly criticised the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), alleging that former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and former minister Satyendra Jain were the ""masterminds"" behind the alleged scam.Sachdeva said that the BJP had earlier flagged the issue, leading to a vigilance probe that found Jain guilty in 2023. However, he accused Kejriwal of halting the file to shield Jain.With the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) now filing an FIR, Sachdeva asserted that Kejriwal’s role would also come under scrutiny.AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar dismissed the allegations against Satyendra Jain as ""ridiculous"" and accused the BJP of orchestrating a political vendetta. Calling the FIR a ""desperate attempt"" by the BJP, she asserted that AAP leaders were being targeted in a relentless ""witch hunt"" despite no evidence of wrongdoing.Kakkar further criticised the BJP for allegedly misusing investigative agencies against political opponents while failing to act against defaulters who fled the country without repaying loans, insisting that such tactics would not help India progress.Officials claim that the work was carried out in a “shoddy manner,” with many cameras found to be non-functional even at the time of project handover. Payments were allegedly inflated to accommodate bribes involving multiple vendors, ANI reported.The ACB has already questioned a BEL officer, who reportedly confirmed the allegations and provided a detailed complaint. Documents from PWD and BEL are being scrutinised for further evidence.Over a month ago, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) sought the President’s approval to prosecute Jain under Section 218 of the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, ANI reported, citing sources.The request was reportedly based on evidence collected by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which allegedly provided sufficient grounds for legal action.","The Delhi government's Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) has registered a case against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former public works department (PWD) minister Satyendra Jain.

'Posters of missing being removed'

PM Modi’s praise for Maha Kumbh



NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday raised serious concerns over the Maha Kumbh mela, questioning the arrangements and demanding answers from the BJP government .The SP chief claimed that nearly 1,000 Hindus are still missing after the grand religious gathering in Prayagraj and accused the Uttar Pradesh government of not doing enough to locate them.Speaking on Wednesday, Yadav criticised the government. “It is a good thing that we all remember Maha Kumbh and Kumbh again and again... The biggest question is how much budget did the Government of India give for organising Maha Kumbh? The Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh were only making arrangements for where the vehicles would be parked. People were being stopped, they were not being allowed to enter the border,” he said.Yadav also urged the BJP government to assist the families of those missing. “BJP and its people should at least help the families of those devotees whose family members have been lost. Still, about 1,000 Hindus are missing. BJP should give information about the missing 1,000 Hindus to their families. There are still posters in Prayagraj. It is sad that the BJP government of Uttar Pradesh is getting those posters removed. The government should at least try to find those 1,000 Hindus who are missing,” he added.Yadav also criticised the management and role of senior officials and police in handling the gathering. “Can anyone imagine that the CMs of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh were making the arrangements for vehicle parking? Several IPS officers were stopping devotees from visiting and saying that they didn't have proper arrangements for them,” he said.Furthermore, he questioned the financial aspect, asking the UP government to disclose how much funding it had received from the Centre for Maha Kumbh.A day earlier, PM Modi hailed the Maha Kumbh, comparing it to the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. He described the gathering of millions as a symbol of India’s national consciousness and unity. “Shedding personal egos, people embraced the spirit of 'wayam' (the collective We), rather than 'mai' (the individual I). People from diverse states became a part of the sacred Triveni,” he said.Modi praised the efforts of the government, society, and the people of Uttar Pradesh in making the event successful. He said that Maha Kumbh represented India’s rising strength and national self-assurance. Recalling historical moments like Swami Vivekananda’s Chicago address and the Dandi March, he stated that Maha Kumbh stood as another milestone in India’s journey of awakening.However, his speech did not mention the tragic incidents during the event, including reports of stampedes and missing persons. This omission was quickly pointed out by the opposition, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who was denied permission to respond immediately after Modi’s address.After stepping out of the Lok Sabha.Rahul said: ""I wanted to support what the PM said, Kumbh is our tradition, history, and culture. There was one thing the PM did not pay condolences to people who lost their lives in Kumbh.""The Congress leader also took a swipe at Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla after he was not permitted to speak.""LoP should be given permission to speak, but I guess it is a new India,"" the Congress leader said.","Akhilesh Yadav claims nearly 1,000 Hindus are still missing after the grand religious gathering in Prayagraj.

Jaime King loses custody amid personal struggles

What this means for Taylor Swift and her Godson

Taylor Swift has always been known for fiercely protecting her private life, but recent developments concerning one of her godchildren have placed her in an unexpected spotlight. The pop superstar is a godmother to Blake Lively’s children and Jaime King’s younger son, Leo. However, due to a recent court ruling, Swift's connection with Leo may now face new limitations.In a ruling that has sent shockwaves through Hollywood circles, a judge has granted Jaime King’s ex-husband, Kyle Newman, sole physical custody of their children. He has also been given tie-breaking authority over legal custody decisions, effectively leaving King with limited parental rights.This decision follows allegations that King has struggled with substance abuse. Reports indicate that she failed to complete a six-month rehab program, which was a critical factor in the court’s decision. According to court documents, Newman was called by his children, who allegedly pleaded for him to pick them up from King’s home. When he arrived, he claimed to have found King in a distressing state.""Jaime looked distressed, strung out and was acting drunk,"" Newman stated in the legal filings. ""She gestured for me to come over to her because she tried to get up but could not stand.""These allegations painted a concerning picture of her ability to care for her children, leading to the judge’s ruling that she would only be allowed supervised visitation.While Swift has not publicly commented on the matter, this court decision could have an impact on her ability to maintain a close relationship with Leo. Given that King can only see her children under strict supervision, any time Swift spends with Leo may now be subject to legal conditions.According to People, the court order allows King visitation rights three times a week in designated time slots. However, she must be supervised by a list of approved individuals, which includes her mother, sister, brother-in-law, and Newman's brother Kevin. Notably absent from this list are any of King’s celebrity friends, including Swift.An addendum to the court order outlines strict conditions that King must meet before she can regain unsupervised visitation.

Tesla owner Elon Musk fired back at Minnesota governor Tim Walz after the former Democratic vice presidential candidate mocked Tesla's falling share price during a public appearance.Walz, who was part of the Democratic ticket that lost the 2024 election, took a swipe at Musk and Tesla while joking about the electric vehicle giant's recent stock slide.

Bangkok Grand Prix talks gain momentum after meeting between F1 CEO and Thailand Prime Minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/formula-one/news/bangkok-grand-prix-talks-gain-momentum-after-meeting-between-f1-ceo-and-thailand-prime-minister/articleshow/119188933.cms,"Photo by: Formula 1

F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali holds key talks with Thai Prime Minister over Bangkok Grand Prix



Bangkok as the Potential Venue



Challenges and Future Outlook



Formula 1 ’s global expansion could soon see Thailand joining the prestigious Grand Prix calendar. F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali recently met with Thailand’s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra to discuss the nation’s plans to host a race in Bangkok . If successful, Thailand would become a key addition to the F1 schedule, strengthening the sport’s presence in Southeast Asia and adding another dynamic street race to the already packed calendar.Thailand has been signaling its desire to join the F1 calendar for some time now. The presence of Alex Albon, who races under a Thai license, has already given the country a connection to the current grid. Additionally, Thai billionaire Chalerm Yoovidhya holds a 51% stake in Red Bull GmbH, the parent company of Red Bull Racing, further strengthening Thailand's ties to the sport.Domenicali's visit to Bangkok came after the season-opening Australian Grand Prix and ahead of the Chinese Grand Prix. During his meeting with Shinawatra, he expressed optimism about the prospect of a race in the Thai capital. “I was delighted to meet with Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the prime minister of Thailand, and her team today to discuss their impressive plans to host a race in Bangkok,” Domenicali said. “I am looking forward to continuing our discussions in the weeks and months ahead.”The push to host a Thai Grand Prix reflects the broader trend of Formula 1's strategic expansion into new markets. The sport has already established a strong foothold in the Middle East and the United States, where three Grand Prix are now held annually. Asia has also emerged as a key focus area, with growing interest from South Korea and Africa, particularly Rwanda, which formally expressed its ambition to host a race last year.Should Thailand’s bid succeed, the race is expected to be held as a street circuit in Bangkok, adding to the list of high-profile city-based races like Monaco, Singapore, and Las Vegas. Early reports suggest that a permanent track could also be constructed in the capital, offering a more stable and long-term solution. Plans to redevelop a former bus station near a public park in Bangkok have been floated as a potential site, which would allow F1 to maintain a strong urban presence while offering a unique racing experience.F1 expert Joe Saward has reported that the sport is seeking a long-term, government-backed agreement, ideally spanning ten years. This approach would ensure financial stability and long-term commitment, mirroring the successful models seen in other established venues. Thailand’s government has shown serious intent, with former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin also holding talks with Domenicali at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix last year before his departure from office stalled the plans temporarily. Prime Minister Shinawatra’s renewed engagement suggests that momentum is building once again.A Thai Grand Prix would not only attract global attention but also serve as a significant economic and tourism boost for the country. Bangkok’s vibrant culture, modern infrastructure, and growing motorsport fanbase make it a compelling destination for F1’s expansion strategy. The popularity of Alex Albon would further bolster local interest and generate strong fan engagement.Despite the enthusiasm surrounding a Thai Grand Prix, challenges remain. The current F1 schedule is already at a record-high 24 races, creating logistical and calendar-related constraints. However, the introduction of a rotational system, as seen with the Belgian Grand Prix’s recent extension, could open the door for new entrants without further bloating the calendar. Belgium will now host a race four times over the next six seasons, setting a precedent for future scheduling flexibility.Domenicali acknowledged the increasing interest from new markets during the Australian Grand Prix weekend. “We receive a lot of attention from other places in the world. By the way, I’m just finishing the race here in Melbourne, I'm going to Bangkok — there is a potential interest from the government to develop something there,” he said.Africa also remains on the radar, with Rwanda showing serious interest, although political and security concerns have complicated progress. Argentina, which last hosted a race in 1998, has also been mentioned as a possible future destination.Also Read: Top 5 British F1 drivers with the highest net worth—who tops the list? Domenicali’s contract extension as F1 CEO for another five years underscores the sport’s commitment to global expansion. With Thailand actively pursuing a place on the calendar and F1 open to new markets, the prospect of a Bangkok Grand Prix looks increasingly promising. If the logistical hurdles can be addressed and the government’s commitment remains strong, Thailand may soon join the elite list of F1 host nations — giving Southeast Asia a new motorsport crown jewel.","F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali holds key talks with Thai Prime Minister over Bangkok Grand Prix.

The US Federal Reserve kept the benchmark rate unchanged in the 4.25-4.5% range in its meeting today. ""In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.

The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased.

US border officials target senior green card holders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-border-officials-target-senior-green-card-holders/articleshow/119094296.cms,"Poll Should Senior Green Card Holders Face Stricter Scrutiny at US Borders?

Immigration attorneys warn against surrendering green cards

Immigration attorneys are seeing an uptick in the number of green card holders (including Indians) being subjected to secondary inspection, including overnight detention at the port of entry (airports) by US Custom and Border Protection (CBP) officers. Some are also ‘pressured’ to voluntarily give up their green card. Elderly Indians, who live with their children in the US but spend the winter months in India, are especially susceptible.An important piece of advice from attorneys: Do not surrender your green card. A green card holder has the right to be heard by an immigration judge.Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a lawful permanent resident (LPR) — aka green card holder — who is absent from the US for over 180 days is treated as seeking ‘re-admission’ and is subject to grounds of inadmissibility. While the issue of abandonment (relinquishment) of green card status typically arises when the individual has been outside the US for more than a year (365 days), a stay in India during the winter season is also coming up for increased scrutiny.Ashwin Sharma, an immigration attorney, based in Florida told TOI, “I have personally handled cases recently where the CBP has targeted elderly Indian green card holders , particularly grandparents who happen to have spent a bit longer outside the US, and pressured them to sign Form I-407 to ‘voluntarily’ surrender their lawful permanent resident status (green card). And the moment they have tried to push back, they have been met with threats of detention or ‘removal’ by the CBP officers who have been emboldened by Trump to see themselves as judge, jury, and executioner.”Kripa Upadhyay, a Seattle-based immigration attorney, stressed the importance of not surrendering the green card. “Generally, an individual’s green card cannot be revoked by the border unless the person ‘voluntarily’ surrenders (by signing Form 1-407). If a green card holder has spent more than 365 days out of the US they are deemed to have ‘abandoned’ their residence. Even if this is the allegation, the green card holder has the right to challenge this in court but they lose this right if they ‘voluntarily’ surrender at the airport!”“Only an immigration judge can take away a green card, so individuals should not sign this form. Unfortunately, people do not realise this because they are afraid, confused or do not understand what they are signing due to language barriers. This is a particular problem for our elderly green card holders who spend winter months in India and may not have sufficient evidence to prove maintenance of permanent resident status. Through documentation such as ownership of property, tax returns and employment one can overcome a presumption of abandonment,” said Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group.She referred to a case where an individual was placed in secondary inspection, because ever since becoming a lawful permanent resident (more than six years ago), he has spent a lot of time in India. Though he never spent more than six months (180 days) outside the US, it was clear from his travel history that he returned to the US only to maintain his green card status. “He was lucky this time and was admitted into the country but warned by CBP to give up his green card if he was not living in the US on a permanent basis,” said Batra.Rajiv S Khanna, an Arlington-based immigration attorney, sounded a word of caution, “One of the common scenarios that I have provided consultations on is when green card holders are not living in the US. They may visit every few months and consider that to be sufficient. That is legally incorrect. Maintaining a green card requires establishing and maintaining a permanent home in the US. Anything short of that can be grounds for ‘lifting the green card’ for abandonment.” To this, Jesse Bless, immigration attorney added, “Lawful permanent residents who are outside the US for more than a year (without a re-entry permit) are getting a notice to appear in removal proceedings.”Greg Siskind, co-founder of Siskind Susser, an immigration law firm, recalled, “During the previous Donald Trump administration, there were sky marshals who were passing forms out on planes asking people to surrender their green cards and people were calling and texting from the planes asking what to do. People need to not surrender their cards. But they must be prepared to sit for a while in secondary inspection. It is possible a CBP officer could even detain a person overnight. But a person is entitled to a hearing in front of a judge and most judges are not going to be happy about these cases going in front of them so I suspect CBP will cave in if a person is adamant about not surrendering.”","Immigration attorneys are seeing an uptick in the number of green card holders (including Indians) being subjected to secondary inspection.
