India’s 2nd spaceport in TN will see first SSLV launch in 2027: Isro chief; says Centre has given nod for Chandrayaan-5,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-2nd-spaceport-in-tn-will-see-first-sslv-launch-in-2027-isro-chief-says-centre-has-given-nod-for-chandrayaan-5/articleshow/119138195.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Isro’s second spaceport outside Andhra Pradesh’s Sriharikota, which is coming up at Kulasekarapattinam coastal town in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district, will see its maiden launch of a small satellite launch vehicle (SSLV) or mini-PSLV within 24 months, space agency chairman V Narayanan said on Monday. The new spaceport will enhance India’s capabilities in space launch services.“All facilities will be commissioned for launch in 24 months. The first launch will take place in two years. Don’t think it will be literally small in size. It will be a 500 kg satellite,” Narayanan said in Chennai after inaugurating a new research centre, ‘S Ramakrishnan Centre of Excellence for Research in Fluid and Thermal Science,' at IIT-Madras.In another big development, the Isro chairman on Sunday said the Centre has given approval for the ambitious Chandrayaan-5 mission as part of the country’s long-term goal of landing an Indian on the Moon by 2040. He highlighted the growing scope of India’s lunar exploration and the significance of Chandrayaan-5, which will feature a higher-capacity lander, essential for future missions, including potential human landings on the Moon.He said Chandrayaan-4 will focus on landing and collecting samples from the Moon, while Chandrayaan-5, which received approval just days ago, will deploy a 350 kg rover. This mission is part of a collaboration between India and Japan.During this year, Isro has planned a series of launches, including GSLV, a commercial satellite from the US, and unmanned test mission with humanoid as part of the Gaganyaan mission, Narayanan said.PM Modi had remotely laid the foundation stone for Kulasekharapattinam spaceport on Feb 28, 2024. The selection of this TN spaceport offers strategic advantages, particularly in enhancing payload capability with its direct southward launch trajectory for small launch vehicles. The new spaceport will house 35 facilities, including a launchpad, rocket integration facilities, ground range and checkout facilities, and a mobile launch structure (MLS) with checkout computers. It will have the capacity to launch 24 satellites every year using a mobile launch structure.Spread over 2,350 acres, the Kulasekharapatnam spaceport will help save fuel for small rocket launches as the port can launch rockets directly south over the Indian Ocean without requiring crossing landmasses.","Kulasekarapattinam coastal town in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district will see its maiden launch of a small satellite launch vehicle (SSLV) or mini-PSLV within 24 months. The first launch will take place in two years, Isro chairman V Narayanan said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119138261,imgsize-43190,width-400,resizemode-4/119138261.jpg"
'Independence of CAG inbuilt': Supreme Court on petition for new appointment method,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/independence-of-cag-inbuilt-supreme-court-on-petition-for-new-appointment-method/articleshow/119137051.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday sought govt's response to a PIL seeking an ""independent and transparent"" procedure for appointment of CAG on the lines of the one the court had devised for CVC, but not before asking, ""When Constitution provides for unbridled power to executive to appoint CAG, should we rewrite that provision?""""Constitution says once appointed as CAG, the person enjoys constitutional protection from arbitrary removal by executive as he/she can be removed only through a removal motion in Parliament,"" Justice Surya Kant said. ""The provisions have ensured CAG's independence,"" the bench also comprising Justice N Kotiswar Singh said.Prolific PIL litigant ' Centre for Public Interest Litigation ', through advocate Prashant Bhushan, told SC that though CAG was considered independent and impartial in the past, it had lost its stature because of the drop in number of audits it conducted of Centre and states governed by the party in office at Centre.Justice Kant, however, did not seem to fully agree with the contention about erosion of the federal auditor's autonomy. ""We seem to have a great misconception about independence,"" he said.Bhushan said even for selection and appointment of SC judges, CVC and CEC, there were mechanisms provided to ensure their independence, yet SC thought it fit to lay down guidelines providing for a high-level panel, including leader of opposition and CJI, for their selection to ensure that these sensitive posts are manned by persons of impeccable integrity and enjoy independence while discharging their duties.When Bhushan said architect of the Constitution, Dr B R Ambedkar, had envisaged greater independence for CAG than SC, the bench pointed out that the Constituent Assembly had debated the viewpoint but majority did not agree with it. ""The issues and questions you raise about selection and appointment of CAG were squarely answered during the Constituent Assembly debates,"" Justice Kant said.The bench said there was already a PIL by one Anupam Kulshreshtha pending in SC on the same issue raised by Bhushan, who said though notice was issued a year ago, it was not listed for hearing again. Though the Constitution leaves it to the executive to appoint judges of SC and HCs in consultation with the CJI, SC in two judgments in the 1990s wrested the judge selection process to itself.In the Vineet Narain judgment, SC had given statutory status to Central Vigilance Commission and set up a CVC selection committee comprising the PM, home minister and leader of opposition. CVC, home secretary and secretary (personnel) were mandated to select and recommend the person for CBI director post, which would have a minimum tenure of two years. A similar mechanism was laid down for appointment of ED director.In 2023, SC had detected a vacuum in the law for appointment of CEC and ruled that CEC and ECs would be selected by a panel comprising PM, CJI and LoP. However, it also said it was for Parliament to decide the constitution of the collegium.","Supreme Court seeks govt's response to a PIL seeking an ""independent and transparent"" procedure for appointment of CAG.

India to step on the gas for indigenous 5th gen fighter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-step-on-the-gas-for-indigenous-5th-gen-fighter/articleshow/119090404.cms,"NEW DELHI: India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, with a top-level committee now working to evolve a clear-cut strategy and production-cum-business model for the swing-role advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).The committee chaired by defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, which includes IAF vice chief Air Marshal S P Dharkar, secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar and top officials from DRDO and Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), is slated to submit its report next month.This comes at a time when Pakistan is looking to acquire at least 40 J-35A stealth fifth-generation jets from China, which is now brandishing even sixth-generation prototypes.China has already deployed its fifth-generation Chengdu J-20 jets at its airfields facing India like Hotan and Shigatse, as reported earlier by TOI.Faced with this, coupled with the huge delay in production of the fourth-generation Tejas jets by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a source told TOI that the committee's aim is to ""devise how best to get AMCA from the drawing board into the air by shrinking timelines and improving efficiency, including a good workable production-cum-business model with much greater private sector participation"".The committee will also consider the plan for indigenous development of a 110 kilonewton thrust-class engine to power the 25-tonne AMCA with foreign technology collaboration. Aero-engine majors like US General Electric, French Safran and British Rolls-Royce are in the fray for this. The new panel was formed after another defence secretary-led committee chalked out a detailed roadmap for IAF's ""all-round capability enhancement"" to plug existing operational gaps in a time-bound manner. The report was presented to defence minister Rajnath Singh on March 3, as was then reported by TOI.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the full-scale engineering development of five prototypes of the twin-engine AMCA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore. The AMCA, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and ""serpentine air-intake"", however, will be ready for production only by 2035 at the earliest as per existing timelines. ""It will be a challenge to compress timelines but a major effort has to be made due to IAF's expanding technological shortfalls,"" another source said, in the backdrop of IAF currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised. At least eight more squadrons are slated for retirement over the next 10 years. IAF currently plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, which will also have AI-powered electronic pilot systems, netcentric warfare systems, integrated vehicle health management and the like. While the first two squadrons will be powered by GE-F414 engines in the 98 kilonewton thrust class, the next five will have 110 kilonewton engines.In the interim, the dwindling numbers are to be progressively made up by induction of 180 Tejas Mark-1A fighters (for around Rs 1.2 lakh crore) and 108 more capable Tejas Mark-2 jets .Parallelly, the long-pending project to manufacture 114 4.5-generation multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) with foreign collaboration as reported by TOI earlier.",India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet.

2025 assembly elections: Is Nitish Kumar preparing for 'son'rise in Bihar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2025-assembly-elections-is-nitish-kumar-preparing-for-sonrise-in-bihar/articleshow/119122438.cms,"In January this year, Nitish made a public appearance with his son at a political function. At this function, Nishant made his first political remark as he sought votes for his father in the upcoming assembly elections. Nishant also highlighted why JD(U)needed more seats to ensure that Nitish Kumar's leadership continues for the progress and development of the state.

Holi festivities at Nitish Kumar's residence this year saw Nishant participating actively and engaging with senior JD(U) leaders.

Then appeared a large hoarding outside the Janata Dal (United) office in Patna featuring son Nishant alongside his father. The poster, which prominently displayed Nishant Kumar next to Nitish Kumar, read, "" Bihar ki maang, sun liye Nishant, bahut bahut dhanyawaad "" (Nishant, thank you very much for listening to the demands of Bihar).

JD(U) at crossroads? Why Nitish needs Nishant

NEW DELHI: Is Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar , who has been a very strong critic of political dynasts, preparing ground for his son Nishant Kumar 's plunge into politics? For years, dynasty politics has been one of the strongest weapons used by Nitish to attack his rival Lalu Prasad, who promoted his wife, sons and daughters in politics.But now, there are very strong indications that Nitish may lose that poll plank in the year-end assembly elections. Nishant, who has stayed away from the political glare for nearly two decades, may finally enter mainstream politics to lend a helping hand to his father, who has been under opposition fire over health issues.Here's a look at some of the recent developments that have led to these speculations ...Clearly, more than the demand of Bihar, it is the demand of a section of JD(U) leaders who are perhaps worried over the consistent opposition attacks questioning the health of Nitish Kumar. They believe Nishant's involvement could strengthen the party and carry forward Nitish Kumar's political legacy.Neither Nishant nor the JD(U) has made any official statement on this. However, in January, when Nishant was asked about his possible political plunge, this is what he said: ""The public will decide what happens next. Let them judge who is capable.""A clever statement that was not just politically correct but also open ended to ensure the chatter around his poltiical plunge continues.Nitish Kumar's present ally - the BJP, which has used dynasty politics as one of its most potent weapons to attack the opposition, was guarded in its response to the possibility of a new 'son'rise in the state. Bihar deputy chief minister and BJP leader Samrat Choudhary has already said that his party will back whatever decision JD(U) takes on Nitish Kumar's son. The other allies of JD(U) have also been guarded in their response while welcoming Nishant if he decided to join politics.Interestingly, it was opposition RJD's Tejashwi who perhaps made the strongest call to Nishant to join politics.""He is our brother. I want him to join politics as soon as possible; otherwise, the BJP will finish the JD(U)--the party formed by Sharad Yadav. He should join politics soon. If he joins politics, then there would be the possibility that JD(U) will survive. It will depend on how Nishant works for the party. We joined politics not because our parents asked us to do it but because the people of Bihar and our party workers needed that,"" Tejashwi had said reacting to rumours of Nishant joining politics.It is natural for Tejashwi, who has been at the receiving end of relentless dynast attacks - both from Nitish and the BJP, to welcome the development.With Tejashwi and Chirag, son of late Ram Vilas Paswan, already in active politics, if and when Nishant decides to take the plunge, it would complete the troika of three second generation leaders in Bihar politics - following into the footsteps of their fathers.The JD(U), which has been dominant in state politics for nearly 20 decades, faced perhaps its biggest challenge in the last assembly elections when the party was reduced to being the junior partner in the NDA for the first time.Nitish could manage to win just 45 seats compared to BJP's 74. However, the BJP kept its pre-poll promise of forming a government under Nitish Kumar's leadership and the JD(U) chief was back as chief minister despite reduced numerical strength.Nitish Kumar did salvage some pride when JD(U) won 14 seats, same as the BJP, in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The number enough to make a hero out of Nitish Kumar for providing valuable support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi led NDA-3 government.However, as the assembly elections approach once again, Nitish would be worried about his party's political fortunes. With Nishant to assist him in managing the party, Nitish would be more focussed on trying to restore the lost political glory of JD(U).For over two decades, JD(U) has literally been a one-man show, both at the state and at the national level. Till now, keeping the family away from the party was the USP of Nitish, but with the party's declining fortunes and his advancing age, the Bihar chief minister perhaps may not have that option anymore.While Nitish is yet to open up on the issue, he has not stopped his ministers and party leaders from raising the pitch for Nishant. Perhaps, the Bihar chief minister is testing the waters for now.","Nishant Kumar has stayed away from the political glare for nearly two decades. He may finally enter mainstream politics to lend a helping hand to his father, who has been under opposition fire over health issues. Nishant's involvement could strengthen the party and carry forward Nitish Kumar's political legacy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119123325,imgsize-107442,width-400,resizemode-4/119123325.jpg"
In 7 charts: Indian-Americans concerned about India-US ties under Trump 2.0; bullish on India's trajectory under PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-7-charts-indian-americans-concerned-about-india-us-ties-under-trump-2-0-bullish-on-indias-trajectory-under-pm-modi/articleshow/118973218.cms,"On India's trajectory

BJP, PM Modi's popularity



Although Indian-Americans shifted to the right politically ahead of the 2024 US election, many remain concerned about what the future holds for US-India ties under a second Trump administration, as per the 2024 Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS).Donald Trump's economic policies, particularly his protectionist stance and focus on ""reciprocal taxes"", have put India-US trade relations under strain. Since returning to the White House, Trump has repeatedly criticised India's high import duties, which he has said are ""unfair"" to American exporters.His proposed tariffs on Indian exports could severely impact sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles, which rely heavily on the US market.Additionally, his administration's stricter immigration policies, such as tightening H-1B visa requirements, could further affect India's tech workforce in the US, thus further straining ties.As per the IAAS report — conducted before the US presidential election results — many Indian-Americans are concerned about bilateral relations under the Trump administration. In fact, Indian-Americans rate the Joe Biden administration 's record on India slightly better than the first Trump administration.Thirty-four percent of respondents identified Biden as doing a better job, and 28 percent said Trump handled bilateral relations better during his first term. Roughly the same proportion, 26 percent, felt the presidents' performances were generally the same.In addition, respondents said bilateral relationship would have been more likely to prosper under a putative Kamala Harris administration compared to a second Trump administration.The survey also asked respondents which American political party does a better job managing US-India relations .A total of 41 percent of respondents said the Democratic Party while 24 percent named the Republican Party. One-quarter of all respondents perceived no difference between the two parties.As the 2024 IAAS was fielded before the US election, it also asked two questions about the prospects for US-India ties under a putative Kamala Harris or second Trump administration. A total of 53 percent of respondents said US-India ties would become stronger if Harris had been elected, 15 per cent state they would get worse, and 32 percent reported they would not change.Respondents were somewhat less bullish on prospects under a second Trump presidency. Forty percent reported ties would improve, 26 percent felt they would worsen, and 34 percent opined they would be unchanged.Compared to 2020, Indian-Americans are more bullish on India’s trajectory, said the IAAS report. Forty-seven percent of Indian-Americans believed that India is headed in the right direction, a 10 percentage point increase from four years ago.The same share approved of Modi's prime ministerial performance. Four in ten respondents said that India’s 2024 election made the country more democratic.Forty-seven percent of respondents felt India is politically on the right track, 32 percent felt it is on the wrong track, and 21 percent cannot say.These numbers represent a significant shift from the 2020 IAAS. Four years ago, respondents’ assessments were markedly more pessimistic, with 36 percent believing India was on the right track and 39 percent reporting it was on the wrong track.The survey also asked about Indian-Americans’ views of India’s current policy direction.Forty-six percent of respondents report that they are either strongly or somewhat supportive of the present government’s policies.Thirty-six percent report they are somewhat or strongly critical of the government’s policies. Eighteen percent express no opinion. These numbers are broadly in line with respondents’ “right track/wrong track” assessments.As per the report, one possible explanation for the relatively more bullish assessment of India in 2024 is that respondents were heartened by the results of the 2024 election, which resulted in a more evenly divided Parliament and greater dispersion of political power. Indeed, some observers interpreted the result of India’s 2024 general election as giving a fillip to democracy since the outcome produced a coalition government and more robust opposition in Parliament.Four in ten members of the Indian American diaspora agree with this sentiment. Forty-one percent of respondents said the 2024 election made India much or somewhat more democratic. On the other hand, 28 percent took the opposite view — that India is much or somewhat less democratic in the aftermath of the general election. Fourteen percent of all respondents did not view the 2024 election as changing India’s democratic character in either direction.The BJP remains the most popular party among Indian-Americans, with 28 percent of respondents identifying with the party.Twenty percent identified with the Congress party, and just 1 percent identified with a third party. In the 2020 IAAS, 32 percent of respondents supported the BJP, 12 percent supported the Congress, and 11 percent identified with a third party.The data suggest that the BJP remains the diaspora’s favored party, but the gap with the Congress, has narrowed compared to 2020.The survey further found that 47 percent of respondents approve of PM Modi’s job in office (36 percent strongly approve and 11 percent approve), while 34 percent disapprove (23 percent strongly disapprove and 11 percent disapprove). An additional 19 percent express no opinion either way.PM Modi’s approval ratings among the diaspora have not budged much in four years. In 2020, 50 percent approved of the job PM Modi was doing (35 percent strongly approved and 15 percent approved) and 31 percent disapproved (22 percent strongly disapproved and 9 percent disapproved).",The 2024 Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS) was conducted before the US presidential election results.

'Pragmatic approach'

NEW DELHI: China on Monday welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on India-China relations , praising his emphasis on dialogue over discord .Beijing described the relationship between the two nations as a ""ballet between the dragon and the elephant"" that must continue for mutual success.China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning acknowledged PM Modi ’s ""positive"" comments and highlighted the progress in bilateral ties since his meeting with President Xi Jinping in Kazan, Russia. ""China noted Prime Minister Modi's recent positive statement on China-India relations and appreciates it,"" Mao said at a media briefing. She reiterated that their meeting had provided strategic direction for both countries.Furthermore, she underlined the historical interactions between the two nations, stating, ""In the 2000-plus years of history, the two countries have maintained friendly exchanges and learned from each other, contributing to civilisational achievements and human progress."" Stressing the importance of mutual growth, she added, ""The two countries should be partners that contribute to each other's success, and a 'cooperative pas de deux,' a ballet between the dragon and elephant, is the only choice for both sides.""During his nearly 3-hour conversation with podcaster Lex Fridman, PM Modi expressed optimism about ties between the two countries, highlighting their shared history and the importance of ensuring that ""differences do not turn into disputes."" He noted that India and China once contributed over 50% of the global GDP and stressed that cooperation between the two nations is beneficial and essential for global peace and prosperity.The Global Times , a Chinese state-run daily, also praised PM Modi’s remarks, acknowledging his push for dialogue despite past tensions. The publication featured an article quoting experts who viewed PM Modi’s statements as a ""pragmatic approach"" towards balancing cooperation and competition with China. Qian Feng, director at Tsinghua University’s National Strategy Institute, noted that since the Kazan summit , both countries have taken ""positive strides"" in implementing key agreements, improving diplomatic and military communications, and maintaining border stability .Addressing past conflicts, including the 2020 standoff in eastern Ladakh, PM Modi acknowledged in the podcast that tensions had existed but said his talks with President Xi had led to progress. ""After my meeting with President Xi, we have seen a return to normalcy at the border. We are working to restore conditions to how they were before 2020,"" he said.Earlier this month, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi also said that India and China should not allow their differences to dictate bilateral relations. ""As two ancient civilisations, we have enough wisdom and capability to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas, pending a fair and reasonable solution to the boundary issue,"" Wang said.He added that both nations should prioritise broader cooperation and avoid letting disputes define their relationship. ""We should never allow bilateral relations to be defined by the boundary question or specific differences to affect the overall picture of our bilateral ties. China believes that as the largest neighbours, both countries should be partners in each other's success.""With the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between India and China approaching, Beijing expressed its willingness to work with New Delhi to implement key agreements and ensure stable and healthy ties. Mao reaffirmed this stance, saying, ""China stands ready to work with India to advance bilateral ties on the track of stable and sound development.""","Beijing described the relationship between the two nations as a ""ballet between the dragon and the elephant"" that must continue for mutual success.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said it is ""unfortunate"" that the government has to protect Aurangzeb's grave, which is located in the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district.Fadnavis's remark came amid growing demand from a certain section to remove the Mughal emperor's grave.""It is unfortunate that the government has to take responsibility for the protection of Aurangzeb's grave, despite his history of persecution. However, I assure you, if any attempt is made to glorify his legacy through '', it will not succeed,"" Fadnavis said at an event that he attended to inaugurate a temple dedicated to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Thane district and lauded the Maratha king for fighting for '' and the country.""We are able to worship our gods freely today because of Shivaji Maharaj's efforts. He fought for Swarajya, for God, for our country, and our religion,"" Fadnavis was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Earlier, BJP's Satara MP Udayanraje Bhosale, who is also the descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, advocated for the removal of the Mughal king's tomb situated in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.Responding to Bhosale's request, Fadnavis clarified that despite sharing similar sentiments, actions must conform to legal procedures due to the site's protected status, which was established during the previous Congress administration.Fadnavis said, ""We all also want the same thing, but you need to do it within the framework of the law, because it is a protected site. The site was put under ASI's (Archaeological Survey of India) protection during the Congress regime some years back.""The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) protects historical tombs under the AMASR Act, 1958, ensuring their preservation. If a tomb is declared a protected monument, no construction is allowed within 100 meters, and activities in the 200-meter regulated area need approval. The ASI oversees conservation and prevents alterations or damage.Section 19(1) of the Act clearly states that no person, including government authorities, can destroy, remove, alter, or deface a protected monument without official permission.Further strengthening these protections, the AMASR (Amendment) Act, 2010, imposes strict penalties and imprisonment for unauthorised construction, alteration, or destruction of a protected monument. This means that even a state government cannot make changes to an ASI-protected tomb.Violating these rules leads to legal action, fines, or imprisonment. Unauthorized encroachments are removed, and restoration must maintain the tomb’s original character.Aurangzeb was the sixth ruler of the Mughal Empire, reigning from 1658 to 1707. He was the son of Emperor Shah Jahan and is known for expanding the Mughal Empire to its greatest territorial extent, covering almost the entire Indian subcontinent.Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb followed a more orthodox Islamic rule, enforcing religious policies that included the reintroduction of the jizya tax on non-Muslims and restrictions on certain cultural practices.Aurangzeb and Sambhaji Maharaj were fierce adversaries in the late 17th century. Sambhaji, the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji, was the second ruler of the Maratha Empire, while Aurangzeb was the Mughal emperor who sought to crush the Marathas and expand Mughal rule in the Deccan. Their rivalry intensified after Sambhaji ascended the throne in 1681 and continued his father’s resistance against Mughal domination.In 1689, Aurangzeb's forces captured Sambhaji near Sangameshwar through treachery. He was brutally tortured for refusing to convert to Islam and executed in an inhumane manner.His martyrdom made him a symbol of Maratha defiance, strengthening the Maratha resistance against Mughal rule. Sambhaji’s death fueled the eventual decline of Mughal power in the Deccan.","Devendra Fadnavis said it is ""unfortunate"" that the government has to protect Aurangzeb's grave.

Ranya Rao Bail Plea: Gold smuggling case: Actress Ranya Rao’s bail plea adjourned till March 19,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gold-smuggling-case-actress-ranya-raos-bail-plea-adjourned-till-march-19/articleshow/119117434.cms,"Gold smuggling case: Actress Ranya Rao’s bail plea adjourned till March 19 (Picture credit: ANI, IANS)

Background of the case

NEW DELHI: The bail plea of Kannada actress Ranya Rao, who is currently in judicial custody over her alleged involvement in a high-profile gold smuggling case , has been adjourned to March 19.The Sessions Court, which was set to hear her petition on March 17, has directed the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to file its objections by the next hearing. Further proceedings will continue once the objections are submitted.Ranya Rao had earlier filed a bail application before the Special Court for Economic Offences, which was rejected due to the serious nature of the allegations against her.Following this, her legal team moved to the Sessions Court in an attempt to secure her release.The case has attracted widespread attention due to its scale and the alleged involvement of influential individuals.Ranya Rao was arrested on March 3, 2025, at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport after DRI officials intercepted her carrying gold bars worth Rs 12.56 crore . Investigations revealed that she had travelled to Dubai 27 times since January 2025. A subsequent search at her residence led to the discovery of additional gold jewellery valued at Rs 2.06 crore and Rs 2.67 crore in cash.The case took a dramatic turn when it emerged that Ranya allegedly used a State Police Protocol Officer to bypass security checks at the airport.

Meanwhile, BJP MLA Basangouda Patil Yatnal has alleged the involvement of state ministers in the smuggling network, promising to expose them in the Karnataka Assembly.Adding to the complexity, the Karnataka High Court has extended its interim order preventing the DRI from taking immediate action against Ranya's husband, Jatin Vijaykumar Hukkeri, who has also been detained in connection with the case.The court has granted the DRI additional time to file its objections.","Ranya Rao was arrested on March 3, 2025, at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport.

He suggested that whilst future negotiations might be prolonged, both countries are prepared for the next phase.This follows PM Modi's statement about fostering 'healthy and natural' competition between India and China whilst preventing disagreements from escalating.Speaking on India-China relations during the podcast with Lex Fridman, PM Modi highlighted the deep historical ties between the two nations and underscored the need for dialogue over discord.""Our focus is to ensure that differences don’t turn into disputes.

Newly appointed US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Monday revealed the profound impact of the Bhagavad Gita on her life and career. Gabbard, who has been a long-time admirer of the ancient Hindu text, emphasised how Lord Krishna's teachings to Arjuna have been a source of strength and guidance for her, whether in the midst of war zones or facing the complex challenges of her current role.In an interview with ANI, Gabbard said: ""Whether serving in war zones in different parts of the world or the challenges that we face now, it is (Lord) Krishna's teachings to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita that I turn to in the best of times and the worst of times.""Gabbard, the first Hindu elected to the US Congress, has often talked about her deep connection with the Bhagavad Gita.In 2020, she urged Hindu students to explore the concepts of Bhakti Yoga and Karma Yoga as outlined in the Gita, emphasiding the importance of service to society as a path to true success. Her daily practice includes meditation, yoga, and reading the Gita.Tulsi Gabbard, currently visiting India as part of a multi-nation trip, also emphasised the importance of direct dialogue between India and the United States on tariff issues.Speaking to ANI on the sidelines of the think-tank Observer Research Foundation's annual Raisina Dialogues in Delhi, she highlighted opportunities to strengthen economic ties between the two nations.Gabbard noted that conversations with Indian officials revealed optimism about enhancing economic relations.""There is significant potential for strengthening our economic partnership. It’s encouraging to see a more positive outlook on this issue rather than focusing solely on tariffs,"" she said, acknowledging that both PM Narendra Modi and President Trump are prioritising their respective nations' economic interests but are also working towards mutually beneficial solutions.""What I have heard from the Indian government officials that I've spoken to over the last few days, there is an opportunity here to see. There is more potential for strengthening of our economic relationship and I'm glad to see that they're looking at it in a more positive light than just one that is focused in a negative way, when we look at tariffs. Obviously Prime Minister Modi is looking out for what is in the best interest of India's economy and the opportunities available for the people of India. Similarly, President Trump is doing the same for the United States, our economic interests and the interests of the American people "" she added.Gabbar also praised the leadership of PM Modi and Trump, describing them as pragmatic leaders seeking effective solutions. Gabbard pointed out that high-level dialogues, along with discussions among cabinet members and secretaries, are crucial for charting a forward path. She also expressed excitement about the private sector's keen interest in fostering bilateral economic engagement.""What I see as a great positive is that we have two leaders who have common sense and who are looking for good solutions. This direct dialogue is happening at the very top in both of our countries, but also at the different secretaries and the cabinet members is going to be key to lay down what that path forward really looks like. And I personally am excited because there's keen interest in the private sector here in India and in the United States,"" she said.Additionally, Gabbard highlighted the strong personal rapport between PM Modi and Trump as a solid foundation for deepening the US-India partnership. She referred to PM Modi's earlier visit to the White House as instrumental in setting a collaborative tone for future engagements.Reflecting on her meetings with Indian officials, Gabbard underscored the broad scope of cooperation, spanning intelligence, commerce, trade, defense, and education. She concluded by expressing optimism about the immense opportunities available for advancing the US-India relationship across multiple domains.""The tone and the relationship with our new administration under President Trump and Prime Minister Modi was set during Prime Minister Modi's visit to the White House. As you know, they are already good friends. It was a very great opportunity for them to share their joint vision for the US-India partnership and the opportunity for us to continue to strengthen that partnership,"" she said.""The meetings that I've had here with different Indian government officials and intelligence officials really is set on that foundation of how we can continue to integrate, how we can continue to strengthen our relationship, not only of course in my area of intelligence, but we're looking at commerce and trade and defense and education. There's nothing but opportunity that I see here in the US-India partnership,"" she added.","Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu elected to the US Congress, has often talked about her deep connection with the Bhagavad Gita.

Be it H-1B visa holders and their kin, or international students, or even green card holders, US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas. India is not on the proposed travel ban list by the US, but still the fear remains.On Monday, TOI reported on similar advice being given to Green Card holders. The reasons range from delays in stamping at US consulates in home country, extreme vetting and cases of secondary inspection, including detention at US airports on return.Kripa Upadhyay, an immigration attorney in Seattle, said, ""This sounds heartless but foreigners (especially those needing to renew H-1B or F-1 visas) must think twice about leaving US right now.""The US department of state has updated eligibility requirements for interview waiver appointments (referred to as dropbox appointments). Earlier, applicants could qualify for interview waiver if they had been issued a non-immigrant visa in any category (except B visitor visas) and were applying within 48 months of expiration. Under revised rules, dropbox is available only to applicants renewing a visa in the same non-immigrant category that has expired within past 12 months. Thus, if you are an international student with an F-1 visa and now need an H-1B you must wait for an interview slot. If you have an H-1B and need an extension, but your earlier visa was issued more than 12 months ago, you must also wait for an interview slot, Upadhyay said.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, said, ""Delays due to visa appointment availability is only part of the concern. We know of individuals stuck in administrative processing for no apparent reason other than additional scrutiny and security clearances. This should not have happened if the individual had been previously approved for a visa multiple times. I think we can expect to see 'extreme vetting' similar to the tenure of the earlier Trump administration.""Also read: Fearing deportation, a Cornell university grad student files a pre-emptive lawsuit If US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has approved an H-1B, the consular officer has the right to refuse the visa and send the application back to USCIS for re-adjudication.

Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, said, ""If travel is unavoidable, visa applicants and their employers should also try to have contingency plans in case of delayed stamping such as continuing work from their home country.""","US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas.

""During TMC chief Banerjee's tenure, there were 395 accidents and derailments, and when Congress' Mallikarjun Kharge was railway minister, the number of accidents and derailments were 38,"" he said.""Where there was once an average of one accident per day, today the number has been reduced to just 30 accidents per year.

""We seem to have a great misconception about independence,"" he said.Bhushan said even for selection and appointment of SC judges, CVC and CEC, there were mechanisms provided to ensure their independence, yet SC thought it fit to lay down guidelines providing for a high-level panel, including leader of opposition and CJI, for their selection to ensure that these sensitive posts are manned by persons of impeccable integrity and enjoy independence while discharging their duties.When Bhushan said architect of the Constitution, Dr B R Ambedkar, had envisaged greater independence for CAG than SC, the bench pointed out that the Constituent Assembly had debated the viewpoint but majority did not agree with it. ""The issues and questions you raise about selection and appointment of CAG were squarely answered during the Constituent Assembly debates ,"" Justice Kant said.The bench said there was already a PIL by one Anupam Kulshreshtha pending in SC on the same issue raised by Bhushan, who said though notice was issued a year ago, it was not listed for hearing again. Though the Constitution leaves it to the executive to appoint judges of SC and HCs in consultation with the CJI, SC in two judgments in the 1990s wrested the judge selection process to itself.In the Vineet Narain judgment, SC had given statutory status to Central Vigilance Commission and set up a CVC selection committee comprising the PM, home minister and leader of opposition. CVC, home secretary and secretary (personnel) were mandated to select and recommend the person for CBI director post, which would have a minimum tenure of two years. A similar mechanism was laid down for appointment of ED director.In 2023, SC had detected a vacuum in the law for appointment of CEC and ruled that CEC and ECs would be selected by a panel comprising PM, CJI and LoP.

""In the annual plan, allocation for SC component has risen 42% and tribal component by 40%. Even after excluding Ladki Bahin outlay, the rise is 18% and 19%,"" Ajit told the assembly.He further said Ladki Bahin scheme could be linked to loan programmes given the enormous quantum of Rs 45,000 crore that it placed in the hands of women.""The Mumbai bank, led by BJP MLC Pravin Darekar, has already announced that those who open their Ladki Bahin accounts there will be eligible for a loan of Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000,"" the deputy CM said.He defended government's Rs 9.3 lakh crore debt and revenue deficit of Rs 45,892 crore, by saying this was within the fiscal limit. ""Only Maharashtra, Odisha, and Gujarat have managed to keep these parameters within the fiscal limit,"" he said. He said the fiscal deficit was less than 3% of GSDP and the loan was less than 25% of GSDP. RBI's risk analysis concluded that Maharashtra had healthy fiscal indicators, he added.He further said government focused on infrastructure schemes, like Wadhawan port project where it was considering building an airport. ""Some countries have built an airport in the sea.

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Monday accused the opposition parties of “misleading” the Muslim community on the Waqf bill , which is meant to make a significant overhaul in the current Waqf laws.The ruling party's remark came amid protests carried out by several Muslim organisations , led by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPL), to oppose the Waqf (Amendment) Bill.In the protest, which was also joined by the opposition MPs, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi warned NDA allies such as the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), Janata Dal (United) (JDU), and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) that Muslims will never forgive them if they supported the legislation.Congress MP Mohammad Jawed when asked to comment on the AIMPLB protest, said, ""We see how lands are being given away to selected industrialists...

What's the issue?



NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu said on Monday that people who study in their mother tongue are excelling worldwide. He mentioned that there is a common belief that knowledge comes only through English, but he disagrees.Addressing the Assembly in Amravati, Naidu said, ""Language is only for communication. Knowledge will not come with language. Only people who study in their mother tongue are excelling across the world. It is easy to learn (through the mother tongue).""He also said, ""I am telling this very clearly to you... language is not for hating. Here (in Andhra Pradesh) the mother tongue is Telugu. Hindi is the national language and international language is English.""Naidu said people should learn multiple languages for work while keeping their mother tongue. He added that learning Hindi would help in communication in Delhi.Referring to people traveling to countries like Japan and Germany, he said learning those languages in India would make it easier for them when they go abroad.Earlier this month also, Naidu advocated for multilingual education, including Hindi. ""...Language is only a means of communication...All of you are aware that Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and other languages are shining globally...Knowledge is different, language is different. I'm going to promote 10 languages, including international languages, in every university. Students can study, go and work there. They need your services. Not only three languages, I will promote multi-languages. We had to promote Telugu. We should also promote English as it is an international language for livelihood. It is better to learn Hindi, so that we can mingle with people easily,"" Naidu had said.Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister had also said on Saturday, March 15, that claims of Hindi being imposed are misleading.""Either imposing a language forcibly or opposing a language blindly; both doesn’t help to achieve the objective of National & Cultural integration of our Bharat. I had never opposed Hindi as a language. I only opposed making it compulsory. When the NEP 2020 itself does not enforce Hindi, spreading false narratives about its imposition is nothing but an attempt to mislead the public,"" Kalyan said.Kalyan’s statement came in response to Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin, who has accused the Union government of imposing Hindi and has refused to implement the three-language formula under NEP.The debate over the National Education Policy (NEP) revolves around its three-language formula, which Tamil Nadu fears may result in the imposition of Hindi in the state. Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has expressed concerns that the policy gives more importance to Hindi over regional languages, affecting the state's linguistic identity and autonomy.The central government, however, argues that the NEP promotes multilingualism and provides flexibility in language education. Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has denied that Hindi is being imposed, saying that states have the freedom to choose their languages under the policy.The dispute escalated after the Centre withheld Rs 2,152 crore meant for Tamil Nadu’s Samagra Shiksha scheme, citing the state's refusal to implement the NEP. Tamil Nadu has traditionally opposed the three-language formula, seeing it as a move toward enforcing Hindi, while the central government maintains that the policy helps students find job opportunities across different regions.","Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu said people who study in their mother tongue are excelling worldwide.

US border officials target senior green card holders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-border-officials-target-senior-green-card-holders/articleshow/119094296.cms,"Poll Should Senior Green Card Holders Face Stricter Scrutiny at US Borders? No – It’s unfair to long-term residents Yes – National security comes first

Immigration attorneys warn against surrendering green cards



Immigration attorneys are seeing an uptick in the number of green card holders (including Indians) being subjected to secondary inspection, including overnight detention at the port of entry (airports) by US Custom and Border Protection (CBP) officers. Some are also ‘pressured’ to voluntarily give up their green card. Elderly Indians who live with their children in the US but spend the winter months in India are especially susceptible.An important piece of advice from attorneys: Do not surrender your green card. A green card holder has the right to be heard by an immigration judge.Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a lawful permanent resident (LPR) — aka green card holder — who is absent from the US for over 180 days is treated as seeking ‘re-admission’ and is subject to grounds of inadmissibility. While the issue of abandonment (relinquishment) of green card status typically arises when the individual has been outside the US for more than a year (365 days), a stay in India during the winter season is also coming up for increased scrutiny.Ashwin Sharma, an immigration attorney, based in Florida told TOI, “I have personally handled cases recently where the CBP has targeted elderly Indian green card holders , particularly grandparents who happen to have spent a bit longer outside the US, and pressured them to sign Form I-407 to ‘voluntarily’ surrender their lawful permanent resident status (green card). And the moment they have tried to push back, they have been met with threats of detention or ‘removal’ by the CBP officers who have been emboldened by Trump to see themselves as judge, jury, and executioner.”Kripa Upadhyay, a Seattle-based immigration attorney, stressed the importance of not surrendering the green card. “Generally, an individual’s green card cannot be revoked by the border unless the person ‘voluntarily’ surrenders (by signing Form 1-407). If a green card holder has spent more than 365 days out of the US they are deemed to have ‘abandoned’ their residence. Even if this is the allegation, the green card holder has the right to challenge this in court but they lose this right if they ‘voluntarily’ surrender at the airport!”“Only an immigration judge can take away a green card, so individuals should not sign this form. Unfortunately, people do not realise this because they are afraid, confused or do not understand what they are signing due to language barriers. This is a particular problem for our elderly green card holders who spend winter months in India and may not have sufficient evidence to prove maintenance of permanent resident status. Through documentation such as ownership of property, tax returns and employment one can overcome a presumption of abandonment,” said Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group.She referred to a case where an individual was placed in secondary inspection, because ever since becoming a lawful permanent resident (more than six years ago), he has spent a lot of time in India. Though he never spent more than six months (180 days) outside the US, it was clear from his travel history that he returned to the US only to maintain his green card status. “He was lucky this time and was admitted into the country but warned by CBP to give up his green card if he was not living in the US on a permanent basis,” said Batra.Rajiv S Khanna, an Arlington-based immigration attorney, sounded a word of caution, “One of the common scenarios that I have provided consultations on is when green card holders are not living in the US. They may visit every few months and consider that to be sufficient. That is legally incorrect. Maintaining a green card requires establishing and maintaining a permanent home in the US. Anything short of that can be grounds for ‘lifting the green card’ for abandonment.” To this, Jesse Bless, immigration attorney added, “Lawful permanent residents who are outside the US for more than a year (without a re-entry permit) are getting a notice to appear in removal proceedings.”Greg Siskin, co-founder of Siskin Susser, an immigration law firm, recalled, “During the previous Trump administration, there were sky marshals who were passing forms out on planes asking people to surrender their green cards and people were calling and texting from the planes asking what to do. People need to not surrender their cards. But they must be prepared to sit for a while in secondary inspection. It is possible a CBP officer could even detain a person overnight. But a person is entitled to a hearing in front of a judge and most judges are not going to be happy about these cases going in front of them so I suspect CBP will cave in if a person is adamant about not surrendering.”",Immigration attorneys are seeing an uptick in the number of green card holders (including Indians) being subjected to secondary inspection.

NHL Rumors: Brock Boeser Expected to Land Major Pay Raise in Free Agency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-rumors-brock-boeser-expected-to-land-major-pay-raise-in-free-agency/articleshow/119126884.cms,"Image Via Getty

Brock Boeser All Set For A Big Market, With Offensive Steadiness

Canucks Not Loving Boeser Trade Offers

LIVE | Patrik Allvin Trade Deadline Media Availability

Even as the Vancouver Canucks fight for a playoff spot, Boeser's future hangs in the balance. The talented winger will be heading to free agency this summer following the expiration of his three-year contract worth $19.95 million. While his concentration is currently on a strong finish to the season, contract negotiations with the Canucks seem yet to be underway. The general consensus is that as ceilings go up in NHL salary structures, Boeser could receive a sizable pay rise on the open market. So, the next move could be critical for both parties.Even if Brock Boeser's offensive production has been down this season, he is lining himself up for a big contract in free agency. To quote Johnston, “With the salary cap due to take a significant jump this summer, Boeser would jump from a $6.65 million average annual value to a $7.65 million AAV just by securing the same percentage of cap (8.06 percent) as he got on his last RFA deal with Vancouver in 2022."" Basically, two forces are acting on this, one being the rising salary cap and the other the low supply of impact goal-scorers on the market.Boeser scored a career-high 40 goals and 73 points in the 2023-24 campaign but has been struggling this year, tallying just 38 points (18 goals and 20 assists) in 60 games. His numbers at present don't look terrific, but still, his goal-scoring ability alone will keep him in the mix for teams looking to add offensive flair.The Canucks looked into a trade for Boeser leading up to the NHL trade deadline, but GM Patrik Allvin was said to not be impressed by the offers on the table. In his comments, Allvin hinted there was a shocking lack of market for Boeser, adding that if criticized, “If I told you what I was offered for Brock Boeser I think I would have to run out of here because you would not believe me.""Since the deadline, Boeser's play has only deteriorated, with calendars recording just one assist and tallying a -6 rating in six games.

Data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) shows that the maximum temperature stayed above 30°C consecutively from March 8 to 16.Met officials attributed the temperature drop on Monday to the end of the western disturbance, which had led to a rise in wind speed.

Gold prices at record high! Have yellow metal prices peaked? Check these 5 charts before putting more money in gold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-prices-at-record-high-have-yellow-metal-prices-peaked-check-these-5-charts-before-putting-more-money-in-gold/articleshow/119121902.cms,"Gold's performance as both a safe haven and wealth generator has garnered attention, with its 17% three-year returns outpacing Sensex's 11.6%

Why is gold going up?

The precious metal's price increase stems from various factors, including trade disputes, dollar weakness and inflation worries, enhancing its safe-haven status, according to Chirag Mehta, CIO of Quantum AMC.

Potential gold import tariffs have prompted movement of the metal towards US markets.

Global central banks have accumulated more gold in the past three years than during the previous six.

Gold ETFs have experienced significant growth, with February recording $9.4 billion (100 tonnes) in inflows, the highest since March 2022.

According to DSP Mutual Fund, gold's sustained appreciation relates to governmental policy decisions. They observe that central banks' monetary approaches, particularly following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), introduced excessive market liquidity, weakening fiat currencies and raising inflation concerns, which supported gold's value increase.

Gold has since ages been seen as a safe haven investment bet, especially in riskier times when other asset classes face uncertainty. But is gold just a safe haven investment or is it also a wealth creator? How do gold returns compare to equities over years and what is the outlook for the precious metal? With the ongoing global turmoil, gold may be seen as the go-to investment bet, especially for relatively conservative investors, but have gold prices peaked?Gold's performance as both a safe haven and wealth generator has garnered attention, with its 17% three-year returns outpacing Sensex's 11.6%. As prices approach Rs 90,000 per 10 gram, what should investors do - should they allocate more of their portfolio to gold or is it time to book profit? We take a look at an analysis from ET Wealth to answer this key question:Also Read | Trump tariffs impact: Is a US recession likely and does India need to worry about it? Experts, including Mehta, suggest that gold's upward momentum could potentially slow as diplomatic negotiations bring market stability and inflation remains controlled. Ventura Securities is of the view that gold prices might have limited upside due to a robust dollar and uncertainty surrounding US Federal Reserve interest rate reductions.Experts indicate that gold's immediate risk-reward profile appears unfavourable. Current market analysis suggests the precious metal is overvalued. Historical data examination of gold prices from the 1970s indicates an unusually significant gap between current prices and the 200-day moving average. This situation has historically preceded extended periods of price decline following rapid growth phases.Niranjan Avasthi, SVP and Head– Product, Marketing & Digital at Edelweiss Asset Management, indicates that gold currently appears more expensive compared to equity investments.Research of the Sensex to gold ratio since 1999 demonstrates that a ratio under 1 typically precedes equity outperformance over subsequent three years, whilst a ratio exceeding 1 suggests gold outperformance.The present ratio stands at 0.86, below the 0.96 long-term average. Avasthi says, ""equities may outpace gold in the next three years,"" suggesting gold's current overvaluation.""In the long term, the policies implemented by central banks are likely to have a profound impact on the gold market,"" insists Mehta.""Considering recent developments, central banks may opt to ease their monetary policies further, potentially moving away from reliance on a dominant currency holding. Such a shift could create a more favourable environment for gold, as the precious metal is traditionally viewed as a diversifier in times of competitive currency devaluations and economic instability.""The assessment of gold's future prospects finds support from Krishan Mishra, CEO of FPSB India, who states, ""Given its historical track record and consistent demand, gold's rally may still continue, particularly in uncertain economic environments.""Also Read | Indian stocks look attractive! Sensex expected to recover lost ground against EM peers in 2025 - top 10 reasons Historical data on gold performance shows compelling statistics. Based on DSP Mutual Fund analysis, gold investments have yielded superior returns compared to stocks in both developed nations (with typically modest stock market gains) and emerging economies (with potentially higher stock market returns) during the previous 25-year period (see visual). The sole exception remains India, where equities have marginally surpassed gold.An analysis of the last two decades indicates that a mere 11% of S&P 500 stocks surpassed gold's performance. The situation was more pronounced in the UK and Japan, where only 1% of stocks achieved this distinction.Whilst Indian stocks demonstrated better results, the majority still struggled to match gold's performance. Approximately 57% of NSE 500 index constituents have underperformed compared to gold during this timeframe. This data demonstrates the considerable challenge in surpassing gold's investment returns.Analysis of rolling returns data compiled by Avasthi reveals that gold's performance is less impressive compared to equities. The rolling returns methodology, which evaluates performance across various time periods without temporal bias, demonstrates that the BSE Sensex has generally yielded better returns than gold since 1984.Also Read | Why Jim Walker, man who foresaw 2008 market crash, wants investors to ‘absolutely double down’ on Indian equities The statistics show that gold surpassed equity performance in approximately 35% of instances, considering both 5-year and 10-year rolling return periods.Gold and equities share similar cyclical patterns, with periods of substantial gains followed by decline in performance. Historical data from FundsIndia reveals that since 1980, gold has experienced significant declines exceeding 30% on three separate occasions, causing pain for investors.The precious metal has shown extended periods of stagnation in returns. A notable example is the decade-long wait to reach its 1980 peak, whilst another instance shows a seven-year period to recover its 2012 peak value. Additionally, gold exhibits volatility comparable to equities.FundsIndia's analysis demonstrates that gold has traded at levels more than 10% below its peak on 51% of trading days. In comparison, the Sensex showed similar behaviour, trading below this threshold on 49% of occasions. These characteristics should be considered carefully whilst evaluating gold's current dominance in the market, the ET Wealth analysis says.Experts emphasise that gold serves as an essential component in a diversified investment portfolio. Although traditionally recognised as a safe-haven asset, gold's significance transcends beyond mere portfolio diversification.Nevertheless, investors should exercise caution regarding gold's recent performance and avoid excessive allocation.Research conducted by PrimeInvestor in 2024 revealed that incorporating gold into an equity-only portfolio between January 2003 and present, across 3-, 5-, and 10-year intervals, enhanced average returns whilst reducing loss probability and limiting downside during challenging periods.The study demonstrated that risk-adjusted returns showed significant improvement when investors allocated 10% to 20% in gold alongside equities. However, increasing allocation beyond these levels proved ineffective.Also Read | Stock market crash: Sensex, Nifty are bleeding!

“Ransom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa-affiliated cryptocurrency wallets. At this stage, Medusa concurrently advertises the sale of the data to interested parties before the countdown timer ends. Victims can additionally pay $10,000 in cryptocurrency to add a day to the countdown timer,”

The FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have warned Gmail and Microsoft Outlook users about a dangerous ransomware scheme . Earlier this week, the US government agencies issued a warning regarding Medusa, a ransomware-as-a-service software responsible for attacks since 2021, which has recently impacted hundreds of individuals. CISA reports that Medusa primarily employs phishing campaigns to steal victims' credentials. Some of the recommendations that the agencies offered to protect against this ransomware include patching operating systems and keeping devices updated, using multi-factor authentication for services like email and VPNs, using strong passwords and avoiding frequent password changesAccording to the advisory (seen by the news agency AP), Medusa developers and affiliates, known as “Medusa actors,” employ a double extortion strategy, encrypting victims' data and threatening to expose the stolen information if the ransom isn’t paid. Medusa runs a data-leak site that lists victims with countdowns to the potential release of their data.the advisory noted.Furthermore, CISA highlighted that Medusa developers and affiliates have targeted over 300 victims across various industries, including healthcare, education, legal, insurance, technology, and manufacturing since last month.Last week, the FBI also warned about a surge in ""smishing"" attacks targeting iPhone and Android users. These scams use fraudulent texts to steal personal and financial data. Cybercriminals have registered over 10,000 domains, fueling a fourfold increase in attacks since January 2025, putting millions at risk of identity theft and fraud, the previous warning noted.","The FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have warned Gmail and Microsoft Outlook users about a dangerous ransomware scheme.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
