NEW DELHI: A resurgence of African Swine Fever (ASF) in Mizoram has led to the deaths of 41 more pigs on Saturday, pushing the total toll to 503 since March 20, state animal husbandry and veterinary officials confirmed.The outbreak was first detected when laboratory tests in Guwahati confirmed ASF infection, triggering concerns among local farmers and authorities. Efforts are underway to contain the spread of the disease and mitigate further losses.The deaths were reported from seven localities in Lawngtlai town, the district headquarters of Lawngtlai district in southern Mizoram, which shares borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh.ASF has become an endemic concern in the north eastern state since its first confirmed case in Lungsen village, Lunglei, on March 21, 2021.All you need to know about the outbreak:African swine fever is a highly contagious and fatal viral disease that affects both domestic and wild pigs of all ages.While it poses no risk to humans and properly cooked pork remains safe to consume, the virus's devastating impact on swine can lead to pork shortages, trade disruptions, and economic consequences.With no available treatment or vaccine, prevention remains the most effective means of protecting pig populations.Authorities have said that since the disease exclusively affects pigs, the risk of transmission to other animals or humans is minimal.Additionally, there is no evidence of transmission from pigs or pork products. However, the virus can spread indirectly through contaminated clothing, equipment, or vehicles, posing a risk to susceptible pig populations.Implementing strict biosecurity measures and properly handling infected pigs and pork products are crucial to preventing the virus's spread and protecting the pork industry.","A resurgence of African Swine Fever (ASF) in Mizoram has led to the deaths of 41 more pigs on Saturday, pushing the total toll to 503 since March 20.

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing row over three language policy , defence minister Rajnath Singh Friday emphasised the importance of linguistic unity, national integration and valour of India’s brave queens. Addressing the audience at a theatrical tribute to Tamil queen Rani Velu Nachiyar , Singh reaffirmed that languages in India are not in competition but in cooperation, stating, “Hindi and all Indian languages strengthen each other.”Organised by BJP’s women’s wing, the event aimed to bring her inspiring story to a wider audience. “There should be no attempts to divide the nation in the name of language. A Hindi speaker is not an opponent of Tamil; rather, we believe in strengthening all Indian languages together,” he added. He said India’s linguistic diversity is a source of strength and unity, not discord.Addressing recent debates on language, he asserted that BJP remains committed to respecting and safeguarding all Indian languages, including Tamil and Hindi. He highlighted initiatives like Kashi Tamil Sangamam, which celebrate India’s linguistic and cultural diversity, and reiterated that promoting one language should never mean undermining another. He expressed concern over TN govt prioritising opposition to Hindi over providing education in Tamil for crucial fields like medicine and engineering, emphasising that BJP works with a “positive agenda” for the benefit of all.Singh paid tribute to the fearless spirit of India’s women warriors, including Nachiyar, first Indian queen to wage an armed struggle against the British.

The board suggested edits and if the revised version is submitted by Monday, it is expected to be approved for screening in the following days.The film's producers have agreed to the modifications.

NEW DELHI: While India meteorological department (IMD) is largely known for providing weather alerts and warnings in the public interest, benefiting various sectors and the common people, the country’s national weather forecaster has now emerged as a key govt scientific agency generating revenue from its range of services.Becoming the biggest money earner of the ministry of earth sciences (MoES), IMD has earned more than Rs 226 crore since 2022-23, with a substantial amount coming to its kitty from the aviation meteorological services provided to Airports Authority of India (AAI).MoES informed a parliamentary panel that another institution — Chennai-based National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) — has developed about 42 technologies which were transferred to industry on paid basis. It earned more than Rs 24 crore in the past three years. Besides rendering the aviation met services to AAI, IMD earned revenue by sale of meteorological data, periodical weather reports and testing/calibration of equipment.Data shared with the panel — parliamentary standing committee on science and &technology, environment, forests and climate change — shows that the IMD earned nearly Rs 66 crore by providing aviation met services during the first six months of 2024-25 financial year. “This (generating revenue from its services) will not only help the ministry to generate additional resources for augmenting important programmes, but also transfer the benefit of these technologies to the society at large,” said the panel, headed by BJP Lok Sabha member Bhubaneswar Kalita.Keeping in mind the specialised requirements of the renewable energy sector, a new data product suitable to the requirements of the sector has also been developed.The medium range forecasts (up to 10 days) of near surface variables (rainfall, temperature, surface pressure, humidity and winds) and upper air variables (winds, temperature humidity and geopotential height) are used for monitoring and early warning of severe weather events.Though these forecasts are used by the IMD and other national and state level disaster agencies, special steps have been taken in the past few years to make the data available to the paid clients in a secure data access.","The India meteorological department (IMD) is largely known for providing weather alerts and warnings in the public interest.

LONDON: An Indian librarian working at Cambridge university’s Trinity College has lost an employment tribunal case in which she was suing the college for race discrimination after not being allowed to take an entire academic term off to go to India.Dr Havovi Anklesaria , who has worked in the library of Trinity College since 1994, wanted to take four months off from Dec to April each year to go to India to care for her parents and visit other family members.Anklesaria is an Indian national with indefinite leave to remain in the UK. She used to return to India annually, from mid-Dec to mid-April, as she had previously been on a casual contract with the college. However, she was switched to a permanent contract in Sept 2021 and at that point the college said it could not allow her to take those four months off and she could take three months off in the summer instead.She then took Trinity College to the employment tribunal, claiming direct and indirect race discrimination based on her race. She also claimed victimisation, saying she was victimised for bringing employment tribunal proceedings as she was not offered invigilation work between April 2022 and Sept 2022.Andrew Speak, human resources director at the college, told the tribunal the college was agreeable to Anklesaria having extended breaks each year, provided it “is not for an entire term”.Speak said that would apply to anyone of any nationality who is on a permanent contract.Employment judge Freshwater dismissed her claims for indirect and direct race discrimination and victimisation. He said: “No employee working for the college under a permanent contract is allowed to be absent from work for an entire term. Anklesaria was offered a contract that would have permitted her to have a break of three months over the summer. She did not accept this. We do not find that she was treated less favourably because of her nationality.”He added she was not offered invigilation work because a decision was taken to offer it to post-doctoral members and postgraduate students instead.","Dr Havovi Anklesaria wanted to take four months off from Dec to April each year to go to India to care for her parents and visit other family members.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday addressed concerns about loan waivers, making it clear that farmers must repay their crop loans by March 31.He admitted that election promises don’t always translate into immediate action and that future decisions will depend on prevailing circumstances.However, he assured that 0% interest loans would be available to ease the burden on farmers.""Whether it's Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis or deputy CM Eknath Shinde , the focus remains on working for the welfare of the people. Recently, many citizens raised concerns about the election manifesto's promise of loan waivers. As of March 28, I want to clearly inform the people of Maharashtra through this program to repay their crop loans by March 31. Promises made during elections don't always translate directly into actions… Considering the current circumstances, decisions will be made in the future. However, for now and even next year, loans taken must be repaid. On a positive note, arrangements have been made to avail of loans at 0% interest,"" Pawar said at an event in Baramati.Discussing the state's financial commitments, Pawar highlighted the challenges of managing Maharashtra’s budget of Rs 7.20 lakh crore. He pointed out that waiving electricity bills alone costs the government nearly Rs 65,000 crore. ""Whatever was said does not come into action directly because while presenting a budget of Rs 7.20 lakh crore, electricity bills worth about Rs 65,000 crore have been waived off, meaning you don't, but we, the government, have to pay it,"" he said.Pawar also outlined the financial burden of various welfare schemes, including Rs 45,000 crore allocated for the Ladki Bahin Yojana . Additionally, Rs 3.5 lakh crore is required for salaries, pensions, and loan interest payments. ""If we add Rs 65,000 crore and Rs 3.5 lakh crore, nearly Rs 4.25 lakh crore is already spent. The remaining funds have to cover essential expenses like school books, uniforms, electricity, water, and roads,"" he added.Recalling his recent visit to Kolhapur, Pawar mentioned that his colleague Hasan Mushrif had urged him to address the issue of crop loan waivers, as many farmers were awaiting relief. ""Yesterday, I was in Kolhapur, and even there, Hasan Mushrif asked me to quickly decide as people are not paying and are waiting… Hence, we will take a decision after assessing the situation. Right now, the conditions do not allow for a waiver, so this year’s and next year’s loans must be repaid,"" Pawar said.To support farmers, he reiterated that the state has arranged for 0% interest loans, covering bank interest costs of Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,200 crore. ""I have passed that on to the banks,"" he added.","Ajit Pawar, Maharashtra deputy chief minister and finance minister, addressed concerns about loan waivers.

On March 30, 1949, four princely states — Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, and Jaisalmer — joined hands to form Greater Rajasthan. The event, officiated by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at Jaipur’s City Palace, marked a near-complete unification of Rajputana and laid the foundation of modern Rajasthan. Since then, March 30 has been celebrated as Rajasthan Day .This year, the Bhajan Lal Sharma-led BJP govt has announced a calendar shift — Rajasthan Day will now be celebrated annually on Chaitra Shukla Pratipada , the first day of the Hindu calendar. Coincidentally, in 2025, that falls on March 30 — but in future years, the date will vary. In 2026, for example, Chaitra Pratipada will fall on March 19.Justifying the change, Sharma said the date aligns with India’s traditional calendar and reflects Rajasthan’s Sanatan cultural heritage . He cited Sardar Patel’s 1949 speech noting that the foundation of Greater Rajasthan happened on Varsha Pratipada (the New Year in Vikram Samvat 2006), which coincided with March 30 that year. The state government has earmarked Rs 25 crore for this year’s celebrations and argues that marking the day by the Indian calendar restores cultural continuity.Critics say the change politicises a historical event. Historian R S Khangarot warns that it dilutes the historical accuracy of March 30, 1949 — a date etched in records as the day Rajasthan was officially formed. “Facts must remain facts,” he said, adding that using a movable date risks distorting public memory of the actual event.The Rajasthan Board’s Class X history textbook also affirms March 30, 1949, as the date when Rajasthan was officially named and unified.The change has triggered a political row, with the opposition Congress accusing the BJP of pushing an RSS-backed cultural agenda. Leader of Opposition Tikaram Jully called the move “unnecessary saffronisation,” asking if similar shifts would be proposed for Independence Day or Republic Day. “Rajasthan Day is a political and historical event, not a religious festival,” he said.The decision has roots in the long-standing campaign of the Navvarsh Samaroh Samiti (NSS), an Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-aligned body established in 1952. Since 2001, NSS has lobbied successive governments to mark Rajasthan Day according to the Vikram Samvat calendar, claiming historical evidence that Patel’s ceremony coincided with Chaitra Pratipada.Supporters of the move, including Sanskrit scholars and govt officials, argue that the Vikram Samvat is a broadly Indian calendar, used not only by Hindus but also by Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs. They contend that recognising this system for a state event enhances India’s civilisational identity.At the heart of debate is the question — is Rajasthan Day a historical milestone or a cultural celebration? And must the two coincide?","Rajasthan Day will now be celebrated annually on Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, the first day of the Hindu calendar. The state government has earmarked Rs 25 crore for this year’s celebrations.

NEW DELHI: Slamming permission to banks to hike charges on ATM withdrawals, Congress Saturday cited a series of levies by banks coupled with price rise and “unbridled loot” to accuse Modi govt of turning banks into “collection agents”.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said, “Our banks have been unfortunately made collection agents by Modi govt which has extracted at least Rs 43,500 crore due to non-maintenance of minimum balance from savings accounts & Jan Dhan accounts combined, between 2018 and 2024.”“Other bank charges to loot citizens: inactivity fee which is Rs 100-200 per year. Bank statement issuance fee is Rs 50-100. Rs 20-25 per quarter is charged for SMS alerts. Banks charge 1-3% as loan processing fees ,” he said, adding if a loan is paid on time, loan pre-closure charges are levied by banks, and NEFT & demand draft charges are an additional burden while KYC updates like signature changes also attract fees.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said, “Our banks have been unfortunately made collection agents by Modi govt” Kharge: “Banks have extracted at least Rs 43,500 crore due to non-maintenance of minimum balance from savings accounts & Jan Dhan accounts combined”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119731372,imgsize-28992,width-400,resizemode-4/119731372.jpg"

NEW DELHI: West Bengal leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari on Friday wrote to external affairs minister S Jaishankar urging him to prevent future foreign visits by chief minister Mamata Banerjee in her official capacity. Adhikari accused Banerjee of undermining India on the international stage and bringing shame to the country during her recent visit to the United Kingdom.In his letter, Adhikari claimed that Banerjee’s remarks in London displayed ""devotion and admiration for the colonial masters,"" which he described as ""unthinkable"" for a Bengali. He cited her speech at a business event in the UK, where she said, ""I love UK because we have an emotional relation, historical relation... From the heritage point of view, ours and from yours also. 190 years, you ruled in India. You ruled Bengal... So we forget that? Always India remembers you, and Bengal also remembers you.""Adhikari condemned her remarks, saying that Bengal had been at the forefront of the independence movement, resisting British rule. He said that praising the colonial past amounted to ""public renunciation of the sacrifices made by our freedom movement revolutionaries.""The letter also criticised Banerjee for her statements at Oxford University's Kellogg College, where she appeared to ""downplay"" India’s economic growth. When a speaker highlighted that India had overtaken the UK as the world's fifth-largest economy and was projected to become the largest by 2060, Banerjee disagreed, saying, ""I will differ that.""Adhikari called her response ""simply treasonous"" and an ""embarrassment for every Bengali and Indian."" He alleged that Banerjee had ""deliberately tarnished India’s reputation on foreign soil"" and accused her of opposing the country's economic rise.The BJP leader further urged the external affairs ministry to conduct a ""thorough probe"" into her remarks and ensure she is not granted permission for official foreign visits in the future. He referenced existing guidelines that require the ministry of external affairs to approve such visits and suggested that her remarks should be considered grounds for disqualification.Banerjee's visit to the UK was marred by controversy, as she faced protests from a group of demonstrators at Kellogg College. Protesters held placards questioning her stance on election violence in West Bengal and the RG Kar College case. BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a video of the incident, criticising Banerjee for her comments on India's economic future. ""West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has a problem with India becoming the world's largest economy... This is truly shameful,"" he posted on X.Union minister Giriraj Singh also slammed Banerjee, saying, ""Hiding the truth and insulting India, both are done by Mamata Banerjee.

Tesla protesters have called for a global day of action against the company and its CEO Elon Musk today as hundreds of demonstrations are going to take place across the country and also outside. More than 200 protests are planned at Tesla locations in the country today in a statement against Elon Musk and his interference in the government. ""No one is coming to save us. Not politicians, not the media, not the courts,"" the website of Tesla Takedown said.Many democratic leaders are supporting the Tesla Takedown, which they call a non-violent protest against Elon Musk's company but hundred of vehicles, showrooms and other properties have been attacked, set on fire in the past few days leading up to the major Tesla Takedown day on March 29.The Donald Trump administration has stood strongly beside Elon Musk and the government said that people arrested for arson and vandalizing Tesla properties will be charged with domestic terrorism.Elon Musk has spoken about the ongoing protests several times.

Hundreds of international students wake up to an email asking them to self deport for campus activism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hundreds-of-international-students-are-waking-up-to-an-email-asking-them-to-self-deport-for-campus-activism-or-even-sharing-posts-on-social-media/articleshow/119679695.cms,"The email sent to the students reads:

Views of an immigration attorney:

Jath Shao , founder of an immigration law firm, spoke extensively with TOI on this emerging issue.

“F-1 and J-1 students are usually admitted D/S, meaning for the duration of their status. There’s a slight distinction between overstay and unlawful presence Historically, someone admitted D/S has not accrued unlawful presence for the purpose of 3 or 10 year bars unless USCIS makes a formal finding that they are unlawfully present. This is important because if you're formally unlawfully present for more than 180 days or 365 days, it can trigger a 3 or 10 year bar. However, with overstay, it's more in a gray area - where the consular officer has more discretion whether to hold that overstay or status violation against the person,” said Shao.

“USCIS’s page has been updated recently on Jan 25 and now states that – Non-immigrants admitted for the duration of status, generally begin accruing unlawful presence the day after their status ends, if they remain in US,” he pointed out.

This is similar to what the Trump administration had attempted during his earlier tenure, when they tried to change the rule to backdate unlawful presence to the point of time when the person violated status.

“Historically, someone admitted under D/S can stay as long as they are maintaining that status - such as being a full time F-1 student or J-1 exchange visitor. In cases of SEVIS termination, normally there are two things an international student can do - either apply to USCIS to reinstate your F-1 and SEVIS, or leave the US and try to get a new F-1 visa through the embassy.”

Shao added, “As part of the leaked Rubio memo (reported by online media) states that affected people should self deport and report to the US consulate or embassy for physical cancellation of their visa, it doesn’t seem like going back to apply for a new visa would be a great option.” (The email sent to a student, as seen by TOI, also has a similar wording).

Jath Shao and other immigration attorneys view that students should seek legal counsel to help them reinstate their SEVIS or in a worse case, immigration attorneys can defend them if removal proceedings are brought against them.

Hundreds of international students in the US are getting an email from the US Department of State (DOS) asking them to self-deport owing to campus activism. Immigration attorneys’ contacted by TOI affirmed this development and added a few Indian students may also be at the receiving end of such emails – for something as innocuous as sharing a social media post.It is not just international students who physically participated in campus activism but also those who shared or liked ‘anti-national’ posts that are the target of these emails, said an immigration attorney.This crackdown is based on social-media reviews being conducted by DOS (which includes Consulate officials). Thus, even new student applications be it for an F (academic study visa), M (vocational study visa) or J (exchange visa) will also come under such social media scrutiny. Applicants will be denied the opportunity to study in the US.According to the latest Open Doors report, there are 1.1 million international students studying in the US in 2023-24 of which 3.31 lakh are Indian students.As reported by Axios earlier, Marco Rubio , Secretary of State, has launched an AI-fuelled ‘ Catch and Revoke’ effort to cancel the visas of foreign nationals who appear to support Hamas or other designated terror groups. Axios further reports that more than 300 foreign students have had their student visas revoked in the three weeks that ‘Catch and Revoke’ has been in operation, there are 1.5 million student visa-holders nationwide.“On behalf of the United States Department of State, the Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Office hereby informs you that additional information became available after your visa was issued. As a result, your F-1 visa with expiration date XXXXX was revoked in accordance with Section 221(i) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended.""""The Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Office has alerted the Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which manages the Student Exchange Visitor Program and is responsible for removal proceedings. They may notify your designated school official about the revocation of your F-1 visa.""""Remaining in the United States without a lawful immigration status can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation. It may also make you ineligible for a future U.S. visa. Please note that deportation can take place at a time that does not allow the person being deported to secure possessions or conclude affairs in the United States. Persons being deported may be sent to countries other than their countries of origin.""""Given the gravity of this situation, individuals whose visa was revoked may wish to demonstrate their intent to depart the United States using the CBP Home App""""As soon as you depart the United States, you must personally present your passport to the U.S. embassy or consulate which issued your visa so your visa can be physically cancelled. You must not attempt to use your visa as it has been revoked. If you intend to travel to the United States in the future, you must apply for another U.S. visa and a determination on your eligibility for a visa will be made at that time.""According to immigration attorneys, the flurry of self-deportation emails that are being sent to international students stems from a March 25, internal directive dispatched by Rubio , directing mandatory social media reviews of existing international students already in the US and new applicants.“If the social media review uncovers potentially derogatory information indicating that the applicant may not be eligible for a visa, Fraud Prevention Units are required to take screenshots of social media findings to the extent it is relevant to a visa ineligibility, to preserve the record against the applicant's later alteration of the information,” states this internal directive.“Consular officers do not need to upload social media findings if the review does not reveal derogatory information, but consular officers must enter case notes stating they conducted a social media review which did not reveal derogatory information,” adds the directive.Such students are also being informed by their International Student Service Office that their SEVIS record has been terminated. SEVIS is the web-based information system that the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses to track and monitor international students during their duration of study.“Students with a terminated SEVIS record must depart the U.S. immediately; there is no grace period following a SEVIS termination. We advise you to depart the US as soon as possible,"" states this intimation.Rubio’s statement at an earlier press conference:At a press conference in Guyana on Thursday, in response to a question relating to the Turkish student at Tufts who has been detained, Rubio said: “if you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student and you tell us that the reason why you’re coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we’re not going to give you a visa. If you lie to us and get a visa and then enter the United States and with that visa participate in that sort of activity, we’re going to take away your visa.”“Now, once you’ve lost your visa, you’re no longer legally in the United States, and we have a right, like every country in the world has a right, to remove you from our country. So it’s just that simple.”“I think it’s crazy – I think it’s stupid for any country in the world to welcome people into their country that are going to go to their universities as visitors – they’re visitors – and say I’m going to your universities to start a riot, I’m going to your universities to take over a library and harass people. I don’t care what movement you’re involved in. Why would any country in the world allow people to come and disrupt? We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses. And if we’ve given you a visa and then you decide to do that, we’re going to take it away…Once your visa is revoked, you’re illegally in the country and you have to leave. Every country in the world has a right to decide who comes in as a visitor and who doesn’t”.",Hundreds of international students in the US are getting an email from the US Department of State asking them to self-deport owing to campus activism.

Team gives priority to cap space ahead of contract extensions



Mitch Marner's contract situation hangs over



John Tavares and Steven Lorentz in wait-and-see mode



A make-or-break offseason for Toronto



As the NHL summer gets near, the Toronto Maple Leafs are adopting a guarded stance on their roster choices. Based on NHL insider Nick Kypreos , the franchise's first concern is Mitch Marner's future ahead of signing contract extensions on other players, such as John Tavares and Steven Lorentz. Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving is also known to be a Marner enthusiast.The Maple Leafs are said to be waiting on contract negotiations with their upcoming unrestricted free agents until they decide if Marner will remain or if they will have to spend cap room to replace him. “It sounds like pending unrestricted free agents John Tavares and Steven Lorentz will have to wait until the offseason for any contract offers from the Leafs if they are to stay. The Leafs’ top priority remains leaving enough cap space to either re-sign Mitch Marner or bring in one or two players as suitable replacements.” Kypreos said in the Toronto Star.Marner, 27, is set to reach the expiration of his six-year, $65.4 million contract soon, and he continues to perform well on the ice. He has 89 points in 71 games and is still an integral offensive player for the Maple Leafs. Yet if he reaches free agency on July 1, he likely will demand a hefty salary bump, maybe into the $13-14 million per-year area.Despite previous trade speculation, Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving has remained a strong supporter of Marner. The marquee winger wouldn't waive his no-trade clause at the trade deadline, making him the boss of the situation. The Leafs now have to determine if they can keep him or if they will have to look elsewhere.Vet Center John Tavares is also in his seventh and last year of a $77 million, seven-year contract. He has been contributing with 33 goals and 67 points through 65 contests. The Maple Leafs are not hurrying, though, to sign him longer term, holding off to examine how the Marner situation will develop before they commit long-term.Although Tavares is still an asset, Kypreos said his Toronto future will hinge on whether or not the club can generate the cap space necessary.In the meantime, forward Steven Lorentz is going through a one-year, $775,000 deal and has tallied six goals and 16 points in 69 contests. Similar to Tavares, he sits in limbo as the Leafs determine their roster requirements.The Maple Leafs' offseason plan will heavily depend on Marner's choice. If he re-signs, Toronto will have to manage its remaining cap space very carefully to complete the roster. If he departs, the team will have the cap space to go after other high-impact free agents.Also read: Toronto Maple Leafs sign NCAA standout Luke Haymes to two-year contract With free agency only months off, everyone's eyes will be on the Maple Leafs as they make their way through one of the most important off-seasons in recent history.","The Toronto Maple Leafs are holding off on signing John Tavares and Steven Lorentz.

US President Donald Trump on Friday described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a 'great friend' and a 'very smart man'. He made these statements at a White House press briefing where he reaffirmed his position on India's high tariffs.""Prime Minister Modi was here just recently, and we've always been very good friends. India is one of the highest-tariffing nations in the world. They're very smart,"" Trump said. ""He is a very smart man and a great friend of mine. We had very good talks. I think it's going to work out very well between India and our country. And I want to say you have a great prime minister.""US prepares to implement reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including India, from April 2. Trump has consistently critiqued India's trade policies, calling it 'tariff king' and describing its import duties as 'very unfair and strong'.Trump had said in an earlier statement, ""I have a very good relationship with India, but the only problem I have with India is they're one of the highest-tariffing nations in the world. I believe they're probably going to lower those tariffs substantially, but on April 2, we will be charging them the same tariffs they charge us.""Addressing the issue, MoS ministry of external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said that during PM Modi's visit to the US on February 12-13, both India and the US resolved to deepen the bilateral trade relationship to promote growth that ensures fairness, national security and job creation. ""PM Modi and US President Donald Trump set a new bilateral trade target – 'Mission 500' – aiming to more than double the total two-way goods and services trade to $500 billion by 2030... Both sides announced plans to negotiate the first tranche of a mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) by the fall of 2025.""""The two governments are in the process of taking these negotiations forward and are actively working to build a framework for the BTA, which aims to expand trade across the goods and services sector, whilst working towards increasing market access, reducing tariff and non-tariff barries, and deepening supply-chain integration,"" he said further. Previously, Trump had criticised India's trade practices, stating 'they have the highest tariffs' and 'it is a hard place to do business"". Trump had said, ""We will soon impose reciprocal tariffs- they charge us, we charge them. Whatever a company or a country, such as India or China, charges, we want to be fair; hence, reciprocal.""He continued, ""We have never done that. We were getting ready to do it until Covid hit."" Specifically addressing India's automotive import duties, Trump noted, ""India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%.""During his address to a joint session of the US Congress, Trump confirmed the reciprocal tax implementation on April 2, expressing that the US had faced exploitation from nearly every nation globally and promised to prevent such practices.Additionally, he addressed tariffs imposed by the European Union, China, Brazil, and Mexico, indicating that the US would implement corresponding tariffs based on other nations' treatment of the US.In a declaration from the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles entering the United States, describing it as 'very exciting' for domestic manufacturing.The new tariffs, commencing April 2, will affect approximately half of all vehicles sold in the United States, including American brands produced overseas. This comprehensive policy intends to encourage automotive manufacturers to establish additional production facilities within US territory.","US prepares to implement reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including India, from April 2.

Elon Musk’s xAI acquires X social media platform in a 33 billion dollar mega deal: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-xai-acquires-x-social-media-platform-in-a-33-billion-dollar-mega-deal-report/articleshow/119687915.cms,"Musk’s xAI acquires X to merge AI and social media

Musk’s xAI expands AI dominance with Grok-3 and Colossus

Integration of X and xAI: Strategic implications

Financial and regulatory considerations

Musk’s expanding influence

In a major corporate merger, Elon Musk 's AI company, xAI , has purchased X, the social media site previously known as Twitter, for $33 billion. The purchase is the latest high-profile action by Musk, who already controls Tesla and SpaceX. The transaction is an all-stock merger that tightens Musk's grip on X and helps him advance AI technologies, including his chatbot system, Grok.Musk announced the acquisition via a post on X, stating that the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, accounting for debt adjustments. The merger is expected to integrate the vast data resources of X with xAI’s AI models and computational power, potentially giving xAI an advantage in the increasingly competitive AI market. But the details of the deal, such as investor compensation, employee impact, and regulatory issues, are still unknown. The takeover also raises concerns about privacy, data protection, and the future of both platforms.The announcement of xAI’s acquisition of X follows Musk’s long-term vision of integrating AI with social media platforms. In his post, Musk emphasized that the futures of xAI and X are ""intertwined,"" highlighting plans to combine data, AI models, computational power, and distribution networks.Industry analysts have described the move as both strategic and expected. Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, noted that the acquisition appears to be a culmination of Musk’s plans for X. Meanwhile, D.A. Davidson & Co. analyst Gil Luria pointed out that the transaction’s valuation—$45 billion before debt adjustments—is significant because it surpasses the original $44 billion Musk paid to take Twitter private in 2022.Musk’s deep involvement in both xAI and X allowed him to execute the acquisition without seeking external investor approval. According to insiders, Musk informed investors that the two companies had already been collaborating closely and that the integration would enhance the development of xAI’s AI models.Founded in 2023, xAI has quickly positioned itself as a competitor in the artificial intelligence market. It recently raised $10 billion in funding, valuing the company at $75 billion. xAI is directly competing with OpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT , and has been working to develop increasingly sophisticated AI models.In February 2025, xAI introduced Grok-3, its latest AI model, as it seeks to rival OpenAI and other AI firms such as China’s DeepSeek. The company has also been investing in expanding its computational resources, with its ""Colossus"" supercomputer cluster in Memphis, Tennessee, being among the largest AI training facilities in the world.Musk has been engaged in legal battles with OpenAI, suing the company over its transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit model. A federal judge recently denied Musk’s request for an injunction to halt OpenAI’s restructuring, further intensifying competition between the two AI firms.The merger between xAI and X represents a broader strategy by Musk to leverage the social media platform’s vast user-generated data for AI development. X, with its real-time data streams, user interactions, and media content, provides xAI with an extensive dataset that can be used to refine and train its AI models.By integrating AI directly into X, Musk could transform the platform into a hub for AI-driven content moderation, personalized recommendations, and enhanced user interactions. Furthermore, the ability to distribute xAI’s AI products through X could provide a competitive advantage over rival AI companies that rely on standalone applications.The acquisition raises several financial and regulatory questions. Following Musk’s 2022 takeover of Twitter, X experienced a turbulent period marked by massive layoffs and advertiser withdrawals. However, recent improvements in its operational performance and renewed advertiser interest have made X a more attractive asset.The banks that originally provided $13 billion in loans for Musk’s Twitter acquisition managed to offload the debt to investors, reflecting increased market confidence in X’s long-term viability. Analysts believe that investors who purchased the debt could see significant returns due to the company’s improving financial performance and integration with xAI.Despite these developments, the deal could face regulatory scrutiny, particularly regarding concerns over monopolization and data privacy. Merging a major social media platform with an AI company raises questions about how user data will be utilized and whether the integration could lead to unfair competitive advantages.Beyond the business realm, Musk’s growing influence in Washington, D.C., could play a role in shaping regulatory responses to the acquisition. As head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk has been involved in advising the U.S. government on cost-cutting measures, potentially giving him leverage in policy discussions affecting his business empire.Musk’s extensive portfolio, which now includes Tesla, SpaceX, X, xAI, and Neuralink, positions him as one of the most powerful figures in technology and business. The acquisition of X by xAI represents another step in his broader vision of integrating AI with social media, automation, and space exploration.","Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, has purchased X, the social media site previously known as Twitter, for $33 billion.

'Tesla is a Ponzi scheme'

'Musk is a f****** fascist'

Vivian Wilson , Elon Musk 's estranged daughter, slammed her father's plans to colonise Mars a 'marketing scheme,' and called him “insecure buffoon.”Wilson appeared in a live stream of Hasan Piker and talked about Musk's gaming skills and claiming that Tesla is a Ponzi scheme .Despite Musk's frequent discussions about establishing a million-person city on Mars by 2050, and his recent announcement about sending spaceships with the Optimus robot this year, with potential human landings by 2029, Wilson remains sceptical.While criticising her father's Mars colonisation plans, Vivian Wilson called this as a mere publicity stunt and said: ""It's not happening, people... It's a marketing scheme that everyone somehow fell for despite being debunked by a f****** Google search.""She also claimed that Tesla operates like a Ponzi scheme, citing the company’s “high P/E ratio as evidence.”""It's inevitably going to ratio. It's not a car company, it's a Ponzi scheme,"" she said while talking with streamer piker.She continued her criticism while speaking with Piker, labeling him a narcissist, Daily Mail reported.When asked about his typical workday behavior, Wilson responded: ""Most of the time I saw him working, he was just yelling at employees in the car while we watched in horror—viscerally screaming.""Wilson also dismissed the notion that her father was ever liberal, stating he had ""never been on the left"" and had leaned right-wing ""since at least 2016.""Additionally, she rejected claims that her transition influenced his political shift, saying, ""I cannot take credit for him becoming a f****** loon. I am not the reason he’s a f****** fascist.""She disputed claims about her father's political leanings, asserting he was 'never on the left' and had maintained right-wing views since at least 2016. She firmly rejected suggestions that her transition influenced his political shift.The tension escalated when Musk claimed in an interview that he was deceived into signing documents regarding puberty blockers, referring to Wilson using male pronouns and her birth name. He attributed this to what he called the 'woke mind virus'.Wilson refuted these allegations on Threads, suggesting her father's claims stem from his absence during her childhood. She alleged that Musk would consistently criticise her 'femininity and queerness'.In a recent Teen Vogue cover interview, Wilson expressed her aspiration to become a reality television star, stating: ""It is my absolute dream to be on a reality show, which I know is absolutely pathetic. As an overdramatic little queer, reality shows are something I adore beyond belief.""Wilson, who received approval for her name and gender change in 2022, confirmed her financial independence from her billionaire father since coming out as trans in 2020.

Exploring the personal life of the late WWE Legend, Umaga

Who is Umaga’s wife?

Umaga’s wrestling legacy

The WWE legend and a prominent member of the Anoi’i family, Edward Smith Fatu, aka Umaga , who spoke less English but relied on brute strength. The Samoan wrestler is widely recognized for his significant stints across WWE and NJPW and was the younger brother of Rikishi and his twin brother, The Tonga Kid. Following in the footsteps of the Samoan legacy, the former WWE champion met with an unfortunate fate and passed away in 2009, the same year as his release from WWE. Despite the untimely passing of the Samoan legend, his wrestling legacy is being carried out by his youngest son and several members of the Anoa’i roots, who is one of the top performers in WWE today, Zilla Fatu .Beyond the squared circle, the Samoan wrestler tied the knot with L.T. Fatu in 2001. The couple has four children together, including their youngest, Zilla Fatu, and the oldest being Isayah. Although Umaga kept his personal life outside the mainstream chaos, his wife, L.T. Fatu, received utmost support from the fans and the wrestling industry alike after the tragic passing of the WWE star.Chris Jericho, among many, came forward to offer the late Samoan wrestler’s spouse a check of $5000 to provide aid during the sorrowful time for the mourning family.Prominent duo known for their Samoan roots, The Usos (Jonathan and Joshua) are the nephews of the late WWE Samoan idol, who began their wrestling journey by signing contracts with Florida Wrestling Championship the same day of Umaga’s demise. Another nephew of Umaga, Joseph, aka Solo Sikoa , and his son, Zilla Fatu, use the signature move, the Samoan Spike, in tribute to Umaga.The Anoa’i family has been a dominant force in the world of WWE, with megastars like Roman Reigns , Solo Sikoa, Jey Uso, and Zilla Fatu carrying on the family’s legacy in WWE.

US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he ""couldn't care less"" if automakers raise car prices for Americans after he imposed a 25 per cent tariff on all foreign-made cars.There have been reports that he warned auto executives of consequences if prices go up, but Trump, in an interview with NBC News, told that higher prices would benefit US-based manufacturers.""I couldn't care less. I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty,"" he told NBC host Kristen Welker.On Thursday, Trump announced a 25 per cent tariff on all imported cars and light trucks, starting April 3.Car parts from countries covered under the US trade pact with Mexico and Canada will have a delay in tariffs while officials work on supply chain adjustments.Automakers have been reluctant to move production to the US due to the high costs and time needed to build factories, hire workers, and reorganize supply chains. Additionally, Trump's shifting tariff policies make auto executives uncertain about his long-term commitment to these measures, a CNN report said.Trump said the tariff would remain in place to increase US production and support the American auto industry.""Absolutely, they’re permanent, sure. The world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more. And all we’re doing is being fair, and frankly, I’m being very generous,"" Trump said.Even though Trump supports the move, stock prices of major US automakers have dropped, and experts have said price increases will impact American consumers.When asked by NBC News about his message to concerned auto executives, Trump said: ""The message is 'congratulations.'""He added, ""The message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you’re going to make a lot of money. If you don’t, you’re going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.""","US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he ""couldn't care less"" if automakers raise car prices for Americans after he imposed a 25 per cent tariff on all foreign-made cars.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.
