"COP29 gets momentum with consensus on creation of carbon credits standards, India wants to conclude work on carbon market",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cop29-gets-momentum-with-consensus-on-creation-of-carbon-credits-standards-india-wants-to-conclude-work-on-carbon-market/articleshow/115236579.cms,"BAKU: With countries reaching a consensus on the standards for creation of carbon credits for the larger issue of setting up carbon markets, India on Tuesday expressed that it expects to conclude the work on the issue at the ongoing COP29 and pitched for ""adequate, predictable and accessible"" finance under the new post-2025 climate finance goal. The remarks came as a group of developing countries (G77, including India, plus China) rejected an existing text on finance goals as it did not have clarity on the quantum as well as sources of finance.In the backdrop of such a development on the second day of the UN climate talks, Indian negotiators said since the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance is a key element in the discussions at the COP29, India would continue to be vocal about the need for adequate finance for the Global South (developing countries).""COP29 should ensure that climate finance is adequate, predictable, accessible, grant-based, low-interest and long-term,"" said an Indian negotiator. His remarks reflect the sentiments of developing countries, represented by the G77 plus China grouping, which want the NCQG text to clearly specify an amount of at least $1.3 trillion per year from developed to developing countries, with a significant provision component for adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage.""At present, much of climate finance discussions are focused on investments in mitigation actions. The COP29 should maintain balance and highlight the urgency of addressing adaptation needs, particularly for vulnerable communities in developing countries,"" said the negotiator, spelling out India's stand on NCQG and carbon market — two issues which are considered yardsticks to judge the outcome of this round of the climate conference. India has already sought a clear definition of climate finance, as reported by TOI on Monday, to bring clarity on the entire issue.Article 6 of the Paris Agreement deals with the global carbon market issue. Late Monday, countries agreed on the article’s sub-section 6.4, which will enable climate action by increasing demand for carbon credits and ensure that the international carbon market operates with ""integrity under the supervision of the United Nations"".“This will be a game-changing tool to direct resources to the developing world. Following years of stalemate, the breakthroughs in Baku have now begun. But there is much more to deliver,"" said COP29 president Mukhtar Babayev while identifying the full operationalisation of Article 6 as a key negotiating priority this year. It is believed that the finalising Article 6 negotiations could reduce the cost of implementing national climate plans by $250 billion per year by enabling cooperation across borders.On the carbon market, Indian negotiators said the COP29 should be able to agree to a mechanism which uses market-based instruments (such as carbon credits) to incentivise low carbon development. ""Countries should establish clearer rules for global carbon markets which do not create unfair barriers to trade or development. It instead addresses the technology and finance gaps for supporting developing nations,"" said a negotiator while speaking on India's stand.","India has pitched for ""adequate, predictable and accessible"" finance under the new post-2025 climate finance goal.

Dick served as a lieutenant at Seringapatam in the 75th Highland Regiment of Foot. The regiment formed part of the storming party at the battle, their objective to breach the walls by use of ladders. Lt Dick is therefore likely to have been amongst the first of the British forces to enter the city, and it was his regiment that assisted with the search for Tipu’s body after the battle.A silver-hilt Seringapatam medal belonging to Peter Cherry, who was present at the siege in the capacity of paymaster, which depicts a “British lion overcoming the tiger”, sold for £23,040 (Rs 24 lakh).A report on the secret alliance between Tipu Sultan and the nawabs of the Carnatic, signed by N B Edmonstone, Persian translator to govt of Bengal, dated April 6, 1800, sold for £35,840 (Rs 38.6 lakh).The Edmonstone document is a manuscript copy of the report to the govt of Bengal on the cache of correspondence between Tipu Sultan and his ministers which was found at Seringapatam after the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and is believed to reveal a secret alliance between Tipu Sultan and two successive nawabs of the Carnatic, Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah and Umdat al-Umara, who were notionally allied with the British. The findings were used to compel Umdat al-Umara's successor, Azim ud-Daul, to sign the Carnatic Treaty , one of the treaties by which the British Empire acquired its rule over the Indian subcontinent.",The sword has an unbroken provenance taking it back to the 1799 battle in which Tipu Sultan met his end.

NEW DELHI: In a first, Enforcement Directorate went after a group of land grabbers in Chennai that had encroached upon a plot worth Rs 13 crore in Saidapet area, and restituted it to its owner, a significant development in the face of several such cases of usurpation taking several decades to be disposed of and many remaining unresolved.These land grabbers had sold the encroached property to a third party by forging documents and fraudulently claiming ownership. Though an FIR was registered in the case by the Chennai Police in 2009, not much progress was made.Subsequently, in 2017, ED registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), attached the property, traced the money trail to establish proceeds of crime, filed a chargesheet, and with court permission, restituted the land to its owner.“The current value of the property stands at Rs 12.7 crore and its restitution to the rightful claimant and victim marks a significant step in ED’s ongoing efforts to ensure that the proceeds of crime are returned to those affected,” the agency said on Monday.ED is investigating a number of land grab cases in different parts of the country and is in the process of restoring them to their rightful owners. The restitution of assets and money to individual victims of scams started with the disbursement of nearly Rs 12 crore of attached fixed deposits (FDs) of the Rose Valley group of companies in Kolkata to around 22 lakh small depositors, who had filed their claims before a court-monitored committee.In Aug, ED restituted at least 78 flats worth more than Rs 20 crore to homebuyers of SRS group’s SRS Pearl, SRS City and SRS Prime in Gurgaon. This was just the beginning as the agency has attached properties worth Rs 2,215 crore of SRS group... The restitution process began following a directive from SC and the Punjab and Haryana HC.In another case, the agency has allowed the sale and refund of Rs 185 crore worth of attached property of Jammu-based Surya Pharmaceuticals to SBI in a money laundering case against the company and its directors.","In a first, Enforcement Directorate went after a group of land grabbers in Chennai.

Must be ready for grey zone and hybrid warfare: Rajnath Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/must-be-ready-for-grey-zone-and-hybrid-warfare-rajnath-singh/articleshow/115232096.cms,"Defence minister Rajnath Singh

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh Tuesday said India needs to be prepared for adaptive defence and its strike forces should be ready for ‘grey zone’ and ‘hybrid’ warfare where traditional ways to defend have been challenged.Speaking at inaugural Delhi Defence Dialogue on the theme ‘Adaptive Defence: Navigating the Changing Landscape of Modern Warfare ’, organised by Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, Singh stressed on continuous adaptation by defence forces to deal with emerging challenges. The terms ‘grey zone’ and ‘hybrid warfare’ refer to conflicts between peace and full-scale military battles.From traditional border-related threats, the challenges have shifted to unconventional warfare such as terrorism , cyber attacks and hybrid warfare. “Govt recognised the need for an adaptive defence strategy in a changing geopolitical and technological scenario, and has taken several initiatives to build a robust and self-reliant ecosystem,” he said.This includes establishing the institution of Chief of Defence Staff , promoting jointness among the three services, improvising the training curriculum and forging new defence partnerships around the world, he added.Singh described ‘adaptive defence’ as not merely a strategic choice but a necessity. “As the threats to our nation have evolved, so too must our defence systems and strategies. We should be prepared for all future contingencies. It is more than just protecting our borders; it is about securing our future,” he said.He stressed the need for the nation’s military and defence mechanisms to continuously evolve to effectively counter emerging threats. “Adaptive defence is not merely responding to what has happened but anticipating what could happen, and preparing for it proactively. In essence, it involves cultivating a mindset and capability to adapt, innovate and thrive, even in the face of unpredictable and evolving circumstances,” he said.Singh said in the present age of digitisation and information overload, the world is facing an unprecedented scale of psychological warfare. There is a need for employing adaptive defence strategies to counter the menace of information warfare, he said.“India is aiming to become a drone hub of the world as drone and swarm technologies are bringing fundamental changes in modern warfare. We are working to improve R&D through reliable certification mechanisms, and facilitate Indian intellectual property creation in this sector,” he said.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh said India needs to be prepared for adaptive defence.

NEW DELHI: Any food item that is delivered online should have a minimum shelf life of 30% or 45 days before expiry at the time of delivery, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has said.For example, if a packet of butter has a shelf life of 10 days, it should have a minimum three days’ shelf life left when it is delivered to the customer by an e-commerce platform.In cases of food items that have longer shelf life, say three or six months, the FSSAI says, a minimum 45 days of shelf life should be there at the time of delivery of the item to the customer.The apex body for regulating food business in the country held a meeting of e-commerce food business operators on Tuesday where this mandate was highlighted and reiterated, sources said.“There have been complaints in the recent past that food items had negligible shelf life at the time of delivery. That’s why we have reiterated to the e-commerce Food Business Operators (FBOs) to adopt practices to ensure minimum shelf life of 30 percent or 45 days before expiry at the time of delivery to the consumer,” said an official.According to sources, Ganji Kamala V Rao, the CEO of FSSAI also cautioned the FBOs against making unsupported claims online in the meeting. He reiterated the mandate that no FBO can operate on any e-commerce platform without a valid FSSAI license or registration, emphasising the critical need for regulatory compliance.Further, Rao clarified that any product claims made on e-commerce platforms must align with the information provided on the product labels and in adherence to FSSAI’s Labelling and Display Regulations.Additionally, he emphasised the importance of delivering food items and non-food items separately to the consumers to avoid potential contamination.",The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has said food items delivered online should have a minimum shelf life of 30% or 45 days before expiry at the time of delivery.

'Neonatologists need to encourage breastfeeding in mission mode',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neonatologists-need-to-encourage-breastfeeding-in-mission-mode/articleshow/115226753.cms,"How many of the armed forces hospitals have been accredited as breastfeeding friendly?

How did you get interested in making armed forces’ hospitals breastfeeding friendly?

What is the role of neonatologists in protecting breastfeeding?

What extra investments and efforts are needed to make hospitals breastfeeding friendly?

Has the certifying of hospitals made a difference?

How can baby food companies’ efforts to influence doctors and health workers be tackled?

Although almost 90% of deliveries in India now happen in health facilities, only 42% of babies are breastfed within the first hour of birth, indicating poor support for breastfeeding in hospitals. Over 60% of child births happen in government facilities, but barely half a dozen government hospitals have been accredited as breastfeeding friendly despite the evidence that making hospitals breastfeeding friendly helps improve breastfeeding rates. However, all the armed forces hospitals providing maternal and child care are being accredited as Breastfeeding Friendly Hospitals through an initiative started by Lt Gen Daljit Singh, who recently retired from the post of the Director General of the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS). In an interview to TOI, he explained why this was an important initiative and how it has improved exclusive breastfeeding by changing practices in the hospitals.Of 150 peacetime hospitals, 110 have maternal and paediatric services with about 23,000-25,000 births annually. Sixteen have been accredited as breastfeeding friendly hospitals and eight are awaiting external evaluation to get certified. Over 70 hospitals under various zonal commands are at various stages of being accredited.I am a neonatologist, but my interest in the issue started in my undergraduate days when my thesis was on breastfeeding in low birthweight babies. My thesis showed that it is sufficient to exclusively breastfeed even low birthweight babies to ensure that they get adequate nutrition. After graduation, I was posted to the Command Hospital in Bangalore, which was certified as a breastfeeding friendly hospital in 1998. So, my initiation was in a place where I saw exclusive breastfeeding in practice, and I realised its importance early on. Though I have exited most service groups after retiring, I have remained a part of the breastfeeding friendly hospitals initiative (BFHI) group as it is an issue close to my heart. We have regular meetings to review our progress.When I specialised in neonatology, I found that when it came to pre-term babies or low birthweight, there was a bias among neonatologists towards giving them formula feeds. There was no confusion about full term babies as everyone knew breast milk was best for babies. But when it came to preterm babies, neonatologists felt that there were nutrients missing in breastmilk that formula could provide or that breastmilk was inadequate. The practice of keeping babies separate from the mother in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) would also lead to the mother producing less milk. To support the mother in lactation and to continue to support her till the baby comes out of the neonatal ICU, some initiative is required on the part of the neonatologists. Then came the fear of HIV, Hepatitis C infection and again neonatologists pushed to give preterm babies formula. You need neonatologists to be converted to breastfeeding. Without consistent effort on the part of neonatologists, babies lose out on their mothers’ milk and fall to formula feeding.You need to invest in two things—the assessment fee, about Rs 30,000 and in the training of lactation counsellors, Rs 20,000. It is not a lot of money but those heading a hospital will always ask where they would find the money for these. As the director general, I could reassure them that we had enough funds and make the funds available. We need to raise awareness and create a sense of mission in everyone involved— nurses posted in the delivery rooms and post-natal wards, the obstetricians and gynaecologists, who are the first point of contact for mothers when they come for antenatal check-ups, neonatologists and lactation counsellors.Once accredited, we have to submit data on various indicators of a breastfeeding friendly hospital every six months and that makes us collect data and track progress. After the accreditation of R&R Hospital, which is our biggest, skin-to-skin contact with mother and breastfeeding within the first hour of birth has been ensured for all babies born there. Similarly in the Command Hospital in Maharashtra, after being accredited and certified as breastfeeding friendly, initiation of breastfeeding within an hour of birth went up from 65% to 99.7% of babies delivered through C-section and from 97.7% to 100% for normal deliveries. Now, we are reviewing the progress of all accredited hospitals in helping mothers to achieve exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months.Company fellows come with free this and that. They are mostly multinational companies, and they will go to any length to sustain their business. You can keep them out only if it is done with a sense of mission among doctors, nurses and paramedics to ensure that no wrong practices are implemented. It is easier to enforce these in the armed forces as there are fewer vested interests and we don’t need company support to hold conferences. We also have strict rules on hospital entry and so we can easily restrict their entry.",Only 42% of babies are breastfed within the first hour of birth in India. Only half a dozen government hospitals have been accredited as breastfeeding friendly. All the armed forces hospitals providing maternal and child care are being accredited as Breastfeeding Friendly Hospitals.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115226755,imgsize-20642,width-400,resizemode-4/115226755.jpg"

Mike Waltz , a decorated combat veteran-turned-lawmaker and China hawk, who is also co-chair of the India caucus on the Hill and has proposed a formal alliance with India, will be Donald Trump's National Security Advisor. The US President-elect has also zeroed in on Florida senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State and South Dakota governor Kristi Noem as Secretary of Homeland Security in a sign that he will entrust policy making and execution to elected loyalists rather than the so-called ""deep state"" that is anathema to MAGA base.Trump has made no formal announcement except for posting that he intends to nominate Elise Stefanik, another lawmaker, as US Ambassador to the United Nations, but the MAGAsphere is rife with celebration about leaks from the President-elect's inner circle about hardliners being preferred over mainstream Republican establishment veterans who've long dominated policy in Washington DC.Waltz, 50, a former Green Beret who served multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, is particularly tough on China and Iran, with a strong counter-terrorism outlook, having served as CT czar to them US vice-president Dick Cheney -- a Trump bete-noire. Curiously, at a time Trump wanted to pull out of Afghanistan, he also opposed withdrawing troops without stringent conditions, among them, seeking a certification from the director of national intelligence that Taliban would not associate with Al Qaeda.More strikingly for New Delhi, Waltz is an ardent votary of a formal US-India alliance, about which India is wary, in keeping with the broad principle that ""it may be dangerous to be America's enemy, but to be America's friend is fatal."" In a 2021 op-ed he co-authored with Nikki Haley, Waltz called for prioritizing relationships that strengthen US standing in the world, saying, ""The place to start is India. It’s time to form an alliance.""""As a nuclear power with more than 1 million troops, a growing navy, a top-tier space program, and a proven history of economic and military cooperation with the United States, India would make a strong ally. An alliance with India would allow both countries to maintain and expand their global strength. And together with Japan and Australia, it would enable the United States to form a real deterrent to potential terrorist threats in Afghanistan as well as counter China,"" they wrote. Waltz is also co-chair of the Space Force caucus on the Hill.Making a strong case for an US-India alliance, Waltz and Haley pointed to India operating the Farkhor Air Base in Tajikistan, maintaining it the only air base with the proximity to conduct counterterrorism strikes in Afghanistan, and arguing that with an alliance, India could allow Washington to access to strategic bases to protect US interests in Afghanistan and the broader region.""We now only have one partner who can effectively keep a watchful eye on Afghanistan. It’s the same partner that can keep track of China’s southern flank: India.,"" they wrote, adding that "" US-India alliance would also give us an edge over China.""""Like the United States, India recognizes that China is a rapidly growing threat. Not only is it attempting to capitalize on our withdrawal from Afghanistan, which goes against both the United States and India’s interests, China is also pressuring India on its own borders,"" they said.The duo also warned that the growing collusion between China and Pakistan poses serious security risks for both India and the United States. ""For India, a US alliance would be a bulwark against a two-fronted conflict on its borders. For the United States, an alliance would help blunt Pakistan’s influence—a state sponsor of terrorism now propped up by Chinese investments—in Afghanistan. We need a new partner to prevent the creation of a terrorist super state that can attack our country again,"" they said.Beyond the strategic and military sphere, Waltz and Haley also cited economic imperatives -- some of which does not fit in with MAGA thinking --- in seeking and ""upgrade"" of the current partnership into a formal alliance. Arguing that the US and India also share economic concerns, including the need for a stable supply chain, they said India’s enormous workforce offers an opportunity for the US to alter its supply chain dependence on China.""We can rely on India as a major source of pharmaceuticals, technology, and critical minerals, supplementing our own domestic manufacturing capabilities,"" they wrote, despite hardline MAGA philosophy of isolationism and not trusting any country.Trump's prospective Secretary of State Marco Rubio is also a hardliner on China and a national security hawk whose belligerence will test Trump's inclination to cut deals -- and losses to the US military. Despite their past hardline stance on various national security issues, both Waltz and Rubio are expected to defer to the MAGA supremo in what will virtually be an imperial court in the White House starting January 20, 2025.","Mike Waltz, a decorated combat veteran-turned-lawmaker and China hawk, will be Donald Trump's National Security Advisor.

Trump’s stance on education

Elon Musk’s support

What would closing the department mean?

Project 2025’s education plan

Public opinion

US President-elect Donald Trump has long voiced his intention to close the US Department of Education , calling it inefficient and overly controlling.Trump’s plan, detailed in his Agenda47 and Project 2025 proposals, has drawn support from tech billionaire Elon Musk. However, experts and lawmakers caution that closing the department may face significant obstacles, particularly given its key role in funding education and managing student loans, as reported by Forbes.Trump has repeatedly criticised the Department of Education, which was established in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, calling it an example of unnecessary government control. ""We are absolutely at the bottom; we're one of the worst"" in education despite spending three times more than other nations, he claimed, referencing US education spending. He has also accused the department of harboring staff that ""in many cases, hate our children,"" and argued that state governments could manage education more effectively.In a video message last year, Trump said, ""We want states to run the education of our children, because they’ll do a much better job of it. You can’t do worse.""Trump’s campaign proposals also include controversial measures, such as cutting funding to schools that teach critical race theory or ""transgender insanity"" and credentialing teachers who support ""the American Way of Life."" These measures would fall outside federal jurisdiction if the Department of Education were shut down.Elon Musk, a prominent Trump donor, has voiced his support for the idea, calling it a ""good idea"" and sharing a meme about the department’s impact on US education. The meme featured a photo of Carter with the text: ""In 1979, I created the Department of Education. Since then, America went from 1st to 24th in education."" However, the accuracy of this claim is unclear, and supporting data remains unverified.While Musk’s support aligns with Trump’s agenda, the challenge of closing the department goes beyond public backing. Shutting down the Department of Education would require congressional approval, likely needing a supermajority of 60 votes in the Senate. Although Republicans regained control of the Senate in the midterm elections, they fall short of 60 votes, meaning bipartisan support would be needed for the measure to pass.The Department of Education is responsible for allocating federal education funds, which account for about 14% of total education funding in the US. These funds are essential for programs like Title I, which supports high-poverty schools, and the Office of Special Education Programs, which aids disabled students. The department also manages student loans, enforces civil rights in schools, and oversees various educational reforms. If it were closed, it’s unclear how these responsibilities would be managed.Trump has not yet addressed the fate of federal student loan programs or clarified how these crucial functions would be handled without the department.Under Project 2025, Trump’s vision includes reallocating the Education Department’s programs to other federal agencies. For example, civil rights enforcement would fall under the Department of Justice, while the student loan program would shift to a new division within the Treasury Department. The plan also proposes eliminating Title I funding, cutting the Head Start program, and rolling back protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools.An August survey from Pew Research found that 44% of Americans hold a favorable view of the Department of Education, though there are significant partisan divides. Only 27% of Republicans view it favorably, compared to 62% of Democrats. The department ranks 14th out of 16 federal agencies in popularity, with the National Park Service, US Postal Service, and NASA topping the list.","US President-elect Donald Trump has long voiced his intention to close the US Department of Education.

Suhas Subramanyam: 'I will support legislation to help legal immigrants on the path to citizenship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-will-support-legislation-to-help-legal-immigrants-on-the-path-to-citizenship-says-us-congressman-elect-suhas-subramanyam/articleshow/115225958.cms,"In the past years, several legislations addressing immigration reform have failed in the US Senate and the House of Representatives. Many had provisions that would address the problems faced by Indians stuck on long green card queues. Would you be supporting any new Bill in

that addresses these issues?

There are a lot of concerns in India over the possibility of tougher immigration rules under President Elect

. Do you think there are grounds for such concerns?

Are you in touch with the other Indian Americans in the House of Representatives – the Samosa Caucus?

You were technology advisor to President Barack Obama and you will now represent a district which is known as a tech hub; would you be participating in legislations and policy discussions on technology in the House of Representatives?

You have often spoken about your Indian American immigrant background, during your campaign – did you have many team members and aides of Indian origin?

After winning the election, you have pledged to work across the aisle. In view of the deep divide during the election campaign, do you feel that Democrat and Republican members of the House of Representatives will be able to resolve their differences and work together?

As you move to Congress, your district in Virginia will have elections for the position of state senator that you have vacated, and there are a couple of names of Indian Americans who will be running. Would you be endorsing any of the candidates?

After winning the election for the Virginia District 10 seat, with a comfortable margin, Suhas Subramanyam , 38, is set to become the first Indian American in the US House of Representatives from his state, when he is sworn-in on January 3, 2025. He also becomes the sixth member of the ‘Samosa Caucus;’ the informal name for the group of Indian American law makers – though personally he is more of an alu-gobi person, preferring a healthy comfort recipe to the deep fried ubiquitous Indian snack. The US Representative-elect spoke to Times of India’s Ishani Duttagupta on a host of issues including comprehensive immigration reforms that could end green card backlogs for Indians and working across the aisle to help mitigate the deep divide between Democrats and Republicans, stemming from the divisive presidential campaigns. Edited excerpts from the interview.I want to support legislation that will help legal immigrants here on the path to citizenship. A lot of people who come here, on H-1B visas especially, work in high demand fields like technology. They pay their taxes and contribute to our economy and then they are simply left behind and not given a path to citizenship. Many of them have complained to me that it’s easier to come into the US illegally and stay than to come legally. So I do want to make sure that we are talking about comprehensive immigration reform and we are talking about deportations and border security and we don’t forget people who have been so integral to our country and to our community here in Virginia.I think that the US-India relationship is a bipartisan effort in the sense of the US and India working together long term. It doesn’t matter who is the President here or leader there. I am going to be a champion for that relationship and I think that the Trump administration seems to be supportive of strengthening the US-India relationship as well. But I think that the thing to be concerned about is that this Presidency can and will be very unpredictable. President Trump has been very unpredictable in office as well as out of office and so we have to see how that translates to the US-India relationship. But there are other issues that I am concerned about with respect to the Trump Presidency – namely the environment and making sure we are producing clean renewable and energy and protecting our planet from climate change. I’m not sure what Trump’s foreign policy will be. He ran on a platform of no new wars and ending the current wars; I’m curious to see how he is going to do that. But I’m going to keep an open mind because I promised my constituents that I’ll work with everyone including the Republicans.Yes, the other Indian Americans in Congress have reached out to me. They have supported me and gave me great advice. Though I’m actually more of an ‘alu gobi’ and ‘bhel’ person; I’m happy with the Samosa Caucus and I want to continue its growth. I hope that our shared experiences will encourage others of Indian origin as well. When I worked on Capitol Hill, there were no members of Indian origin in Congress and it was very rare to even see an Indian American staff member like me. But we have come a long way it seems and it would be great to see more Indian Americans elected.Absolutely! I think tech policy is one of the issues that can be bipartisan and we’re going to have to address it. It’s a critical moment for tech policy and we need people who understand what they are doing from a business perspective and from a technology perspective when it comes to regulating these tools. Whether it is AI or block chain or cyber security, I want to make sure that my district has a voice in shaping technology policy so that we can promote innovation and regulate the bad behaviours.A lot of young Indian Americans reached out to my campaign to get involved. We especially liked younger people from high school and college getting engaged. It is good to get exposed to policy early on to help them get a sense of service in their mind. Many of them go on to volunteer or serve in different capacities. You don’t always have to run for office. I like to impart upon young people involved in our campaign that service is so important and you can do it in so many different ways. I made it a point to make sure that young people got involved in our campaign. And many of those young people were Indian American because of my candidacy.I’ve always thought that we are stronger when we are united as a country and I want to make sure that I deliver to my constituents. That is only going to happen by working with the Republicans. But I’m going to do everything I can to protect our economy here in Virginia; to protect the community and deliver to my constituents. I’m not going to be silent on things on which I disagree such as protecting federal workers in the Washington DC area, that includes my district in Virginia. That’s going to be critical and it’s something for which I’m going to fight. I’m not going to let them fire thousands of federal workers and replace them with their people and Trump loyalists. But generally I’m going to keep an open mind, work across the aisle and deliver to my constituency.I have endorsed State Delegate Kannan Srinivasan for the Democratic nomination for the state senate seat that I will be leaving when I join the House of Representatives. But that’s not because he is Indian but because he is going to make a great legislator and do really great things in the state senate. In the past, it used to be hard to find Indian Americans running for state and federal elections; but now there are many who want to step up. Some of them have told me that it is because of my success as the first Indian American in the House of Representatives, from my state, that they felt encouraged to run; they saw that someone like them could win. That is one of the impacts of winning and I’m happy to pave the way for others. I certainly don’t want to be the last Indian American in Congress from Virginia","Suhas Subramanyam, 38, is set to become the first Indian American in the US House of Representatives from his state, when he is sworn-in on January 3, 2025.

In comparison, Delhi's average AQI was worse at 321 (very poor to severe level) compared to Mumbai's 150.Delhi is considered one of the most polluted cities in the world, especially during winter, thanks to stubble burning. However, the toxicity in Mumbai's air is considered to be at a higher level due to the increasing concentration of toxic PM2.5 caused by automobiles, industries, construction activities and garbage burning.AQI is a concentration of toxic particulate matter PM2.5 or PM10 in the air, whichever is higher.Chembur resident Kavya Nayak said the smog was so thick on Tuesday morning that she couldn't view Eastern Express Highway from her 30-storey building.Amisha Sinha, a Malad resident, said many in her building visited doctors for air-borne infections.Kharghar residents complained of gases being released into the air from Taloja and surrounding industrial areas.In all, 17 out of 25 locations that were monitored on Tuesday showed non-satisfactory levels. Some of the suburbs that showed non-satisfactory levels of air quality on the higher side included BKC, Borivli East, Chembur, Vasai West, and Malad West.According to weather experts, a dip in temperature, low wind speed combined with moisture-laden air causes emissions and dust from automobile, industrial, and construction activities to remain suspended in the air instead of being blown away by the sea breeze. The particulate matter trapped in moisture gets warmer due to temperature and eventually makes climatic conditions warmer and sultry.While poor AQI may cause breathing discomfort to people on prolonged exposure and discomfort to people with heart disease with short exposure, the non-satisfactory levels can cause breathing discomfort to people with lung disease such as asthma, heart disease, and children and older adults.","Mumbai's air quality index (AQI) started dipping again to non-satisfactory levels from Monday night.

Kristi Noem Admits to Killing Her Dog Cricket Amidst Trump’s Secretary of Homeland Security Appointment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-kristi-noem-dog-cricket/articleshow/115221775.cms,"Kristi Noem with Donald Trump

President-elect Donald Trump has selected South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as his incoming Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, according to two people familiar with the choice.Noem's appointment signals Trump’s commitment to following through on his immigration pledges. Alongside Noem, key immigration hardliners Stephen Miller and Tom Homan are set to take on senior roles, reflecting the administration’s focus on a strict immigration policy . Trump’s choice ensures that a loyal supporter will head DHS , an agency central to his domestic agenda.During Trump’s previous administration, DHS faced significant upheaval, with five different leaders, only two of whom were Senate-confirmed. As the head of this vast department, Noem will manage a $60 billion budget and lead hundreds of thousands of employees. DHS oversees US Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the US Secret Service.Noem’s political journey has been closely tied to Trump. She was previously a top candidate for his vice president, although her relationship with Trump cooled after the fallout from her book No Going Back: The Truth on What’s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward. In it, Noem recounted a story of putting down her 14-month-old wirehair pointer, Cricket, after the dog failed to show hunting promise, sparking backlash. Noem described Cricket as “untrainable” and recalled that the experience was intended to illustrate her readiness to tackle difficult tasks.While some criticised Noem’s account, drawing comparisons to past controversies involving politicians and pets, she defended her choice as an example of making “tough, necessary decisions.” The dog had caused multiple issues on hunting trips and had even killed chickens. Noem’s account didn’t end there, as she also described putting down a family goat in a similarly direct manner, underscoring her commitment to decisive action in challenging situations.Following the book's publication, reaction to Noem’s accounts of animal euthanasia has been mixed, with some detractors calling her “deliberately cruel.” Others in the hunting community expressed disgust at her actions, especially when it came to handling Cricket’s training and eventual fate. Noem, however, responded by saying, “Tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm,” mentioning she had recently had to put down three horses that had been with her family for over two decades.","Donald Trump has selected South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as his incoming Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

Beyond the field, Kelce has expanded his wealth through lucrative TV commercials, shows, and his popular podcast ""New Heights,"" co-hosted with his brother Jason Kelce. Industry experts believe the podcast could be worth over $100 million, giving Kelce more than enough funds to indulge in high-end upgrades for his 17,000-square-foot Leawood home.The latest addition to Kelce’s property is a massive underground man cave , which is being designed as part of the growing trend of ""iceberg houses."" This trend is gaining traction among celebrities who opt to build more of their homes below ground. The concept allows for expansive, hidden living spaces while maintaining a sleek, low-profile exterior. Kelce’s man cave, set to feature a state-of-the-art golf simulator, is just one example of the unique amenities being added to his mansion.Kelce’s property, nestled in a secluded cul-de-sac on a 3.5-acre lot, already includes an impressive array of features. These include a two-level movie theater, a wine cellar, a club room with a bar, and an expansive outdoor area with a pool, hot tub, and waterfall. For those who enjoy fitness and sports, the estate also boasts a gym, sauna, tennis/pickleball court, and even a miniature golf course. The addition of the underground golf simulator is expected to elevate the mansion’s recreational offerings to new heights.While Taylor Swift ’s involvement in the man cave project has not been confirmed, fans speculate that she may enjoy the space alongside Kelce’s teammates and friends. Given Kelce’s penchant for golf, it’s likely that his social circle will frequently gather at the new underground retreat.While some real estate experts caution about the financial risks of building iceberg homes, Kelce’s financial standing and personal connections, including his relationship with Swift, make such investments a feasible luxury.

KOCHI: The recently concluded Kerala State Schools' Sports Meet was held with much hype as the govt claimed it was modelled on the lines of the Olympics. Unfortunately, the performance on the ground from Kerala's next generation of athletes did not match the hype and left much to be desired.While the performance of many athletes showed declining standards, what was more concerning was the distinct lack of competition witnessed in many events.India's leading long jumper, Ancy Sojan, was bitterly disappointed with the standard of competition in her event, which included her sister, Anjali ES, as a participant. Akhila Mol K from GV Raja Sports School , Thiruvananthapuram, secured gold in the senior girls' long jump event by leaping to 5.54m, but the mark was significantly lower than Ancy's 2019 record of 6.24m.""I'm not at all happy with what I witnessed. I think the current crop of athletes lacks dedication and effort. They might be looking at short-term goals, and their coaches are also failing to inspire them,"" she said.And it wasn't just in long jump. The KC Throws Academy in Cheruvathoor, Kasaragod, dominated the throw events, bagging 10 medals, including six gold. ""I consider myself as my rival when I come for the meet because there is no serious challenger,"" said KC Servan, who bettered his own state records in discus throw and shot put. ""I know many of my fellow competitors, who showed good progress in the initial stages but dropped out from athletics due to disciplinary issues,"" he added.The track events also showed similar concerns. Only M Jyothika of HS Parli and Muhammed Ashfaq of GV Raja Sports Schools demonstrated promise in the senior 400m. ""If Jyothika stays focused and works hard, she will do well in 400m. But she will have to look beyond Kerala if she is looking for better competition. She clocked 56.81 here, but she is much better than this,"" said Jyothika's coach, PG Manoj.Ashfaq, on the other hand, set a meet record in 400m, clocking 47.65 seconds. Second-placed Jasim J Rassac of Mar Basil HSS, Kothamangalam, could only manage a time of 48.23. Ashfaq clocked 52.82 for gold in the 400m hurdles, with Vijay C of VMHS, Vadavannur, finishing a distant second with a time of 54.26.AFI joint secretary, PI Babu, attributed the falling standards of upcoming athletes to the indifferent attitude of students and parents and did not want to pin the blame on coaches. ""Most of them come here for grace marks. Sports is nowadays treated just like NCC, NSS, or student police wing. And worse, many of these athletes drop out from sports after their school days,"" said Babu. ""The number of students who take up sports seriously in college is also coming down,"" Babu lamented, citing a worrisome trend.""Above 90 percent of the schools do not have a proper playground. Then how do they indulge in sports activities? There are only a very few PE teachers in our schools, and those who are there, their primary job is to maintain the discipline of the schools. Then how can we expect the standard of sports to go up?"" he asked.","The recently concluded Kerala State Schools' Sports Meet was held with much hype as the govt claimed it was modelled on the lines of the Olympics.

Trump’s 'Manhattan Project' of government reform: Musk and Ramaswamy to lead efficiency crusade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-manhattan-project-of-government-reform-musk-and-ramaswamy-to-lead-efficiency-crusade/articleshow/115236359.cms,"The 'Manhattan Project' parallel

Navigating the challenges

The DOGE Directive: Redefining efficiency

A moment of reinvention

In a move described by President-elect Donald Trump as “potentially 'The Manhattan Project ' of our time,” the soon-to-be President has appointed Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency , or DOGE . The acronym, a playful nod to Musk’s affinity for the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, underscores the duo’s mission: dismantling bureaucracy, slashing excessive regulations, and transforming the vast apparatus of federal governance into a streamlined model of efficiency.The choice of leaders, both prominent figures in the private sector, reflects Trump’s long-standing ambition to draw on the expertise of outsiders to enact deep, systemic reforms. Tesla CEO Musk, known for his innovation in electric vehicles and space exploration, joins Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur turned political firebrand, to embark on this ambitious undertaking. Their combined vision is expected to resonate far beyond Washington, introducing an “entrepreneurial approach” never before seen in government circles.Musk, the world's wealthiest person, emerged as a crucial ally to Trump during the campaign, reportedly contributing over $100 million to support the Republican's bid and frequently promoting Trump's candidacy on X, the social media platform he owns.During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy, 39, was notably hesitant to criticize Trump, instead aligning himself closely with the Republican leader and championing many of the same policies, such as reducing the size of the federal government and reevaluating the country’s foreign alliances. Although Trump ruled out Ramaswamy as a potential running mate, he expressed an early interest in considering him for a Cabinet role, noting during an October campaign rally, “We can put him in charge of one of these big monsters, and he’ll do a better job than anybody you can think of.”Read more: Trump says Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy will lead department of government efficiency Trump’s characterization of DOGE as the “Manhattan Project” evokes one of the most significant endeavors of the 20th century: the clandestine World War II initiative that developed the atomic bomb. The original Manhattan Project was marked by its blend of military urgency, scientific ingenuity, and sweeping collaboration among the brightest minds of its era. It changed the course of global conflict and demonstrated the profound capabilities of American innovation when pushed to the limit.In the context of Trump’s announcement, the comparison speaks to the scale and transformative potential he envisions for government reform. Just as the original project redefined power on the global stage, DOGE aspires to redefine the US government's relationship with its citizens by eliminating inefficiencies and fostering a more responsive, accountable administration. Whether the audacious vision of Musk and Ramaswamy will match the historical weight of its namesake remains an open question, but the ambition is unmistakable.Despite its lofty goals, the path for DOGE is uncharted and fraught with regulatory and ethical considerations. Unlike official government agencies, the external advisory nature of DOGE could potentially sidestep typical disclosure requirements. Both Musk and Ramaswamy’s positions, operating outside the formal government employment structure, exempt them from divesting holdings or facing the same transparency obligations as federal employees. This raises questions about how DOGE will balance influence with accountability in its pursuit of governmental “shockwaves.”Trump’s directive sets a clear deadline: July 4, 2026. The symbolic timeline coincides with the nation’s 250th anniversary, positioning DOGE’s success as a patriotic milestone. The duo’s work will be aligned with the Office of Management and Budget, leveraging private-sector expertise to seek out inefficiencies in the $6.5 trillion annual federal spending. As Musk once boldly claimed he could uncover over $2 trillion in savings, the stakes and expectations for the new department are monumental.DOGE’s implementation strategy, its impact on existing agencies, and its reception by career bureaucrats will be closely watched. Skeptics point out that prior reform efforts have struggled against entrenched interests and systemic inertia, but proponents argue that DOGE’s external structure may enable it to bypass traditional roadblocks.Whether DOGE can replicate the transformative spirit of its World War II namesake, the Manhattan Project, remains to be seen. Yet in its essence, this initiative represents Trump’s ambition to leverage the icons of innovation and disruptive thinking to reshape governance itself. As July 2026 looms, Musk and Ramaswamy’s performance will be judged not just by the reforms they propose but by their ability to deliver a government that embodies Trump’s vision of “We the People” in efficiency and accountability.(With inputs from agencies)","President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.
