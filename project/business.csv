"DGCA allows HIV+ commercial pilot to fly, but with riders. Will challenge order, he says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-allows-hiv-commercial-pilot-to-fly-but-with-riders-will-challenge-order-he-says/articleshow/119186293.cms,"MUMBAI: A US-trained commercial pilot with HIV on Tuesday told the Bombay HC that Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)'s certification deeming him fit to fly as a commander but only with a more experienced pilot beside him was ""discriminatory."" He now plans to file a fresh petition challenging the rider on his licence only because of his HIV status.""If the petitioner has any grievance of the subsequent developments and the fresh certification... it is for the petitioner to challenge the same as may be permitted in law,"" said Justices Girish Kulkarni and Advait Sethna.The pilot filed the petition last year through his father. In July 2021, a medical test deemed him fit to serve as a pilot in command. He had cleared DGCA exams to become a civil commercial pilot. In Oct 2021, he was informed of the HIV diagnosis and issued a 'temporary unfit for flying' medical certificate. In Dec 2021, DGCA informed him he was 'permanently unfit for flying' as a pilot in command. On appeal, in May 2022, DGCA deemed him 'fit for flying as (co-pilot) only.' Thereafter, he left for the US.DGCA's Dec 18 reply said the petitioner is on anti-retroviral therapy (ART), including medicines which have several adverse effects. It cited the International Civil Aviation Organisation's Manual of Civil Aviation Medicine on the risk of progression of the disease after commencing ART. ""Considering repercussions of disease progress, unpredictable side effects of ART, and frequent monitoring constraints, an aeromedical disposition is made declaring him fit to fly as pilot in command with qualified experienced pilot,"" it stated.DGCA's advocate Piyush Shah said the petitioner applied for medical certificate and ""in respect of that we have allowed him as pilot in command"" rostered along with a more experienced pilot. The pilot's advocates, Bhoomika Vyas and Sangram Chinappa, said if he required a pilot with more flying hours to be alongside, no one would hire him. ""This would render him unemployable,"" said Vyas, adding, ""similarly placed persons, who do not have HIV"" face no such rider on their licence.To the judges' query, Vyas said her client has now returned from the US. The judges said the petitioner's grievance that the DGCA was not considering him because of his status as an HIV+ person ""in our opinion, would stand redressed."" For any other grievance, he must file a fresh petition ""making out a case.""","The pilot filed the petition last year through his father.

Open to ‘fair debate’ on Lokpal jurisdiction over HC judges: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/open-to-fair-debate-on-lokpal-jurisdiction-over-hc-judges-supreme-court/articleshow/119186054.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday created space for a “fair debate” on the contentious issue of anti-corruption watchdog Lokpal assuming jurisdiction to inquire into allegations of taint against high court judges even though the apex court had formed a prima facie view that this would be “dangerous” for independence of constitutional courts.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta protested strongly against Lokpal assuming jurisdiction over high court judges and told a bench of Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant and A S Oka that the Jan 27 order of the full bench led by Lokpal A M Khanwilkar, attempting to assume inquiry jurisdiction over HC judges, went against the procedure established through SC judgments for dealing with complaints against con stitutional court judges.The bench agreed and said the field was already occupied and a mechanism was in place to deal with complaints against SC and HC judges. Mehta said the Supreme Court should examine only Section 14(1)(f) of Lokpal Act, which formed the basis for Lokpal’s Jan 27 order.Supreme Court Bar Association president and senior advocate Kapil Sibal said the SC, in its 1991 judgment in the Veeraswami case, had made it mandatory to obtain the CJI’s consent before initiation of proceedings against a constitutional court judge. “The law must be clarified to ensure that complaints of this nature (corruption and misuse of office) are forwarded only to the CJI and not to any other authority,” he said.Lokpal’s order had come on a complaint filed by a person accusing an HC judge of influencing an additional district judge and another HC judge who were hearing suits filed by the complainant against a private company.However, Sibal said there was a wider issue involved. “What happens if a person goes to a police station and wants to file an FIR (for a criminal act allegedly committed by an HC judge)? The fundamental issue is whether a complaint can be filed against SC and HC judges outside the mechanism provided under the Constitution and the additions made through SC rulings. The court may have to examine this issue in this case,” he said.The SG said whether a person could go to a police station to lodge an FIR did not fall within the ambit and scope of the issue arising from Lokpal’s Jan 27 order. The procedure for lodging a complaint against a constitutional court judge was provided in the Veeraswami judgment, he said.The bench agreed and said it would examine the issues relating to Lokpal’s jurisdiction to entertain complaints against HC judges. Justice Kant said the proceedings should not appear one-sided and added that there should be an amicus to present the contrary view for a fair debate on the issue. In its order, Lokpal had clarified that it did not have jurisdiction over SC judges. The bench appointed senior advocate Ranjit Kumar as amicus and posted hearing on the matter to April 15.","Supreme Court created space for a ‘fair debate’ on the contentious issue of anti-corruption watchdog Lokpal assuming jurisdiction to inquire into allegations of taint against high court judges.

CBI must investigate builder-bank nexus: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cbi-must-investigate-builder-bank-nexus-supreme-court/articleshow/119185877.cms,"Submit builder-bank nexus probe blueprint in 2 weeks: SC to CBI





NEW DELHI: Taking strong exception to real estate firms and banks making “homebuyers cry” by not completing projects on time and forcing them to pay EMIs, SC on Tuesday said a CBI probe was needed to unearth the nexus between them and sought a proposal from the agency on how it intends to conduct the investigation, which could bring many realtors under the scanner.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said the builderbank nexus had created havoc, leaving lakhs of homebuyers suffering and it was ultimately Supreme Court which was coming to their rescue. It said SC was dealing with multiple cases of homebuyers of different projects on a daily basis, and it was not the court’s job.“We will definitely have a CBI probe. That is clear. Thousands of people are crying. We can’t wipe their tears but we can address their issues. Something very effective has to be done in a time-bound manner,” the bench said. It asked CBI to come up with a proposal in two weeks on how to conduct the probe — whether project-wise or area-wise.Considering that the proposed probe against builders and banks would be a huge exercise, bringing virtually the entire real estate sector under the lens, the bench sought the assistance of former Intelligence Bureau chief Rajiv Jain. Court appointed the 1980-batch IPS officer, who is now practising law, as amicus curiae and asked him to file a note on how to proceed in the case.The court was hearing petitions filed by thousands of homebuyers who had booked flats under subvention plans in various housing projects in NCR and alleged that they were being forced by banks to pay EMIs despite not getting possession of their flats because of inordinate delay by developers. Under the subvention scheme, banks disburse the sanctioned amount directly to the accounts of builders, who pay EMIs on the amount till flats are handed over to homebuyers. As builders started defaulting in paying EMIs as per the tripartite agreement, banks initiated action against homebuyers to recover the payments.Realising the fallout of a CBI probe, some financial institutions urged the court not to bring the agency into the picture as it would create instability and requested that RBI be asked to look into the matter. Senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Ranjit Kumar, appearing for financial institutions, urged the court not to paint all banks with the same brush and said their clients had already placed all information before the bench as sought by it.Singhvi said if a particular builder became insolvent, then the fault did not lie with banks. But the bench questioned how a bank could release money to a builder despite knowing that not a brick was laid at the site.The court made it clear that “no one will be spared” but those who acted fairly should not be afraid of the impending investigation.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appear ing for CBI, said at the outset that the agency would take the case if the court directed and suggested that the probe could start with investigation into any project in Greater Noida. The court, however, asked the agency to come back with a detailed proposal.SC decided to take stern action after very few builders and banks complied with its order to give details of their projects and loans sanctioned. Out of roughly 40 builders and 30 banks/financial institutions which are party in the proceedings, only nine banks and five builders filed their compliance affidavits. “This blatant disregard and ignorance of the court’s directions, coupled with their reluctance in appropriately assisting the court, hints to wards a possible collusion between builders-cum-developers and banks/financial institutions,” the bench said.The bench had directed the petitioners, builders and banks to furnish the following information regarding different projects — (i) The status and details of payments made by builders to banks or payments by homebuyers to banks/ builders, (ii) The date of offering possession where the project is stated to have been completed, (iii) The current status of completion of the project, (iv) The status of recovery from homebuyers, (v) The amenities advertised by builders at the time of launching projects and the status regarding completion thereof, (vi) The status as to whether the builder-cum-developers had undergone CIRP (under IBC) or any other coercive or non-coercive recovery procedure, and the stage of such proceedings, (vii) Whether homebuyers received any relief from statutory authorities like RERA. If so, the details of such orders were to be furnished.SC had in July last year protected homebuyers and directed that no coercive action be taken against them by banks or builders regarding payment of EMIs and no complaint shall be entertained against them for cheque bounce cases.The aggrieved homebuyers said they were victims of illegal disbursal of loans by banks directly into the account of builders in violation of RBI guidelines, which are statutory in nature.“This is a classic case where one rich man (bank/financial institution) gave money to another rich man (builder). The rich man who received the money (builder) ran away with it without fulfilling his obligations. The rich man who gave the money (bank/financial institution) disbursed it in violation of the law of the land. The poor man (homebuyer) is now made a victim and is pushed into litigation by the bank when he has not received a single rupee. And is deprived of his dream home,” one of the petitions said.","Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said the builderbank nexus had created havoc, leaving lakhs of homebuyers suffering. It asked CBI to come up with a proposal in two weeks on how to conduct the probe — whether project-wise or area-wise.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119185867,imgsize-1015725,width-400,resizemode-4/119185867.jpg"
"ED searches Bengaluru offices of Soros’s foundation, and entities linked to it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-searches-bengaluru-offices-of-soross-foundation-and-entities-linked-to-it/articleshow/119185811.cms,"ED action coincides with heat Soros is facing back home

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday conducted extensive searches on Open Society Foundations (OSF), promoted by US billionaire currency speculator and hedge fund operator George Soros who has been accused by BJP of acting against India’s interests.The raids in Bengaluru at OSF and linked entities were the fallout of an inquiry into FDI sourced by OSF in violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act guidelines.Sources said Open Society Institute, US, has been put under prior reference category (PRC) by the home mini stry since 2016 due to allegedly undesirable activities. So, OSI is required to secure prior sanction from the ministry to send funds to FCRA-registered organisations in India.Sources said investigation found Soros Economic Development Fund (SEDF), OSI’s social impact investment arm, provided funds to 3 Indian companies — Rootbridge Services Pvt Ltd (RSPL), Rootbridge Academy Pvt Ltd (RAPL), and ASAR Social Impact Advisors Pvt Ltd (ASAR). These companies received approximately Rs 25 crore from SEDF between 2020-21 and 2023-24.SEDF funds to RSPL were through compulsorily convertible preference shares. However, since SEDF could not make foreign donations directly to Indian NGOs without MHA approval, the George Soros-funded entity explored alternative options to bypass PRC restrictions. FDI in RSPL is suspected to be a colourable arrangement violating FDI norms, officials said.“RAPL, incorporated in 2019, received Rs 2.7 crore from SEDF as commission agent services without rendering any services. This suggests RAPL acted as an agent for SEDF to bypass FCRA provisions for funding NGOs in India,” a source said.ASAR, incorporated in 2016, received Rs 2.9 crore from SEDF as ‘service fees’. The investigators, however, are not convinced and suspect the funds to be donations in disguise, meant for NGOs in lieu of services which were, in fact, never rendered to SEDF.OSI group also set up an investment company, Aspada Investment Company (AIC), in Mauritius to channelise funding to India.Aspada Investment Advisors Pvt Ltd was established in Bengaluru to manage SEDF’s investments in India. However, the body, now Lightrock Investment Advisors Private Limited, was not in the loop about Rs 300 crore SEDF provided to 12 NGOs.ED action coincides with the heat Soros has been facing back home in the US after the election of Donald Trump as President. The hedge fund operator had aligned with hardline liberals and openly opposed Trump.","The raids in Bengaluru at OSF and linked entities were the fallout of an inquiry into FDI sourced by OSF in violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act guidelines.

"Avoid travel outside US, immigration attorneys tell H-1B, F-1 visa holders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/avoid-travel-outside-us-immigration-attorneys-tell-h-1b-f-1-visa-holders/articleshow/119135563.cms,"'Visa holders must've contingency plans'

Be it H-1B visa holders and their kin, or international students, or even green card holders, US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas. India is not on the proposed travel ban list by the US, but still the fear remains.On Monday, TOI reported on similar advice being given to Green Card holders. The reasons range from delays in stamping at US consulates in home country, extreme vetting and cases of secondary inspection, including detention at US airports on return.Kripa Upadhyay, an immigration attorney in Seattle, said, ""This sounds heartless but foreigners (especially those needing to renew H-1B or F-1 visas) must think twice about leaving US right now.""The US department of state has updated eligibility requirements for interview waiver appointments (referred to as dropbox appointments). Earlier, applicants could qualify for interview waiver if they had been issued a non-immigrant visa in any category (except B visitor visas) and were applying within 48 months of expiration. Under revised rules, dropbox is available only to applicants renewing a visa in the same non-immigrant category that has expired within past 12 months. Thus, if you are an international student with an F-1 visa and now need an H-1B you must wait for an interview slot. If you have an H-1B and need an extension, but your earlier visa was issued more than 12 months ago, you must also wait for an interview slot, Upadhyay said.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, said, ""Delays due to visa appointment availability is only part of the concern. We know of individuals stuck in administrative processing for no apparent reason other than additional scrutiny and security clearances. This should not have happened if the individual had been previously approved for a visa multiple times. I think we can expect to see 'extreme vetting' similar to the tenure of the earlier Trump administration.""Also read: Fearing deportation, a Cornell university grad student files a pre-emptive lawsuit If US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has approved an H-1B, the consular officer has the right to refuse the visa and send the application back to USCIS for re-adjudication.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday has acknowledged that his initial criticism of India’s stance on the Russia-Ukraine war has left him with ""egg on his face."" Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue in Delhi, Tharoor admitted that India's neutral policy has positioned it as a key player in fostering lasting peace and has a Prime Minister ""who can hug both the president of Ukraine and the president in Moscow"".Tharoor, who had previously called for India to condemn Russia’s aggression, said during a session, ""I am still wiping the egg off my face because I was one of the few in Parliament who criticised India’s position in February 2022.""The Thiruvananthapuram MP explained that his criticism was based on the violation of the UN Charter and Ukraine’s sovereignty. However, three years later, he now recognises that India’s balanced approach has allowed Prime Minister Narendra Modi to engage with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky within weeks of each other.""All of those principles had been violated by one party and we should have condemned it. Well, three years later it does look like I am the one with the egg on my face because clearly the policy has meant that India has actually a prime minister who can hug both the president of Ukraine (Zelenskyy) and the president in Moscow (Putin) two weeks apart and be accepted in both places,"" he said according to news agency PTI.With the caveat that he was speaking in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the government as he is in the opposition, Tharoor suggested that India might be open to sending peacekeepers if there was an agreed peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine.He noted that Russia has ruled out NATO peacekeepers, making non-European forces more viable. ""As an Indian parliamentarian, I don’t think there would be strong resistance to the idea,"" he said, citing India's extensive history in peacekeeping missions.Tharoor recalled how, in 2003, India’s Parliament firmly rejected sending troops to Iraq after the US-led invasion. However, he stated, “I don’t see that happening for Ukraine.”India has participated in over 49 UN peacekeeping missions, reinforcing its long-standing commitment to global stability.","Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has acknowledged that his initial criticism of India’s stance on the Russia-Ukraine war has left him with ""egg on his face"" The Thiruvananthapuram MP said India's neutral policy has positioned it as a key player in fostering lasting peace.

How flights will move from Mumbai to Navi Mumbai Airport & options for demolishing CSMIA T1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-flights-will-move-from-mumbai-to-navi-mumbai-airport-options-for-demolishing-csmia-t1/articleshow/119169626.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: Some flights of all big Indian carriers like Air India Group and IndiGo are likely to be shifted in the same ratio from Mumbai’s Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) when the latter gets operational later this summer. Foreign carriers with a few flights will operate fully from either of these two airports.The Adani Group is also weighing options for the demolition of T1 — whether to bring down the entire structure in one go this winter or do it piecemeal. T1 comprises of T1A, B and C buildings which were built over last 50 years with 1B being constructed in 1965; 1A in 1992 and 1C in 2010.“We are in talks with all airlines. As far as Indian carriers are concerned, the plan is to shift equal percentage of flights by them from CSMIA to NMIA. Foreign airlines with few flights will not like to split operations and will continue to operate from one hub only in Mumbai MMR. Some foreign airlines want to move fully to NMIA,” said people in the know. Air India has about 140 daily flights to and from CSMIA; Akasa 57 and AI Express about 15. IndiGo, the biggest Indian carrier in market share terms, did not give this figure.“We are weighing the option of either starting NMIA operations with domestic flights. In that case, domestic flights will be shifted first. Or we could start both domestic and international simultaneously, in which case both will be shifted,” said sources.The rate of shifting flights will also depend on how fast T2 capacity grows from 4 crore passengers annually (CPA) to 4.5 CPA and whether T1 goes down in one go or in phases — basically the capacity of CSMIA. “The existing T1 handles 1.5 CPA. T1 demolition will start 4-5 months after NMIA gets operational, which means by this Nov or Dec. We hope to increase T2 capacity by mid 2026. These decisions will be taken shortly,” they said.Airlines also want clarity on these issues. The reason: They are selling tickets for flights, some of which will get shifted. “Once we inform passengers that their flight, for say July/Aug, has been moved to NMIA, we don’t know whether it suits them or not. To minimise this, we need clarity at the earliest. We don’t have same issues with whenever Noida Airport opens as we are not selling tickets for there yet,” said a senior airline official.Meanwhile, Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) is also in talks with aviation authorities to lift the cap on hourly flight movements. This was done to ease the severe congestion seen perennially at CSMIA. The aviation ministry had two years back directed MIAL to reduce their flight operations from 46 to 44 per hour during ""high intensity runway operations” (HIRO) periods from 8-11 am and 5-8 pm and from 44 to 42 aircraft movement per hour during non-HIRO period.“We are confident of handling more flights without affecting time performance, at least from our side as an airport. MIAL has been in talks with authorities to lift that cap. We are in process of increasing CSMIA runway capacity. Gatwick, the world’s busiest single runway airport handles 54-55 flights an hour,” sources added.",Some flights of all big Indian carriers like Air India Group and IndiGo are likely to be shifted to Navi Mumbai International Airport.

SRINAGAR: Chief minister Omar Abdullah fretted Tuesday about “discrimination” in distribution of assets after the 2019 bifurcation of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state into Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh .Lawmakers of Omar’s National Conference (NC) members argue that J&K UT has been given far less assets in Delhi, Chandigarh and other regions. But Omar, speaking in the assembly, vowed to take a reconciliatory route to resolve the issue.“Five years ago, J&K and Ladakh got separated. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were separated long ago (2014) but they are still engaged in disputes over assets in courts, spending huge amounts of money,” Omar said while responding to a question.The CM made it clear his govt would not go down the Andhra-Telangana path. “We want to resolve asset issues with Ladakh through consensus and through give and take,” Omar said. He acknowledged such a reconciliatory approach might be criticised in J&K and Ladakh but insisted it was the only way to solve it.After the abrogation of Article 370, assets between J&K and Ladakh were apportioned on the recommendations of an advisory committee constituted by the Centre under J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019.A key sticking point has been liabilities of the erstwhile state amounting to Rs 2,504.46 crore and how it should be shared between UTs of Ladakh and J&K. Omar’s govt has taken up the matter with the Union home ministry and Ladakh administration.About properties of the erstwhile state in Delhi, Omar said J&K got far less than Ladakh. “We are working on settling the issue. We have acquired land in Dwarka, where we plan to construct a new J&K Bhawan,” he said.According to the CM, J&K House on Delhi’s Prithviraj Road has vacant land and a new building will be constructed there for visiting MLAs. In Chandigarh, Omar pointed out that the govt already owns a building that will be modified to provide proper accommodation for J&K patients travelling to the city’s PGIMER.","Omar Abdullah fretted about ‘discrimination’ in distribution of assets after the 2019 bifurcation of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state.

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday asked the Netherlands to not provide arms, weapon systems, platforms and military technologies to Pakistan, which has sponsored cross-border terrorism for decades, in a meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his counterpart Ruben Brekelmans.In the delegation-level meet, India and the Netherlands decided to elevate their bilateral ties in areas like defence, security, information exchanges, maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, and new and emerging technologies like AI and drones .The clear takeaway, however, was Singh telling Brekelmans that “equipping” Pakistan with defence equipment and technologies “undermines regional security and stability” in South Asia, sources told TOI.“Singh said India has been fighting Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in J&K and elsewhere for decades. India tells all friendly countries that they should not arm Pakistan in any way due to its state policy of fueling terrorism in other countries,” a source added.The Netherlands, for instance, has supplied two Alkmaar-class mine countermeasures vessels or mine-hunters, which were built at the Van der Giessen-de Noord shipyard in Alblasserdam.Similarly, the country is also providing 1,900-tonne multi-role offshore patrol vessels from the Damen Shipyards to Pakistan. “Several Dutch companies are interacting with Pakistan in the military arena, especially in the naval domain,” another source said.India has upped the ante against terrorism and Sikh separatism in recent diplomatic meetings, with PM Modi on Monday seeking continuing cooperation from his New Zealand counterpart Christopher Luxon to rein in pro-Khalistani separatists in his country.Parallelly, Singh also told US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that the Trump administration should designate Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which is banned in India for promoting secessionist and pro-Khalistani activities, as a foreign terrorist organization, as was reported by TOI.In the India-Netherlands meet on Tuesday, the two sides also explored the possibilities of collaboration in shipbuilding, equipment and space sectors, “optimizing the complementariness in skills, technology and scale of the two countries”.“They also discussed working together in domains like AI and related technologies, besides connecting the defence technology research institutes and organizations of the two countries,” a defence ministry official said.With India developing a “vibrant innovation and industrial ecosystem”, New Delhi also said Dutch armament companies should be encouraged to integrate Indian vendors into their supply chains.Singh said he was “delighted to meet the young and dynamic defence minister of the Netherlands, and the two reviewed the full range of bilateral defence cooperation. “We look forward to further deepening and elevating our defence partnership,” he said.","India and the Netherlands decided to elevate their bilateral ties in areas like defence, security, information exchanges, maritime cooperation in the Indo- Pacific.

NEW DELHI: India and China should be partners contributing to each other's success and a cooperative ""pas de deux"" between the dragon and the elephant is the only right choice for the two countries, Beijing said while welcoming PM Modi's ""positive"" remarks in a podcast in which he had endorsed signs of a rapprochement in ties since Oct last year.In the interaction with Lex Fridman, Modi had also strongly backed Donald Trump's policies and the US president even shared the podcast on his social media platform, Truth Social.Modi had said on Sunday that the border situation with China was normalising since his meeting with President Xi Jinping in Kazan in Oct and trust would return in the relationship ""slowly but surely"". Seeking a cooperative relationship, he also said it was natural for India and China to have differences, and the focus should be on ensuring that these don't turn into disputes.Building upon PM Modi's remarks, the Chinese foreign ministry said that Sino-Indian ties were characterised by mutual learning and friendly exchanges for over 2,000 years."" China appreciated PM Modi's recent positive statements.

New Delhi : Online platform X, earlier known as Twitter, told Delhi HC Tuesday that it has its own system of sharing information with law enforcement agencies in cases of cybercrime , declining to come on board the Centre’s flagship “Sahyog” portal, reports Abhinav Garg.A special bench of Justices Prathiba M Singh and Amit Sharma recorded the stand of X that the platform cannot be “compelled” to join the central govt’sDelhi HC noted that only X remained unwilling to join Sahyog, while 38 other intermediaries have “onboarded” the portal, including Meta, WhatsApp, Apple, Amazon, Telegram, Instagram, etc. Meta also informed court its integration of WhatsApp and Facebook’s system with Sahyog would be concluded soon. HC also noted that I4C — home ministry’s nodal agency dealing with cybercrimes — has followed up with X and held meetings on the issue, but the microblogging site maintained it is not bound to come on board Sahyog as it has always cooperated whenever authorities reached out. The bench acknowledged that I4C has a grievance against X on grounds that in the past, when requests were made for information about sexual offences against children, no response came from X, which is why X ought to come on board Sahyog.Since, except for X, every other social media entity agreed to be linked to Sahyog, HC said these no longer needed to be part of the proceedings before it and agreed to examine objections by X on the next date in the matter that stemmed from a habeas corpus plea file by a woman trying to trace her missing son.On Tuesday, court observed that as per I4C’s status report, while 38 intermediaries have “onboarded”, 15 intermediaries are in the process. In the case of 35 intermediaries, which include cryptocurrency exchanges, approvals are being obtained. Centre’s unit also disclosed that all states/ UTs, as well as the defence ministry, have joined Sahyog.Meanwhile, Delhi Police also informed the court it has finalised a handbook to guide its investigators on the manner in which information is to be sought from social media intermediaries.

The Paris Agreement is a globally agreed goal to strive to limit warming to 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels.“While a single year above 1.5 degree C of warming does not indicate that the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement are out of reach, it is a wake-up call that we are increasing the risks to our lives, economies, and to the planet,” said WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo.The report attributed the record global temperatures, seen in 2023 and broken in 2024, to the ongoing rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, coupled with a shift from a cooling La Niña to warming El Niño event.It, however, noted that several other factors may have contributed to the unexpectedly unusual temperature jumps, including changes in the solar cycle, a massive volcanic eruption and a decrease in cooling aerosols.The report also shows the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide was at the highest levels in the last 800,000 years, and the rate of sea level rise has doubled since satellite measurements began in 1993.Around 90% of the extra heat trapped by GHG is absorbed by the ocean, causing it to warm and affecting marine life, weather patterns, and sea levels. The report shows that the ocean continued to warm in 2024, reaching record high levels.The sea level rise has cascading damaging impacts on coastal ecosystems and infrastructure, with further impacts from flooding and saltwater contamination of groundwater.“Our planet is issuing more distress signals -- but this report shows that limiting long-term global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius is still possible. Leaders must step up to make it happen -- seizing the benefits of cheap, clean renewables for their people and economies - - with new national climate plans due this year, ” said United Nations secretary-general António Guterres.","Year 2024 may be the warmest calendar year on record with a global mean near- surface temperature of 1.55 degrees celsius above the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 average) But the long-term warming (averaged over decades) remains below 1.5 degrees C, says World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119185045,imgsize-32382,width-400,resizemode-4/119185045.jpg"

MUMBAI: An international report has found that while nine Indian cities, including Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, focus on immediate responses to heat waves, long-term interventions remain scarce and, where they exist, are inadequately targeted.""Without efficacious long-term strategies, India is likely to witness a higher number of heat-related fatalities due to more frequent, intense, and prolonged heat waves in forthcoming years,"" cautions the study, co-authored by scholars from Sustainable Futures Collaborative, King's College London, Harvard University, Princeton University, and University of California, Berkeley.Utilising climate models, the study identified nine cities — Bengaluru, Delhi, Faridabad, Gwalior, Kota, Ludhiana, Meerut, Mumbai and Surat — with populations exceeding 1 million (based on the 2011 Census) that are anticipated to experience the most substantial increases in hazardous heat index values, combining temperature and humidity, relative to their recent historical averages.“Mumbai, with its 12.4 million population, is presently experiencing premature and extended heatwaves. Mumbai encounters elevated temperatures in summer and during the post-monsoon period due to heightened humidity. Increased humidity amplifies the heat index value of a locality, potentially diminishing bodily resilience and ability to cope with extreme heat through perspiration. Maharashtra possesses a State Heat Action Plan (HAP), while heat-resilience in Mumbai is additionally guided by the Mumbai Climate Action Plan. The HAP delineates actions to be undertaken by pertinent departments before, during and after a heat wave,"" the report said.The analysis found that while all nine cities implement short-term emergency response measures, crucial long-term actions are either wholly absent or poorly targeted. Essential interventions such as household cooling provision for the most heat-exposed, work-loss insurance coverage, enhanced fire management services, and electricity grid improvements are notably lacking across all cities.“In three cities — Mumbai, Bengaluru, Surat — we found the active, embedded engagement of civil society organisations over extended periods of time had the effect of focusing the bureaucracy on climate action, which suggests that more active civil society involvement is necessary to reduce state capacity deficits,” the report said.","Nine Indian cities, including Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, focus on immediate responses to heat waves.

There's increasing focus on defence cooperation. How can Sweden contribute to the Make in India initiative?



Sweden shunned long-standing neutrality to join NATO last year. Are you disappointed with the way Trump has targeted the organisation?



Can India still play a role in ensuring peace?



It’s important for like-minded democracies to together uphold the rules-based order , whether in Ukraine or in Indo-Pacific where China is posing challenges, Sweden’s foreign minister Maria Malmer Stenergard tells TOI’s Sachin Parashar in an exclusive interview. Excerpts:We came up with our strategy last year and it's on the side of defence. We are seeing how security in the world is becoming interlinked. The worst example of this is North Korean troops being present on the Russian side in the war against Ukraine. It shows how small the world has become, and we need cooperation among democracies who believe in the rules-based order. There is great interest in the Indo-Pacific in many parts of the world. We see potential here for enormous growth but also tensions. For instance, we see how China is challenging the rules-based order, the law of the sea, in the South China Sea.We have substantial cooperation already in place in defence. It's a big step that Swedish company Saab is coming here to produce the Carl Gustaf (shoulder-launched weapon system). We will both benefit from this cooperation and there is also potential as regards the defence industry. Sweden is very strong in that area, and with these many tensions in the world, there is great potential.My interpretation of the new administration is that they are 100% committed to the alliance. Pete Hegseth (secretary of defence) has said he would like to deepen the cooperation. I think the US intends to be a good ally. Having said that, I think their criticism against European countries, and also Canada, of not spending enough on their own security is absolutely legit. Sweden has done its homework. So, we have doubled our investments in the military in four years and we are heading for more. There is no such thing as a free lunch. The best way of keeping the US interested in European security is to show that we are interested in European security. Trump is trying to find a solution (to the war). We are very pleased with the agreement in Jeddah for a proposed ceasefire and now the pressure is on Russia. It's up to Russia to show they want to lay down their weapons. I'm not sure they will want that. Trump has contributed to that and for that we are grateful.I think India is a very important country standing up for the rules-based order. I'm convinced that India has a very important role to play regarding this. But it has to be peace that is fair and does not allow Russia to go back to its people perceived as winners, invest more heavily in their military and then return to attack another friendly country. Our full support for Ukraine (including Sweden's military aid) is a prerequisite for them to be able to negotiate from a position of strength. It's important for Ukraine to be in a position to say no to a bad deal.","It’s important for like-minded democracies to together uphold the rules-based order, says Maria Malmer Stenergard.

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders ' home match against Lucknow Super Giants, scheduled for April 6 at Eden Gardens , faces the likelihood of rescheduling as local police have declined security clearance due to Ram Navami festivities. The situation stems from BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari 's announcement of over 20,000 processions across West Bengal during the festival, prompting heightened security measures statewide.Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Snehasish Ganguly confirmed after two discussions with the police on Tuesday that the authorities ""have not given the go-ahead"" for the match. He explained that they categorically stated they would not be able to provide adequate security, making it unfeasible to accommodate a crowd of 65,000 without police protection.The CAB has since informed the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) about the situation, with some time still available to make a final decision. Ganguly also pointed out that a similar scenario occurred last year when a scheduled IPL match on Ram Navami had to be rescheduled.""They have categorically said they won't be able to provide adequate security. If there's no police protection, accommodating a 65,000-strong crowd becomes impossible,"" Snehasish was quoted as saying by PTI. ""We have informed the BCCI, and there is still time to take a final call. Even last year, a scheduled IPL match on Ram Navami had to be rescheduled.""The anticipated clash between Kolkata Knight Riders and Lucknow Super Giants was expected to draw significant attendance, given the strong local following of both teams. With LSG owned by RPSG Group chairman Sanjiv Goenka, the match held considerable appeal for cricket enthusiasts in the region.Meanwhile, the 2025 IPL season is set to kick off at Eden Gardens on March 22, featuring defending champions KKR against Royal Challengers Bengaluru. The grand opening ceremony, which will last approximately 35 minutes, is expected to showcase performances by singer Shreya Ghoshal and actress Disha Patani. ICC chairman Jay Shah and other prominent dignitaries are expected to attend the event, marking the return of a grand opening ceremony at Eden Gardens after a long gap.Snehasish Ganguly expressed enthusiasm about the marquee match, noting that the demand for tickets has been overwhelming.

US border officials target senior green card holders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-border-officials-target-senior-green-card-holders/articleshow/119094296.cms,"Poll Should Senior Green Card Holders Face Stricter Scrutiny at US Borders? No – It’s unfair to long-term residents Yes – National security comes first

Immigration attorneys warn against surrendering green cards



Immigration attorneys are seeing an uptick in the number of green card holders (including Indians) being subjected to secondary inspection, including overnight detention at the port of entry (airports) by US Custom and Border Protection (CBP) officers. Some are also ‘pressured’ to voluntarily give up their green card. Elderly Indians who live with their children in the US but spend the winter months in India are especially susceptible.An important piece of advice from attorneys: Do not surrender your green card. A green card holder has the right to be heard by an immigration judge.Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a lawful permanent resident (LPR) — aka green card holder — who is absent from the US for over 180 days is treated as seeking ‘re-admission’ and is subject to grounds of inadmissibility. While the issue of abandonment (relinquishment) of green card status typically arises when the individual has been outside the US for more than a year (365 days), a stay in India during the winter season is also coming up for increased scrutiny.Ashwin Sharma, an immigration attorney, based in Florida told TOI, “I have personally handled cases recently where the CBP has targeted elderly Indian green card holders , particularly grandparents who happen to have spent a bit longer outside the US, and pressured them to sign Form I-407 to ‘voluntarily’ surrender their lawful permanent resident status (green card). And the moment they have tried to push back, they have been met with threats of detention or ‘removal’ by the CBP officers who have been emboldened by Trump to see themselves as judge, jury, and executioner.”Kripa Upadhyay, a Seattle-based immigration attorney, stressed the importance of not surrendering the green card. “Generally, an individual’s green card cannot be revoked by the border unless the person ‘voluntarily’ surrenders (by signing Form 1-407). If a green card holder has spent more than 365 days out of the US they are deemed to have ‘abandoned’ their residence. Even if this is the allegation, the green card holder has the right to challenge this in court but they lose this right if they ‘voluntarily’ surrender at the airport!”“Only an immigration judge can take away a green card, so individuals should not sign this form. Unfortunately, people do not realise this because they are afraid, confused or do not understand what they are signing due to language barriers. This is a particular problem for our elderly green card holders who spend winter months in India and may not have sufficient evidence to prove maintenance of permanent resident status. Through documentation such as ownership of property, tax returns and employment one can overcome a presumption of abandonment,” said Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group.She referred to a case where an individual was placed in secondary inspection, because ever since becoming a lawful permanent resident (more than six years ago), he has spent a lot of time in India. Though he never spent more than six months (180 days) outside the US, it was clear from his travel history that he returned to the US only to maintain his green card status. “He was lucky this time and was admitted into the country but warned by CBP to give up his green card if he was not living in the US on a permanent basis,” said Batra.Rajiv S Khanna, an Arlington-based immigration attorney, sounded a word of caution, “One of the common scenarios that I have provided consultations on is when green card holders are not living in the US. They may visit every few months and consider that to be sufficient. That is legally incorrect. Maintaining a green card requires establishing and maintaining a permanent home in the US. Anything short of that can be grounds for ‘lifting the green card’ for abandonment.” To this, Jesse Bless, immigration attorney added, “Lawful permanent residents who are outside the US for more than a year (without a re-entry permit) are getting a notice to appear in removal proceedings.”Greg Siskind, co-founder of Siskind Susser, an immigration law firm, recalled, “During the previous Donald Trump administration, there were sky marshals who were passing forms out on planes asking people to surrender their green cards and people were calling and texting from the planes asking what to do. People need to not surrender their cards. But they must be prepared to sit for a while in secondary inspection. It is possible a CBP officer could even detain a person overnight. But a person is entitled to a hearing in front of a judge and most judges are not going to be happy about these cases going in front of them so I suspect CBP will cave in if a person is adamant about not surrendering.”",Immigration attorneys are seeing an uptick in the number of green card holders (including Indians) being subjected to secondary inspection. Some are also ‘pressured’ to voluntarily give up their green card. Elderly Indians who live with their children in the US but spend the winter months in India are especially susceptible.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119094525,imgsize-101034,width-400,resizemode-4/119094525.jpg"
"Proposed higher wage for H-1B visa holders may hinder hiring of freshers, scientists and engineers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/proposed-higher-wage-for-h-1b-visa-holders-may-hinder-hiring-of-freshers-scientists-and-engineers/articleshow/119183032.cms,"Potential impact of wage hikes:



Concerns for employers and workers:



Policy challenges:



A new study warns that proposed wage mandates for H-1B visa holders could make it harder for US companies to hire skilled foreign workers, particularly scientists and engineers. The research, conducted by the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), highlights concern over a proposal that would require employers to pay H-1B professionals significantly above current market rates.The proposed wage changes, including a requirement to pay at least the ""median local wage,"" could price many skilled foreign graduates out of the job market. The report suggests that instead of creating more opportunities for U.S. workers, the mandates could push companies to move jobs offshore.A recent amendment by Senator. Bernie Sanders to the Laken Riley Act will result in raising wages for H-1B workers by as much as 72% in some cases. For example, a newly graduated software developer in San Jose would have needed to be paid over $80,000 more per year than under current law. The Senate did not vote on the amendment, but similar measures could be debated as Congress considers immigration reforms.NFAP argues that the ""median local wage"" does not reflect real-world pay structures, especially for entry-level workers. In many professions, median wages are based on individuals with over a decade of experience. Requiring employers to pay such rates to all H-1B workers could make it financially unfeasible to hire recent graduates or early-career professionals.NFAP notes that about 70% of full-time graduate students in fields like electrical engineering and computer science at U.S. universities are international students. The research suggests that proposed amendments on wages which would make hiring challenging would drive away top talent and weaken the US workforce in key industries, such as artificial intelligence and semiconductor engineering.The study also raises fairness concerns, suggesting that requiring employers to pay foreign-born recent graduates significantly more than U.S. workers with greater experience could lead to legal challenges.Similar wage mandates proposed during the earlier Trump administration were struck down in court for violating administrative rules. NFAP warns that if Congress moves forward with new wage mandates, it could have similar negative effects, including fewer job opportunities for skilled foreign graduates and increased outsourcing by U.S. companies.As discussions on immigration reform continue, policymakers will have to weigh the impact of wage mandates on employers, workers, and the broader economy. The NFAP study suggests that imposing inflated wage requirements on H-1B visa holders could do more harm than good, potentially weakening the US position as a global leader in technology and innovation.","National Foundation for American Policy warns that proposed wage mandates for H-1B visa holders could make it harder for US companies to hire skilled foreign workers.

NBA Offseason Rumors: Golden State Warriors could bag $11.1 million Philadelphia 76ers guard to bolster team's defensive end; Stephen Curry's fatigue exposing crucial roster flaws?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-offseason-rumors-golden-state-warriors-could-bag-11-1-million-philadelphia-76ers-guard-to-bolster-teams-defensive-end-stephen-currys-fatigue-exposing-crucial-roster-flaws/articleshow/119185128.cms,"Philadelphia 76ers guard Quentin Grimes (5) scores past Golden State Warriors guard Moses Moody (4) during the first quarter at Wells Fargo Center.

The Golden State Warriors, fresh off a disappointing 114-105 loss to the Denver Nuggets, are in dire need of a scoring boost. With Stephen Curry struggling and the team shooting a dismal 24.2% from three-point range, the spotlight has turned to potential summer signings. One name that stands out is Philadelphia 76ers guard Quentin Grimes, who has been on an offensive tear, averaging 34.5 points over his last five games.Grimes, a 24-year-old guard, recently dropped 46 points against the Houston Rockets, showcasing his ability to perform against elite defenses. This performance wasn’t an anomaly. Since being traded to the 76ers on Feb. 4, Quentin Grimes has been a consistent scoring threat, shooting 53.2% from the field and 42.5% from beyond the arc. His recent form has made him one of the most talked-about players in the league.The Golden State Warriors are no strangers to Grimes’ capabilities. On Mar. 1, he scored a career-high 44 points against them in a 126-119 victory. His impending status as a restricted free agent this summer makes him an attractive target for Golden State, who are looking to maximize the remaining prime years of Curry and Jimmy Butler However, acquiring Quentin Grimes won’t be straightforward. The Warriors are tight on cap space, and the future of restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga adds another layer of complexity. If Kuminga leaves for a lucrative deal, it could free up the necessary funds to pursue Grimes. But as of now, this remains a speculative scenario.Quentin Grimes’ potential fit with the Golden State Warriors is intriguing. As a career 37.8% three-point shooter, he could complement Curry’s playstyle, providing another reliable distance threat. His ability to create his own shot and drive to the basket would add a new dimension to Golden State’s offense.Also read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Golden State Warriors could acquire $94,500,000 Brooklyn Nets forward to support Jimmy Butler and Stephen Curry; perfect to form a Warriors BIG 3? While the financial hurdles make this potential signing unlikely, the idea of Quentin Grimes joining the Warriors is tantalizing. His offensive prowess could be the spark Golden State needs to return to championship contention. As the summer approaches, all eyes will be on how the Golden State Warriors navigate their cap space and whether they can turn this fantasy into reality.","Philadelphia 76ers guard Quentin Grimes has been on an offensive tear, averaging 34.5 points over his last five games.
