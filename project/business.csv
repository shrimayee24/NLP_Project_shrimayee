'Talent vacuum in BJP': Congress on reports of Shashi Tharoor leading delegation of MPs to expose Pakistan's terrorism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/talent-vacuum-in-bjp-congress-on-reports-of-shashi-tharoor-leading-delegation-of-mps-to-expose-pakistans-terrorism/articleshow/121226984.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday welcomed the Centre’s decision to bring in Shashi Tharoor to lead a delegation of MPs tasked with exposing Pakistan-sponsored terrorism on international platforms.Taking to X, the Kerala Congress claimed that the government chose Tharoor for the role due to a “talent vacuum” within the BJP, asserting that the nation needs a voice that commands global respect.“At a time when Prime Minister Modi and his external affairs minister have lost credibility internationally, the nation needs a voice that commands respect. We appreciate the government for recognising the talent vacuum within the BJP and choosing a Congress leader to represent the country,” the party said.“We are confident that Shashi Tharoor will present India's case at the global level and correct the mistakes made by the Modi government,” the post added.The statement comes a day after the government announced plans to send around 40 parliamentarians to various parts of the world to highlight Pakistan's continued support for terrorism.The MPs will brief the international community about Pakistan’s ongoing involvement in cross-border terrorism and draw attention to India’s recently launched Operation Sindoor.The 10-day tour is expected to commence on May 23, with delegations likely to visit key world capitals including Washington D.C., London, Abu Dhabi, Johannesburg, and Tokyo.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju is leading the coordination efforts for the initiative. Several opposition MPs, including Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor, Priyanka Chaturvedi, and Sasmit Patra, have reportedly been approached to participate.This will be the first time the Centre is deputing a multi-party delegation of MPs to present India’s stance on Kashmir and cross-border terrorism originating from Pakistan.Although the government has not made an official announcement, it is understood that the ministry of external affairs, ministry of home affairs, ministry of parliamentary affairs, and other agencies are preparing detailed dossiers to substantiate India’s allegations against Pakistan.An official from the ministry of external affairs is expected to accompany the delegations.The move comes in the wake of precision strikes by Indian armed forces on terrorist launchpads in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Following several days of confrontation along the Line of Control, both nations agreed to a ceasefire on May 10. India clarified that while military operations would cease, there would be no diplomatic engagement with Islamabad",The Kerala Congress claimed that the government chose Tharoor for the role due to a “talent vacuum” within the BJP.

Alarm ringing in Himalayas: Environment minister Bhupender Yadav,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/alarm-ringing-in-himalayas-environment-minister-bhupender-yadav/articleshow/121222005.cms,"Bhupender Yadav (File photo)

‘Need regional synergy to protect fragile ecosystems’

(With agency inputs)

DEHRADUN: Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav flagged the growing ecological vulnerability of the Himalayas, which is marked by accelerated glacier melt, while addressing ‘ Sagarmatha Sambaad ’ — a global dialogue on climate change and its impact on mountainous regions — in Kathmandu on Friday.“The science is clear. The Himalayas are sounding the alarm,” Yadav said, warning that climate change is hastening glacier retreat and endangering water security for downstream populations.Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav added that the Himalayan communities are under threat despite contributing little to the climate crisis, and called for regional cooperation to share knowledge and protect these fragile ecosystems.The Union minister’s call for action comes on the heels of a study published in ‘Journal of Glaciology’ by Cambridge University Press which revealed a troubling trend at Himachal Pradesh’s Gepang Gath glacier: rapid glacial retreat coupled with the dramatic expansion of its proglacial lake — a water body that forms at the front or side of a glacier and is typically dammed by moraine, glacial ice, or debris. Over the past six decades, this lake has grown nearly sixfold, from 0.2 sq km in 1962 to 1.2 sq km in 2023.Led by scientists from National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research under ministry of earth sciences, the study links this expansion directly to the glacier’s retreat, further accelerated by calving (the breaking off of ice chunks from the glacier’s terminus). Between 2014 and 2023, Gepang Gath retreated 480m, resulting in substantial surface area loss and volume loss (21.7 million cubic metres of ice). The glacier’s mass balance has shown a consistently negative trend, indicating it is losing more mass than it gains.The study highlights a dangerous feedback loop: as the lake grows, its relatively warm water accelerates melting at the glacier’s edge, triggering further calving.To prevent disasters, the study calls for urgent measures, including the establishment of early warning systems for the proglacial lake and enhanced monitoring of glacier-lake dynamics.",Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav flagged the growing ecological vulnerability of the Himalayas. Yadav said climate change is hastening glacier retreat and endangering water security for downstream populations. He added that the Himalayan communities are under threat despite contributing little to the climate crisis.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121222143,imgsize-3491619,width-400,resizemode-4/bhupender-yadav.jpg"

Operation Sindoor: Over 600 Pakistan drones killed by Army air defence units,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-over-600-pakistan-drones-killed-by-army-air-defence-units/articleshow/121221694.cms,"Indian Army's air defence units swiftly deployed along the western front, successfully neutralizing over 600 Pakistani drones and repelling the rest during 'Operation Sindoor'. A multi-layered air defence network, integrating legacy weapons with indigenous systems like Akash and Akashteer, showcased unmatched precision and thwarted Pakistan's attempts to overwhelm India's air defence grid. This operation demonstrated India's enhanced AD preparedness.

NEW DELHI: Over 600 drones launched by Pakistan were simply swatted out of the sky while the rest were repelled by Army air defence (AD) units, which were swiftly deployed along the western front in the build-up to the launch of ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ on May 7, senior officers said on Friday.More than 1,000 AD gun systems and 750 short and medium-range surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, of all shapes and sizes, plugged into a wide array of radars, were mobilised in double-quick time. This ensured the multi-layered air defence network transformed from a peacetime posture to full operational readiness to thwart the multiple waves of drones unleashed by Pakistan during the four days of hostilities last week.“The operation not only safeguarded vital military and civilian infrastructure but also shattered the myth of drone supremacy. It has shown that Indian boots on the ground, backed by indigenous technology and rigorous training, can defend the skies with unmatched precision,” a senior Army Air Defence (AAD) officer said.Pakistan’s strategy of launching multiple drone swarms , many of them armed, were aimed to map and test India’s AD radar network as well as get the Indian armed forces to deplete their stockpiles of ammunition and missiles designed to take on hostile aerial threats. The Indian defence establishment was ready, having built adequate ammo reserves through regular and emergency procurements over the last five years due to the military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh.“Pakistan’s strategy was to overwhelm India’s integrated air defence grid, gather real-time intelligence, and target population centres, military assets and places of worship. But it failed spectacularly,” another officer said.“We neither open up all our radars, nor keep them open round-the-clock, to ensure the adversary does not pick up electronic signatures. One also does not use the top-end Russian S-400 (interception range 380km) or Barak-8 MR-SAM (70km, jointly produced with Israel) AD systems against low-value targets like small drones,” he added.Old ‘legacy’ AD weapons like L-70 anti-aircraft guns, ZU-23mm twin-barrel guns and upgraded Schilka, often underestimated in this era of high-tech warfare, proved their mettle in this arena. “They emerged as highly effective point defence systems against low-flying, hard-to-detect drone swarms,” he said.The indigenous Akash AD missile systems, with an interception range of 25km, also played a major role in taking care of the bigger threats like aircraft, armed UAVs and the Turkish Byker Yiha III kamikaze drones.Army deployed six nodes of its new indigenous Akashteer air defence control and reporting systems, which were fully plugged into IAF’s larger IACCS ( integrated air command and control system ) for a real-time composite air situation picture available to all commanders on the ground, as reported by TOI earlier.“Akashteer’s digital backbone offered unmatched situational awareness and real-time command-and-control capabilities, enabling commanders to neutralise threats swiftly without risking friendly aerial platforms,” the officer said. The “sheer scale” of engagement, speed of deployment, and level of integration between sensors, shooters & networks across the Services is “a turning point” in India’s AD preparedness, he added.","More than 1,000 AD gun systems and 750 surface-to-air missile systems mobilised in double-quick time.

Supreme Court Criticizes Repeated PILs on Rohingya Deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-irked-by-repeated-pils-to-stop-rohingya-deportation/articleshow/121220210.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday was irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims within a fortnight and told senior advocate Colin Gonsalves that he can’t be filing PIL after PIL on the same issue without any new fact to seek modification of SC’s May 8 decision refusing relief.On May 8, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and N Kotiswar Singh had refused to grant interim stay on apprehended deportation of Rohingyas despite spirited arguments from Gonsalves and Prashant Bhushan. The bench had said Rohingyas, who are not Indian citizens, do not have a right to reside anywhere in the country.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had said India is not a signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees and disputed validity of UNHCR granting refugee status to Rohingyas, who are from Myanmar and had fled to other countries because of serious threat to their lives from the military.On Friday, Gonsalves said on May 8 itself the Union govt had deported 28 Rohingyas, who were handcuffed and taken to Andaman Island, given life jackets and pushed towards Myanmar. After somehow reaching Myanmar, they took help of fishermen to make phone calls to their relatives in Delhi to inform them that they faced imminent threats to their lives.The bench of Justices Kant and Singh said these are bald averments and who is there to verify these facts are true to his knowledge. “When the country is facing such a situation at present, you cannot come up with fanciful PILs like this. There is no material to support vague and sweeping allegations made in the petition. Unless the petitioner provides prima facie credible material, it is difficult to pass an interim order which is contrary to the one refused on May 8 by a 3-J bench.”Gonsalves cited a SC judgement on protection of Chakma refugees to seek similar relief for Rohingyas. He also cited a UN Report as well as an order of the International Court of Justice to claim that Rohingyas are not migrants but refugees whose protection of lives is mandated by the UN.The bench said, “We do not want to comment on the UN Report today. We will give an answer to that on July 31, when this petition along with the pending one would be taken up for hearing.” Gonsalves said this would allow govt to deport more Rohingyas, whose number exceed 8,000 in different parts of the country and 800 of them are in Delhi.","Supreme Court irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims.

NEW DELHI: The Indus Waters Treaty will remain suspended “until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”, Union Jal Shakti ministry has conveyed to the cabinet secretary in its monthly report.Though the ministry has articulated the country’s well stated position on the issue after keeping the treaty in abeyance, the communication assumes significance in the wake of the latest missive from Pakistan appealing to India to reconsider the 1960 treaty, citing the dependence of millions of people on the water being regulated by it.In a report to cabinet secretary T V Somanathan on Tuesday, Debashree Mukherjee, secretary of Jal Shakti ministry, said the govt announced that the treaty would be held in “abeyance” with immediate effect in the aftermath of the “Pakistan-sponsored” terror attack on civilians in Pahalgam.“The key water-sharing treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism ,” she said in her report.","The Indus Waters Treaty will remain suspended “until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism’ Pakistan has appealed to India to reconsider the 1960 treaty, citing dependence of millions of people on the water being regulated by it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121221614,imgsize-104540,width-400,resizemode-4/Pak-signals-willingness-to-engage-on-Indus-Waters-Treaty-with-India.jpg"
India gives special entry to 160 Afghan trucks via Attari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gives-special-entry-to-160-afghan-trucks-via-attari/articleshow/121221556.cms,"Afghan trucks allowed to unload goods at Attari

NEW DELHI: India is learnt to have approved as a “special gesture” entry of 160 Afghan trucks carrying dry fruits and nuts through the Attari border with Pakistan, as bilateral ties with the Taliban develop rapidly even in the absence of a formal recognition for the regime in Kabul. According to sources, Pakistan held up clearance for a while on the Wagah side for the movement of the trucks before allowing some of them to unload at Attari on Friday.India had decided to shut the Attari-Wagah border on April 23, following the Pahalgam terrorist attack that took place a day earlier. Pakistan has in the past allowed one-way trade between Afghanistan and India through that border, facilitating export of Afghan goods to India but not any reverse export from India to Afghanistan.Expanding trade ties was one of the issues that external affairs minister S Jaishankar discussed with the Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in what was the first political engagement between India and the Taliban on May 15. Despite the hurdles created by transit issues in Pakistan, India remains the largest market for Afghan products in South Asia and annual trade stands at approximately $ 1 billion.The one time in the recent past Pakistan did allow India to send goods to Afghanistan through the land border was in late 2021, after India proposed sending 50,000 tonnes of wheat as aid to the drought-affected country. The Taliban, who had just returned to Kabul, pushed Pakistan to not hold up clearance for the supply.Muttaqi had called Jaishankar on Thursday ahead of his upcoming visit to Iran and China, a fact India attaches a lot of significance to. Both leaders had agreed to remain in touch and Jaishankar thanked Muttaqi for the solidarity Kabul expressed for India after the Pahalgam attack and for not buying into subsequent attempts by Pakistan authorities to sow discord between India and the Taliban, including through the claim that India fired missiles at Afghanistan. A source said this was significant “posturing” given the tense situation that followed India’s Operation Sindoor.Since foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Muttaqi in Dubai earlier this year, India has been looking to resume work on its projects in Afghanistan and, while also considering more development cooperation projects for the people of Afghanistan. These efforts will likely be further expedited by India’s move to politically engage Kabul.“We are also considering humanitarian assistance for the Afghan refugees expelled by Pakistan,’’ said a source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Formal recognition, however, will have to wait until the international community remains convinced that the Taliban dispensation is not serious about providing inclusive governance and removing restrictions on women.“Since 2021, India has sent 50,000 tonnes of wheat, 350 tonnes of medicines, 40,000 litres of Malathion and 28 tonnes of earthquake relief material to Afghanistan. We have also provided 2000 online scholarships for Afghan students. This aid was appreciated by the Afghan side,’’ added the source.",India is learnt to have approved entry of 160 Afghan trucks carrying dry fruits and nuts.

Indus Waters Treaty

What India is planning



Impact on Pakistan

NEW DELHI: India is considering a significant escalation in its use of water from the Indus river system, a move that could drastically reduce the water supply to Pakistan. This development comes amid heightened tensions following a deadly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam on April 22 by Pakistan-backed terrorists.Shorlty after the attack, India had suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a landmark water-sharing agreement between the two countries that has historically regulated the use of the Indus river and its tributaries.Despite the ceasefire agreement reached after intense fighting in early May, the Indus Waters Treaty remains suspended, and India's water projects are moving forward, according to a report by Reuters.Experts note that while large-scale infrastructure projects take years to complete, the political message and initial impacts on water flow are already significant. The situation remains fluid, with the potential for water to become a new flashpoint in the already tense India-Pakistan relationship.The Indus Waters Treaty, brokered by the World Bank in 1960, allocates the waters of six rivers between India and Pakistan. India controls the eastern rivers — Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi — while Pakistan has rights over the western rivers —Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum. Under the treaty, India is allowed limited use of the western rivers for irrigation and hydropower projects but must not significantly affect the water flow to Pakistan.Following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, in which 26 civilians were killed, India suspended its adherence to the treaty, citing Pakistan's involvement in cross-border terrorism.External affairs minister S. Jaishankar has made it clear that the treaty will remain ""in abeyance"" until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably stops cross-border terrorism. He also emphasised that India is willing to engage with Pakistan only on issues related to terrorism and the return of illegally occupied territories in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), rejecting broader talks on Kashmir or the treaty itself for the time being.In a strategic move, India is accelerating plans to increase its water extraction from the Indus river system, particularly focusing on the Chenab, Jhelum, and Indus rivers, which are primarily allocated to Pakistan under the treaty.One of the most impactful projects under consideration is the expansion of the Ranbir Canal on the Chenab river.Originally built in the 19th century and currently about 60 kilometers long, the plan is to extend this canal to 120 kilometers.This expansion would increase India’s capacity to divert water from 40 cubic meters per second to 150 cubic meters per second, significantly reducing the flow of water into Pakistan’s Punjab province, a key agricultural region.Additionally, India is exploring other irrigation and hydropower projects that could further reduce water availability downstream. Government documents reviewed by Reuters indicate proposals to potentially redirect water from the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers into rivers within northern Indian states, further limiting water flow into Pakistan.These projects include the construction of dams capable of storing large quantities of water-something India has not previously done on the western rivers under the treaty’s restrictions.Read More: Operation Sindoor: How India delivered devastating blow to Pakistan’s air defence with dummy jets, BrahMos missiles Pakistan relies on the Indus river system for approximately 80% of its agriculture and much of its hydropower generation. Any substantial reduction in water flow could have severe consequences for Pakistan’s food security, economy, and energy supply.Islamabad has already reported a 90% drop in water levels at a critical receiving point following Indian maintenance work on Indus projects, providing a glimpse of the pressure it might face if India proceeds with its plans.Pakistan has condemned India’s suspension of the treaty and warned that attempts to halt or divert water flows would be considered an ""act of war.""The Indus Waters Treaty has long been regarded as one of the most successful water-sharing agreements globally, having survived multiple wars and ongoing tensions.",India is considering a significant escalation in its use of water from the Indus river system.

Celebi moves Delhi HC against revocation of security clearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/celebi-moves-delhi-hc-against-revocation-of-security-clearance/articleshow/121220617.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Turkish-origin firm Celebi Airport Services India , which handled ground handling operations at various airports in India, including in the capital, approached the Delhi high court on Friday challenging the decision of aviation watchdog BCAS to revoke its security clearance in the “interest of national security”.The plea questions the move to act against the firm on “vague” national security concerns , a decision taken by govt days after Türkiye backed Pakistan and condemned India's strikes on terror camps in the neighbouring country. It is likely to be taken up for hearing next week. Celebi, operating in the Indian aviation sector for over 15 years and employing over 10,000 people, offers its services at nine airports.According to sources, it argued that the Indian govt’s decision to revoke its security clearance, which provides airport ground handling services across India, will jeopardise thousands of jobs and threaten investor confidence.Celebi maintains that its operations in India are independent and professionally governed, distancing itself from any political affiliations. It is likely to seek an urgent stay, arguing that mere rhetoric of national security can’t be a ground to take such action as govt’s move fails to reveal grounds or reasons why such an action is called for and gives no justification.Following the revocation of Celebi NAS Airport Services’ security clearance, Union civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu assured that efforts are underway to retain employees. A press release from the civil aviation ministry stated that BCAS revoked Celebi's security clearance on grounds related to national security. Govt reaffirmed its commitment to national security, passenger convenience, and uninterrupted cargo operations while managing the fallout from the decision.The firm handles around 58,000 flights and 540,000 tonnes of cargo annually in India, according to its website. It is present at Mumbai, Delhi, Cochin, Kannur, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Goa, Ahmedabad, and Chennai airports.In a statement issued earlier, Celebi Aviation India said it remains in full compliance with Indian aviation, national security, and tax regulations, and operates with complete transparency.It rejected all allegations regarding the company's ownership and operations in India and reaffirmed its long-standing commitment to the country's aviation sector.",Celebi Airport Services India approached the Delhi high court on Friday challenging the decision of aviation watchdog BCAS to revoke its security clearance.

He is an economist with deep knowledge of business, GST, and income tax — he should engage with businessmen and help strengthen the party,” Raj said. “It's easy to criticise, but I do not see these things being done,” he added.The comments come a day after Chidambaram publicly expressed doubts about the cohesion of INDIA bloc, the opposition coalition formed to challenge the BJP-led NDA.""The future of the INDIA bloc is not so bright… It shows at the seams that it is frayed,” Chidambaram said while speaking at a book launch on Thursday.He added that while he hoped the alliance could be held together, he was “not sure” if it remained intact.His remarks also gave fresh ammunition to the BJP, which was quick to pounce. BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said even Congress leaders now acknowledge the party has “no future,” accusing the opposition alliance of being driven by “self-interest” rather than public service.“When the INDI alliance was formed, its only goal was to grab power — even if it meant being anti-India, abusing Prime Minister Modi, or demoralising our armed forces,” Bhatia told PTI. “Now, Chidambaram himself has said the alliance is dead.”Echoing the sentiment, BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said on X, “Even Rahul Gandhi’s close aides know Congress has no future.”Former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar also weighed in, saying the INDIA bloc was nothing more than a rebranded version of the “corrupt” UPA and lacked a shared vision or ideology.“It is an alliance of dynasty-driven parties, known only for their love of corruption and hatred of Modiji.

(it) provides no reasons or justification,"" it added.The government on Thursday had revoked the security clearance of Celebi and its associated companies, citing concerns ""in the interest of national security."" The move directly impacts Celebi's ground handling operations , considered sensitive from a security standpoint, at nine major Indian airports: Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Goa, Cochin, and Kannur.Celebi Airport Services India Pvt Ltd (CASIPL), along with two other group companies, manages ground handling operations at these locations.“The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has revoked Celebi’s security clearance on grounds related to national security. Nothing is above the security of our nation and our fellow citizens. National interest and public safety are paramount and non-negotiable,” Union civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said in a statement. He added that efforts are underway to retain employees of Celebi and ensure continued handling of passenger and cargo services at the affected airports.The order, which takes immediate effect, is widely seen as a message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration that countries perceived to support Pakistan will face economic consequences. During Operation Sindoor, Pakistan reportedly used Turkish-origin drones in attacks on Indian cities, triggering diplomatic fallout.Amid growing public backlash, Turkish businesses are also feeling the heat in India. Tour operators have reported widespread cancellations of travel to Turkey, while protests have emerged against Turkish products such as marbles and apples.Celebi, meanwhile, has denied any links to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s daughter, Sümeyye Erdoğan, who was reported to have a stake in the company. Sümeyye is married to Selçuk Bayraktar, the chairman of BAYKAR, the manufacturer of the drones allegedly used by Pakistan.Concerns about potential disruption at Indian airports were eased after Delhi airport authorities announced the termination of their contract with CASIPL and assured continued smooth operations and employee retention. Most major airports in India work with multiple ground handling service providers. In Delhi, Bird Flight Services (BFS) and Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS) are active. Bengaluru is served by AISATS and GlobeGround India, while Kochi has BFS, AI Airport Services Ltd (AIASL), and Agile (run by IndiGo).Ground handling companies are responsible for a range of critical airport services, including baggage and cargo loading, passenger check-in and boarding, fueling, maintenance support, cleaning, and guiding aircraft safely on the tarmac.","Turkey-based aviation firm Celebi on Friday filed a case against the government’s move to revoke its security clearance.

NEW DELHI: In a display of modern warfare, India unveiled its indigenous air defence network with Akashteer , a fully automated Air Defence Control and Reporting System.The newly operational automated air defence system, Akashteer, played a central role in intercepting and neutralising a large-scale missile and drone attack launched by Pakistan on the night of May 9th and 10th, according to a press release from the Ministry of Defence.The ministry said the attack targeted both military and civilian areas and was repelled without any of the projectiles hitting their intended targets. “By the time the enemy knew they were being watched, they were already being targeted,” the statement claimed.Akashteer focuses on strategic warfare rather than raw power, according to the government. The integrated platform delivers instantaneous aerial surveillance data to all connected entities (control room, radars and Defence Gun), facilitating synchronised air defence activities. The system automates the process of detecting, monitoring and countering hostile aircraft, drones and missiles. It combines different radar mechanisms, sensors and communication systems into one unified operational structure.The government further revealed that, Akashteer automates surveillance and response, and provides a real-time common air picture to various defence units. It is vehicle-mounted, enhancing mobility and allowing deployment in active combat zones. ""Akashteer has demonstrated that it sees, decides, and strikes faster than anything the world has fielded,"" said the government, boasting the capabilities of the defence system.The government said Akashteer was developed under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative to reduce reliance on imports and increase indigenous capability. “What stood between them and their intended targets was not just technology, but years of commitment to Atmanirbhar Bharat,” the release said.Pakistan, which reportedly used Chinese-supplied HQ-9 and HQ-16 systems, failed to intercept Indian counter-strikes during the exchange. Officials said the performance gap highlighted the strategic value of domestic defence systems tailored to Indian requirements.Akashteer is part of a broader network that includes integration with the Indian Air Force’s Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS) and the Indian Navy’s TRIGUN platform. This tri-services coordination is designed to reduce friendly fire incidents and improve response times.The system also forms a component of India's wider C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) framework, a critical part of modern military operations.Akashteer joins a growing list of indigenous platforms under development, including the Dhanush artillery system, ATAGS, MBT Arjun, LCA Tejas, ALH, and several naval platforms. According to the Ministry of Defence, 65 per cent of defence equipment is now produced domestically, compared to 30 to 35 per cent a decade ago.India is targeting Rs 3 lakh crore in total defence production by 2029. The private sector now contributes 21 per cent of output, supported by 16 Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), over 430 licensed companies, and about 16,000 MSMEs.While Akashteer’s performance during Operation Sindoor is still being assessed in detail, officials say its use marks a transition in India’s approach from reactive defence to more proactive and integrated airspace control.","Akashteer played a central role in intercepting and neutralising a large-scale missile and drone attack launched by Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Pulling the curtain down on a 25-year-old legal battle between the two factions of Iskcon over control of Hare Krishna temple and other assets in Bengaluru, Supreme Court on Friday ruled that Iskcon Bangalore will have control over it and quashed the Karnataka high court order in favour of Iskcon Mumbai .Noting that Iskcon was established with a laudable object and had initiated the Hare Krishna movement, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih said the dispute between Iskcon Mumbai and Iskcon Bangalore ought not to have been brought to court. The dispute between the two organisations, which are working to spread devotion and spirituality , began in 2001 when Iskcon Bangalore filed a civil suit for control of the temple and other material assets.Examining all the documentary records and statement of witnesses, the court said that the application for allotment of land was made by Iskcon Bangalore and the sale deed was also executed in its favour, and Iskcon Mumbai cannot lay claim over it.“Therefore, the high court’s finding that Iskcon Mumbai, through its branch in Bangalore, was the owner of the Schedule ‘A’ property is completely erroneous and deserves to be set aside. It is completely contrary to the documentary evidence. Even assuming that Iskcon Bangalore did not possess funds, and even if money came from Iskcon Mumbai, it cannot claim ownership. Only because the existence of the Bangalore branch of Iskcon Mumbai was proved, one cannot jump to the conclusion that allotment of Schedule ‘A’ property was to Iskcon Mumbai through the Bangalore branch,” the court said.Karnataka HC had on May 23, 2011 passed an order in favour of the Mumbai unit by setting aside the decree passed by the trial court, and Iskcon Bangalore thereafter moved the apex court which passed an interim order to maintain status quo.","The dispute between the two organisations, which are working to spread devotion and spirituality, began in 2001.

No chaos at major airports as other ground handlers step in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-chaos-at-major-airports-as-other-ground-handlers-step-in/articleshow/121220710.cms,"A recent government rule impacted operations of Turkiye's Celebi at nine Indian airports. Existing ground handling agencies stepped in to manage the workload. GMR Group made alternate arrangements at Goa's Mopa airport. Over 10,000 Celebi employees were absorbed by other handlers like Bird Group and AISATS. Operations have stabilized with no major disruptions.

NEW DELHI: The govt rule mandating that airports handling over a crore passengers annually have at least three ground handling agencies (GHA) meant that flights and passengers at majority of the nine airports from where Turkiye’s Celebi was barred on Thursday were not affected.Other ground handlers equally handled their share of the job Celebi was doing. This is an interim arrangement and airport operators will now issue tenders inviting bids for a third GHA.The exceptions included Goa (Mopa), where the Turkish company was the only JV and where the GMR Group has made alternate arrangements for now. The other eight airports — Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Cochin — asked the other GHAs to chip in.Among the leading GHAs in India are Air India Airport Services Ltd (AIASL), Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS), Bird Group’s Bird Flight Services (BFS) and Agile Airport Services (of IndiGo). “Air India and IndiGo mostly do their own self-handling through these companies. Other GHAs cater to smaller domestic and international airlines. In Delhi, for instance, non-airline GHAs may be handling 1-1.5 crore passengers annually. This keeps reducing for other airports. When the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) order of Thursday revoked security clearance to Celebi and its associated companies, airport operators reached out to us and asked us to do Celebi’s job for some time,” said a leading non-airline GHA.The handover from Celebe was completed within 24 hours, say people in the know. “The over 10,000 employees of Çelebi have been absorbed across interim handlers. About 35-40% of them have joined Bird Group, while the rest have been placed with AISATS and AIASL. There have been no job losses,” said another ground handler.Barring a few hiccups — mostly administrative and linked to communicating now with people who overnight came onto their rolls — GHAs say “operations have stabilised and there are no reported flight delays or passenger disruption”.“Till a third GHA is appointed, existing handlers will operate in a non profit, support-only capacity to ensure service continuity and regulatory compliance. We are stretched but in national interest will do the job as long as it is required to be done...,” they said.","Turkiye's Celebi was barred on Thursday from nine Indian airports.

Lovely Professional University (LPU), a private university, has terminated six MoUs with universities in Turkiye and Azerbaijan.Signed in Jan 2025, the MoU had enabled research collaboration and student and faculty exchange. IIT-Roorkee said the decision aligns with national interest. “Our global partnerships must reflect the values, priorities, and security considerations of our country,” said Kamal Kishore Pant, director of the IIT.Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University (CSJMU), Kanpur, a state-govt run university, has also ended similar MoUs, while there are many others reviewing their international agreements with higher education institutions from Turkiye.LPU cited the two countries’ pro-Pakistan stance during recent Indo-Pak tensions as the reason for ending collaborations. These included student and faculty exchanges, joint research, and dual degree programmes.LPU chancellor and Rajya Sabha MP, Ashok Kumar Mittal said: “National security is not safeguarded solely at the borders — it must be defended in every classroom, boardroom, and international collaboration.”On Thursday, the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) urged over 1,100 universities to review and, if needed, suspend or end partnerships with institutions in Pakistan, Turkiye, and Bangladesh. The appeal follows a terrorist attack in Pahalgam that claimed 26 lives.AIU president, Vinay Kumar Pathak accused these countries of supporting anti-India narratives and called for academic institutions to show national solidarity in their international engagements.","IIT-Roorkee has cancelled its Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Inonu University, Turkiye.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Friday said ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ was a unique culmination of the “firm political will of PM Narendra Modi, pinpointed information generated by our intelligence agencies and the infallible strike capability of the three armed forces”.“India is proud of its three armed forces, BSF and all the security agencies ,” Shah said while unveiling the upgraded Multi-Agency Centre (MAC), the country’s foremost intelligence fusion centre — that connects all the intelligence, security, law enforcement and investigative agencies, at the North Block here.He underlined the new MAC will provide a seamless and integrated platform for agencies to coordinate their efforts towards addressing complex and interconnected national security challenges like terrorism, extremism, organised crime and cyber attacks.Referring to the 21-day anti-Naxal operation conducted recently by security forces at the Karreguttalu Hills on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border, Shah said this displayed exemplary coordination between intelligence agencies and security forces. “There is very good coordination in the process and thinking of our intelligence agencies and the three armed forces,” he noted.The home minister lauded the new MAC network, which has undergone a hardware and software upgrade in record time to acquire futuristic capabilities such as embedded artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. This will help to harness the potential of the vast database with MAC and geographic information system (GIS) services.Unveiling the future roadmap for the security establishment, Shah emphasised upon the need to integrate other significant databases housed with different central agencies in different silos, onto one platform, for leveraging advanced data analytics. The system, Shah said, will elevate the quality of data analytics generated on the MAC network, enabling accurate trend analysis, hotspot mapping and timeline analysis to give predictive and operational outcomes. “The new MAC will go a long way in combating the terror ecosystem having intricate linkages with organised crime,” he said.Shah has been actively guiding the technological upgradation of MAC, which was set up in 2001. Housed with the Intelligence Bureau, the new MAC follows qualitative and quantitative transformation at a cost of over Rs 500 crore.It has weaved in the country’s island territories, insurgency-affected areas and high-altitude terrain, while ensuring last-mile connectivity down to the district level, with a fast and standalone secure network.","Home minister Amit Shah said ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ was a unique culmination of the ‘firm political will of PM Narendra Modi’ The home minister lauded the new MAC network, which has undergone a hardware and software upgrade in record time to acquire futuristic capabilities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121220597,imgsize-17362,width-400,resizemode-4/Op-Sindoor-result-of-firm-political-will-of-PM-Shah.jpg"

Shah was immediately admitted to the ICU of a private hospital on SG Highway where he remains under treatment.Shah’s arrest by ED was preceded by an extensive search and survey carried out on 40-odd residential and business premises in Ahmedabad associated with Gujarat Samachar daily and other business entities mainly in the real estate sector .Appearing on behalf of Shah, senior counsel Devang Vyas filed a regular bail application before the court mainly on health grounds. He assured the court of Shah’s full cooperation in the investigation once his health improved. The ED did not object to the grant of bail for a brief period considering his health condition. However, the agency reserved its right to reply to the regular bail plea later. Special PMLA judge K S Sojitra granted interim bail to Shah on furnishing surety and a personal bond of Rs 10,000.The court has ordered the accused to update the IO about his health condition every alternate day.

"Experts align with Omar’s view, saying revival of Tulbul Navigation Project will yield socio-economic benefits for J&K",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-align-with-omars-view-saying-revival-of-tulbul-navigation-project-will-yield-socio-economic-benefits-for-jk/articleshow/121219418.cms,"JK CM Omar Abdullah (File photo)

NEW DELHI: PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti may have slammed Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah over his call for reviving the Tulbul Navigation Project , but he has echoed India’s long-term interests, with experts flagging how its implementation will yield socio-economic benefits for the entire UT.The project, also known as the Wular Barrage , is a navigation lock-cum-control structure located at the outlet of the country’s largest freshwater lake, Wular, in J&K. It was designed to facilitate navigation on the Jhelum river during lean winter months (Oct-Feb) but was stalled by Pakistan citing the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).As the treaty is in abeyance following the last month Pahalgam terror attack, experts, who have tracked the project’s development ever since it was stalled by Pakistan in 1987, believe that its implementation can be the most immediate step for the benefit of J&K.“It is time for India to finally break ground on the long-stalled Tulbul Navigation Project,” said Uttam Sinha, a senior fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses. He rues that for nearly four decades, the “developmental aspirations” of the people of Kashmir were “sacrificed at the altar of diplomatic caution” even as its implementation falls well within the treaty.“It is a matter of interpretation. India has long held the view that regulating depletion of naturally stored water for use of navigation, which is non-consumptive, is permissible under the IWT,” said Sinha.Kushvinder Vohra, former Central Water Commission chairperson, echoed similar views and explained how the project will help in better flood and water management through the Wular lake, and also help in tackling drainage congestion downstream.“It shall help in maintaining requisite water depth in the Jhelum below the Wular lake during the lean period so that navigation can be maintained throughout the year,” said Vohra, noting that it will also have an “incidental benefit” of increase in power production through hydro-electric projects .But why was the project stalled when it falls well within the treaty? After all, non-consumptive use is permitted to India under the IWT which includes control or use of water for navigation, provided these do not prejudice downstream uses of waters by Pakistan. Islamabad could never establish any prejudice to their downstream uses by the construction of the structure.Pakistan during multiple secretary-level talks in the past flagged that the project structure is a barrage with a storage capacity of around 0.3 million acre feet (0.369 billion cubic metre) and that India is not permitted to construct any storage facility on the main stem of the Jhelum river.Sinha said, “It’s a matter of interpretation...Now, the suspension (of the IWT) paves the way for a more assertive water strategy...Implementation of the Tulbul project is the most immediate step that can be taken.”","The project, also known as the Wular Barrage, is a navigation lock-cum-control structure located at the outlet of the country’s largest freshwater lake, Wular.

NEW DELHI: In one of the most daring and technologically advanced operations, the Indian Air Force (IAF) used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to devastating effect during retaliatory strikes on Pakistani airbases in Round 2 of Operation Sindoor on May 10. According to sources quoted by ANI, approximately 15 BrahMos missiles were launched in precision attacks that targeted critical infrastructure across 11 of 12 key Pakistani Air Force bases, effectively paralysing its air defence and strike capabilities.The missile strikes came as part of Round 2 of India's counter-offensive following the terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, which was carried out by Pakistan-backed groups. On the night of May 9–10, as Pakistan tried to target civilian and military infrastructures in India, New Delhi escalated military response under the broader Operation Sindoor with the BrahMos missiles spearheading the IAF's multi-layered assault strategy.“This was the first time the BrahMos missile system was used in an active conflict,” sources in the defence establishment told ANI. “Its performance exceeded expectations, delivering high-precision strikes that crippled key Pakistani air assets and defence networks,” they said.The IAF’s plan began with the launch of dummy aircraft, designed to simulate an incoming fighter threat. This decoy tactic prompted Pakistan to activate its radar and air defence systems, including the HQ-9 missile batteries. Once these systems were exposed, Indian forces launched loitering munitions, such as the Israeli Harop drones, to neutralise the air defence grid.With the Pakistani radar network compromised, the IAF then followed up with long-range precision strikes. The BrahMos cruise missiles, alongside Scalp, Crystal Maze, and Rampage munitions, were used to devastating effect. These were launched from fighter aircraft operating under the Western and Southwestern Air Commands.“The BrahMos missiles played a central role in disabling runways, hardened shelters, and command centers, significantly degrading the Pakistan Air Force’s ability to launch counter-operations,” ANI reported, citing multiple defence sources.The aftermath of the strike forced the Pakistani military to relocate many of its aircraft to rear bases and reportedly resulted in the loss of several high-value assets, including long-endurance UAVs and an airborne early warning system destroyed in a hangar in Sindh province.According to ANI, the intensity of the BrahMos-led strikes forced Pakistan to abandon its plans for further retaliation. In a telling sign of the damage inflicted, Pakistan urgently sought a Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) level meeting to propose a pause in hostilities and explore an understanding with India.The operational use of BrahMos in this conflict marks a historic milestone for India's missile capabilities. Developed jointly by India and Russia, the BrahMos is known for its Mach 2.8 speed, precision strike capabilities, and versatility across land, sea, and air platforms.“This operation has not only validated the BrahMos missile’s deterrent value but also demonstrated its potency as a first-strike option in modern warfare,” a senior defence official told ANI.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to devastating effect during retaliatory strikes on Pakistani airbases in Round 2 of Operation Sindoor.

Won’t permit any challenge to 1995 Waqf Act: SC bench

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said it will on May 20 hear a limited number of advocates for several Muslim petitioners who have challenged the constitutional validity of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, only for the purpose of deciding the necessity and contours of any interim order required to be issued by the court.SG Tushar Mehta said govt has filed a comprehensive affidavit on the three issues flagged by the court in its April 17 order: nomination of non-Muslims to Central Waqf Council and boards, validity of waqf-by-user without valid documents, and the process for identification of govt land under waqf.Perturbed after seeing a number of senior advocates appearing for the Muslim parties and speaking in different voices, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih said if merely scheduling the hearing takes so much of time and if this there is so much confusion as to who all should be permitted to argue, then the hearing cannot commence.The bench asked lead counsel for the Muslim side, senior advocate Kapil Sibal , to coordinate with other counsels who are arguing against the amendments and file by Saturday a consolidated written submission on the need and shape of interim order. It asked Mehta to articulate his response and submissions by Monday.During the hearing, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said the court should allow him to argue a petition challenging the Waqf Act, 1995, as well as the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, both of which are discriminatory based on religion. The bench, however, asked, “How can you challenge the 1995 Act after 30 years?”Jain said the petition also challenges certain provisions of the new waqf law as it has not addressed the unequal situation created in favour of Muslims by the 1995 Act.The bench said, “Do not mix the issues. We will not consider any request for stay of any provision of the Waqf Act, 1995. Just because the Amendment Act, 2025 is challenged, no one can be allowed to jump in to challenge the 1995 legislation.”Sibal said the assurance of the Union govt through the solicitor general on certain aspects should continue till May 20. Mehta said it will continue till May 20.","Supreme Court will hear a limited number of advocates for several Muslim petitioners on May 20.

Russell Wilson teams up with Troy Aikman to back a $100M friend’s latest business venture



Russell Wilson is known for precision, leadership, and focus on the football field—but off it, his strategic thinking and loyalty run just as deep. The NFL quarterback recently spotlighted those values by backing the launch of REAL JET , a private aviation startup spearheaded by his longtime friend and visionary entrepreneur, Kenny Dichter. For Wilson, this wasn’t just a casual repost—it was a testament to a decade-long bond grounded in mutual ambition, trust, and a shared pursuit of meaningful impact.Their friendship dates back more than ten years, but it’s built on more than just business ventures. During the COVID-19 crisis, Wilson and Dichter co-created the “Meals Up” initiative in partnership with Feeding America. The campaign delivered critical meals to struggling communities during a time of global uncertainty, revealing a deeper layer of their relationship—one rooted in compassion and responsibility. It wasn’t about headlines; it was about humanity.Now, Wilson is again amplifying Dichter’s mission. He reshared a post from REAL JET on Instagram to his 5.6 million followers, tagging both @kennydichter and @flyrealjet, with three flying emojis. The soundtrack? “Fly Away” by Lenny Kravitz—a clever nod to both the launch and the literal takeoff of this bold new venture. The move was subtle yet significant, signaling Wilson’s unwavering support as Dichter re-enters the private aviation space following his tenure as CEO of Wheels Up.REAL JET is not just another luxury travel option—it’s a disruptive force in private aviation. As part of Dichter’s broader lifestyle brand REAL SLX, the company aims to “connect flyers with the right companies, the right aircraft, and the right people.” His approach reimagines aviation much like rideshare apps revolutionized urban transport—making private air travel more accessible, tailored, and efficient for corporate travelers and occasional flyers alike.Interestingly, Russell Wilson isn't the only NFL legend showing love. Hall of Famer Troy Aikman also threw his support behind Dichter, reposting a message that described the founder as a “visionary entrepreneur.” While Wilson and Aikman have had a candid, sometimes tense rapport, their shared admiration for Dichter bridges any gridiron gaps. It reflects the aviation mogul’s wide-reaching influence and the powerful relationships he’s cultivated across industries.Wilson’s wife, Ciara, also chimed in, reposting her husband’s story and adding her own cheer: “Let’s go @kennydichter.” Their history with the Dichters runs deep.

Here’s what Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath wrote on X (formerly Twitter)

""Here's something worrying from a recent earnings call of a beverage maker: Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever. Even Indian companies have said something similar. Remember, India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic.""

Diabetes is a ticking time bomb for India. We have the largest number of people with diabetes in the world.

There was a time when people used to call diabetes a rich person's disease. But that's no longer the case. According to a recent study, 21 crore Indians are living with diabetes.

Poll Do you believe increasing soft drink consumption is a significant health risk for India? No, I don't think so Yes, it's a serious concern

The scary part is the rate at which it's affecting young Indians. If you're a 20-year-old woman living in a city today, you have a 64.6% chance of developing diabetes during your lifetime. If you're a young man, your risk is also quite high at 55.5%.

But the sad part is there's a lack of awareness among people. About 27.5% of people with diabetes don't even know they have it. Even if they do know, very few people get treatment.

What makes this a serious crisis is that less than 20% of Indians have health insurance. Most Indians end up spending out of their pocket, which is a huge burden for poor and low-income households.

There's no magic bullet to solve this issue. We need multiple approaches, from public awareness campaigns, insurance coverage for the poor and vulnerable, to introducing early detection programs.

Simple lifestyle changes, like adding a few extra minutes of exercise each day or reducing time spent sitting, can make a big difference. Even small changes, such as walking or cycling for an extra five minutes a day, can lower the risk of diabetes.

We've been supporting founders and startups that are working on helping Indians become healthier, but this is a systemic challenge that needs all people involved—from individuals to the government—to take action.

Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to raise concerns about increasing soft drink consumption in India. In the post, Kamath cited a worrying trend from a beverage maker’s recent earnings. “Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever,” he wrote without naming the beverage company. Kamath linked the increased consumption of soft drinks to a broader health issue, pointing out that “India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic”. Notably, this is the second time when Kamath has warned against rising cases of diabetes in the country. He previously shared a post in November last year, calling Diabetes 'a ticking time bomb for India.'Kamath quoted his previous post which he shared in November last year. He then wrote:","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to raise concerns about increasing soft drink consumption in India.

US woman praises India’s 10 best traits on social media

1. Affordable healthcare

2. Extensive and cost-effective public transportation

3. Rich and diverse food culture

4. Strong community and family bonds



5. Culture of resourcefulness and sustainability

6. Affordable and high-quality education

7. Vibrant festivals and cultural celebrations



8. Hard work and resilience

9. Flexible and adaptive labor market

10. Strong social networks and community support



India, a nation known for its rich cultural heritage and rapid economic growth, often surprises foreigners with its unique blend of tradition and modernity. One such admirer is Kristen Fischer , an American expat living in India, who recently highlighted ten practical aspects of Indian life that she believes the country excels at, compared to other parts of the world. In an Instagram video titled ""Things India Does Better,"" Fischer shared her firsthand observations on why India stands out, praising its affordability, strong community support, and cultural vibrancy. Her insights provide a refreshing perspective on the everyday strengths of Indian society that often go unnoticed.India’s healthcare system stands out for its affordability and accessibility, a factor that Fischer highlighted as one of the country’s biggest strengths. Unlike many Western countries where medical treatments can lead to financial strain, India offers high-quality medical services at a fraction of the cost. This affordability extends to everything from routine check-ups to complex surgeries, making healthcare accessible to a larger section of the population.Additionally, India is known for its world-class hospitals and medical professionals, with cities like Chennai, Mumbai, and Delhi emerging as medical tourism hubs. Patients from around the globe often travel to India for treatments like heart surgeries, joint replacements, and cosmetic procedures, drawn by the combination of advanced technology and cost-effectiveness.India boasts one of the world’s largest and most cost-effective public transportation networks. Fischer praised the country’s extensive rail system, which spans over 68,000 kilometers, connecting even the remotest corners of the nation. This network is complemented by affordable buses, autorickshaws, metros, and app-based ride-sharing services, providing convenient travel options for millions every day.For instance, the Delhi Metro, known for its punctuality and cleanliness, has become a model for other cities, while local trains in Mumbai are the lifeline for the city’s bustling workforce. The affordability of these options makes daily commuting more economical compared to many Western countries, where public transport can be significantly more expensive.Indian cuisine is renowned worldwide for its vibrant flavors, rich spices, and immense variety. Fischer noted that India’s diverse food culture is not only delicious but also remarkably affordable. From street food like samosas and chaat to elaborate regional dishes like Rajasthani thalis and Hyderabadi biryani, India offers a gastronomic experience that caters to every palate and budget.Moreover, the widespread use of fresh, locally sourced ingredients and centuries-old cooking techniques contribute to the health benefits and distinct flavors of Indian dishes. India’s food culture also emphasizes hospitality and sharing, reflecting the country’s deeply rooted community values.One of the most distinctive aspects of Indian society is its emphasis on close-knit family structures and strong community ties. Fischer highlighted this as a key strength, noting that Indian families often live together, providing a robust support system for both emotional and financial well-being.In India, it is common for multiple generations to share a household, creating an environment where family members can rely on each other during tough times. This sense of togetherness extends beyond the family unit to include neighbors and local communities, fostering a deep sense of belonging and mutual support.Fischer also praised India’s culture of resourcefulness, where people often repair, reuse, and recycle items rather than discarding them. This mindset minimizes waste and promotes sustainability, reflecting a practical approach to everyday living.In rural areas, this resourcefulness is evident in the widespread use of traditional farming techniques, reliance on locally sourced food, and innovative approaches to water conservation. Urban households, too, are increasingly embracing sustainable practices, from composting to using solar power, driven by a growing awareness of environmental issues.India’s education system, while facing challenges, also stands out for its affordability and quality. Fischer noted that India is home to some of the world’s most prestigious institutions, like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), which offer top-tier education at a fraction of the cost compared to their Western counterparts.This affordability extends to primary and secondary education, where many public and private schools provide high-quality instruction at reasonable fees, making education accessible to a broader population.India’s festivals, known for their color, energy, and inclusivity, are among the most vibrant in the world. Fischer appreciated the way these celebrations bring communities together, fostering a sense of unity and shared joy.From the lights of Diwali and the colors of Holi to the spiritual fervor of Eid and the grandeur of Durga Puja , Indian festivals reflect the country’s deep-rooted traditions and diverse cultural heritage. These celebrations often include family gatherings, community feasts, and elaborate rituals, creating lasting memories for participants.Fischer also highlighted the hardworking nature and resilience of Indians, who show remarkable adaptability in the face of challenges. This resilience is evident in the country’s thriving startup ecosystem, its rapid economic growth, and the determination of its people to overcome adversity.India’s labor market is known for its flexibility, which has fueled the growth of industries like information technology, business process outsourcing (BPO), and manufacturing. This adaptability has made India a global outsourcing hub, attracting companies from around the world seeking cost-effective solutions.Finally, Fischer emphasized the importance of strong social networks in India, where communities often come together to support each other during difficult times. This sense of community is reinforced by cultural values that prioritize relationships and collective well-being.","US woman praises India’s 10 best traits on social media.

“As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles.”

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s plan to cut bureaucracy at company

Amazon has reportedly fired 100 employees within its Devices and Services division . According to a report by Reuters, the company said the jobs represented a small number of the total for the unit and were part of its regular business review.

To recall, Amazon also laid off some employees from Alexa-related jobs in 2023.In a statement given to Reuters, Amazon spokesperson said,While the full scope of the layoffs remains unclear, reports indicate that a variety of teams within the Devices and Services unit have been affected.

Chris Olave emerges as Steelers next big target after Pickens trade: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chris-olave-emerges-as-steelers-next-big-target-after-pickens-trade-report/articleshow/121218390.cms,"Chris Olave emerges as Steelers next big target after Pickens trade: Report (Image Source: Getty Images)

Chris Olave linked to Steelers as trade rumors heat up

Steelers are trying for Chris Olave but deal is not close yet

The Pittsburgh Steelers have already made two high-profile moves this offseason with wide receivers. They first traded for DK Metcalf from the Seattle Seahawks. They then traded George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys. Now, it appears they may not be finished. The team is reportedly eyeing trading for another star, New Orleans Saints receiver Chris Olave .The Steelers began by acquiring a dominant wideout. They sent a second-round pick and a later pick trade to acquire DK Metcalf in March. Weeks after, they sent George Pickens to Dallas. That transaction acquired them a third-round pick in 2026 as well as a future late-round trade.With Metcalf on board as their best wide receiver, the team is a bit improved at the top, but their depth is still lacking. They do have veteran Robert Woods, who does not get much playing time but is primarily recognized for blocking and leadership. Calvin Austin had potential last year but isn't ready for an outside full-time role. Rookie Roman Wilson is still without a track record.Which means the Steelers will probably do one more thing. On his radio show, Pittsburgh radio personality Adam Crowley said the next suspect is Saints phenom Chris Olave. He tweeted out the name ""Chris Olave"" and then followed up by saying that someone close to the situation texted him the name.Kevin Adams of Barstool Sports also broke the story. He supplied more information, indicating, ""Trying. Interested. But not close."" That translates to the Steelers are making an effort, but it is not even close to being finished.If they can get Olave, it would be a big signing. Although Olave sat out time with a concussion last year, he was great in 2023. He caught 87 passes for more than 1,100 yards that season. He's the type of receiver who can do everything short passes, deep passes, and all things in between. He'd complement Metcalf, who is more suited for deep, run-after-catch plays.Adding Olave would provide the Steelers with two high-level receivers and a significant boost to their offense. It would also assist quarterback Russell Wilson or Justin Fields, whichever one wins the starting job, by providing them with more weapons.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers Leaves NFL Fans Guessing As Steelers Await Blockbuster Decision That Could Shake Up The League","Pittsburgh Steelers are reportedly trying to sign New Orleans Saints receiver Chris Olave.

It wasn’t just a family tribute it marked the launch of a new chapter.She’s now hosting her own podcast, giving her a space to speak freely about everything from her upbringing to the challenges she’s faced as a young woman in sports and media.

In an interview with Beyond Type 1, she opened up about the ongoing challenges, saying, “Still learning… It never stops.”But Shelomi’s presence isn’t just digital. She also made a pivotal move in her basketball career, transferring from the University of Colorado to Alabama A&M.During her early days at Jackson State, where her father Deion Sanders coached and her brothers played, Shelomi experienced the unique dynamic of being both the youngest and the only daughter on campus.Recalling those times with a laugh, she once joked, “I’m a freshman and a female, so they weren’t gonna leave me in Jackson with the whole family coming over.”Her return to an HBCU environment speaks volumes about her desire for community and fit values that often get overlooked in the spotlight of big-name programs. She previously played at Jackson State, and this return feels like a homecoming, professionally and personally.Shelomi is also making significant strides in the NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) landscape. She recently inked a deal with Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty, a major endorsement that showcases not only her marketability but also her confidence in stepping into new territory beyond basketball.While Shelomi’s story is one of growth and reclamation, her brother Shedeur’s path is filled with pressure. Despite being a top college quarterback, he fell to the fifth round of the NFL Draft, a disappointment that raised eyebrows and stirred media debate.However, Shedeur has already started silencing doubters by putting up standout performances at the Browns' rookie camp.Also read: Shedeur Sanders draws attention with swagger and precision at Browns practice Together, Shelomi and Shedeur represent two different sides of the Sanders legacy: one navigating the pressure of NFL expectations, the other forging a new identity beyond the family name. In doing so, both are proving they’re more than just Deion Sanders’ kids they’re rising stars in their own right.","Shelomi Sanders is using media, sports, and personal storytelling to build her own legacy.

NEW DELHI: Heavy rain drenched parts of Mumbai on Saturday, bringing much-needed relief from the city’s lingering humidity.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a partly cloudy sky and intermittent showers throughout the day, with light to moderate rain expected across several areas.The showers follow a spell of pre-monsoon rainfall seen in recent days.The IMD has also issued a five-day forecast warning of sustained rainfall and thunderstorm activity in multiple states.“Southern India, especially the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka, will experience persistent rainfall, accompanied by thunderstorms and gusty winds for the next five days,” IMD scientist Akhil Srivastava told ANI on Friday.Srivastava said similar weather conditions are likely to prevail over Central India as well. The northeast will also remain wet, he added: “The Northeastern parts of the country will also continue to receive rainfall for the next five days.”Northwestern India may witness thunderstorms in the days ahead, although heatwave conditions are expected to persist. In the east, particularly in Assam, Meghalaya, and Arunachal Pradesh, hot and humid weather is likely to continue.Delhi, however, might see a brief reprieve from the heat. “We expect thunderstorm activity to develop over Delhi in the evening today and tomorrow. Light rainfall is expected, and due to this, the temperature might fall to around 37 to 39 degrees Celsius,” Srivastava said.The weather updates come amid growing concerns about soaring temperatures in the northern parts of the country. In Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad, rising heat levels have led to a spike in hospitalisations, especially among children.“Summers have started, and at this time, children suffer from typhoid, fever, loose motion, and cold and cough,” said Senior Consultant Medical, V Singh.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.
