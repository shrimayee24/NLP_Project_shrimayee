Chasing highs that Everest can’t provide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chasing-highs-that-everest-cant-provide/articleshow/112073074.cms,"Expecting the unexpected

Covering every last detail

What do mountaineers do when they want to experience the feeling of being one with the trail? Simple: they go off it.“The popular and iconic mountains have an established route. With the required amount of fitness and endurance levels, one can make it to the summit. But mapping the unknown has a different thrill,” Satyarup Siddhanta sums it up perfectly.The climber from Bengal is the Guiness record holder for being the youngest in the world to complete seven summits and seven volcanic peaks.He is also one of a tribe of mountaineers from the state — many of whom have summited the world’s iconic mountains — that is now climbing unexplored, virgin peaks that pose unknown challenges and offer the thrill of scaling unconquered heights.There are now at least three teams of climbers from West Bengal that have completed treks in remote and uncharted areas in recent months. One of them, Sonarpur Arohi, last month summited Gupt Parvat, an unexplored peak in the Pir Panjal range of Himalayas.“On such expeditions, there is no signposting. Most of these explorations lead to nowhere. What you achieve may not be that something that you’d looked forward to. Despite that, you try because an explorer takes the path less trodden,” Siddhanta explains the philosophy driving these mountaineers.Take the expedition to Shikar Beh, which Sonarpur Arohi attempted after Gupt Par vat. They failed to complete the trek as they hadn’t carried equipment needed to cross large crevices. “There was a climb to Shikar Beh in 1973 by a Japanese team. It never mentioned these crevices. Approaching the summit, our team was stopped by those crevices. We realised they were impossible to cross without a ladder,” he said.While planning the Gupt Parvat (5,988m) expedition, Sonarpur Arohi did not even have a picture of the peak. “It cannot be seen or identified unless you physically reach the mountain. The gorge was never explored. The villagers never went beyond the first transit camp,” said Rudra Prasad Haldar, a member of the team, which went to Mount Brammah in Kishtwar valley of Jammu and Kashmir last year via a new route.Haldar, an Everest summiteer, found the Gupt Parvat climb to be no less difficult than scaling the world’s highest peak. “There was no recorded attempt from the Indian side. After reaching the area we realised that the topography had changed completely over the decades. We had read that it was an ice field. But when we reached, we found it to be a moraine (mound of loose glacial sediments). In place of ice fields, we found multiple glacier lakes,” he recounted.Where written records are not available, explorers have to start preparations well in advance. “We started by studying satellite images of the area as well as topographic sheets. We realised that satellite images were not sufficient. We reached out to NATMO (National Atlas & Thematic Mapping Organisation) and the National Library for topographic sheets,” said Debashis Acharya, a mountaineer from south Bengal who made it to Jamdwar Khal (5,241m), an unexplored ridge between Har Ki Dun and Sian Gad at the eastern end of Uttarakhand’s Jamdwar glacier.Explorers know that when journeying into the unknown it is important to find out about emergency exit routes, too. “Since there was no record of any Jamdwar Khal exploration, we had to gather information about treks in the adjacent areas to map emergency exit routes,” Acharya said.Another team from Kolkata set out for Holmes’ Col (5,507m) in Himachal Pradesh last month. The hostile and tricky stretch was first recorded by Peter Holmes in 1956. “There might have been other ascents, but we could not find any account by other climbers,” said Abhijit Banik, a climber from Kolkata. “We had planned to make it to Holmes’ Col in 2021, but we had to call off the journey and return midway,” he added.“After we started from Barsheni in Himachal Pradesh, we set up our base camp at 4,891m on the Dibibokri main glacier. Debashis Bardhan, a member of the team, had laid out an initial plan based on Holmes’s account. But the topography has changed over the past seven decades. You can often go off the edge of the map,” he said. On the eighth day, a group of four finally managed to move towards Holmes’ Col. The weather was favourable and they reached the summit of Holmes’ Col on June 12.","There are now at least three teams of climbers from West Bengal that have completed treks in remote and uncharted areas in recent months.

"Long flying hours, roster instability causing pilot fatigue: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/long-flying-hours-roster-instability-causing-pilot-fatigue-study/articleshow/112072738.cms,"MUMBAI: Prolonged flying duties surpassing 10 hours per day, consecutive night shifts, rapidly rotating weekly rosters disrupting circadian rhythms , and schedules strictly adhering to the bare minimum mandated rest periods were identified as the primary factors contributing to pilot fatigue , according to the findings of a recent survey conducted by a non-governmental organisation.The survey, which garnered responses from 530 airline pilots in India, predominantly captains operating domestic and international flights lasting under six hours, revealed that approximately 70% of pilots considered flight duty periods exceeding 10 hours to have a profound impact on the onset of fatigue, as stated in the survey report published by Safety Matters Foundation . Currently, India allows airlines to schedule pilots for flight duty periods of up to 13 hours within a 24-hour timeframe.Exacerbating the issue of extended duty hours were frequent ""tail swaps,"" which 63% of pilots cited as a contributing factor to fatigue. Tail swaps , a term used in the airline industry, refer to a change of aircraft. However, the crew cannot directly transfer from one aircraft to another. ""The crew must disembark from the aircraft, proceed to the terminal building, and undergo security screening before boarding the next aircraft. Frequent tail swaps, when combined with other factors such as maximum flight duty, minimum rest, and multiple landings, can compound the increase of fatigue,"" the survey stated.""The survey findings and recommendations were submitted to DGCA last week,"" stated Capt Amit Singh of Safety Matters Foundation.In addition to answering survey questions, 177 pilots provided comments that shed light on the work-life balance of pilots in India. Roster instability emerged as the primary grievance in the comments.One captain shared an example where his airline woke him up at 2:30 am to inform him not to report for duty at 5 am as scheduled, as it would violate the minimum mandated rest period. Other complaints included excessive layovers, with pilots returning home for just one day after working layover flights for 6-7 days, as the pilot's base station no longer holds significance.Another pilot highlighted an increase in errors during landings and take-offs among crew members due to fatigue, and airlines not granting leave, among other issues.""In recent years, the number of Indian pilots who have been declared temporarily or permanently medically unfit has risen,"" noted Capt Singh, emphasising that fatigue is a significant contributory factor to cardiac disease .In August of the previous year, a 40-year-old IndiGo pilot suffered a cardiac arrest and passed away in the security hold area of Nagpur airport, just minutes before he was scheduled to operate a flight to Pune.This incident brought to light a range of fatigue-related issues afflicting airline pilots and prompted the regulator to review the norms governing maximum permissible duty periods & minimum rest periods when rostering pilots for flying duties.In Jan this year, DGCA had issued a reformed set of norms with a strict June 1 deadline for airlines to implement. However, in March, following representations made by airlines to the ministry, DGCA withdrew the deadline.","A recent survey conducted by a non-governmental organisation identified the primary factors contributing to pilot fatigue.

NEET-UG scam: Number of toppers set to drop from 61 to 17 in revised list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-ug-scam-toppers-number-set-to-drop-from-61-to-17-in-revised-list/articleshow/112024237.cms,"NEW DELHI: The number of toppers in the NEET-UG exam is set to come down to 17 from 61 when National Testing Agency ( NTA ) announces the revised merit list , most likely on Friday.Revision of the merit list was necessitated after IIT-Delhi , working at Supreme Court's instance, recommended that only one of the options in a question in the physics paper was correct.Several students had complained that two of the four options could be held to be correct going by different NCERT books. With only one answer being deemed correct, those who had chosen the other option lost five marks (four marks for wrong answer and one negative mark), in what was sure to have a cascading effect on the ranks of all those who took the exam.This decision will primarily impact the scores of 4.2 lakh candidates, including 44 who achieved perfect scores of 720, because they had opted for the answer deemed incorrect by IIT-Delhi and for which they had been awarded four marks earlier by NTA. “The number of toppers, which stands at 61, will come down to 17, post the deduction of marks,” an NTA official said.The change in ranking could prove to be crucial for many students considering that over 24 lakh aspirants took the NEET-UG for the 1.08 medical seats up for grabs in the country. Of these, 56,000 seats are in govt institutions, which are much sought after for their better infrastructure and lower fees.According to sources, the biggest impact will be on candidates ranked between 50,000 to 1 lakh as over 16,000 candidates, who were earlier likely to earn a seat in a medical college, are likely to go out of the cohort.Sources said the impact on the 44 students, who will no longer be toppers, will not be much as they would still feature in the rank cohort of 33,000 to 50,000 but change in their ranks will impact their chance of securing seats in govt medical colleges of their choice.",The number of toppers in the NEET-UG exam is set to come down to 17 from 61 when National Testing Agency ( NTA ) announces the revised merit list.Revision of the merit list was necessitated after IIT-Delhi recommended that only one of the options in a question was correct.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112024337,imgsize-98584,width-400,resizemode-4/112024337.jpg"

PM targets opposition over Agniveer scheme





Opposition accuses PM Modi of 'petty politics'





NEW DELHI: On the Kargil Vijay Diwas, as opposition cornered PM Modi-led NDA government over the Agniveer scheme , the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states moved to provide job reservations to the ex-servicemen. In back-to-back statements, the chief ministers of Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh , Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha announced the decision to provide job reservations to Agniveers in the state jobs while backing the scheme.Underscoring the importance of national security, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath criticised the opposition on Friday for allegedly misleading the public regarding the Agniveer scheme.He also stated that his government will provide Agniveers jobs in police service and Pradeshik Armed Constabulary (PAC) on ""priority basis"".In a post on X, CM Yogi said, ""When Agniveers return after their service, Uttar Pradesh government will provide these youth the facility of adjustment in Police Service, PAC on priority basis. A certain reservation facility will be provided for them in Uttar Pradesh Police.""The announcement comes just days after the BJP-led Haryana government said the state would provide 10% reservation to Agniveers in direct recruitment to posts of constable, mining guard, forest guard, jail warden and SPO.Besides UP, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh also announced job quotas for Agniveers on Friday.Madhya Praadesh chief minister Mohan Yadav on Friday announced that his government will provide reservations to Agniveers in the recruitment of police and armed forces after the end of their services.Sharing the information on social media platform X, Yadav said the decision is as per ""the wishes of our illustrious Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji.""The Madhya Pradesh CM earlier in the morning paid tribute to the heroes of the Kargil war at Shaurya Smarak in Bhopal on the occasion of 25th anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas.With this, Madhya Pradesh became the third BJP-led state to announce reservation in jobs for Agniveers.On the occasion of Kargil Diwas, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami also announced a similar decision.""We will make provisions and bring an Act to give reservation to them in government services. We are working on this plan. We will make use of their skills and discipline in various government departments,"" Dhami said.The chief minister also announced that the aid extended to the kin of martyrs will be increased from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 50 lakh.""No sacrifice can be bigger than the act of laying down one's life to secure the country's borders. No grant or honour can be enough for this supreme sacrifice,"" he added.Chhattisgarh CM Vishnu Deo Sai also made the announcement saying, ""I am glad to announce that ex-Agniveers will be given priority in appointment of police constable, forest guard and jail guard in Chhattisgarh. The state government will soon release guidelines for it.""Odisha CM Mohan Charan Majhi announced similar move and said 10 per cent quota and five-year age relaxation will be given to the Agniveers in uniform services.Nayab Saini-led Haryana government had announced the similar move on July 17.Chief minister Nayab Saini said the state government will provide 10 percent reservation to Agniveers in Haryana in direct recruitment to the posts of constable, mining guard, forest guard, jail warden and SPO.He also announced age waiver of three years for Agniveers in Group B, C employment in the state.Earlier today, in his address at the Kargil Vijay Diwas Shradhanjali Samaroh in Drass, PM Modi called Agnipath scheme an example of necessary reforms done by the army.He said some people were playing politics over a sensitive issue related to national security and rubbished claims that the Agnipath scheme was launched to save pension money. ""The aim of Agnipath is to make the forces young ... The aim of Agnipath is to keep the armies continuously fit for war,"" he said.""For decades, there have been discussions on making the armed forces young, from Parliament to various committees. The average age of Indian soldiers being higher than the global average has been raising concerns. Therefore, this topic was raised in many committees for years. But the will to solve this challenge related to the country's security was not shown earlier,"" PM Modi said.""Unfortunately, such a sensitive issue related to national security has been made a subject of politics by some people. Some people are playing politics of lies for their personal interests even on this reform of the army,"" the PM added.Modi government's Agniveer scheme has attracted constant criticism by the opposition making it one of the major flashpoint during Lok Sabha election campaign and subsequent Parliament sessions.As PM Modi on Friday blamed the opposition for ""playing politics of lies for their personal interests even on this reform of the army"" over the scheme, the INDIA bloc leaders launched a counter-attack, accusing PM Modi of being involved in ""petty politics"".Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and other party leaders accused the prime minister of indulging in ""petty politics"" over the Agnipath issue and said the prime minister's remarks that his government implemented the scheme at the behest of the Army was a ""blatant lie"".""It is very unfortunate and deplorable that Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji is doing petty politics even on occasions like paying tribute to martyrs on Kargil Vijay Diwas. No Prime Minister has ever done this before,"" Kharge said.""Modi ji is saying that his government implemented the Agnipath scheme at the behest of the Army. This is a blatant lie and an unforgivable insult to our valiant armed forces. Modi ji, it is you who is spreading lies!"" he said in a post on X.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh accused Modi of ""lying"" even on Kargil Vijay Diwas.""He (Modi) says the Agnipath/Agniveer scheme was introduced by the Army. General MM Naravane, who was Army chief at that time, has written that the scheme came as a complete surprise to the Army and as a 'bolt from the blue' to the Navy and Air Force. Modi is now trying to evade responsibility for this disastrous scheme,"" he said in a post on X.Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) MP Mahua Maji said the scheme needs to be reviewed as it does not provide any social security to the Agniveers.""I salute the martyrs of Kargil. Whenever foreign nations have attacked us, our brave soldiers have sacrificed their lives,"" she said.""But there should be a review of the Agniveer scheme. We should think about the soldiers on whom the whole nation of 140 crore people relies. What would happen to them after four years when they become unemployed?"" the JMM MP posed.The Trinamool Congress' Rajya Sabha MP Dola Sen dismissed the prime minister's remarks that the Agniveer scheme is intended to keep the force young.""The Army has always been young, perhaps the prime minister does not know... They get voluntary retirement while they are young. They serve the nation, we respect them,"" she said.""Being in the Army was a full-time job. But the Agnipath-Agniveer (scheme) ended that. We will keep protesting against the scheme,"" Sen said.","BJP-ruled states move to provide job reservations to the ex-servicemen.

Study links drop in vulture tally to rise in human deaths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/study-links-drop-in-vulture-tally-to-rise-in-human-deaths/articleshow/112072735.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ghazipur landfill site in Delhi may be one of the few places in the capital where one can still spot the vultures - a bird species that used to be a common sight in India until 1990s and have since witnessed a fast decline. From a 50 million strong population, the bird species have turned into one of the most critically endangered species in the country today.While loss of vultures has been noted with concern and efforts are being made to revive their population, a new study has - for the first time - highlighted how the rapid drop in numbers of this bird species coincided with excess human deaths in the country.Districts affected by the disappearance of vultures saw an increase in human all-cause death rates of at least 4%, averaged over 2000 to 2005, a study published in the journal American Economic Association (AEA) suggests.While some animal species will feed on carrion if available, for vultures, it is the only source of food.As a result, vultures are considered very efficient scavengers . Also, unlike the other scavenging species such as dogs and rats, vultures do not leave the flesh behind and reduce the risk of transmission of diseases from them.The American Economic Association study states that anecdotal accounts describe how with vultures no longer available, the rotting meat and its scent build up, attracting feral or stray dogs. ""Combination of dogs and rats serving as vectors of infectious diseases, and being less efficient scavengers, make carcass dumps a breeding ground for disease,"" the study point out.Increase in population of rats and feral dogs causes rise in rabies, and in transmission of pathogens and diseases such as anthrax to other scavengers, as well as to increased water pollution from carcass dumping and surface runoff. All this led to additional human deaths, the AEA study suggests.","Vultures used to be a common sight in India until 1990s and have since witnessed a fast decline.

BENGALURU: A controversy over the alleged transportation of dog meat at Bengaluru city railway station has taken a new twist, with food safety commissionerate officials confirming it to be goat meat .Police Friday seized 90 insulated boxes with 2,700kg of meat that had arrived by train from Jaipur. Tension prevailed at the station and adjoining areas on Friday evening when activists gathered in large numbers to protest the alleged transportation of dog meat.However, contrary to the allegations of right-wing activists that dog meat was illegally sold in Bengaluru after getting parcels from distant states, the packages that arrived on Friday evening had 'chevon' (goat meat) packed in insulated boxes.Police registered three FIRs on Friday night over the incident. ""The first FIR was against the transportation of meat, suspecting it could have been mixed with dog meat, and the second was against cow vigilante Puneet Kerehalli for obstructing food quality department officials from discharging their duty. Another FIR was registered against Puneet and his four associates for unlawful assembly in a public place,"" a senior police officer told TOI.K Srinivas, commissioner of food safety, clarified that dog meat is not being sold in Bengaluru and what arrived in the parcel was 'chevon'. ""The meat, at the outset, was not of a dog but is of a special breed of goat, Sirohi, which is largely found in Rajasthan and Kutch-Bhuj areas of Gujarat. They also have a slightly elongated tail and spots on them. Hence, people could easily confuse them for a dog. There were no signs of dog meat in the samples. Due to short supply of mutton and 'chevon', some traders source it from other states and sell it here at an affordable price,"" he added.As the meat packages arrived, questions were raised as to why any trader would bring such a huge quantity of 'chevon' to Bengaluru when there was so much availability of sheep and goat in Karnataka. However, much to the dismay of many, experts from the department of animal sciences at Gandhi Krishi Vigyan Kendra (GKVK) revealed there was severe scarcity of 'chevon' in Bengaluru.Prof B L Chidananda, former professor of animal sciences at GKVK, said: ""Unlike the popular sheep varieties, Karnataka does not have its own varieties of goat. Due to this, there is a shortfall of 25% to 30% of 'chevon' in Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka. At the same time, Bengaluru, along with other districts of Karnataka, is the largest consumer of meat. Bridging this gap and keeping in mind the price affordability, traders source cheap varieties of chevon from other states where there is largescale production.""","Police seized 90 insulated boxes with 2,700kg of meat that had arrived by train from Jaipur.

NEW DELHI: Urging states to provide an investor-friendly environment, PM Modi on Saturday asked govt think tank NITI Aayog to prepare an "" investment-friendly charter "" of parameters which would include policies, programmes and processes for attracting investments. Modi said states may be monitored on these parameters to promote healthy competition among them for attracting investments.Speaking at the 9th governing council meeting of NITI Aayog, he underscored the importance of law and order, good governance and infrastructure as vital for attracting investments, rather than just incentives.Twenty states and six UTs attended the meet; some opposition-governed states opted out.""Viksit Bharat in 2047 is an ambition of every Indian. States can play an active role to achieve this aim as they are directly connected with the people,"" he said, asserting that the aspiration should reach each district, block, and village.PM Modi said the dream of Viksit Bharat can be realised only if the states also develop, and exhorted them to prepare a vision for 2047 for themselves and their districts.This was the first meeting of the reconstituted council and the PM expressed confidence that India is progressing on the path to fulfil the vision of a developed nation in 2047 through the power of cooperative federalism.Continuing the govt's focus on jobs, the PM emphasised skilling and training of youth to make them employment-ready as the world looks favourably towards India for skilled human resources. ""India is a youthful country. It is a huge attraction for the entire world because of its workforce. We should aim to make our youth a skilled and employable workforce. Emphasis on skill, research, innovation and job-based knowledge is necessary for making Viksit Bharat @2047,"" the PM was quoted as saying.Modi said that this is the decade of change which brings a lot of opportunities across sectors and encouraged states to utilise them and make policies and initiate governance programmes that are conducive for development through innovative approaches in policy-making and execution.The PM urged states to explore the creation of river grids at the state level for effective utilisation of water resources and said that zero poverty must be set as a target on a priority to realise the goal of a developed nation. He emphasised the need to tackle poverty on an individual basis rather than just at a programme level and said removing poverty from the grassroots would bring about a transformational effect in the country.The PM also encouraged all states to increase productivity and diversification in agriculture and provide market linkages to farmers. He called for spreading the adoption of natural farming practices which can improve soil fertility, ensure better and quicker returns to farmers due to low costs, and also provide a global market for the products.He also urged states to initiate demographic management plans to address the issues of population ageing in future and said states should aim to take up capacity building of govt officials at all levels and encouraged them to collaborate with the Capacity Building Commission.Modi lauded the Aspirational Districts Programme anchored by Niti Aayog, and said that the key to its success was continuous and online monitoring of measurable parameters, which led to healthy competition among districts to better their performance in different govt schemes.Chief ministers and Lt Governors gave various suggestions for the vision of Viksit Bharat @ 2047 and also discussed steps being taken in their states. Some of the key suggestions and best practices highlighted were related to agriculture, education and skill development, entrepreneurship, drinking water, reducing compliances, governance, digitalisation, women empowerment, and cyber security, among others, an official statement said.The PM asked Niti Aayog to study suggestions of states and UTs made during the meeting.",PM Modi said the dream of Viksit Bharat can be realised only if the states also develop.

Non-kosher chicken items off menu as Kolkata eatery returns to Jewish roots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/non-kosher-chicken-items-off-menu-as-kolkata-eatery-returns-to-jewish-roots/articleshow/112071400.cms,"KOLKATA: Nahoum & Sons, the iconic bakery operating out of New Market in the heart of Kolkata for the past 122 years, has decided to remove chicken items from its menu. The change was driven by the unavailability of a kosher butcher , as the shop reverted to its Jewish roots .The shop, established in 1902 by Nahoum Israel Mordecai, a Baghdadi Jew, will also close on Saturdays to observe the Jewish Sabbath.The decision, influenced by the passing of the bakery's kosher chicken supplier last year, reflected the challenges faced by Kolkata's dwindling Jewish community. Without a kosher butcher, fourth-generation owner Adam Nahoum opted to cease sale of chicken products. The shop continues to offer popular items like fish pantheras and egg chops.General manager Jagadish Chandra Haldar, who has been with Nahoum & Sons for 49 years, said the directive to stop selling chicken items and to close on Jewish holidays came from Adam in Jan. ""Thereafter we stopped making chicken items. We continue to sell the much-in-demand fish pantheras and egg chops,"" Haldar added.Adam, a physician in Jerusalem, has maintained close ties with the shop, visiting Kolkata twice a year. His father Issac died last year.Initially, the shop was closed on Saturdays. However, for several decades, it observed Sunday as its closure day, aligning with other shops in New Market. It has now reverted to closing on Saturdays and opening on Sundays from 9.30am-1pm, coinciding with the hours when some sections of the market are operational.It will also close on Jewish holidays, including Rosh Hashanah and Passover.As a family-run business, it was their prerogative to set the rules, another employee said. ""We simply follow instructions. Perhaps, previous family members who managed the business were not as religiously inclined,"" he said.According to Jael Silliman, an author documenting Kolkata's Jewish community, practicing kosher in the city became increasingly difficult after the mid-1980s as the Jewish population declined.","Nahoum & Sons, the iconic bakery operating out of New Market in the heart of Kolkata, has decided to remove chicken items from its menu.

PM Surya Laxmi Yojna: Free 3KW Solar Rooftop Installation in Madhya Pradesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/pay-nothing-to-set-up-a-3-kw-solar-rooftop-plant-in-madhya-pradesh/articleshow/112003038.cms,"The estimated cost of a 3KW solar rooftop plant as per Union govt specifications is Rs 1,65,000.

BHOPAL: Can you set up a solar rooftop plant without paying any money? Yes, the Madhya Pradesh govt is coming up with a new ambitious scheme named ""PM Surya Laxmi Yojna"" that encourages more than 1 crore power consumers to install solar rooftop plants without incurring any cost.This will reduce the electricity subsidy provided by state govt month-on-month and help the power distribution companies (discoms) to meet clean energy requirement.The scheme proposes that the Union govt under its solar rooftop policy provides subsidies to the tune of 60% of the cost of the plant while the state aims to provide 10% of the remaining 40% amount as margin money to the banks upfront and get the balance amount financed at 7% interest.Thus, the consumer will not be burdened to pay additional money for installing the solar rooftop plant and the financed amount can be paid back to the bank by selling off surplus energy generated each month.It's a win-win situation for the state govt and power distribution companies (discoms) that are burdened with power subsidies and the consumers.According to state govt estimates there are a total of 1.26 crore domestic consumers in Madhya Pradesh. Of these, 1.08 crore consumers are beneficiaries of the Atal Griha Jyoti Yojana, i.e., their consumption is less than 150 units of electricity per month, and they are subsidized at the rate of Rs 568 per month by the state govt. And among these 1.08 crore consumers, 62.7 lakh consumers are those who consume between 100 and 150 units of electricity per month. They are the target of the new scheme.As of now, after state govt subsidy, these 1.08 crore consumers pay between Rs 100 and Rs 408 per month to the respective discoms. But after installing solar rooftop plants at the current tariff they will be required to pay only Rs 36 to Rs 183 per month.Under the proposed scheme of the MP govt, the estimated cost of a 3KW solar rooftop plant as per Union govt specifications is Rs 1,65,000. Of this, GoI provides a subsidy of 60% i.e. Rs 99,000 and the state would provide the banks a margin money of 10% i.e. 16,500. The remaining 30% i.e. Rs 49,500 would be financed by the banks at 7% interest.""The consumers will get a solar rooftop at zero investment-they will get lower bills and once the bank instalments are paid, they will also earn some extra income by selling surplus power,"" said a top official.""On the other hand, as on date, the MP govt spends more than Rs 5,500 crore annually only for the subsidy on Atal Griha Jyoti Yojana. After installation of RTS plants under proposed Surya Laxmi scheme, the state govt will only have to pay the subsidy once, which is a maximum of Rs 16,500 per consumer. Besides, the govt and consumers, the discoms stand to gain as they will get the benefit of purchasing power at lower rates and selling it at a higher rate. It will provide the benefits of decentralized generation,"" energy department sources said.""Under the proposed scheme, only those consumers who are beneficiaries of the Atal Griha Jyoti Yojana will be eligible for the margin money subsidy by the state govt. For all other consumers only the subsidy provided by the central govt will be available. In the first phase 1,00,000 such rooftop installations will be targeted,"" said sources.","The Madhya Pradesh govt is coming up with a new ambitious scheme named ""PM Surya Laxmi Yojna"" The state aims to provide 10% of the remaining 40% amount as margin money to the banks upfront.

GURGAON: Faridabad was Haryana 's most polluted city and the second-most polluted city in India in the first half of 2024, according to a study by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air ( CREA ).The city's air quality was assessed based on PM 2.5 concentrations, which averaged at 103 g/m³.Gurgaon was the fourth-most polluted city in the country in the same period, its average PM2.5 at 99 g/m³.These findings underscore the critical risk to health that air pollution poses in NCR. The top 5 most polluted cities are Byrnihat (Meghalaya), Faridabad, Delhi, Gurgaon and Bhagalpur (Bihar).The CREA report presents a dismal scenario, revealing that Faridabad surpassed the World Health Organization's (WHO) daily PM2.5 guideline of 15 g/m³ on every day between Jan and June this year.Moreover, it exceeded the daily limit under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards ( NAAQS ) of 60 g/m³ on a staggering 164 out of 182 days.Faridabad is the sole non-attainment city in Haryana under the country's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), as its air quality didn't meet the national ambient air quality standards between 2011 and 2015.NCAP was launched in 2019. A total of 131 cities are covered under this programme.The situation in neighbouring Gurgaon and Ballabgarh is not much better either. While Gurgaon's average PM2.5 concentration was the fourth-highest in India in the last six months, Ballabgarh was ninth on the list at 94 g/m³.Both cities reported PM2.5 levels above the NAAQS limit for over 160 days during this period. These findings underscore a critical environmental health issue in Haryana, with air pollution levels consistently breaching safe standards, posing a significant risk to public health and necessitating urgent action.Other cities on the most polluted list were Bhagalpur (5th-most polluted), Sri Ganganagar (6), Greater Noida (7), Muzaffarnagar (8), Ballabgarh (9), Bhiwadi (10), Hanumangarh (11), Chhapra (12), Patna (13), Mandi Gobindgarh (14), Angul (15), Noida (16), Muzaffarpur (17), Saharsa (18), Asansol (19), and Rohtak (20).Sunil Dahiya, analyst at CREA, said: ""As many as 21 of the 24 Haryana cities that were included in the study, except Palwal, Ambala and Mandikhera, exceeded the NAAQS PM2.5 limit for most of this period. The authorities need to focus on two areas. First, the data quality and placement of ambient air quality monitors for these three cities should be investigated, as it is peculiar that some cities are showing unusually low values in the area's polluted airshed, which raises questions on the data recorded by these cities. Second, it is crucial to formulate a larger airshed-level clean air action plan, which also enforces systematic and comprehensive pollution strategies for these cities and addresses sources beyond the municipal corporation boundaries of these cities.""Officials from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said Faridabad's air quality has improved compared to past years. Between Oct 2021 and Sept 2022, the average PM2.5 level was 101.5 g/m³, which improved to 89 g/m³ in Oct 2022-Sept 2023, a senior official said.""This represents a 12% dip, indicating an improvement in air quality compared to previous years. There has been a reduction in pollutants, but it is true that the condition has not changed completely. Coal-based industries have been shifted out of Faridabad, and many have converted to PNG. Road infrastructure has also improved in the last three years, and awareness about pollution has also increased. But we still have miles to go. We are working towards achieving clean air,"" the official said.The NCAP initially set a target of reducing PM2.5 and PM10 in the selected cities by 20%-30% by 2024, taking the pollution levels in 2017 as the base year to improve upon.In Sept 2022, the Centre set a new target of a 40% reduction in PM2.5 concentration compared to 2017 in cities covered under NCAP by 2026. To meet these targets, it has released around Rs 6,897 crore to these cities.PM2.5 refers to air particles that are 2.5 microns in diameter, which is approximately 1/30th the width of a strand of human hair.It comprises fine, toxic particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs, enter the bloodstream, and cause heart disease, stroke, and other respiratory ailments. PM2.5 data is a widely employed measure for assessing the impacts of air pollution on health.","Faridabad was Haryana's most polluted city and the second-most polluted city in India in the first half of 2024.

The incident, which affected 8.5 million PCs, has prompted Microsoft to reassess the resilience of its operating system and consider limiting kernel-level access for third-party security vendors .John Cable, Microsoft's vice president of program management for Windows servicing and delivery, outlined the company's stance in a blog post titled ""Windows resiliency: Best practices and the path forward."" Cable emphasised the need for ""end-to-end resilience"" and hinted at potential changes that could restrict kernel access for security software.The CrowdStrike update bug, which resulted in widespread system crashes, has highlighted the risks associated with allowing third-party applications to operate at the kernel level. This privileged access, while beneficial for threat detection, can lead to catastrophic failures if errors occur.Microsoft is now exploring alternatives that don't rely on kernel access, such as VBS enclaves and the Azure Attestation service. These technologies, which utilize Zero Trust approaches, could provide enhanced security without the risks associated with kernel-level operations.The tech giant's push for change may face resistance from cybersecurity vendors and regulators. A similar attempt to restrict kernel access in Windows Vista in 2006 was met with opposition. In contrast, Apple successfully locked down kernel access in macOS in 2020.Microsoft's approach involves collaboration with partners and the broader security community. The company aims to balance improved system resilience with the needs of security vendors who have historically relied on kernel-level access for their products.Microsoft's response to the CrowdStrike incident also included deploying over 5,000 support engineers to assist affected organizations and providing ongoing updates through the Windows release health dashboard. The company has emphasized the importance of business continuity planning, secure data backups, and utilizing cloud-native approaches for managing Windows devices to enhance resilience against future incidents.",CrowdStrike update last week resulted in widespread system crashes.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"Britain is 'broke and broken', newly-elected Labour govt claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-is-broke-and-broken-newly-elected-labour-govt-claims/articleshow/112073382.cms,"UK's New Labour Government Likely To Drop Challenge To ICC Over Netanyahu's Arrest Warrant

Britain 's government has declared the country ""broke and broken"" ahead of an evaluation of public finances on Monday, which the newly-elected Labour Party will use to blame a 20 billion pound ($26 billion) shortfall to their predecessors. Labour, which won in a landslide victory on July 4, claims that the situation in many areas of public policy is worse than expected.Finance minister Rachel Reeves is set to present the results of a fiscal review to parliament, accusing the Conservative Party , which governed for the past 14 years, of making unfunded spending commitments to gain public favor.According to a statement from Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office, “The assessment will show that Britain is broke and broken - revealing the mess that populist politics has made of the economy and public services.” The statement adds, ""It will show that the previous government made significant funding commitments for this financial year without knowing where the money would come from.""The Conservative Party has dismissed Labour’s claims of a financial 'black hole' as a pretext for tax increases that were not disclosed during the election campaign. Some economists also expressed skepticism, arguing that Labour should have anticipated most issues before taking office.Reeves will also announce the date for her first budget, commission independent forecasts to be published alongside that budget, and outline plans for the formal spending review process. This process determines the budget allocation for each department. Additionally, Reeves is expected to approve above-inflation pay raises for teachers and health workers.The exact approach Labour will take to address the identified shortfall remains unclear. Reeves is limited by election promises not to raise rates of income tax, National Insurance social security payments, value-added tax, and corporation tax.Media reports suggest that Reeves might use Monday’s statement to suggest other tax increases in the subsequent budget. The Financial Times reported that some road and hospital building projects might be delayed.Although the government’s statement did not specify any measures, senior Labour minister Pat McFadden emphasised, “We will not shy away from being honest with the public about the reality of what we have inherited.”Labour has spent the initial weeks of their term focusing on the difficult financial situation they inherited, aiming to set realistic expectations among the public. The party’s immediate emphasis is on transparency and detailing the challenges left by the previous administration.","UK government declares country ""broke and broken"" ahead of evaluation of public finances.

"'World first': Juice spacecraft to flyby by Earth and Moon, then slingshot to Jupiter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/world-first-juice-spacecraft-to-flyby-by-earth-and-moon-then-slingshot-to-jupiter/articleshow/112073067.cms,"'Space Potato': NASA Shows What Mars' Moon Phobos Looks Like

The European Space Agency 's Juice probe , launched in April 2023, is set to perform a groundbreaking manoeuvre next month as it journeys through the Solar System to Jupiter. The spacecraft, currently 10 million kilometres from Earth, will utilise the gravity of both the Moon and Earth to conserve fuel on its eight-year voyage to investigate the potential for extra-terrestrial life on Jupiter 's icy moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa.Preparations for this complex manoeuvre have begun at the ESA's space operations centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Juice is expected to reach Jupiter's system in July 2031, taking a longer route than Nasa's Europa Clipper spacecraft, which is scheduled to launch this October and arrive a year earlier.The decision to take the scenic route is partly due to the limitations of the Ariane 5 rocket used to launch Juice, which was not powerful enough for a direct shot to Jupiter, approximately 800 million kilometres away.""The only solution is to use gravitational assists,"" explained Arnaud Boutonnet, the ESA's head of analysis for the mission. By flying close to planets, spacecrafts can leverage their gravitational pull to change course, speed up, or slow down. While many other space missions have used planets for gravity boosts, the upcoming Earth-Moon flyby will be a ""world first"", according to the ESA, as it will be the first ""double gravity assist manoeuvre"" using boosts from two worlds in succession.Juice will pass 750 kilometres above the Moon on August 19 before zooming past Earth the next day, leaving at a speed of ""3.3 kilometres a second -- instead of three kilometres if we had not added the Moon"", Boutonnet noted.During its flyby, Juice will capture photos and test its numerous instruments, while some amateur skygazers on Earth may be able to spot the probe as it passes over Southeast Asia using telescopes or powerful binoculars.The manoeuvre has been meticulously planned for years, but it will not be without challenges. ""We are aiming for a mouse hole,"" Boutonnet emphasised, noting that even the slightest error during the Moon slingshot could be amplified by Earth's gravity, potentially risking the spacecraft entering and burning up in Earth's atmosphere. The ground team will closely monitor the spacecraft and have a 12-18 hour window to calculate and adjust its trajectory if necessary.If the manoeuvre is successful, Juice will continue its journey through interplanetary space , heading to Venus for another boost in 2025 and flying past Earth twice more in 2026 and 2029 before finally setting course for Jupiter. Once at Jupiter, Juice will perform an impressive 35 gravitational assists as it bounces around the planet's ocean moons, with its trajectory resembling ""a real plate of spaghetti"", according to Boutonnet, who added, ""What we're doing with the Earth-Moon system is a joke in comparison.""","Juice probe will use gravity of both the Moon and Earth to conserve fuel on its eight-year voyage to Jupiter.

Fires are becoming ever bigger

The Park Fire: California's largest blaze this year

Fires across the West

Increasingly severe wildfires

Nonstop fires

Controlled burns

as a solution

The future of wildfire management

Thousands of firefighters are battling a rapidly growing wildfire in northern California after the blaze more than doubled in size within 24 hours. The Park Fire , which has now consumed over 350,000 acres (141,640 hectares), is located approximately 90 miles (144 km) north of Sacramento, the state capital, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).As of Saturday afternoon, the fire remained 0% contained. However, cooler temperatures and more humid air are expected in the region, potentially aiding efforts to slow the fire's spread. Despite these hopeful conditions, the fire has already destroyed 134 structures.Experts say that decades of extinguishing fires at the first sign of smoke, combined with the effects of climate change , have set the stage for a massive wildfire in northern California and numerous smaller blazes across the western US and Canada.These fires are moving faster and proving harder to fight than those in the past. The only way to prevent future wildfires from becoming so fierce is to use smaller controlled fires, a method indigenous people employed for centuries, experts suggest. However, they acknowledge that implementing this change won't be easy.The Park Fire, the largest blaze in California this year, spanned 544 square miles (1,409 square kilometers) as of Saturday. It ignited on Wednesday when a man reportedly pushed a burning car into a gully in Chico and then blended in with others fleeing the scene.The intensity and rapid spread of the fire led officials to draw unfavorable comparisons to the Camp Fire of 2018, which devastated nearby Paradise, killing 85 people and destroying 11,000 homes.Communities across the U.S. West and Canada were also under siege from fast-moving flames on Saturday. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, more than 110 active fires covering 2,800 square miles (7,250 square kilometers) were burning in the U.S. on Friday.""Amped up"" is how Jennifer Marlon, a research scientist at Yale’s School of the Environment, described the recent fires. While there may not necessarily be more wildfires, they are larger and more severe due to the warming atmosphere.""The big message is that seeing extreme wildfires is just part of a series of unnatural disasters that we are going to continue seeing because of climate change,"" Marlon said.Benjamin Hatchett, a fire meteorologist with the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University, noted that ten of California’s 20 largest fires occurred in the last five years. The Park Fire ranked eighth as of Saturday morning and continued to spread. Hatchett attributed the increase in fire severity to climate change, which creates more variability in weather conditions.""We have a lot of very, very wet years and very, very dry years,"" Hatchett said. ""And so we get a lot of this variability that helps to accumulate and then dry out fuels.""This year, record-setting temperatures in California dried up the plant growth from recent wetter-than-average years, creating ideal conditions for widespread large wildfires.""We’re starting to push the limits of firefighting resource availability,"" Hatchett said.Today's fires don't allow firefighters a chance to rest, burning with extreme intensity straight through the night and into the next day, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.""We’re also seeing fires burning over a longer fire season than we used to,"" Swain said.The severity and heat of these fires can transform forests into different ecosystems. In some areas, trees are replaced with flammable invasive grasses due to climate change, affecting the ability of ecosystems to recover.In some parts of the country, like the Midwest, farmers use fire to control trees, woody shrubs, and invasive species. However, in the western U.S., fires have been extinguished in their infancy for decades.Tim Brown, a research professor at the Desert Research Institute and director of the Western Regional Climate Center in Reno, Nevada, pointed out that accumulated fuel in these areas causes fires to burn hotter and more intensely than natural fires would.Fires were once common in the West due to lightning strikes and indigenous burning, but this practice stopped during colonial settlement. Hatchett emphasized the need to return to controlled burns.""That’s the only way we’re really going to get out of this, is to really accept and embrace the use of fire on our terms,"" Hatchett said. ""Otherwise, we’re going to get fire on the fire’s terms, which is like what we’re seeing right now.""However, Swain acknowledged that conducting controlled burns is challenging in today's landscape, where millions of acres cannot burn unchecked.""This is something we need to be doing more of. But the practical reality of doing so is not at all simple,"" Swain said.Despite the challenges, Swain said there is no option to address the wildfire risk that doesn't involve fire.""We’re going to see more and more fire on the ground,"" he said. ""The question is whether we want to see it in the form of more manageable, primarily beneficial prescribed burns, or in these primarily harmful, huge, intense conflagrations that we’re increasingly seeing.""","The Park Fire, the largest blaze in California this year, spanned 544 square miles (1,409 square kilometers) as of Saturday.

In a dramatic act of protest , a pair of passengers took their frustration with Delta Airlines to a new level by raiding the airline’s VIP lounge after experiencing significant flight delays . Their bold antics, which included loading up on free food, emptying hand sanitizer dispensers, and more, have captured widespread attention online.A video documenting the escapade has garnered over 600,000 views on TikTok.Content creator Kyle Philippi, who posted the footage, captioned it, “POV: Delta doesn’t compensate for thousands of dollars lost from delaying our flights for days so we gonna get it back in the Sky Club. This will set them back.”The video’s timing seems to align with last week’s Microsoft outage, which led to Delta canceling thousands of flights and affecting approximately half a million passengers, according to the AP.The footage opens with Philippi and an accomplice filling their plates with an excessive array of complimentary food at Delta’s Sky Club lounge.
