NEW DELHI: Indian Armed Forces targeted the headquarters of banned terror groups Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in a series of precision strikes carried out at nine sites in Pakistan under Operation Sindoor in early hours of Wednesday, PTI reported citing officials.Bahawalpur emerged as the stronghold of JeM terror group following the release of Masood Azhar in 1999, secured in exchange for the hostages of hijacked flight IC-814. Since then, the group has been linked to a series of major attacks in India, including the 2000 strike on the Jammu and Kashmir assembly, the 2001 Parliament attack, the 2016 assault on the Pathankot Air Force base, and the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing.Azhar, a UN-designated global terrorist, has remained out of public view since April 2019.

‘Pak to hike def spending by 18 per cent'

An IED blast carried out by Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) targeting a Pakistan army convoy in MachKachhi district on Monday killed at least eight soldiers, including a special operations commander, and injured six others.BLA said its freedom fighters targeted the army convoy using a remote-controlled device. The blast destroyed the enemy vehicle, killing multiple personnel, it said. The Pakistan armed force’s media and public relations wing, ISPR, alleged India’s involvement in the attack, a claim that has become a recurring narrative in such incidents. “Terrorists belonging to the Indian proxy, so called Baloch Liberation Army, targeted security forces’ vehicles with an improvised explosive device in the general area Mach-Kachhi district. Resultantly, seven personnel embraced shahadat,” ISPR said.However, according to a list of deceased released by local officials, eight personnel were killed in the attack. The army vehicle was hit between the Amir Post and the Ali Khan base in the Gestri area, according to local enforcement officers.The attack is the latest in a series of strikes against the Pakistan army in Balochistan, highlighting the ongoing tensions in the region.Three days ago, BLA attacked a prison van by blocking a key highway. While the prisoners were freed, five policemen were taken hostage.Pakistan’s coalition govt has endorsed an 18% increase in defence spending to over Rs 2.5 trillion in the next budget due to tensions with India, according to a media report on Tuesday.

The PML-N-led govt shared the roughly Rs 17.5 trillion worth of new budget framework with PPP, which agreed to the 18% increase in defence outlay.There was a consensus between the allies to increase the defence budget due to the recent wave of tensions with India, the newspaper said.

NEW DELHI: A drill to check Delhi's preparedness for emergency situations such as air raids, blackouts and evacuations in case of attacks is all set to take place in 55 locations across the capital at 4pm Wednesday, as part of a national exercise.Under ' Operation Abhyaas ', air-raid sirens will be sounded and residents will be trained on evacuation protocols, and search and rescue operations, among other measures.While a total blackout may not take place as it will require coordination with the Northern Powergrid and may bring the city to a standstill, officials said sporadic power cuts may be carried out in pockets.In Ghaziabad, sirens will go off twice, at 10am and 8pm. In Gurgaon, a voluntary ""blackout"" will be observed between 7pm and 8pm. Noida, which does not have a civil defence unit, will have a different drill.The drill is aimed at gauging how quickly the civilian population responds to an emergency, such as an air strike, in a war-like situation.The directive for the drill came from the Union home ministry in light of “new and complex threats” emerging due to heightened tensions with Pakistan following the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, where 26 civilians — 25 of them tourists — were shot dead on April 22.Officials said the drill will take place simultaneously at 55 locations across the 11 districts of the capital. These will include educational institutions, markets, residential pockets, housing societies, hospitals, and govt installations. More than 7,000 Civil Defence volunteers and 1,800 Aapda Mitras, who are trained in disaster response by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), will be at the forefront of the drill, along with local police, traffic police, fire services, and home guards, besides the departments of revenue, health, transport, education, and power, among others.CM Rekha Gupta said the national capital was “fully prepared” for the drill. “Every activity is being undertaken as per the directions of the Centre,” she said. A senior revenue department official said the exercise will be a test of how well-oiled, robust, and alert the civil defence mechanism is.The day will start with special training programmes for students in 660 schools – 550 private and 110 state-run – on disaster response. Officials said a demonstration video has been shared to help schools understand how to conduct a drill.The directorate of education issued a circular Tuesday, directing schools to ensure full participation in the drill and to cooperate with the visiting DDMA teams “in the right spirit, with the aim of promoting a culture of safety, preparedness and civic responsibility among students”. Officials added that the drills will continue and training will be imparted to students in all schools over the next fortnight.Volunteer platform Yuvamanthan will depute teams to assist schools with the awareness programmes and basic drills for hostile threat preparedness, an official said. “The demonstration video shared with the schools shows teachers responding to an alarm by closing doors, windows and curtains, and switching off electrical appliances. Students are instructed to take cover under their desks or near walls, protecting their heads with their school bags and hands. Senior students will also be trained to guide the younger ones and help maintain calm,” said an official.The civil defence exercise will also involve the district controller, various district authorities, civil defence wardens and volunteers, home guards (both active and reservists), as well as members of National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS), Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS) and students from schools and colleges. The directorate of education has asked all govt and private aided schools to submit a report, along with photographs of the drill, to their respective district education offices on Wednesday.The drill for civilians will begin in the evening. Standard operating procedures have been distributed to all departments, resident and market associations, and institutions, and a communication strategy has been developed, an official said. Civilians will familiarise themselves with the sounds of the air-raid siren — long wails for alerts and short bursts for all-clear — identify nearest shelter locations such as basements, underground car parks or designated safe zones and keep ready items such as a torch, emergency kit and water bottles, among others, the official said. “Following the drill, we will carry out a complete assessment of the state of equipment and communication devices,” an official said.","The drill is aimed at gauging how quickly the civilian population responds to an emergency, such as an air strike, in a war-like situation.

IAF to launch major drill on Pakistan border from today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-to-launch-major-drill-on-pakistan-border-from-today/articleshow/120947512.cms,"IAF to launch major drill on Pakistan border from today

NEW DELHI: India will launch a major air combat exercise close to the international border in Rajasthan with frontline fighters like Rafales, Mirage-2000s & Sukhoi-30MKIs as well as force-multipliers, in some more muscle-flexing to keep Pakistan on the edge after naval drills in the north Arabian Sea.A NOTAM (notice to airmen) for airspace reservation has been issued for the exercise over a large area hugging the border with Pakistan from 3.30pm on Wednesday to 9.30pm on Thursday, officials said.The public warning came as Indian and Pakistan armies Tuesday talked over the director-general of military operations (DGMO) hotline, while they continued to exchange small arms fire at multiple places across Line of Control for the 12th successive night.The high-tempo air drill, which the IAF described as a ""routine pre-planned training exercise"", will include the entire spectrum of day and night warfare under simulated hostile conditions. This is in keeping with the high operational readiness being maintained by the Indian armed forces, as various military options against Pakistan are being kept open by govt.Fighters, helicopters, remotely-piloted aircraft and force-enablers like IL-78 mid-air refuellers and airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft will be deployed from different air bases for the exercise. Rajasthan itself has some key airbases like Jaisalmer, Uttarlai, Suratgarh, Nal and Phalodi.The IAF exercise mirrors the Navy's multiple drills conducted in the northern Arabian Sea last week, with several frontline warships being deployed and BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other weapon systems being tested. One specified zone was just around 80-85 nautical miles from where the Pakistan navy was undertaking its own drills.The show of force has now been extended from the maritime to the air domain. The IAF has been undertaking regular combat air patrols (CAPs) amid the heightened tensions with Pakistan, while it has also increased the number of operational readiness platforms (ORPs) at airbases on the western front.Over the DGMO hotline, through which talks traditionally take place every Tuesday, the Indian Army is learnt to have raised the issue of Pakistan army posts opening ""unprovoked"" small arms fire at several locations across the 778-km long LoC.The exchanges with rifles and LMGs took place in areas like Kupwara, Baramulla, Poonch, Rajouri, Mendhar, Naushera, Sunderbani and Akhnoor on Monday night, with Indian troops ""responding promptly in a proportionate manner"", an officer said.While heavy-calibre weapons like 155mm artillery guns and 120mm mortars are not yet being used by either side, this upward spiral in ceasefire violations (CFVs) - since the Pahalgam terror massacre - was last witnessed when India had scrapped the provisions of Article 370 in Aug 2019.It had led to a particularly violent 2020, with as many as 5,133 CFVs of firing and artillery duels being recorded that year. In Feb 2021, the two DGMOs had reached a fresh understanding to maintain peace and tranquillity along the LoC and the 198-km international boundary in J&K. Earlier, in May 2018, a similar understanding between the DGMOs had gradually withered away with escalation in cross-border hostilities.","India will launch a major air combat exercise close to the international border in Rajasthan.

Though he did not elaborate, the assertion was seen as another sign that the counsel of a few foreign capitals for restraint might not be a determining factor in how the Modi govt responds to the Pakistan-backed terror attack.""For decades, we had this negative mindset where people would worry before taking a big decision, 'what will the world think, will we get votes or not'?

As she lists one mansion, Taylor Swift transforms another possibly for life with Travis Kelce

After taking some well-earned time off, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are slowly easing back into their busy schedules. Following the Kansas City Chiefs ’ Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in February and the conclusion of Taylor’s monumental “The Eras Tour,” the couple took a step back from the spotlight to relax and reconnect in private.As Swift renovates her Rhode Island mansion into a potential family home, Kelce is back to training for what could be his final NFL season while also upgrading his lifestyle to match their evolving relationship.Taylor Swift is already focused on her next musical chapter, with a new album in development and plans reportedly underway for a 2026 tour, according to sources. Meanwhile, she’s also making moves in real estate, listing her former Cape Cod mansion owned briefly between 2012 and 2013 for sale.The most notable step is Taylor Swift’s decision to renovate her $17.75 million mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. This historic 12,000-square-foot estate, perched on a scenic coastal cliff, is undergoing a $1.7 million transformation to become a primary residence. The upgrades include expanding the bedroom suite and lounge by 400 square feet, redesigning the kitchen, and adding a new bedroom.The living room is also being remodeled, and the front portico will be reconstructed. Permits were quietly filed in late 2024, with construction expected to finish by the end of 2025. Sources suggest Swift envisions this property as a future family retreat with Kelce.Now, as the off-season winds down, Travis Kelce is back at the Chiefs’ training facility, gearing up for what many believe could be his final NFL season. With a decorated career behind him, this upcoming chapter is set to be both meaningful and emotional.Alongside his return to football, Travis Kelce is also continuing his popular podcast, New Heights, which he co-hosts with his older brother and former Philadelphia Eagle, Jason Kelce. The podcast has become a fan favorite, offering a candid and often humorous glimpse into their lives both on and off the field.Parallel to Swift’s efforts, Travis Kelce is also making big changes to accommodate their shared future. In response to safety concerns following a high-profile burglary at his Kansas City mansion where over $100,000 in valuables were stolen Kelce has significantly enhanced the security of his home. He installed a $40,000 alarm system, multiple CCTV cameras, motion detectors, and floodlights.Additionally, he built a fortified safe room and an underground man cave. Two guard dogs, costing $9,000, and 24/7 private security at $6,000 per month have also been added. These improvements are largely aimed at ensuring Taylor Swift feels safe during visits, especially given the intense public and media attention surrounding their relationship.Beyond these two main properties, Swift is reportedly eyeing new real estate in Nashville and Kansas City. Nashville, her long-time base, offers proximity to family and friends, while Kansas City would place her closer to Kelce during the NFL season. Sources indicate that the couple may even be considering purchasing a home together in Kansas City, a move that strongly suggests they are planning for a more settled, domestic life.Also Read: “External forces trying to unbalance them”: Living Nostradamus claims cosmic fate ties Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, warns of looming challenges ahead All these developments point to a serious turn in their relationship.

Former first lady Michelle Obama admitted to having been taking therapy to help her tune up for the next phase of her life. he admission came amid speculations over her troubled marriage with former president Barack Obama, though Michelle put the speculations to rest. Then, what's this next phase? Speaking with Jay Shetty, Michelle Obama said that she's transitioning into an empty nester with both her daughters -- Sasha and Malia -- finding their own lives.Michelle Obama has been appearing on several podcasts, including her own, that she does with her brother Craig Robinson -- following a mysterious spell of absence from public life. She missed Jimmy Carter's funeral and then the inauguration of President Donald Trump -- only to fuel speculations that she and Barack were going separate ways.But now Michelle Obama is back and addressing every issue, starting from her marriage problems to skipping Trump's inauguration and also about seeking therapy.“So, I’m getting that tune-up for this next phase because I believe this is a whole ‘nother phase in life for me. And I now have the wisdom to know—let me go get some coaching while I’m doing it,” she said about her next phase.Michelle said that phase of life where she struggled to keep the family together has ended with her daughters ""being launched"".Therapy, she said, helps her unwind some old habits and ""sort through some old guilt"".Though Michelle Obama dismissed divorce speculations and said neither she nor Barack quit the marriage despite the hardship, a recent move of the Obamas kept the divorce rumors going.

Saquon Barkley net worth 2025 and his current salary



Saquon Barkley investments



Saquon Barkley has never been just another running back. Ever since entering the NFL as the No. 2 overall pick in 2018, Barkley has consistently delivered electrifying performances that make him a true standout. From his early accolades—being named both Rookie of the Year and a Pro Bowler—to his unexpected switch from the Giants to the Eagles in 2024, his journey has kept fans glued to the screen.Now with the Eagles, Barkley continues to redefine his position. In a historic November game, he shattered the franchise record with 255 rushing yards and 302 total yards, proving once again that he can single-handedly turn the tide. Off the field, his financial acumen has mirrored his on-field success, solidifying him as not just a player—but a brand.Saquon Barkley’s 2025 has become a defining chapter in his already stellar NFL career. With an estimated net worth of $32 million, as reported by Forbes, Marca, and Pro Football Network , Barkley’s financial journey mirrors his dominance on the field. A substantial portion of his wealth stems from his NFL contracts, which have now placed him in a league of his own.Initially, Barkley joined the Philadelphia Eagles in March 2024 on a three-year, $37.75 million deal, leaving behind his tenure with the New York Giants. That deal guaranteed $26 million and an annual salary of $12 million. But what followed in the 2024–2025 season was nothing short of extraordinary.Leading the league with 2,005 rushing yards in the regular season, Barkley powered the Eagles to a triumphant Super Bowl LIX win. On March 4, 2025, his excellence was rewarded with a two-year, $41.2 million extension. As reported by CBS Sports, this new deal includes $36 million guaranteed and can reach an additional $15 million through incentives—making Barkley the highest-paid running back in NFL history with an average annual salary of $20.6 million.“Barkley earned $250,000 in incentives for surpassing 1,000 rushing yards and helping Philly win the NFC Championship,” noted CBS Sports contributor Joel Corry. That bonus will also elevate his base salary by $250,000 in both 2025 and 2026.With elite performance, unmatched dedication, and savvy contract moves, Barkley continues to redefine what success looks like for an NFL running back—on and off the gridiron.Saquon Barkley is not just a force on the field—he’s equally strategic when it comes to his money. From early in his career, Barkley made it clear that he wasn't just thinking about short-term gains but planning for long-term stability. “I’m going to invest my money and live off the endorsement deals,” he had shared in 2018, even before signing with the New York Giants, taking a cue from athletes like Marshawn Lynch.That vision has materialized impressively. Barkley has invested in sectors he believes in, including consumer goods and agriculture. One of his standout moves came in 2021 when he backed X2 PERFORMANCE with $16 million. The brand, known for its clean energy supplements, aligns with his athlete-first philosophy. His endorsement portfolio—featuring giants like Nike, Visa, Pepsi, Dunkin' Donuts, and Toyota—is reportedly worth $10 million. His recent Unisom commercial, where he lightheartedly trolled the Giants, reflects both his business savvy and his playful personality.Beyond brand partnerships, Barkley’s financial discipline extends into real estate. In 2018, he bought a $424,500 home in Whitehall, Pennsylvania, as a heartfelt gift to his parents—one of his earliest dreams fulfilled. That property's value has since appreciated to around $650,000. He also owns a $3.5 million luxury penthouse in Jersey City, boasting sweeping Manhattan views and upscale amenities—a symbol of his refined urban lifestyle.Barkley’s evolving investment journey, including forays into cryptocurrency, underscores his proactive approach to wealth. It’s clear he’s not just securing his future—he’s building it brick by brick.Also Read: NFL stars light up the 2025 Met Gala with Joe Burrow, Justin Jefferson and Saquon Barkley stealing the show","Saquon Barkley is the highest-paid running back in NFL history with an average annual salary of $20.6 million.

REAL ID deadline hits May 7: TSA to enforce new airport rules



How and where to get a REAL ID



In-person applications

REAL ID applications must typically be completed in person. Applicants must bring:

Proof of identity (e.g., birth certificate or passport)

Proof of Social Security number

Two proofs of residency (e.g., utility bill, lease agreement)

As the May 7, 2025, deadline for REAL ID enforcement approaches, millions of Americans are rushing to obtain compliant identification cards. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will soon require travelers to present a REAL ID or other federally accepted identification at airport security checkpoints. However, this urgency has triggered a sharp rise in online scams designed to exploit consumers. From fake websites to phishing texts and misleading social media posts, fraudsters are targeting those who may be unfamiliar with the application process or anxious about the impending deadline. These fraudulent schemes aim to steal personal and financial data under the guise of providing expedited REAL ID services.Cybercriminals have launched a variety of fake websites that mimic state DMV portals. These sites request sensitive personal data under the pretense of processing REAL ID applications. Some also charge illegitimate processing fees or redirect users to malicious links.Spoofed emails often accompany these scams. They may contain official-looking logos and language to appear legitimate, asking recipients to “verify” their identity or “complete” their application with a payment of around $35 for so-called “expedited” processing.Phishing text messages have also emerged, with messages instructing users to click on links to apply for or confirm their REAL ID. These messages typically contain shortened URLs and pressure language like “Immediate Action Required.”On social media platforms, scammers have posted advertisements or comments promoting fake REAL ID services. Some link directly to phishing websites, while others encourage users to call fake customer support lines.Consumers should be aware of several red flags when navigating REAL ID applications:If you receive a suspicious message or visit a questionable website:To apply for a REAL ID, individuals should go directly to their state DMV's official website. Each site has a dedicated section for REAL ID information, application instructions, documentation checklists, and online scheduling tools.In the event that personal data has been compromised, individuals are encouraged to place a credit freeze with the three major credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. This prevents any new credit accounts from being opened in their name.Anyone who believes their identity has been stolen should visit identitytheft.gov. This federal resource walks users through the steps of creating a recovery plan and filing reports with the appropriate agencies.Regularly checking bank and credit card statements can help detect fraudulent activity early. Setting up transaction alerts is also recommended.The REAL ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005 in response to security concerns following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It establishes minimum security standards for the issuance of state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards.

They are issued by state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMVs), but adhere to federal guidelines set by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).After multiple postponements, the TSA will begin enforcing the REAL ID requirement on May 7, 2025. Travelers who do not have a REAL ID or another form of approved identification (such as a U.S. passport) will not be permitted to pass through airport security checkpoints for domestic travel.Due to this imminent enforcement date, DMVs across the country have experienced a surge in applications. In Virginia, for example, the Department of Motor Vehicles reported that REAL ID cards accounted for 61% of all active licenses as of April 2025. A total of 166,816 REAL ID cards were issued in Virginia that month alone—a 60% increase compared to March 2025.Many DMVs offer walk-in service as well as online appointment booking.

MLB insider suggests Pirates' pitcher Mitch Kelly can be a perfect replacement for Max Scherzer

“Both Chris Bassitt and Max Scherzer will hit free agency this winter, while Kevin Gausman only has one more year left on his deal, but with so much money already tied up in Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Anthony Santander, Andrés Giménez, José Berríos and more, trading for Keller at a known price point through 2028 almost has to be preferable to another winter of hoping for the best in free agency.”

“Scherzer has been sidelined since the opening week of the season due to the lingering thumb issue, lasting just three innings (45 pitches) in his lone start for Toronto. The setback is the latest in a slew of injuries for the former three-time Cy Young winner as he made a combined 17 starts in the two seasons prior to signing a one-year deal worth $15.5 million to join the Blue Jays.”

The Toronto Blue Jays suffered a setback after their pitching star Max Scherzer was shifted to the injured list for 60 days recently. Previously, the Blue Jays star was shifted on a 15-day injured list but due to the severity of his thumb injury, the duration has been stretched to 60 days.

Reportedly, the Texas Rangers alum experienced a thumb inflammation issue due to which he was shifted to a 15-day injured list.According to the reputed media outlet Bleacher Report’s Kerry Miller, the management of Toronto Blue Jays should look forward to updating their roster for the rest of the MLB season.

Other districts such as Uttara Kannada , Raichur, Mysuru and Mandya will follow later this week.The MHA instructed all states to conduct drills in 244 high-risk districts across the country, divided into three categories based on their vulnerability.

Over 5,000 individuals trained in civil defense will participate in the Bengaluru drill.In Mumbai, air raid sirens will go off at 60 locations across the city at 4pm, signaling the start of the nationwide mock security drills. This will be followed by a 5-minute blackout at certain locations. Civil defense personnel, home guards, and volunteers will assemble at designated locations to assess readiness for a potential war-like situation.The drill aims to gauge how well the city can handle an emergency involving air strikes, evacuations, and casualties. Simultaneous drills are planned across Maharashtra, with over 10,000 civil defense volunteers participating in various locations, including Raigad, Nashik, Pune, and Jalgaon. The exercise will also help refine rescue operations and improve the state's disaster response capabilities.Delhi is set to conduct a major civil defense drill across 55 locations, simulating air strikes, blackouts, and evacuations. The drill is part of ‘Operation Abhyaas,’ designed to assess the city’s preparedness for emergency situations.Civil Defense volunteers, along with local police, fire services, and other agencies, will play a key role. Citizens will familiarize themselves with the siren sounds and learn evacuation protocols, including identifying shelter areas such as basements and designated safe zones.The exercise will also train school children in disaster response procedures. Officials expect the drill to test coordination across various departments and evaluate equipment readiness for a potential emergency.In Chennai, a mock civil defense drill will take place at the Madras Atomic Power Station and the Chennai Port Trust. The exercise will focus on handling an air raid threat and assessing the coordination of civil defense measures.Four locations in Hyderabad will host a civil defense mock drill at 4pm. It will include activating air raid sirens and training civilians on emergency protection measures during hostile attacks.‘Air raid’ sirens will be activated at 4 pm (Incoming Air Raid) within Outer Ring Road (ORR) and there will be another activation of sirens at 4.30 pm to close the mock drill. The measures to be taken during the mock drills include the operationalisation of air-raid warning sirens, training civilians on civil-defence aspects to protect themselves in the event of a ""hostile attack.""In Bengal, over 100 locations will undergo a civil defense drill, including air raid sirens, evacuation training, and damage control. The drills are aimed at enhancing war-readiness, and volunteers and police personnel will participate.Bhopal and Indore: A civil defense drill will be conducted across multiple districts in Madhya Pradesh, including Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior, and others, starting at 4pm.

The exercise will involve blackouts, sirens, and evacuation drills, demonstrating the nation's preparedness.In Rajasthan, India will also conduct a significant air combat drill near the international border, involving advanced fighter jets like Rafales, Mirage-2000s, and Sukhoi-30MKIs, as well as support units like refueling aircraft. This follows naval drills conducted in the north Arabian Sea, showing India's continued military readiness to counter any threats, particularly from Pakistan.A notice to airmen (NOTAM) has been issued for a large airspace area from 3:30 pm on Wednesday to 9:30 pm on Thursday, indicating the timing of the exercise. This announcement comes as Indian and Pakistani military officials held a conversation over the Director-General of Military Operations ( DGMO ) hotline while exchanging small arms fire along the Line of Control (LoC) for the 12th consecutive night.The air combat exercise, described by the Indian Air Force ( IAF ) as a “routine pre-planned training exercise,” will include day and night warfare simulations under hostile conditions, showcasing India’s high operational readiness. Various aircraft, including fighters, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles, will be deployed from different airbases, including those in Rajasthan like Jaisalmer and Suratgarh .This air drill mirrors the Indian Navy's recent exercises in the northern Arabian Sea, where multiple warships and advanced weaponry, including BrahMos missiles, were tested. One of the exercise zones was near the area where the Pakistan Navy had conducted its own drills.The show of force extends from maritime to air operations, with the IAF conducting frequent combat air patrols (CAPs) amid rising tensions with Pakistan. Additionally, the number of operational readiness platforms (ORPs) at airbases along the western front has been increased.The talks over the DGMO hotline also highlighted ongoing ceasefire violations (CFVs), with the Indian Army raising concerns about unprovoked small arms fire from Pakistan's military along the 778-km LoC. The CFVs occurred in multiple areas, including Kupwara, Poonch, and Rajouri, with Indian troops responding promptly. While heavy weapons like artillery are not yet involved, the increase in CFVs echoes the tensions seen after the revocation of Article 370 in 2019, which led to a violent 2020 with over 5,000 CFVs recorded. A ceasefire understanding was reached in February 2021, but tensions have since escalated, threatening the fragile peace along the LoC.",A nationwide mock drill is set to take place today at 4pm in various cities across India.

CARSON CITY: A hearing Wednesday before Nevada's high court could provide the first public window into a secretive legal dispute over who will control Rupert Murdoch 's powerful media empire after he dies.The case has been unfolding behind closed doors in state court in Reno, with most documents under seal. But reporting by The New York Times , which said it obtained some of the documents, revealed Murdoch's efforts to keep just one of his sons, Lachlan, in charge and ensure that Fox News maintains its conservative editorial slant.Media outlets including the Times and The Associated Press are now asking the Nevada Supreme Court to unseal the case and make future hearings public. The court is scheduled to hear arguments in the afternoon in Carson City, the capital.Murdoch's media empire, which also includes The Wall Street Journal and New York Post, spans continents and helped to shape modern American politics. Lachlan Murdoch has been the head of Fox News and News Corp. since his father stepped down in 2023.The issue at the center of the case is Rupert Murdoch's family trust, which after his death would divide control of the company equally among four of his children - Lachlan, Prudence, Elisabeth and James.Irrevocable trusts are typically used to limit estate taxes, among other reasons, and can't be changed without permission from the beneficiaries or via a court order.Rupert Murdoch has attempted to alter the trust, however, and Prudence, Elisabeth and James have united to try to stop that. James and Elisabeth are both known to have less conservative political views than their father or brother, potentially complicating the media mogul's desire to keep Fox News's political tone.The dispute has had many twists and turns, including a probate commissioner ruling against Rupert Murdoch in December.In a 96-page opinion, the commissioner characterized the plan to change the trust as a ""carefully crafted charade"" to ""permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch's executive roles"" inside the empire ""regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries"" of the family trust, according to the Times.Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Rupert Murdoch, told the newspaper at the time that they were disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal. Another evidentiary hearing is scheduled for this month.","The case has been unfolding behind closed doors in state court in Reno, with most documents under seal. Media outlets including the Times and The Associated Press are now asking the Nevada Supreme Court to unseal the case and make future hearings public. The issue at the center of the case is Rupert Murdoch's family trust, which after his death would divide control of the company equally among four of his children.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120951535,imgsize-1163185,width-400,resizemode-4/120951535.jpg"

We have to wait and watch how the enemy reacts to this precision strikes by India. The market is unlikely to be impacted by the retaliatory strike by India since that was known and discounted by the market.The main catalyst of the market resilience in India is the sustained FII buying of the last 14 trading days which has touched a cumulative figure of Rs 43940 crores in the cash market. FIIs are focused on the global macros like weak dollar, slower growth in US and China in 2025 and India’s potential outperformance in growth. This can keep the market resilient. However, investors have to watch the developments in the border. The big shift in market preference in favour of largecaps away from overvalued segments of mid and smallcaps is significant. FIIs, as always, are mainly buying largecaps. This trend can continue.""Among the major Sensex constituents, several companies experienced declines, with HCL Tech, Asian Paints, Nestle India, HUL, Titan, and Sun Pharma leading the downturn, declining by as much as 1.5%. In contrast, positive momentum was seen in Tata Motors, HDFC Bank, Power Grid, SBI, and IndusInd Bank at the market opening.Tata Motors shares jumped more than 4% following the announcement that its shareholders had given approval for the company's proposal to divide into two separate listed entities, with distinct divisions for passenger vehicles (PV) and commercial vehicles (CV).Ajay Bagga, a Banking and Market Expert, told ANI, ""The geopolitical risk that was hanging over the Indian markets has got crystallised today with the Indian strikes on PoK and Pakistan-based terror camps.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
