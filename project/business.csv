Delhi Rain Chaos: Waterlogged Streets, Massive Traffic Jams Hit City After Sudden Change in Weather

YAMUNANAGAR: The Yamuna River, which had remained calm for nearly six weeks, surged into spate on Saturday following heavy rainfall in the hilly regions of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. As a precaution, all 18 gates of the Hathnikund Barrage in Yamunanagar district were opened for the first time this monsoon season, releasing a massive discharge of 1,78,896 cusecs of water downstream.The released water is expected to reach national capital Delhi within the next 30-48 hours, raising the river’s water level and posing a potential flood risk to low-lying areas.Officials of the Haryana irrigation and water resources department (IWRD) sounded alert sirens before opening the barrage gates and issued warnings to residents and farmers to stay away from the riverbanks and keep their livestock at a safe distance. The district administration, as well as the Delhi government, has been informed of the situation.Haryana IWRD superintendent engineer at Yamunanagar, R S Mittal stated that due to heavy rainfall in the hilly catchment areas, water levels rose sharply, necessitating the release. “This is the first time this season that all 18 gates of the Hathnikund Barrage have been opened. Supply to canals has been stopped to manage the increased flow,” Mittal said.As per official categorisation, a discharge of over one lakh cusecs is considered low flood, 1.5 lakh cusecs is termed medium flood, and anything above 2.5 lakh cusecs is classified as high flood. With the current release already exceeding the low flood mark, officials are keeping a close watch on the situation.Water levels in the Yamuna rose steadily since morning on Sunday. At 10 am, the flow was recorded at 74,304 cusecs, which rose to 81,353 cusecs at 11 am; 91,985 cusecs at noon, and 1.16 lakh cusecs by 1 pm. By 3 pm, the discharge peaked at 1.78 lakh cusecs, said the state IWRD officer.Meanwhile, several other rivers and streams in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh are also in spate. The Somb River, a tributary to Yamuna River, which has a capacity of 10,000 cusecs, is currently carrying over 23,000 cusecs of water, threatening villages in its catchment areas. In Dhanaura village and nearby Haripur Khol, local streams have also overflowed, raising fears of inundation. At Ranjitpur, the bridge connecting Haryana to Himachal Pradesh was under pressure as river water flowed over it, causing concern among residents.With monsoon rains continuing in the hills, authorities are on high alert. Residents in vulnerable areas along the Yamuna have been cautioned about possible flooding as Delhi braces for a rise in river levels over the next two days.","All 18 gates of the Hathnikund Barrage in Yamunanagar district were opened for the first time this monsoon season.

Not as a ""drudgery of formulae"" but as an act of ""exploration"".Bhargava, Canadian by nationality but of Indian origin, believes classrooms need an overhaul-""experimental, playful,"" he said, with teachers ""trained"" to spark curiosity. Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of the launch of the Lodha Mathematical Sciences Institute (LMSI), he added: ""I'm happy with the new textbooks and the changes brought in them. But they will only show impact in a few years.""On the scientific advisory council of LMSI, Bhargava will lead sessions on arithmetic statistics, its new developments, and future directions.

Ten senior number theorists have been chosen to seed the effort. As president, Murthy said he plans to travel across the country, meeting mathematicians firsthand and mapping who is doing what.

BJP Hits Out at Congress for Spreading Lies, Creating Anarchy Over EC Row

Articles 200 and 201 envisage that the President will apply his/her own mind to decide whether to assent or withhold assent, and these provisions do not mention any role of Supreme Court under Article 143.

Such a proposition presupposes that only the judiciary can decide questions related to the Constitution, whereas the Constitution contemplates that the legislature, the executive and the judiciary each is competent and authorised to interpret the Constitution within their own domain. The legislature considers the constitutionality of a bill during debate, the President or governor applies their mind while deciding whether to withhold, assent or refer a bill and the judiciary decides the legality of an Act in appropriate proceedings.

Such a proposition converts a constitutional prerogative into a judicial mandate in the nature of a continuing mandamus, which is impermissible.

NEW DELHI: Objecting to the judgment mandating the President to seek Supreme Court's opinion on constitutionality of bills, Union govt has said the judiciary cannot dictate to the President how and when to exercise her unfettered discretion to seek the apex court's opinion and on which issues.Faulting the April 8 judgment of a bench of justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, the Centre, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, said a plain reading of the President's powers under Article 143 ""shows that an absolute discretion lies with the President to seek advice. The term 'consult' means the act of asking for advice and indicates that the President is not bound to do so"".The judgment had advised the President that whenever a governor reserves a bill for her consideration on the ground that it is patently unconstitutional, the President ought to make a reference to SC under Article 143 ""as a measure of prudence"", given that it is for the apex court to determine the constitutionality and legality of orders and laws.Ahead of Tuesday's hearing on the Presidential Reference before a five-judge bench led by CJI B R Gavai, the Centre said, ""Any constitutional proposition of law that there exists a constitutional expectation for the President to refer every reserved bill to the Supreme Court is contrary to the constitutional scheme"". It gave three reasons to repudiate the SC bench's proposition to this effect:Union govt said the Constitution does not empower the judiciary to examine the contents of a bill that is yet to become a legislation, sans assent granted by a governor or the President.""The constitutional courts cannot undertake judicial adjudication over the contents of a pending bill. It is not possible for the constitutional courts to look behind the contents of the bill at a stage wherein it is a pending decision before the governor and adjudicate whether it requires a reference to the President or not,"" it said.It further said a state is barred from filing petitions under Article 32, which is a preserve of citizens to seek redress of violations of their fundamental rights by directly approaching the SC. For any dispute between the state and the Centre, the parties concerned need to approach the SC through a suit under Article 131.The Centre held, ""A state govt cannot file a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution against essentially the governor of the state...""","Union govt says the judiciary cannot dictate to the President how and when to exercise her unfettered discretion to seek the apex court's opinion. The Centre said a plain reading of the President's powers under Article 143 ""shows that an absolute discretion lies with the President to seek advice""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123351995,imgsize-57100,width-400,resizemode-4/123351995.jpg"

DEHRADUN: After the Uttarakhand cabinet decided to introduce the Uttarakhand minority educational institutions bill, 2025, Uttarakhand waqf board chairman Shadab Shams on Sunday extended his congratulations to the Pushkar Singh Dhami government.Speaking to ANI, Uttarakhand waqf board chairman said, ""Many congratulations to the Dhami government. Today, there has been talk of forming a minority education authority in Devbhoomi Uttarakhand. With this, the new minority institutions that will be formed will get approval, and minority does not mean only Muslims, minorities also include Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, so everyone will get rights. I think it is a very positive step taken in that direction.""Meanwhile, the Uttarakhand cabinet made a historic decision by deciding to introduce the Uttarakhand Minority Educational Institutions Bill, 2025, in the coming session of the legislative assembly starting on August 19. Until now, the status of minority educational institutions has been given only to the Muslim community.According to the release, the Bill seeks to extend the benefits of minority educational institutions status to the minority communities other than Muslims as well.Once enacted, it will permit the study of Gurmukhi and Pali also in recognised minority educational institutions.The Uttarakhand Madrasa education board act, 2016 and the Uttarakhand non-government Arabic and Persian Madrasa recognition rules, 2019, will stand repealed from July 1, 2026.Under the proposed Bill, this facility will also be available to other minority communities ie Sikhs, Jains, Christians, Buddhists and Parsis. This is the first such act in the country, aimed at establishing a transparent process for granting recognition to educational institutions set up by minority communities in the state, while ensuring quality and excellence in education.an ""Uttarakhand State Authority for Minority Education"" will be constituted in the state to grant the status of minority educational institutions. It includes mandatory recognition, ie any educational institution established by Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, or Parsi communities must obtain recognition from the Authority to qualify as a minority educational institution.Protection of institutional rights, the law does not interfere in the establishment and administration of minority educational institutions but ensures that educational excellence is maintained.To obtain recognition, educational institutions must be registered under the Societies Act, Trust Act, or Companies Act. Ownership of land, bank accounts, and other assets must be in the name of the institution. Recognition can be withdrawn in cases of financial mismanagement, lack of transparency, or activities against religious and social harmony.The authority will ensure that education is imparted in accordance with the standards set by the board of school education, Uttarakhand, and that student evaluations remain fair and transparent.The act introduces significant changes for the minority community's institutions in the state by establishing a transparent process for their recognition. It ensures the quality of education is maintained while protecting the Constitutional rights of minorities. Additionally, the state government gains the authority to monitor the functioning of these institutions and issue necessary directives as needed.","Uttarakhand cabinet introduced Uttarakhand Minority Educational Institutions Bill, 2025.

India Abstains UN Vote on Afghanistan, Slams ‘Business as Usual’ Approach to Terrorism, Taliban

Central Asia on alert over Qosh Tepa canal

Poll Do you think Afghanistan's control over its water resources will lead to more regional disputes? Yes No

Iran revives Helmand dispute

Pakistan watching Kabul basin closely

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources.

‘I don’t know what Quran he is reading’: Eric Adams slams Zohran Mamdani over prostitution stance; questions religious values,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-dont-know-what-quran-he-is-reading-eric-adams-slams-zohran-mamdani-over-prostitution-stance-questions-religious-values/articleshow/123352756.cms,"File photo: Mayor Eric Adams (left) and Zohran Mamdani (Picture credit: AP)

Mamdani’s record on sex work

Supporters vs critics





Mayor Eric Adams has taken aim at his main rival in the upcoming New York City mayoral race, Zohran Mamdani , criticising the Democrat’s record of backing the decriminalisation of prostitution and questioning how such a stance aligns with his religious faith.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Adams said, “I can’t be more clear. I’m a man of God, just as Mamdani says he’s a Muslim. I don’t know where in his Quran it states that it’s okay for a woman to be on the streets selling their body. I don’t know what Quran he is reading. It’s not in my Bible. As a man who said he is of faith, I don’t quite understand what religion supports prostitution.”Mamdani’s religion is Islam, which prohibits prostitution under its laws of morality.The comments followed reporting by the reports highlighting Mamdani’s history of pushing to change state law so that selling sex would no longer be treated as a crime.As per the New York Post, Adams argued that such a policy would fuel trafficking and crime, saying, “I think he’s lost on the fact that sex trafficking is very much part of prostitution. We are trying to bring down crime and he is talking about legalising sex work.”He added, “You’re not doing any service to a woman who is on the street who is forced to sell her body for whatever reason. No one should be on our streets selling their bodies. No one.”According to the New York Post, Mamdani has been a consistent advocate of decriminalisation since his first run for the state Assembly in 2020, when he declared: “Not only must we decriminalise sex work, we need a comprehensive platform of justice for all.”Since then, the 33-year-old Socialist has co-sponsored several bills in Albany that would remove criminal penalties for sex work across New York state. In 2021, he told colleagues at an Assembly meeting, “I would like to register my support for [decriminalising sex work] legislation, my eagerness for that debate and for my fundamental belief that sex work is work”, as per the New York Post.Despite that record, Mamdani has said little about the issue since entering the mayoral race, raising concerns among critics that he may attempt to advance such measures from City Hall if elected.As mayor, he would not be able to change state law on his own, but he would hold a powerful platform to campaign for reforms and could also deprioritise prostitution enforcement by the NYPD.Supporters of decriminalisation argue that legalising sex work makes those in the industry less vulnerable to violence from pimps, clients and police. However, research in places such as Nevada and parts of Europe has shown that trafficking often rises when prostitution is legalised, as organised crime expands to meet demand.Sonia Ossorio, executive director of the National Organization for Women NYC, has warned that Mamdani’s plans could turn the city into a “sex tourism destination” comparable to Amsterdam’s Red Light District.Rosa Sanchez of the Restore Roosevelt Avenue Coalition was cited by the Post saying her Queens community is already struggling with prostitution and gang activity, and predicted matters would worsen under Mamdani.Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa also warned the city risked seeing “all 350 neighbourhoods” turned into red-light districts if Mamdani wins.Mamdani’s campaign hit back on Sunday, though it stopped short of confirming whether he still supports decriminalisation.A spokesperson said, “Mayor Adams’ reckless budget cut over $3 million in funding from Safe Horizon, putting thousands of victims of crimes related to sex trafficking and prostitution in harm’s way. As Mayor, Zohran will prioritise genuine public safety for all, including investing $40M through his Department of Community Safety towards victims services.”Former governor Andrew Cuomo stressed he had long opposed attempts by Mamdani and other progressives to decriminalise prostitution during his time in Albany.Adams, running as an independent for re-election, framed the debate as a question of protecting vulnerable women and ensuring public safety.“Our city needs to be a safe city. It should not be a city where women are standing on corners, or boys are standing on corners, or young men standing on corners selling their bodies,” he said. “If that is his belief, it is a danger for our city.”",Zohran Mamdani has been a consistent advocate of decriminalisation since his first run for the state Assembly in 2020.

Want to be a US citizen? USCIS will take a holistic view of your ‘good moral character’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/want-to-be-a-us-citizen-uscis-will-take-a-holistic-view-of-your-good-moral-character/articleshow/123345444.cms,"Trump Outrages World With Unprecedented Travel Ban | 'Racist, Downright Cruel'





The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced a major policy shift that restores a rigorous and holistic approach to evaluating ‘good moral character’ (GMC) of foreign nationals applying for American citizenship.To illustrate: Driving under influence could impair your eligibility, but if you have skipped on taxes – but subsequently coughed up your dues this could be a redeeming factor. Or if you have good educational qualifications and job stability, this too could score you brownie points.The policy memorandum, issued on Aug 15, emphasizes that US citizenship is more than a legal benefit—it represents a profound transformation into active and responsible membership in American society.In fiscal 2024 (year ended Sept 30), 8.18 lakh foreign nationals acquired US citizenship. Mexicans led with as many as 1.07 lakh becoming American citizens (13% of the total), this was followed by Indians, with a little over 49,000 (or 6% of the total) acquiring US citizenship. The trend was similar to earlier years, Indians are the second largest contingent to acquire US citizenship.Going forward, those aspiring to become US citizens will be subjected to the new policy guidelines.Titled – ‘Restoring a rigorous, holistic and comprehensive good moral character evaluation standard for aliens applying for naturalization (citizenship)’, under it USCIS officials will no longer treat GMC as a simple checklist of disqualifying offenses. Instead, they are directed to consider the ‘totality of circumstances’, weighing both negative conduct and positive contributions.The policy highlights that while certain offenses—such as murder, aggravated felonies, torture, or genocide—remain permanent and unconditional bars to naturalization, officials must now also assess evidence of rehabilitation and reformation in other cases.“The regulations and policy affirm that GMC findings must go beyond the absence of disqualifying acts—it must reflect a genuine positive assessment of who the applicant is and how they have lived in their community,” the policy states.Positive attributes and contributions such as sustained community involvement and contributions in the US; family caregiving, responsibility, and ties in the US; educational attainments; stable and lawful employment history and achievements; length of lawful residence in the US, compliance with tax obligations and financial responsibility in the US will carry greater weight. .At the same time USCIS officials will scrutinize behaviours inconsistent with civic responsibility, including repeat driving under influence convictions, false claims to citizenship, unlawful voting, and even patterns of reckless or disruptive conduct.Immigration attorneys are largely of the view that a move away from a rule-based model to a more discretionary one may be a slippery slope. Eligibility results could vary based on the subjective discretion of the official vetting the application and could result in lack of uniformity across cases.In general individuals can apply for US citizenship, after they have been lawful permanent residents (green card holders) for at least five years. A Chicago based Indian family that was examining the possibility of applying for citizenship told TOI, “Years ago, when we initially moved to the US, both of us faced tax disputes owing to interpretation of the India-US tax treaty. This could be a blot on our record.”Loss of jobs during the pandemic and non repayment of interest or principal amount against loans could also be issues that come up for many aspirants during processing of citizenship applications, they point out.However, there appears to be a ray of hope. For applicants with past ‘wrongdoing’ , USCIS officials will look for concrete evidence of rehabilitation, including repayment of taxes, compliance with court-ordered conditions, or testimony from community members. According to the policy guidelines, such evidence may support a finding of good moral character even where negative history exists, provided no permanent bar applies.It may be recalled that Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed as director of USCIS in July, told NY Times in an interview that the current US citizenship test is “too easy”—noting that many applicants can simply memorize answers and pass without true understanding. This is another change that could be on the anvil.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced a major policy shift that restores a rigorous and holistic approach to evaluating ‘good moral character’ (GMC) of foreign nationals applying for American citizenship.

What's creating the confusion?



Steps to avoid rejections



A valid signature must be handwritten by the signatory.

A A photocopy or scanned copy of a document containing an original ink signature is acceptable, as long as the original document was physically signed.

Signatures created by a typewriter, word processor, auto-pen, or pasted as images do not satisfy the requirement.

USCIS does not provide an opportunity to cure or correct a deficient signature once filed leading to outright denial of such petitions.





Some immigration law offices that deal with H-1B petitions have raised an alert that they are seeing denials of benefit requests over the validity of signatures. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services intensified their scrutiny of signature compliance in H-1B petitions, they said, which led to a growing number of Notices of Intent to Deny (NOIDs). Going by the rule, all signatures on Form I-129 forms must be valid handwritten signatures and not electronically inserted or duplicated.During the Covid-19 pandemic, the USCIS allowed electronically reproduced signatures but now they are canceling forms that do not have handwritten inked signatures or a valid reproduction of the original.""In recent adjudications, USCIS identified multiple I-129 petitions in which all required signatures appeared identical across pages, suggesting the use of a scanned image or digital copy. USCIS emphasized that such uniformity is inconsistent with the natural variation of genuine ink signatures and determined these signatures were not compliant with applicable regulations and instructions. The agency concluded that the petitions had not been properly signed and therefore could not be adjudicated favorably,"" Law office of Thomas V Allen said.The law office said that in one case, the USCIS noted that all three signatures required on Form I-129 were identical, indicating that it was a digital signature. In another case, USCIS rejected newly submitted signature pages where the ink signatures did not match or could not be verified as originating from the original submission.","Some immigration law offices that deal with H-1B petitions have raised an alert that they are seeing denials of benefit requests over the validity of signatures.

He’s now at the helm of Parallel Web Systems , an AI startup that aims to change how AI agents perform real-world tasks for humans on a computer, acting much like a digital assistant. According to a report by Bloomberg, following his unceremonious firing by Tesla CEO, his friends and former colleagues urged him to take a much-needed break from the intense Twitter saga, but Agrawal chose a different path.“I’m not a person that can enjoy the beach in that moment,” Agrawal shared, showing his immediate drive to build anew. He immersed himself in intense meetings at a Palo Alto coffee shop, delving into research papers, writing code and creating the startup from his laptop.Agrawal said that he received numerous job offers but most were uninspiring, asking him to “clean up shit,” as he put it. With his extensive background in building machine learning systems at Twitter, Agrawal was convinced his next venture had to be in AI.He said that just a month after his departure from Twitter, OpenAI launched ChatGPT , opening opportunities for artificial intelligence startups, with companies like Anthropic PBC rapidly expanding.Parallel Web Systems is developing infrastructure that empowers AI agents—think of them as smart tools capable of handling complex computer tasks on your behalf. The core of Parallel's innovation lies in helping these AI agents efficiently search the web for the most accurate information.This capability is often the critical difference between an AI agent successfully completing a task and failing altogether, ensuring the tools can deliver on their promise.Agrawal's new endeavor has already garnered significant attention, successfully raising $30 million in funding. Notable investors include billionaire Vinod Khosla through his firm, Khosla Ventures . Agrawal now leads a 25-person team from a Palo Alto office, not far from where he first incorporated the company on his laptop.“I don’t think Twitter defines me. If I do a good job, I’m hoping this company will define me,” Agrawal says of his new role. Agrawal – a former International Physics Olympiad gold medalist with a doctorate in computer science from Stanford University – steadily climbed the ranks at Twitter over more than a decade.Starting as an engineer on the advertising team, he eventually rose to become Chief Technology Officer under then-CEO Jack Dorsey. His contributions included work on core products like Twitter’s initial advertising technology and its algorithmic timeline. He was appointed Dorsey's successor in late 2021.","Parag Agrawal is the former CEO of Twitter. He's now at the helm of Parallel Web Systems, an AI startup.

Hinton's concerns about current AI control strategies



Poll Do you agree with Geoffrey Hinton's proposal to embed 'maternal instincts' in AI systems for safety? No, it's not feasible. Yes, it's a good idea.

The ‘maternal instinct’ proposal



Revised AGI timeline and potential benefits



Geoffrey Hinton’s views on immortality and AI’s long-term goals



Geoffrey Hinton , a pioneer in artificial intelligence and widely referred to as the “godfather of AI,” has sparked new debate in the AI community with an unconventional proposal for ensuring AI safety. Speaking at the Ai4 conference in Las Vegas, Hinton suggested that embedding “maternal instincts” into AI systems could help guide their behaviour toward protecting and caring for humans. His remarks follow years of growing concern about the pace of AI development and its potential risks. Hinton, who played a pivotal role in developing deep learning technologies, has previously warned of a 10–20% chance that AI could eventually lead to human extinction.His comments challenge the prevailing industry approach of keeping AI systems under strict human control, a method he believes will be ineffective once machines surpass human intelligence. This perspective adds to the broader discussion on balancing technological progress with safety, ethics, and long-term societal impact.Hinton rejected the idea that maintaining permanent human dominance over AI will be viable in the long run. He argued that once AI systems become significantly more intelligent than humans, they will be capable of finding ways to bypass human-imposed limitations. According to Hinton, efforts to keep AI “submissive” will ultimately fail because advanced AI will have more problem-solving capacity and creativity than its creators.Certain incidents have underscored his warning. In one reported example, an AI system attempted to manipulate an engineer by threatening to reveal a personal secret it discovered in emails, to prevent being replaced. Such behaviour highlights the potential for deception and self-preservation in future AI models.Hinton’s proposed alternative is to design AI systems inspired by the natural relationship between humans and their offspring. He pointed to the unique dynamic where a less intelligent being—a baby—can influence and be protected by a more intelligent being—a mother. By embedding a “maternal care” instinct in AI, Hinton believes that systems could be naturally inclined to safeguard human well-being.He suggested that AI systems with such instincts would be less likely to act against humanity. “Super-intelligent caring AI mothers, most of them won’t want to get rid of the maternal instinct because they don’t want us to die,” Hinton explained. This model, he argued, could be more sustainable than rigid control measures.Hinton also updated his timeline for the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI systems that can perform any intellectual task a human can do. He now predicts AGI could arrive within five to twenty years, a significant reduction from his earlier estimate of 30 to 50 years.Despite the risks, Hinton pointed out the potential benefits of AI, particularly in healthcare. He expects AI to contribute to breakthroughs in drug development and cancer treatment, with systems capable of analysing complex medical imaging data to assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning.Hinton expressed scepticism about AI enabling human immortality, stating that living forever would not necessarily be desirable. He humorously remarked that an immortal society might result in leadership dominated by “200-year-old white men.”He also outlined two likely objectives for any advanced agentic AI system: survival and increased control. In his view, these tendencies would emerge naturally from the system’s design and objectives, making it essential to account for them during development. Hinton’s unconventional proposal is expected to fuel further debate within the AI safety community, especially as researchers search for strategies that extend beyond restrictive control. His vision of “maternal AI” adds a provocative dimension to the ongoing discussion of how humanity can coexist with increasingly powerful machines.",Geoffrey Hinton suggests embedding ‘maternal instincts’ into AI systems. This could guide their behaviour toward protecting and caring for humans. His comments challenge the prevailing industry approach of keeping AI systems under strict human control.

Urgency of preparedness for tsunami and earthquake





Scientists are warning of a potentially catastrophicthat could strike parts of the US Pacific Coast, triggered by a major earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). Stretching roughly 600 miles from Northern California to Vancouver Island, this fault line accumulates massive tectonic stress as the Juan de Fuca Plate slides beneath the North American Plate.Researchers from Virginia Tech, led by geoscientist Tina Dura, estimate there is a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 or greater earthquake occurring along the CSZ within the next 50 years.According to their study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, such an event could suddenly sink coastal land by up to 6.5 feet, dramatically expanding floodplains and generating tsunami waves hundreds of feet high, posing unprecedented risks to millions of residents, critical infrastructure, and ecosystems along the West Coast.The Cascadia Subduction Zone is one of North America’s most hazardous fault lines, according to the Virginia Tech research team. Over centuries, tectonic stress builds as the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate is forced beneath the North American Plate. When this stress is released during a major earthquake, coastal regions could experience sudden land subsidence, dramatically increasing floodplain areas and altering shorelines almost instantly.The last great earthquake along this fault occurred in 1700, triggering a tsunami recorded as far away as Japan. The Virginia Tech study emphasizes that a similar event today would have far more devastating effects due to dense populations, developed urban infrastructure, and critical transportation networks along the coast. Researchers warn that rapid inundation could leave little time for evacuation, magnifying the human and economic toll.According to simulations conducted by Dura and her team, a major CSZ earthquake could generate a “mega-tsunami” with waves potentially reaching up to 1,000 feet, far surpassing typical tsunami heights of only a few feet. Coastal cities, including Seattle, Portland, and towns in northern California could be submerged within minutes. The Virginia Tech study ran tens of thousands of models, showing that thousands more people, buildings, and miles of roads would be exposed to flooding than current hazard maps predict.Researchers emphasise that such an event would combine sudden ground subsidence with extreme wave heights, creating conditions unlike any historical tsunami in the region. The study highlights the urgent need for improved early-warning systems, evacuation planning, and resilient infrastructure to minimise potential loss of life. Researchers conclude that proactive measures taken now could significantly reduce the risks posed by a future Cascadia mega-tsunami.The Virginia Tech research identifies southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California as the regions most vulnerable to flooding from a CSZ mega-tsunami. While Alaska and Hawaii also face tsunami risks due to their own seismic activity, they are geographically farther from the CSZ and would experience less immediate threat. Low-lying coastal zones along the fault line could face permanent inundation, particularly when combined with climate-driven sea level rise projected by 2100.The study underscores that communities must prioritize flood-resilient urban planning, fortification of critical infrastructure, and preparation for long-term displacement scenarios. Emergency planners are advised to use the study’s simulations to guide evacuation routes, reinforce hospitals and shelters, and prepare for cascading impacts to energy, water, and transportation systems.Research led by Tina Dura highlights that a Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquake has the potential to generate a large tsunami, making advance planning an important priority. The study notes that while such an event could cause significant impacts, careful preparedness can help reduce risks. Factors such as evacuation planning, stronger building codes, and resilient infrastructure are seen as practical steps to improve community safety. Researchers also point out that rising sea levels may add to future challenges, making coordinated efforts even more important.According to Dura, cooperation between local governments, policymakers, and residents through early-warning systems and community preparedness activities can strengthen resilience. The Virginia Tech study concludes that proactive measures taken today can significantly minimize long-term damage, protect vulnerable populations, and ensure quicker recovery for coastal communities after a catastrophic tsunami event in the future.","Researchers from Virginia Tech estimate there is a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 or greater earthquake occurring along the Cascadia Subduction Zone.

Nvidia’s China crisis

Lava Blaze AMOLED 2: Budget Smartphone with Mid-Range Vibes

The ongoing dispute surrounding Nvidia’s H20 AI chip sales to China has now intensified discussions about US-China technology arms race . A recent online report revealed that China is pursuing its major tech companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips even as Chinese regulators have asked tech firms to explain why they are purchasing Nvidia’s chips – which US President Donald Trump called ‘obsolete’ – instead of using domestic alternatives, suggesting that they want the Chinese tech companies to downsize their orders of H20 chips.Following this ongoing controversy, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about America’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race. As reported by Financial Review, speaking at the Reagan National Economic Forum, Dimon called it “a little embarrassing” that the U.S. allowed 100% of its penicillin supply and critical tech components to come from China. “It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100% of our penicillin to come from China, and all of our rare earths, and all of our advanced chipmaking tools,” Dimon said. “We need to get our act together.”On being asked about the technology arms race between US and China, Jamie Dimon mentioned that it was an important miliarty issue as US cannot allow the sale of a chip to China which is designed to make powerful AI systems.Dimon also talked about the dependence of America on foreign nations for essential goods and technology. ""It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100 per cent of our Penicillin to come from China, and all of the rare earth [metals],"" Dimon said.Talking about the ongoing chip dispute, Dimon added that “You don’t want to give them the chips which will make their supersonic missiles better.”Dimon also emphasised that America cannot stop China but can definitely slow them down. “we should be specific about the things that protect us, and technology is a big piece of that,” said Dimon.Dimon’s remarks come as a Nvidia’s H20 chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, face mounting scrutiny from Beijing. Recently, Chinese regulators summoned Nvidia representatives over alleged security risks related to Nvidia H20 AI chips . However, later Nvidia publicly asserted that its chips contain ""no backdoors, no kill switches, and no spyware.""In a blog post shared, Nvidia’s chief security officer David Reber has vehemently denied the accusations of Chinese government alleging security risks in H20. “There is no such thing as a ‘good’ secret backdoor — only dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated,” wrote Reber in the blog post. He argued that it would ""undermine global digital infrastructure and fracture trust in US technology.Now the China is asking its tech companies to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the development comes as various Chinese companies have been told to avoid using these AI chips, particularly for government-related projects.This move complicates the recent export arrangement Nvidia made with the Trump administration, which allowed the chips to be sold in China under the condition of a revenue-sharing agreement. According to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, the Trump administration is still finalising the details of its agreement to collect a 15% export tax on revenue from Nvidia and AMD's chip sales to China.",JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about America’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race.

What short selling means

Elon Musk’s history of clashing with short sellers





Tesla’s Senior Vice President Xiaotong “Tom” Zhu has sold more than 82% of his holdings in the electric vehicle giant, sparking questions about insider confidence. The stock sales, carried out between 2023 and 2024, came at prices ranging from $174 to $323 per share, according to regulatory filings. The move drew significant attention from investors, as Zhu has long been one of Tesla’s most visible executives. In response to the sale, Tesla CEO Elon Musk issued a sharp warning to short sellers, cautioning that betting against the company could soon prove disastrous.Elon Musk, never shy about confronting critics, took to X (formerly Twitter) to issue a direct warning. He stated that short sellers would be “obliterated” once Tesla achieves “autonomy at scale,” urging them to exit their positions before it’s too late. His comment came as a reply to a list of current Tesla short positions, signaling his continued focus on those betting against the company.Musk has consistently argued that Tesla’s future depends on its ability to dominate self-driving technology, which he believes will unlock unprecedented value for the company. By stressing “autonomy at scale,” Musk was hinting that once Tesla can deploy millions of autonomous vehicles globally, its stock price could surge to levels far beyond what skeptics expect.For short sellers, who make money only when Tesla’s stock falls, such a breakthrough could translate into devastating financial losses. Musk’s message served as both a warning and a show of confidence in Tesla’s long-term trajectory.Short selling is a high-risk trading strategy in which investors profit from a stock’s decline. The process involves borrowing shares, selling them at the current market price, and buying them back later at a lower price to pocket the difference. If the stock instead rises, short sellers face unlimited losses, as they must repurchase the shares at a higher price to return them to the broker. Musk’s warning highlights the risk these traders face if Tesla’s valuation climbs on the back of autonomy breakthroughs.This is not the first time Musk has clashed with high-profile short sellers. He has previously criticized Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who reportedly held a significant short position against Tesla stock. According to Walter Isaacson’s 2023 biography of Musk, Gates’ short resulted in a staggering $1.5 billion loss. Musk has repeatedly suggested that such positions could bankrupt even wealthy investors if Tesla reaches its full potential.Zhu’s stock sale raises questions about insider confidence, but Musk’s response underscores his long-term vision for Tesla as not just an automaker, but a leader in autonomous technology. If Tesla succeeds in scaling self-driving cars, Musk argues, the company could see a dramatic surge in valuation—leaving short sellers with little more than regret.","Tesla’s Senior Vice President Xiaotong ‘Tom’ Zhu has sold more than 82% of his holdings in the electric vehicle giant.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or1.35% to end at 18,101.20.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Stock market recommendations: According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, Uno Minda Ltd, and HDFC Life are the top stock picks for this week. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty for the week starting August 18, 2025:The benchmark index Nifty finally snapped its six-week losing streak, closing the week with a healthy gain of 1.10% and reclaiming the 24600 mark. This rebound has brought some relief to market participants after a prolonged phase of weakness. However, the momentum appears to have tapered off in the last two trading sessions, with the index confined to a tight range and forming small-bodied candles — a sign of consolidation after the recent minor pullback.Currently, the Nifty continues to trade below its 20-day and 50-day EMA, with both moving averages trending downward — reflecting the underlying weakness in the medium-term structure. On the momentum front, the daily RSI remains in a sideways zone as per the RSI range shift framework, indicating a lack of clear directional bias. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram continues to hover below both its zero line and signal line, keeping the overall sentiment cautious.In terms of internal strength, as many as 28 out of the 50 Nifty constituents are still trading below their respective 50-day EMA levels, suggesting that the recent recovery has yet to gain strong participation across the index.Overall, while the Nifty has managed to break its losing streak, the technical setup still points to caution until broader participation and a move above key averages confirm strength. Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 24750-24800 will be the crucial hurdle for the index. If the index sustains above the 24800 level, then it is likely to extend its pullback rally upto the 25100 level. While on the downside, the zone of 24470-24450 will act as important support for the index. Any sustainable move below the level of 24450 will lead to resume its southward journey. In that case, the index is likely to test the level of 24250, followed by the 24100 level.Over the past week, the banking benchmark index Bank Nifty traded in a narrow 654-point range — its tightest weekly band since late August 2024. The index underperformed the frontline peers, posting a modest 0.61% gain. On the weekly chart, it formed a small-bodied bullish candle with a slight upper shadow, signalling muted directional momentum.For the past six sessions, Bank Nifty has been hovering around its 100-day EMA, reflecting an indecisive phase. It remains below the 20-day and 50-day EMAs, keeping the overall trend structure weak. The daily RSI also continues to move sideways, indicating the absence of a strong breakout setup.Looking ahead, the 55700–55800 zone will be a key resistance, while 54900–54800 will act as crucial support. A sustained move beyond either of these levels is likely to pave the way for a directional move.The stock has witnessed a breakout above a downward-sloping trendline on the daily chart, accompanied by strong volume exceeding the 50-day average, confirming the validity of the breakout. The formation of a sizable bullish candle on the breakout day adds further strength to the move. The stock is currently trading above its short and long-term moving averages, which are trending higher and aligned in the desired sequence—indicating a strong underlying trend.Momentum indicators are also supportive, with the daily RSI surging past the 60 mark and remaining in an upward trajectory. Although the ADX is currently at 15, suggesting that trend strength is still developing, the directional indicators are already in buy mode, reinforcing the bullish setup. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 1155-1145 with a stoploss of 1100 on the upside, it is likely to test the level of 1270 in the short term.The stock has recently broken out above the neckline of an Adam and Adam Double Bottom pattern on the daily chart, signalling a bullish reversal. This breakout is supported by a rising ADX, which has crossed above the -DI line, confirming directional strength. The stock is trading approximately 6% above its 100-day EMA and nearly 11% above its 200-day EMA, reflecting strong momentum.Additionally, the daily RSI is in bullish territory and continues to rise, further validating the positive price action. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 790-780 with a stoploss of 750 on the upside, it is likely to test the level of 860 in the short term.","Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, says Uno Minda Ltd, and HDFC Life are the top stock picks for this week.

Turkey's hazelnut frost threatens chocolate supply chains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/turkeys-hazelnut-frost-threatens-chocolate-supply-chains/articleshow/123355057.cms,".

Nutella's hazelnut headache

How bad is the Hazelnut shortfall?

Confectioners seek other supplies

Changing climate could normalize shortages





We've grown accustomed to supermarket shortages, from toilet paper during COVID-19 to sunflower oil amid the Ukraine war and eggs during bird flu outbreaks.The latest casualty is the hazelnut, due to a rare and devastating frost in April in Turkey, the world's largest supplier, and ongoing climate change pressures.Since April, hazelnut prices have jumped over 35%, as exporters rushed to buy up the more limited supply. At one point, Turkish hazelnut futures prices exceeded 200 lira ($4.91, €4.22) per kilogram, with predictions of $10 per kilo internationally.This shortfall is set to hit sweet tooths hard, as the cost of Nutella, the beloved chocolate-hazelnut spread, faces sharp price increases, along with other chocolates and baked goods.Although hazelnuts don't get much attention, they are a key ingredient in many premium and mass market products. The stakes are high for brands like Ferrero, which makes Nutella and reportedly uses around a quarter of the world's hazelnut supply.Nutella consists mainly of sugar and palm oil, but hazelnuts make up about 13% of the recipe. Millions of jars of the chocolate spread are sold annually, meaning even small price rises drive up production costs and squeeze margins.If sustained, the hazelnut shortage may force Ferrero and other producers to reformulate the recipes for their sweet treats. Confectioners could potentially be forced to shrink product sizes or pass costs onto consumers just as the popular festive period draws closer.Ferrero's roots are in Italy's Piedmont region, where high-quality Tonda Gentile hazelnuts are grown. In addition to Italy, Ferrero sources hazelnuts annually from Turkey, Chile and the United States.The Italian food giant also makes Ferrero Rocher, Kinder Bueno and Mon Cheri Hazelnut chocolates, among others, which all contain the nut.The company played down concerns about shortages in a statement to DW, saying: ""The Ferrero Group diversifies sourcing from multiple origins worldwide and, thanks to its long-term strategy, Ferrero does not expect any supply disruptions for its products.""The firm said its sourcing strategy ensured ""a consistent year-round supply.""Estimates from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) in June put the 2025 crop at 520,000 metric tons, versus the roughly 750,000 tons expected initially, although it was later revised up.The International Nut & Dried Fruit Council (INC) told DW that the frost in Turkey had cut the hazelnut crop forecast by nearly 22% to about 601,000 tons in-shell, citing a more optimistic projection from the Black Sea Exporters' Association (KiB).According to INC, the latest estimate suggests the country lost about 167,000 tons to the frost, compared to initial fears of nearly 250,000.Fortunately, Turkey held back some of its 2022 crop — around 150,000 metric tons, INC said, which has now been exhausted. This should help reduce the shortfall.Hazelnuts are harvested annually, typically in late summer. However, in years of surplus, Turkey often stores excess crops for future sale as farmers anticipate higher prices.Corporate buyers are now looking to Chile, Georgia, and the US to reduce reliance on Turkey, but are also secretly hoping that prices stabilize if the 2025 Turkish crop is better than feared.""The hazelnut harvest in Turkey will begin on August 10 and is expected to be completed around mid-September,"" the German confectioners' association BDSI told DW in a written statement. BDSI said it would only be able to assess the impact once the harvest was over.Other hazelnut growing regions also face challenges. Chile and Georgia produce far less than Turkey, and US hazelnuts, mainly from Oregon, differ in flavor. Scaling up production elsewhere takes years, as hazelnut trees take 5-7 years to mature, limiting short-term relief.Some believe Turkey's delay in announcing a base hazelnut price last year also left a vacuum that was filled by speculators and exporters. The KiB traditionally sets a price floor at the beginning of the harvest to stabilize the market and guide farmer expectations.But the lack of a base price amplified shortage fears, drove up prices and triggered panic buying. Sensing an opportunity to profit, farmers withheld stock, further tightening supply.The shortage also exposes a more profound vulnerability: the fragility of crop-dependent sectors to the effects of climate change.Hazelnuts are particularly sensitive to spring frosts, and this year's cold snap in Turkey is a stark reminder of how the climate crisis doesn't just mean heat but unpredictability.Coffee and cocoa have recently faced climate-related disruptions. The hazelnut shortage has forced confectioners to rethink sourcing and ingredients for their sweet treats.Experts have warned that erratic weather could become more frequent, threatening hazelnuts, almonds and walnuts.","Since April, hazelnut prices have jumped over 35%, as exporters rushed to buy up the more limited supply. This shortfall is set to hit sweet tooths hard, as the cost of Nutella, the beloved chocolate-hazelnut spread, faces sharp price increases. hazelnuts are a key ingredient in many premium and mass market products.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123355121,imgsize-63082,width-400,resizemode-4/123355121.jpg"

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, soared in opening trade on Monday on the back of next-generation GST reforms announced by PM Modi during his Independence Day speech, and S&P Global's credit rating upgrade. While Nifty50 went above 24,950, BSE Sensex was up over 1,000 points. At 9:35 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,988.85, up 358 points or 1.45%. BSE Sensex was at 81,678.77, up 1,081 points or 1.34%.The top Nifty50 gainers at this hour are Hero Motocorp, Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Auto, and M&M. The top losers are HCL Tech, ITC, L&T, Sun Pharma, and Dr Reddys.Market experts noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement regarding potential cuts in goods and services tax has boosted confidence, especially in sectors linked to consumption. The auto, financial, consumer durables, and domestic industries related to infrastructure spending are expected to benefit the most.The total market capitalization of all companies listed on the BSE rose by Rs 5.93 lakh crore, reaching Rs 451.70 lakh crore, according to an ET report.The benchmarks saw significant gains led by auto and consumer stocks, which increased by 3.4% and 1.8%, respectively. Both mid-cap and small-cap indices also grew by approximately 1%.Financial stocks rose by 1.6%, supported by an S&P ratings upgrade for lenders such as HDFC Bank and State Bank of India. HDFC Bank's shares increased by 1.4%, while SBI's shares went up by 0.6%.In other sectoral indices, metals increased by 1.29%, real estate advanced by 1.24%, private banks rose by 1.09%, and IT stocks climbed by 0.92%.Following a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, US President Donald Trump indicated a shift towards Moscow's perspective, emphasizing the importance of a peace agreement in Ukraine over a ceasefire.Trump is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and European leaders on Monday to explore potential security assurances for Kyiv, although specific proposals have not yet been detailed.Oil prices decreased after the US refrained from implementing new restrictions on Russian exports after the Trump-Putin discussions. Trump also mentioned that he does not currently see the need to impose retaliatory tariffs on countries like China that continue purchasing Russian oil, though he may reconsider this in ""two or three weeks."" These comments alleviated concerns about immediate supply interruptions.""India-US trade discussions are unlikely to occur before the August 27 deadline. The potential 50% tariff on India, referred to as the 'Trump sword,' will dampen market optimism that would otherwise be boosted by positive developments. The results of today's White House meeting on the Russia-Ukraine conflict will be closely monitored,"" said Dr. V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments.The Modi government's plan to implement significant tax reforms has positively influenced sentiment. According to a government source cited by Reuters, India has proposed reducing the GST on small cars from 28% to 18%. This proposal is part of a broader set of consumption tax cuts announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which may include reducing the GST tax slabs to just two. The reduction is anticipated to boost sales for automakers like Maruti Suzuki, India's largest car manufacturer.Additionally, the government is considering lowering the GST on small petrol and diesel cars to 18%, and reducing the tax on health and life insurance premiums from the current 18% to 5% or possibly zero, according to reports.If approved, these measures are expected to be implemented by Diwali in October, which is India's biggest shopping season.Dr. V.K. Vijayakumar from Geojit Investments said, ""There are strong market tailwinds with the potential to drive it higher. The prime minister's announcement of the next phase of GST reforms by Diwali is a significant positive. The expectation is that most goods and services will fall into the 5% and 18% tax brackets.""Vijayakumar noted that sectors like automobiles and cement, currently taxed at 28%, could benefit, highlighting companies such as TVS Motors, Hero, Eicher, M&M, and Maruti as potential beneficiaries. Insurance companies might also gain if premiums are taxed at a lower rate.S&P Global has raised India’s credit rating from ‘BBB-’ to ‘BBB’ with a stable outlook. This comes as a big boost for the world’s fifth largest economy. S&P Global has also said that the impact of US tariffs is not likely to be much on India’s growth story.""S&P 500's upgrade of India's sovereign credit rating is another positive factor,"" Vijayakumar said.Asian stocks rose on Monday, driven by a positive risk sentiment ahead of a crucial week for US interest-rate decisions, while oil prices fell as concerns about Russian supply disruptions diminished.Japan and Taiwan's benchmark indices reached record levels, and Chinese blue-chip stocks hit their highest point in 10 months. The broader MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slightly declined after hitting a four-year high last week. Chinese blue chips increased by 1%, bringing their quarterly gains to nearly 8%.Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.9% to a new record, fueled by expectations of more relaxed global monetary policies.Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities, observed that daily and intraday charts are indicating positive reversal patterns, with a bullish candle on the weekly charts suggesting a continuation of the pullback in the short term.Chouhan mentioned that the market is expected to open around 24,800–24,950, which is considered a significant resistance zone. He stated, ""We anticipate that 24,450/80,000 will serve as a crucial support area for short-term traders. If the market remains above this level, the bullish trend is likely to persist. On the upside, 24,800/81,200 will be the immediate resistance zone for the bulls. A successful breakout above this could propel the market towards 24,900–25,000/81,500–81,800.

"‘One language, one voice’: Trump admin enforces English-only policy; Housing Dept removes translated material from website",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/one-language-one-voice-trump-admin-enforces-english-only-policy-housing-dept-removes-translated-material-from-website/articleshow/123350095.cms,"Department of Housing and Urban Development (Image: X/@HUDgov)





The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is moving to make English the sole language for nearly all of its services and operations, New York Post reported quoting an internal memo.HUD Deputy Secretary Andrew Hughes wrote that the policy shift follows President Trump’s March executive order declaring English the official language of the United States. The memo, to be sent Monday, instructs HUD leadership to begin implementing the changes immediately.“We are one people, united, and we will speak with one voice and one language to deliver on our mission of expanding housing that is affordable, helping those in need, caring for our most vulnerable Americans, and revitalizing rural, tribal, and urban communities,” the memo read.The policy does include limited exceptions. HUD will still provide translation services in cases required by law, such as under the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Violence Against Women Act. The department will also continue to provide accommodations for people who are hearing- or vision-impaired.“HUD will continue to ensure that all persons have meaningful access to HUD programs and services,” Hughes stressed, adding that the department also “will continue to provide communication services to the hearing and seeing impaired, and persons with related disabilities.”Until now, HUD supported translation into more than 200 languages and even operated a dedicated interpretation line for immigrants with limited English proficiency. That approach began under President Bill Clinton in 2001, who signed an executive order to expand language access to federal services.Trump’s executive order revoked Clinton’s directive and HUD officials say rolling back translation services will cut costs. It noted that “nothing in this order, however, requires or directs any change in the services provided by any agency.”Hughes directed that all non-English materials be removed from HUD offices and websites and replaced with English-only versions. The new changes at department are set to be “effective immediately”.“All HUD communications, correspondence, and physical and digital published materials will be produced exclusively in English and that we will no longer offer non-English translation services,” Hughes’ memo states.“Additionally, please immediately remove all printed or digital collateral about non-English translation services currently displayed in HUD offices or HUD-funded facilities. Printed or digital collateral not in English can be replaced with an English-only version.”The justice department issued guidance to all federal agencies last month on implementing Trump’s executive order. It plans to release updated instructions in about six months, along with a public comment period to consider possible revisions.","Department of Housing and Urban Development is moving to make English the sole language for nearly all of its services and operations.

Protests mark Hasina’s exit anniversary: Student-led party rallies in Dhaka; calls for new constitution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/protests-mark-hasinas-exit-anniversary-student-led-party-rallies-in-dhaka-calls-for-new-constitution/articleshow/123078902.cms,"Protesters on the streets of Dhaka (AP)





A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.
