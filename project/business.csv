Indore: Madhya Pradesh DGP Kailash Makwana highlighted that police action alone is insufficient to prevent sexual assault cases, pointing to declining social values attributed to widespread access to explicit content through digital devices and internet connectivity.Addressing media Saturday about rising sexual assault cases, the DGP said, ""There are many reasons why I believe this is happening - availability of internet, mobile phones, obscene content, alcohol. Through mobile phones, anyone can connect with anyone from anywhere. There is a serious decline in morality. There are many such reasons, and to expect the police to handle all of this alone is not possible.""Makwana said domestic supervision has weakened considerably. ""Within homes, people are no longer able to keep a watch on each other. Many of the boundaries have been broken, and the kind of obscenity being served through the internet from a young age is undoubtedly distorting children's minds. That, somewhere, is contributing to the increase in such crimes,"" he added.Speaking to journalists in Indore on Sunday after a comprehensive review meeting, DGP Makwana announced significant progress in anti-Naxal operations.“In its fight against Naxalism, MP police have neutralised 10 Naxals in past six months alone — marking the highest such figure recorded in any single year in the state. Previously, the maximum number of Naxals eliminated in a year stood at six,” the DGP said.The meeting included senior officials from Indore commissionerate and SP and DSP-ranked officers from all eight districts in Indore range. The DGP said, “While Naxal problem remains widespread in Chhattisgarh, the issue in MP is restricted to Balaghat and Mandla. Among these, Balaghat continues to be most affected.

"Post Op Sindoor, India to fast-track launch of 52 defence surveillance satellites",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-op-sindoor-india-to-fast-track-launch-of-52-defence-surveillance-satellites/articleshow/122149971.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the need for ‘deep’ as well as ‘persistent’ surveillance of enemy territory being reinforced by Operation Sindoor , India plans to fast-track the launch of 52 dedicated satellites for the armed forces. It is also in the process of finalising a comprehensive military space doctrine.Phase 3 of Space-Based Surveillance (SBS) programme, which was approved by the PM-led cabinet committee on security in Oct last year at a cost of Rs 26,968 crore, involves the construction and launch of 21 satellites by Isro and 31 by three private companies.The first of these satellites is to be launched by April next year, with all 52 to be deployed before 2029-end, as part of the project being spearheaded by Defence Space Agency (DSA) under the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) of defence ministry.“Work is underway to compress these timelines to launch the satellites faster into the low earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary orbit. The three private companies that have got the contracts have been told to speed up building of the satellites,” a source told TOI.“The aim of SBS-3 is to cover much larger areas of China and Pakistan, as well as the Indian Ocean Region, with shorter revisit times (interval between two consecutive surveillance sweeps of the same location) and much better resolution.The space doctrine is also being fine-tuned,” he added.Parallelly, IAF is pursuing the case for three high-altitude platform system (HAPS) aircraft, which are basically unmanned aerial vehicles or ‘pseudo-satellites’ that operate in the stratosphere for long durations on ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) missions, as reported by TOI earlier.During Operation Sindoor, which saw intense hostilities with Pakistan from May 7 to 10, India used domestic satellites like Cartosat, as well as foreign commercial ones, for tracking military movements in Pakistan. “We need to shorten our OODA (observe, orient, decide and act) loop. The faster India gets the 52-satellite constellation up in space the better,” another source said.India also needs to put in place its satellite shield since China is developing weapons like direct ascent anti-satellite missiles, co-orbital satellites, electronic warfare equipment, and directed energy weapons like high-powered lasers to contest or deny other nations access to the space domain.China’s military space programme has expanded from operating just 36 satellites in 2010 to over 1,000 by 2024, with 360 of them dedicated to ISR missions.At a seminar earlier this month, IDS chief Air Marshal Ashutosh Dixit had stressed the need to extend India’s “surveillance envelope” while underlining the critical role of “real-time situational awareness” in conflicts.“We must detect, identify and track potential threats not when they approach our borders, but when they are still in their staging areas, airfields and bases, deep within an adversary’s territory,” he said.China’s creation of PLA Aerospace Force in April last year underlined its recognition of space as the “ultimate high ground” in modern warfare. “Their satellites have recently demonstrated sophisticated ‘dogfighting’ manoeuvres in LEO, practising tactics designed to track and potentially disable adversary space assets. They have evolved from a ‘kill chain’ to a ‘kill mesh’ — an integrated network that seamlessly interweaves ISR satellites with weapon systems,” Air Marshal Dixit said.","India plans to fast-track the launch of 52 dedicated satellites for the armed forces.

NEW DELHI: In a major policy change, Railways will soon prepare reservation chart (of confirmed berths/seats) eight hours before scheduled departure of trains instead of the present four hours. To facilitate passenger convenience, for trains departing before 2pm, the reservation chart will be prepared at 9pm the previous evening.Railway Board proposed the changes last week and railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has directed their implementation ""in a phased manner so that there is no disruption"". The board will come up with the roll out plan soon.In an official statement, the ministry said the current practice of preparing reservation charts four hours before train departure creates uncertainty in the minds of passengers. The new timeline will greatly help them with waitlisted tickets. They will get the first update on waitlist status well in advance. It will especially benefit passengers travelling from remote locations or suburbs of major cities to catch long distance trains. It will also provide more time to make alternative arrangements in case the waitlisted ticket is not confirmed, the statement said.In another passenger-friendly move, the railways announced complete revamp of passenger reservation system (PRS) by Dec.The new PRS will allow over 1.5 lakh ticket bookings per minute, around five times more than the current capacity of 32,000 tickets per minute.Under the new PRS, ticket inquiry capacity will increase 10-fold - from 4 lakh to over 40 lakh enquiries per minute. The system will also have a multilingual and user-friendly booking and inquiry interface. The decisions were made at a review meeting chaired by Vaishnaw last week. Officials said the project has been under execution by Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) over the last few months.""In the new PRS, users will be able to submit their choice of seat and see the fare calendar,"" said an official.

NEW DELHI: Monsoon covered the entire country on Sunday, nine days before the normal date, advancing into the remaining parts of Delhi-NCR, Rajasthan, west UP and Haryana, IMD said.This is only the fourth time in the past 25 years that monsoon covered NCR and remaining parts of northwest India the same day. The last time this happened was on July 13 in 2021, whereas the earliest date on which such an event took place was June 16 in 2013 — the day Kedarnath witnessed a major disaster due to cloudburst and flash floods.It has taken monsoon 37 days to cover the entire country this time since its onset over Kerala on May 24, eight days before the normal date. On an average, monsoon covers all of India in 38 days (June 1-July 8).

‘Lost to Marathi manoos’

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra government on Sunday nixed the government order on the implementation of the three-language policy amid opposition's allegations of ""imposing"" Hindi language on the students of the state.During a press conference, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also announced the formation of a committee under educationist Dr Narendra Jadhav to suggest the way forward and implementation of the language policy.The panel has sought three months to study the issue and prepare a report.""The state cabinet has decided to withdraw the Government Resolutions (GR) issued in April and June regarding the implementation of the three-language policy from class one. A committee headed by Dr Narendra Jadhav will be formed to recommend implementation (of the three-language formula),"" Fadnavis said.He said the government will take a fresh decision based on the report of Dr Jadhav, a former member of the Planning Commission and ex-Vice Chancellor.""The other names of the committee will be announced in some days. The panel will study the Mashelkar Committee's report and suggest from which standard (class 1 or otherwise) the three language formula will be implemented,"" he said.""The decision (on language policy) has been taken in the interest of Marathi students. If three languages are taught, students will get credit in the academic bank,"" he added.The Fadnavis government had issued a GR on April 16, making Hindi a compulsory third language for students in classes 1 to 5 studying in English and Marathi medium schools. Amid backlash, the government issued an amended GR on June 17 making Hindi an optional language.This comes after the opposition - Shiv Sena (UBT), MNS, and NCP (SP)- dubbed the move as ""imposition"" of Hindi in Maharashtra.Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS had announced a joint march on July 5 to oppose the ""imposition"" of the Hindi language. The march was cancelled after the government withdrew the GRs.Accusing Uddhav Thackeray of playing politics over the language issue, Fadnavis said the Shiv Sena (UBT) chief was opposing the Hindi language as he wants to ""lay red carpet for the English language"".Fadnavis said the Mahayuti government headed by him issued the two GRs in April and June as part of the sub-group set up by the then Thackeray-led MVA government.""We changed the decision to make the Hindi language mandatory and made it optional,"" he added.Fadnavis said the then CM Thackeray had appointed an 18-member Mashelkar Committee on September 21, 2020, comprising reputed figures from the education sector, on how to implement the NEP. A GR was issued on October 16, 2020.""The committee submitted a 101-page report on September 14, 2021. The panel stated that apart from the Marathi language, English and Hindi languages should be taught in classes 1 to 12. The report was tabled in the state cabinet on January 7, 2022. The minutes of the cabinet meeting are available,'' he said.He claimed Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Vijay Kadam, who runs an educational institution, was a member of the Mashelkar committee.Fadnavis also claimed Uddhav didn't mention that his government disagreed with the Mashelkar committee's report.""At that time, Uddhav didn't say that his government was not accepting the three-language formula. The then government set up a sub-group on the Mashelkar Committee's report,"" he added.""Any Indian who doesn't accept this proposal as part and parcel of a linguistic state has no right to be an Indian. He may be 100 per cent Maharashtrian, 100 per cent Gujarati, and 100 per cent Tamil, but he cannot be an Indian in the real sense of the word, except in geographical sense. If my suggestion is not accepted, India will then cease to be India,"" he said quoting Ambedkar from ""Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar: writings and speeches"".While addressing a press conference, Uddhav said that Devendra Fadnavis government attempted to break the unity of the Marathi manoos and create a divide between Marathis and non-Marathis.""The decision to impose Hindi under the guise of a three-language policy from Class 1 has finally been withdrawn. The government has cancelled the two GRs (Government Resolutions) related to this. This cannot be called wisdom that came late, because this imposition was withdrawn solely due to the strong resistance from the Marathi people. Why the government was so insistent on pushing Hindi and from where exactly this pressure was coming still remains a mystery,"" Uddhav said.""But the attempt to enforce the learning of Hindi by students in Maharashtra through the three-language formula has finally been defeated, and for that, congratulations to all the people of Maharashtra. The government lost to the power of Marathi manoos. The government did not realise Marathi manoos will unite in this manner. Let this passionate resolve grow stronger, and let the Marathi language become a language of knowledge and global discourse — that is the real aspiration,"" he added.The Fadnavis government had issued a GR on April 16, making Hindi a compulsory third language for students in classes 1 to 5 studying in English and Marathi medium schools.

Fadnavis defends Hindi move, cites Uddhav-era panel’s report

MUMBAI: Buffeted by an anti-Hindi campaign led by the Thackeray cousins, CM Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday announced that the state cabinet had decided to scrap two Govt Resolutions (GRs) to introduce Hindi as a third language for class 1 students.The announcement came on a day when public protests against introducing Hindi in primary schools started with Uddhav Thackeray present at a symbolic burning of the GRs at Azad Maidan. A stormy start was also expected to the monsoon session of the state legislature on Monday.Announcing a rollback, the CM also set up a panel led by academic Narendra Jadhav to frame recommendations for implementing a three-language policy. ""Our policy is Marathi-centric and Marathi student-centric. We do not wish to do politics on this issue,"" said Fadnavis.Following the announcement, the Thackerays called off a joint protest rally to be held on July 5 and instead hold a 'victory procession'. Both Shiv Sena (UBT) and Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena had described the move to start Hindi lessons in primary school as a 'linguistic imposition'.Announcing a rollback, Fadnavis cited recommendations of the Mashelkar committee set up by his predecessor in 2020 to defend his govt's move.He said Thackeray formed the expert panel to guide the administration on adopting the new National Education Policy. He said the report was accepted by Thackeray, Congress and NCP (SP) when in power. ""But as usual when in power speak differently, when out of power speak differently. Opposition for opposition sake,"" he added.Raj Thackeray must ask Uddhav Thackeray if he gave approval then how has he set out to hold an agitation now,” Fadnavis added.The state govt has been under pressure from its own Language Advisory Committee, which passed a resolution that no third language including Hindi be taught before Class 5. The opposition led by the Thackeray cousins had then announced a morcha against the introduction of Hindi on July 5. Several litterateurs and celebrities had announced their decision to join the morcha as also the Congress and the NCP (SP).Defending the GR for the third language, the CM said the Mashelkar committee set up during the tenure of Uddhav Thackeray submitted a 101-page report recommending such a move. The committee was led by scientist Raghunath Mashelkar and had a sub-committee which included Shiksha Vidya Prabodhini founder Vijay Kadam, a ‘deputy leader’ of Sena (UBT), he added.“Point number 8.1 (of the report) states English and Hindi languages should be implemented as second languages from first standard onwards. If students learn English for 12 years from first to twelfth standard, they will develop proficiency in English and be able to read necessary books. They will be prepared for engineering, medical and other technical-professional courses. While priority must be given to teaching in Marathi in higher education institutions, English and Hindi as second languages should be made compulsory from first standard to 12th. If needed, they should also be made compulsory in the 3 or 4-year degree courses of college education,” said Fadnavis, quoting from the report.He said that the new panel will study the Mashelkar report and engage with those opposed to the policy before making recommendations. The other members of the committee will be announced shortly and the committee will submit its report in three months, he said.Explaining the evolution of the three-language policy, he said the NEP was first adopted by Karnataka followed by MP, Telangana and UP. “On 21 Sept, 2020 then CM Uddhav Thackeray announced the setting up of an expert committee on how to apply this NEP.” Fadnavis said after the report was submitted on Sept 14, 2021, it came before the cabinet on Jan 20, 2022. Its minutes were confirmed on Jan 7, 2022 and signed by CM Thackeray. There is no mention of keeping aside the three-language policy,” said Fadnavis.“It is not true when some say the report was not accepted. The report was accepted and to implement it, a committee was set up to frame rules. In our tenure following the work of the committee the GRs were issued. We issued the first GR on 16 April, 2025 mentioning Marathi as compulsory followed by English as second language and Hindi as third language. There was an uproar and a second GR was issued on 17 June 2025 and in that we said any Indian language can be studied as a third language. Marathi is compulsory. The study of a third language is not from Std I. It is only an oral study, reading and writing is from Std III. Our govt did not take the decision, we did not make Hindi compulsory, rather (we) gave the option of any Indian language,” said Fadnavis.Fadnavis said when govt issued the second GR it was made clear they wanted to implement it through consensus and the education minister had begun holding consultations.After the CM’s press meet, deputy CM Ajit Pawar urged opposition to call off the July 5 morcha and not inconvenience people in Mumbai. “The reason for holding the morcha is no longer there,” he said.Following the CM’s announcement, MNS chief Raj Thackeray said, “This imposition was withdrawn solely due to strong resistance from the Marathi people. Why govt was so insistent on pushing Hindi and from where exactly this pressure was coming still remains a mystery.” He said the govt has once again appointed a new committee. “Let me say this in clear terms: whether the report of this committee comes or not, such things will no longer be tolerated. ”","CM Devendra Fadnavis defends Hindi move, cites Uddhav-era panel’s report. Announcement came on a day when public protests against introducing Hindi in primary schools started. A stormy start was also expected to the monsoon session of the state legislature on Monday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122148152,imgsize-1175321,width-400,resizemode-4/122148152.jpg"
Mumbai's iconic Parsi eatery shuts before 100th anniversery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbais-iconic-parsi-eatery-shuts-before-100th-anniversery/articleshow/122137364.cms,"TOI

MUMBAI: Jimmy Boy, the legendary Parsi restaurant tucked into the heart of Fort, was just months away from turning 100 years. Known for its Keema Pav, Brun Maska, Mava Cakes, and nostalgic Irani chai, the eatery has long been a culinary landmark in south Mumbai. But the dream of ringing in a centenary celebration at its original location came crashing down — quite literally — on the evening of June 20.According to civic records, on June 20 a call was registered with the BMC disaster management helpline by junior engineer of the building and factory department stating that cracks had developed in the ground plus four storey commercial building Vikas Premises whose ground floor houses this eatery. As per further details for safety reasons, the building had been vacated. “A formal notice has been issued instructing all occupants to vacate immediately and restricting further occupancy until structural safety is ensured,” stated a civic official.has a copy of the notice served to the owner of the building on June 21, under section 354 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act 1888. However the notice further read that the said consultant came on site at around 08:25 pm on June 20.“He informed that he had given Structural Audit report to the society, about a year before, informing therein to carry out immediate structural repairs however till date the society has not taken any remedial measure. A letter dated June 21 of M/s. Mahimtura Consultants Pvt. Ltd. is received to this office along with Proforma – B of Structural Audit Report and photographs showing conditions of the structure, wherein the said consultant has mentioned his various observations showing that the structural condition of building has become extremely dilapidated,” stated the notice.When contacted, Shehzad Irani, Director of Operations at Jimmy Boy, said that the Fort premises had been the heart of their operations. “In September 2025, we complete 100 years. We’ve been operating from the same premises, with the same family managing it. It was known as Café India until 1999, serving all-day breakfast and tea. The name was later changed to Jimmy Boy, where we began offering our full Parsi food menu. We had a few plans for our centenary celebrations, especially to give back to our patrons in some way. However, we hadn’t finalised anything yet,” he said.Irani added that Café Olive Green, run by the Army in Navy Nagar, is being serviced by Jimmy Boy, and patrons can enjoy cakes, sandwiches, and puffs there as well. Apart from this, they are also operating out of their Mahim premises, which has takeaway option only. Since the closure of the Fort branch, they have extended their delivery radius through online food aggregators.""While the Fort branch remains shut due to the ongoing structural issue, the case is being handled legally and we’re staying positive. Though this feels like a speed breaker, we hope to bounce back stronger. At the heart of everything, our aim remains to serve authentic Parsi food and give back to the city that made us who we are,"" he said.TOI tried to contact the owner of Vikas Premises, but the manager said he would only be available to comment on Monday.Pinky Janak Ganjawala, a landlord of a building in South Mumbai, expressed concern that even structurally sound buildings are being served notices simply due to their age. “Just because a building is old doesn’t mean it’s unsafe,” she said. Citing Section 79A of the MHADA Act, she noted that if owners fail to act within months of a danger notice, MHADA can take over redevelopment without tenant or owner consent. “In most cases, landlords and tenants aren’t aligned — and this process feels unfair to us,” she added.","Jimmy Boy, the legendary Parsi restaurant tucked into the heart of Fort, was just months away from turning 100 years.

A proposed 55-megawatt hydel project on the Kulsi river and a satellite township at Barduar - both near Guwahati and along the Meghalaya border - have drawn protests from indigenous groups worried about displacement and threats to their way of life. The Kulsi project, planned in collaboration with Meghalaya, would involve dam construction in the river's upper reaches and possibly displace around 10 villages. The Barduar township, set on about 1,500 acre surrounding a British-era tea garden in Kamrup district, would transform a largely tribal area into a suburban hub on Guwahati's outskirts.""There are some people who love protesting,"" Sarma said on the sidelines of an event. ""We, the two CMs (including Conrad Sangma of Meghalaya), want to build the dam for public benefit, to provide irrigation water. If they don't want it, they can just say so. But instead, there are speeches, protests, and the emergence of new leaders - this has damaged Assam."" Sarma said govt would not push forward with either project against local will. On the Barduar plan, he said: ""We've informed the assembly that if the people there oppose it, the township won't be built. Yet protests continue. What should we do with such agitators? I can't stop them from agitating."" Tribal groups, including All Rabha Students' Union, have demanded land documents for long-settled families in Barduar, fearing eviction if the township proceeds. They said the project threatens their movement for inclusion in Sixth Schedule of Constitution, which would grant greater autonomy to Rabha-inhabited areas.",Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma signalled Sunday possible cancellation of two major development projects.

HYDERABAD: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday asserted that the Centre will not engage in any discussions with Naxals as they continue to bear arms.Speaking at a public meeting after the inauguration of the headquarters of Turmeric Board at Nizamabad in Telangana , the home minister emphasised that the Congress-governed state should not become a hub for Naxal activities. “Congress asks (the Centre) to hold discussions with these people (Maoists). Our govt’s policy is ‘no talks’ with those who hold arms. Give up weapons, surrender, and join the mainstream. I have serious doubts about whether Congress govt might offer shelter to Naxals on the run,” the Union home minister said.The home minister urged CM A Revanth Reddy to take a strong stance against making Telangana a hub for Naxals, highlighting losses among police and local tribes due to Maoist violence. “Should we simply forget the sacrifices and allow them to roam free?” the Union minister asked.Shah reiterated the Centre’s commitment to eradicating Naxalism from the country entirely by March next year. “In several Northeastern states, over 10,000 extremists have surrendered, many of whom have even successfully contested local elections. In the past two years alone, over 2,000 Naxals have laid down their arms.If they continue to resist, we are determined that Naxalism will be wiped out by March 31, 2026,” Shah declared.Shah slammed the Congress govt, saying the tenure of the previous BRS regime was marred by corruption, which ultimately led the public to vote for Revanth. But despite the change in leadership, the people of Telangana have not seen the benefits they expected. “Once Telangana was an ATM for BRS. Now, it has merely become an ATM for Congress leaders in Delhi,” Shah remarked.Shah denounced Congress LS leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi for raising questions about Operation Sindoor . “Rahul, how many doubts do you have? During Operation Sindoor, we crossed into Pakistan and dismantled their terrorist camps.”On the turmeric board, Shah credited PM Narendra Modi with the initiative, saying the latter had promised it in 2023 and had not fulfilled it by meeting a four-decade-old demand to set up its headquarters in Nizamabad. “Modi Ji always delivers on what he promises,” the Union home minister emphasised.Shah highlighted Modi’s other measures for farmers such as increasing the agriculture budget by Rs 1 lakh crore, providing Rs 6,000 annually to every farmer, keeping fertiliser prices stable, and ensuring crop insurance.","The home minister urged CM A Revanth Reddy to take a strong stance against making Telangana a hub for Naxals. “Our govt’s policy is ‘no talks’ with those who hold arms.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said over 95 crore Indians were now covered under at least one social security scheme, citing a recent report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Quoting ILO’s findings, Modi said 64% of India’s population received at least one form of social protection benefit. This marks a significant increase from less than 25 crore beneficiaries in 2015.“This is not just a number. It reflects a significant transformation in how India supports its citizens,” the PM said during the 123rd episode of his radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’. He added that India now ranked second globally in terms of social security coverage. ILO data is based on Phase 1 of a national data consolidation drive, which covers central schemes and programmes implemented in eight states — Rajasthan, Maharashtra, MP, TN, Odisha, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Assam.Modi said Phase-2 was already under way and would bring data from the remaining states and more sectors, potentially taking the total number of beneficiaries past 100 crore.Modi said schemes like Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana and e-Shram portal have been key in extending social protection to a wider population, particularly the poor, elderly and unorganised workers.He said these schemes have ensured access to food, healthcare, income support and insurance for crores of families.He added that this growing social protection coverage would also help India in signing bilateral social security agreements with developed countries, enabling portability of benefits for Indian workers employed overseas. Modi also referred to a WHO report that declared India free from trachoma, an infectious eye disease that can lead to blindness.PM Narendra Modi said Phase-2 of a national data consolidation drive was already underway and would bring data from the remaining states and more sectors, potentially taking the total number of beneficiaries past 100 crore.Modi said schemes like Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana and e-Shram portal have been key in extending social protection to a wider population, particularly the poor, elderly and unorganised workers.

Mahindra believes this transition offers India a unique opportunity to emerge as a new centre of gravity in what he called ""Globalisation 2.0"".""India, too, will face challenges,"" Mahindra said, noting the evolving nature of global trade marked by shifting alliances, reduced dependence on China-centric supply chains, and diminishing dominance of the US market. He said the world is moving toward a ""multi-polar, regional, and domestically driven"" model of globalisation, in which India is well-positioned to thrive.""Ironically, the US shift toward de-globalisation may lead to a new avatar of globalisation… I believe India is well-positioned to emerge as one of the new centres of gravity,"" Mahindra asserted.He underscored India’s advantages, including its stable democracy, reputation as a reliable partner, and a strong, apolitical military. However, Mahindra cautioned that the future remains uncertain. ""Whether it be a country or a business, the winners will be the ones who can successfully navigate uncertainty and ambiguity—the ones who are resilient.""Referring to geopolitical volatility, Mahindra acknowledged that India faces risks, especially with “our provocative neighbour”, Pakistan. ""I am optimistic that we can demonstrate the limits to our tolerance without impeding our path to economic ascendance,"" he added.He pointed out that US-China decoupling, while uncertain, is likely to continue, impacting trade flows. ""International trade has already slowed amidst heightened uncertainty and dampened investor confidence,"" he said. Industries relying on global supply chains—such as electronics and consumer goods—are particularly vulnerable due to rising input costs, he warned.Mahindra stressed that India must rethink its trade dependencies and diversify sourcing. He predicted increased localisation, re-engineered supply chains, and the formation of new trade networks globally. India’s trade deficit, sectoral vulnerabilities, and rising competition must be addressed strategically.""The challenge will be to minimise the adverse effects, akin to how Lord Shiva confined the poison to his throat without letting it spread,"" Mahindra said, invoking the mythological reference of Samudra Manthan. But he urged India not to merely mitigate risks but seize this shift as a growth opportunity.""Instead, we can proactively view this as an opportunity to enable some 'Amrit' to emerge,"" he said. Mahindra emphasised that private enterprise must lead this economic transformation with speed and agility.India could benefit from China's adversarial stance, which may open up new opportunities in supply chains. Mahindra said India must focus on innovation, R&D, and manufacturing to capture market share from global competitors. ""Restrictions on China and high tariffs for other competing countries could open new markets for Indian goods,"" he said.To make the most of the moment, Mahindra warned, India must act swiftly. ""Speed and agility are essential, as countries like the Philippines and Vietnam are already touting themselves as future manufacturing hubs. We must act swiftly and strategically to secure our share of the Amrit.""","Anand Mahindra believes this transition offers India a unique opportunity to emerge as a new centre of gravity in what he called ""Globalisation 2.0"" He said the world is moving toward a ""multi-polar, regional, and domestically driven"" model of globalisation in which India is well-positioned to thrive.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122145398,imgsize-401768,width-400,resizemode-4/122145398.jpg"

Stock market recommendations: According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBICAP Securities, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise, and LT Foods are the top stock picks for the upcoming week. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks with a 3-month horizon:The squeeze sets the stage—the breakout steals the show. For 31 trading sessions, the Nifty moved in a narrow consolidation range, building silent pressure with every passing day. Like an audience holding its breath before the climax, the market was coiling, waiting for a trigger. That moment finally arrived this week, as Nifty broke free from its range-bound structure, delivering a sharp upside move that ended the week above the 25600 mark, with a 2.09% gain.More importantly, this move led to the highest weekly close since September 2024, confirming that the breakout wasn’t just symbolic—it was structural. On the weekly chart, the index has formed a sizable bullish candle, a visual expression of strong momentum and renewed buying conviction.This breakout was not an isolated event. It comes with improving breadth across sectors such as Financial Services, Private Banks, Oil & Gas, Infrastructure, and Auto, many of which have also seen breakout patterns of their own.Backed by strong technical indicators and firm sectoral participation, Nifty now looks poised to extend its northward journey in the coming weeks and is likely to test the level of 25800, followed by 26100 in the short term. While, on the downside, the zone of 25400-25350 is likely to provide a cushion in case of any immediate decline.The stage was set in silence—now, the spotlight is on the bulls.Bank Nifty has been displaying notable strength lately, backed by a series of compelling technical indicators. Most prominently, the index has registered fresh all-time highs over the last two trading sessions—clearly outperforming the broader Nifty index, which remains nearly 2.5% below its own record high. This relative outperformance reflects strong sectoral leadership from banking stocks.A key bullish trigger has been the recent Stage-2 cup pattern breakout on the daily chart—a well-known continuation formation that typically precedes a strong upward trend. Furthermore, Bank Nifty continues to trade above all its crucial short-term and long-term moving averages, signalling well-supported price action. Momentum indicators such as RSI and MACD remain firmly in bullish territory on both daily and weekly timeframes, highlighting sustained strength and trend acceleration.In summary, the alignment of breakout patterns, moving average support, and strong momentum across timeframes suggests that Bank Nifty is likely to maintain its bullish trajectory. As per the measure rule of cup pattern the upside target is placed at 59000 level. While, on the downside, the zone of 56800-56700 is likely to provide the cushion in case of any immediate decline.On the daily chart, the stock has registered a breakout from an Ascending Triangle pattern, supported by robust volume participation—signalling strong buying interest and a bullish continuation. This breakout not only validates the underlying strength but also marks a shift in sentiment after a period of consolidation.Currently, the stock is trading well above all its key moving averages, with each of these averages sloping upward, indicating a well-established uptrend.Adding to the bullish momentum, the daily RSI has also broken out of a two-month consolidation range, confirming the pickup in strength and signalling that the stock may be entering a fresh upward phase. Together, these technical developments suggest that the stock is likely to see continued upside in the near term.Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 7320-7280 level with a stoploss of Rs 7000. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 7900 in the short term.The stock recently found strong support near its 100-day EMA, which acted as a reliable cushion during the recent decline. Following this support, the stock witnessed a sharp upside rally, indicating a strong reversal from this crucial demand zone. What adds conviction to this rebound is the robust volume accompanying the move—highlighting renewed buying interest from market participants.Interestingly, the daily RSI also respected the 40 level, which is often considered a key support in bullish range shifts. The sharp pullback in RSI from this zone reinforces the view that momentum is regaining strength and the stock may be transitioning into a fresh bullish phase.Overall, this confluence of price action, volume confirmation, and momentum resilience points toward a potential continuation of the upward move in the near term. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 485-480 level with a stoploss of Rs 450. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 540 in the short term.","According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBICAP Securities, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise, and LT Foods are the top stock picks for the upcoming week.

MOHALI: Trouble mounted for dismissed Punjab police DSP Gursher Singh Sandhu as in a fresh development, the vigilance bureau registered a case against him and his mother Sukhwant Kaur for allegedly possessing assets disproportionate to known sources of income.The action stems from a wider probe linked to the controversial interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi recorded while he was in custody of Punjab police.According to vigilance officials, DSP Gursher Singh earned approximately Rs 26 lakh over three years, but investigations revealed that he spent around Rs 2.59 crore in the same period — an amount nearly 10 times his official income.The case was registered by the flying squad of Mohali, and multiple raids are underway to apprehend him. However, sources in vigilance bureau suspect that Gursher has fled abroad.This new case adds another layer to legal troubles of the former police officer, who was dismissed from service in Oct 2024 after being booked for fraud, forgery, and corruption. His pre-arrest bail plea was rejected in January this year by a local court, after which he went untraceable.Gursher, known as an ""encounter specialist"" during his tenure with Mohali Police, is facing serious allegations of extortion, land fraud, and abuse of official position.He is accused of buying disputed land parcels at throwaway prices and selling them at inflated rates, as well as filing false complaints through proxies to extort money from victims.One such victim approached the Punjab and Haryana high court, which subsequently ordered the registration of an FIR against him. The case includes charges under Sections 419, 465, 467, 468, and 471 of the IPC, along with provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.Gursher is alleged to have played a key role in facilitating televised interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi at the CIA staff office in Kharar. At the time, Gursher was serving as DSP (investigation), Mohali, and was frequently stationed at CIA office in Kharar.The interview caused a political and public uproar, prompting intervention from the high court, which led to his dismissal from service and suspension of seven other police officials. The vigilance bureau has intensified its manhunt for Gursher and is expected to widen its probe into his financial transactions, real estate dealings, and possible overseas links.","DSP Gursher Singh Sandhu and his mother Sukhwant Kaur are accused of possessing assets disproportionate to known sources of income.

We take a look at the top three upcoming changes in train ticketing and what they mean for passengers:

Train Chart Preparation 8 Hours in Advance

Currently, Indian Railways prepares reservation charts four hours prior to train departure. This uncertainty particularly affects those travelling from nearby locations to board their trains.

To address this concern, a new proposal suggests preparing reservation charts eight hours before departure time.

For trains scheduled before 1400 hours on a day, charts will be finalised at 2100 hrs on the preceding day.

The Railway Minister has endorsed this suggestion and instructed phased implementation to ensure smooth transition.

This revised system will provide clarity to passengers holding waitlisted tickets. They will receive updates about their waitlist status earlier than before.

The change will particularly assist travellers from distant areas or city outskirts who plan to board long-distance trains. Additionally, passengers will have sufficient time to plan alternative travel arrangements if their waitlisted tickets remain unconfirmed.

Only Verified Users for Tatkal Ticket Booking

Indian Railways has announced that starting July 1, 2025, only verified users will be permitted to book Tatkal tickets through the IRCTC website and mobile application.

through the IRCTC website and mobile application. Additionally, the implementation of OTP-based authentication for Tatkal bookings will commence from end of July.

The Railways Minister has directed the officials to expand the authentication process for Tatkal reservations.

Users will need to verify their identity using either Aadhaar or other valid government identification documents stored in their DigiLocker accounts.

Earlier, it had been announced that only Aadhaar-authenticated users will be able to book tatkal tickets from July 1, 2025. The scope of that is now being expanded to include documents in DigiLocker.

New Passenger Reservation System by December 2025

The Railways Minister conducted an assessment of passenger reservation system improvements. CRIS has been implementing this enhancement project over recent months.

The enhanced PRS infrastructure demonstrates adaptability, flexibility and expanded capacity, capable of managing ten times the existing volume. This substantial upgrade will boost ticket booking capabilities significantly.

The modernised system will facilitate over 150,000 ticket reservations per minute, representing a fivefold increase from the current capacity of 32,000 tickets per minute.

The system's enquiry processing ability will see a tenfold enhancement, expanding from 400,000 to more than 4 million enquiries per minute.

The upgraded PRS features a user-friendly interface supporting multiple languages for bookings and enquiries.

The enhanced system enables users to specify seating preferences and view fare calendars. Additionally, it incorporates dedicated facilities for Divyangjan, students, patients and other specific categories.

Indian Railways train ticket operations set for a major revamp: In a move aimed at enhancing comfort for passengers, Indian Railways is planning to gradually roll out three key changes to its passenger reservation system. The steps will involve a new procedure for booking tatkal train tickets, advance chart preparation for waitlisted passengers and the overall upgradation of the passenger reservation system.During a recent assessment of these improvements, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stressed the importance of developing an intelligent, clear, user-friendly and productive ticketing system. The primary focus of planning should be passenger comfort, ensuring that travellers experience seamless and pleasant journeys throughout their rail travel, he has said.","Indian Railways is planning to gradually roll out three key changes to its passenger reservation system.

What is the Ganga water agreement between India and Bangladesh?

The water-sharing agreement of 1996 between India and Bangladesh was established to resolve disputes regarding the Farakka water allocation.

The discord arose following the 1975 activation of the Farakka barrage, which channelled water from the Ganges to the Hooghly River to ensure the Calcutta port remained navigable.

The agreement established terms between India, the upstream nation, and Bangladesh, the downstream nation, for sharing Ganges water at Farakka - a barrier constructed on river Bhagirathi, approximately 10 kilometres from Bangladesh's border.

The Farakka Barrage's construction facilitated a 40,000 cusecs water diversion into a feeder canal serving the Kolkata Port Trust.

The current protocol allocates 35,000 cusecs of water alternately to both nations for 10-day periods during the lean season from March 11 to May 11.

India is exploring various alternatives to modify and reassess a significant agreement with Bangladesh regarding the distribution of Ganga waters, following its decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan.The agreement for sharing Ganga waters, called the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty, expires in 2026, marking 30 years since its implementation. While renewal requires mutual agreement, New Delhi is eyeing a fresh treaty that addresses its present developmental requirements, sources told ET.The agreement, which was formalised in 1996 when Sheikh Hasina began her first tenure as Bangladesh's Prime Minister, established a framework for distributing Ganga's flow at the Farakka Barrage in West Bengal during the critical dry period from January 1 to May 31 annually.Also Read | China plays hardball!

According to these sources, India seeks to modify the treaty to accommodate its requirements for irrigation, harbour maintenance, and electricity production.The West Bengal administration reportedly supports the Central government's position, considering that the treaty's existing provisions are insufficient for their requirements.Also Read | India bleeds Pakistan dry: Water at ‘dead’ levels in Pakistan's dams; bigger Indus river plans in the works - top points to know","The water-sharing agreement of 1996 between India and Bangladesh was established to resolve disputes regarding the Farakka water allocation.

Microsoft sued by authors for allegedly using pirated books to train AI model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/microsoft-sued-by-authors-for-allegedly-using-pirated-books-to-train-ai-model/articleshow/122088854.cms,"Authors accuse Microsoft of copyright infringement

Lawsuit demands damages and a court injunction

Legal backdrop: A turning point in AI copyright battles

Microsoft yet to respond publicly

A growing challenge for the AI industry





A group of prominent authors, including Pulitzer Prize winner Kai Bird and New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino, has filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, accusing the tech giant of illegally using pirated versions of their books to train its AI model known as “Megatron. ” Filed in a New York federal court on June 25, the suit claims that Microsoft copied nearly 200,000 copyrighted works without permission to develop AI systems that mimic the authors’ unique writing styles, themes, and voices. This marks another major legal challenge in the growing debate over AI training and copyright law.The plaintiffs allege that Microsoft used a massive dataset of pirated digital books to train Megatron, a generative AI model designed to produce human-like text. According to the complaint, the AI’s ability to replicate the tone, syntax, and narrative patterns of copyrighted works demonstrates a clear violation of intellectual property rights. The authors argue that their creative output was exploited to build a product that competes with them in the marketplace, without their consent or compensation.The writers are seeking statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work, along with a court order to block Microsoft from continuing its alleged unauthorised use of their materials.While the exact number of infringed titles remains unclear, the plaintiffs claim that thousands of authors’ works may have been used without licence or attribution. The case could set a precedent for how courts handle AI training involving copyrighted content.This lawsuit comes just one day after a California judge ruled that AI firm Anthropic may have made “fair use” of copyrighted material in training but could still be liable for using pirated versions of books. It was the first US decision to address the legality of using copyrighted texts in generative AI development. The Microsoft case adds further momentum to a wave of lawsuits from writers, artists, and media outlets challenging how their work is used by tech companies.According to Reuters, Microsoft has not issued an official response to the allegations. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment when contacted by reporters. Meanwhile, legal observers say this case will be closely watched for its implications on the future of AI development and intellectual property rights.Tech firms including Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic have all faced similar legal scrutiny in recent time. The central argument from the companies is that using public data for AI training qualifies as “fair use” under US copyright law. However, rights holders argue that this approach undermines creators' control and devalues their work. As AI models become increasingly sophisticated, courts should define clearer boundaries around what constitutes ethical and legal data usage.","Lawsuit demands damages and a court injunction against Microsoft.

70% of Indian teens spend 7 hours online: ISKCON monk warns of mental health fallout

A spiritual path grounded in scientific wisdom



Gauranga Das’s unique approach to leadership



Books that bridge the gap between worlds



The Art of Resilience

The Art of Focus

In a moment that appealed to seekers of spirituality as well as tech enthusiasts, there was an unforgettable exchange between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The discussion between them, which had started lively with a jocular remark about being youthful, soon turned into an introspective discussion on the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility.Gauranga Das, a graduate from IIT Bombay, who now heads programs in sustainable living and spiritual education, used the moment to highlight some of the most pressing concerns of our digital times - mental health and the increasing digital addiction epidemic.The difference between these two IIT graduates was more than physical or professional; it was philosophical. While one sits at the head of one of the most influential tech giants in the world, the other has dedicated his life to leading people to inner understanding and spiritual direction. The meeting wasn't merely a reunion; it was a comparison of two radically different directions based on the same intellectual heritage. It was an effective metaphor for the decisions contemporary society must make today: progress without equilibrium, or innovation backed by internal wellness.Gauranga Das and Sundar Pichai, though having started at the same time at IIT, followed different career paths early on in life. Pichai went into technology and became the CEO of Google, a company that is at the heart of the digital revolution. Das instead went down the path of spiritual discovery and service, becoming an ISKCON member and dedicating himself to bringing ancient wisdom into modern settings.Their meeting at the India Global Forum 2025 was noticed when Pichai noted the way young Gauranga Das looked compared to his age. Das responded with an answer that went viral instantly for its simplicity and profundity:This one sentence highlighted a wider discussion regarding what it means to live from purpose rather than performance. It also spawned a wider debate regarding how spiritual tools can assist with coping with rising levels of stress inflicted as a result of round-the-clock digital interaction.In his address to the forum, Gauranga Das reported shocking statistics regarding digital addiction, specifically social media. Based on the information he provided, more than 230 million individuals globally are addicted to social media. In India alone, 70% of adolescents spend as much as seven hours per day on the net, a figure that indicates increasing worry for parents, teachers, and mental health professionals.Das linked these figures to the wider problem of declining mental health worldwide. Referring to world trends, he identified that one in seven individuals is presently suffering from some sort of mental health difficulty. These are anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and chronic stress; maladies that are increasingly being attributed to excessive exposure to digital content and a mindfulness deficit in daily life.This was not simply an attack on technology, but a call to awaken to how we engage with it. Das leveraged the platform to promote a more holistic digital life, one that includes frequent breaks, mindful use, and spiritual anchoring.Gauranga Das is not only a monk who has spiritual wisdom; he is also an engineer who has been trained and who has a deep understanding of how technology functions and how it may affect human psychology. This makes him uniquely qualified in matters that lie at the interface between science and spirituality.Das is also a senior member of the Governing Body Commission of ISKCON and the director of Govardhan Ecovillage (GEV), a green living community that was established under the inspiration of Radhanath Swami. GEV is not only an ashram, it is a widely acclaimed model of how to apply ancient wisdom to modern sustainability practices. It won the UN World Tourism Organization Award in 2017, and it is also accredited with key United Nations organisations such as UNEP, ECOSOC, UNCCD, and CBD.Under Das's stewardship, GEV has turned into an exemplar of the way communities can be in harmony with nature yet maintain essential spiritual principles. It should not be astonishing that numerous young professionals, such as engineers, physicians, and policy makers, now journey to the Ecovillage for leadership training and retreats.Aside from his work in the Ecovillage, Gauranga Das also heads the Govardhan School of Public Leadership, an institution that prepares wannabe civil servants of India. The founder created the school to develop resilient leaders imbued with ethical values by the integration of Vedic wisdom alongside contemporary public policy training.Das also leads the Bhaktivedanta Research Centre, where ancient manuscripts are kept, translated, and analysed in academic contexts. This centre offers postgraduate studies in philosophy and comparative religion, providing students access to systems of knowledge that are both ancient and extremely useful today. The curriculum combines ancient insights with modern administrative frameworks, helping students navigate complexity, uncertainty, and moral dilemmas in real-world governance and social impact roles.Through such platforms, Das prioritises staying resilient, focused, and mentally clear; qualities that are typically undervalued in demanding corporate settings but are key to sustained success and satisfaction.To make spiritual insights more common, Gauranga Das has written two influential books:Both books borrow from scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita but touch on very contemporary issues like office burnout, distraction, and individual discontentment. These books have spoken to spiritual seekers as well as working professionals seeking down-to-earth, real-life counsel on surviving life's stress.In interviews and talks, Das has consistently emphasised that spiritual tools are not exclusive to monks or renunciants. They are equally relevant to CEOs, students, and anyone navigating the complexities of modern life.",Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das met at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The pair discussed the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility. Das is not only a monk who has spiritual wisdom; he is also an engineer who has a deep understanding of how technology functions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122067493,imgsize-39158,width-400,resizemode-4/Sundar-Pichais-IIT-batchmate-Gauranga-Das-who-turned-monk-looks-younger-than-him.jpg"

The next is scheduled July 9.Residents say that the govt of Maharashtra authorities namely Mhada, SRA and BMC have included the 200-year-old Miracle Cross and Prarthanalaya (church) in the slum rehabilitation scheme of Nargis Dutt Nagar.Rahebar Khan Raja, former municipal councillor of the locality said, ""The Miracle Cross and Prarthanalaya Association are the petitioners and they have given me the power of attorney to fight the court cases.On June 25, the Bombay High Court bench of Justice GS Kulkarni and Justice Arif Doctor granted a stay on the SRA's eviction and demolition order on the cross and Prarthanalaya structures. The judges questioned the authorities how a sacred prayer centre, which is neither a residential nor commercial entity, can be included in an SRA scheme. They asked about the ownership of these lands and asked the authorities to file their reply by way of affidavits. The next hearing is on July 9. The judges directed that there should be no eviction or demolition till further orders.""Khan says these prime sea-facing areas are reclaimed lands from the sea. ""Of this 117 acres was given by the govt of Maharashtra in 1964 to the Maharashtra Housing Board (Mhada) to build houses for economical weaker section (EWS) and low income group (LIG) citizens. Now under the garb of SRA, developers are trying to gain maximum benefits. This is a 200-year-old cross, grotto and shrine situated opposite Rangsharda Hotel.

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S.

Elon Musk reclaims actor Gene Wilder’s Bel-Air property after loan default,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-reclaims-actor-gene-wilders-bel-air-property-after-loan-default/articleshow/122118210.cms,"Representative Image

Why Gene Wilder’s nephew felt short on his loan payments



“restore the house to much of how Gene had it (with modern editions and no shag carpeting) during his golden period there,”

“Everything was orderly and convivial.”

“It was an opportunity that allowed me to film my autobiographical movie, The Requiem Boogie, in the house where so many childhood memories in it actually took place. It has been a very special and magical four years. Collectively and in coordination with Mr. Musk and his team, we took the steps we are taking now.”

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reportedly reclaimed ownership of actor Gene Wilder ’s iconic Bel-Air home after the late star’s nephew, Jordan Walker-Pearlman , defaulted on a loan he received from the tech billionaire to purchase the property in 2020. Musk initially acquired the single-family Los Angeles home in 2013 for $6.7 million. In 2020, he had expressed intentions to sell the property, stating at the time that he planned to “own no house.” It was later revealed that Musk had lent Walker-Pearlman and his wife, Elizabeth Hunter, $6.7 million to buy the home from him. However, the couple reportedly fell behind on loan payments, prompting Musk to move to foreclose on the property in July 2024.According to a report by Realtor.com, Musk had planned a public auction for the property in December 2024. Yet, January 2025 records indicate the home was ultimately purchased for $7.5 million through an LLC owned by Musk, the report notes.While living in the home, the couple worked toWalker-Pearlman told The Hollywood Reporter.However, the foreclosure sale details and ownership transition were kept private. Walker-Pearlman said,He was reportedly financially affected by the 2023 Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes, which led to delays in loan payments. He previously mentioned to the outlet that there was no ill will between him and Musk regarding the foreclosure notice.In a statement from 2024, Walker-Pearlman said:He and his wife first attempted to sell the house on their own, listing it for $12.95 million in August 2024, but were unable to secure a buyer. The asking price was later reduced to $9.5 million in November 2024.That same month, Walker-Pearlman and Hunter were notified that the property was scheduled for auction in December 2024. As per Realtor.com, the notice cited an outstanding loan balance along with “reasonable estimated costs, expenses, and advances,” totalling $7.5 million.","Jordan Walker-Pearlman defaulted on a loan he received from Elon Musk to purchase the property in 2020.

SoftBank is ‘all in’ on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. CEO and Founder Masayoshi Son said the company is betting heavily on the artificial intelligence (AI) company, with planned investments worth 4.8 trillion Japanese yen (around $33.2 billion). Son said he believes OpenAI, currently unlisted and not profitable, will eventually become “the most valuable company in the world.” Speaking at a shareholder meeting, Son said SoftBank’s long-term goal is to play a leading role in the era of artificial superintelligence (ASI)—a concept he described as AI that is 10,000 times smarter than humans. The Japanese tech conglomerate has been expanding its partnership with OpenAI this year, including joining the $500 billion Stargate project.During the meeting, the Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son also revealed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had once asked SoftBank for a $10 billion investment before Microsoft signed its now well-known partnership with the AI firm. “I said, yes, I would,” Son told shareholders. But Altman eventually went with Microsoft.The software giant recently lost its exclusive cloud provider status with OpenAI and hasn’t approved a reported restructuring plan to make OpenAI a traditional for-profit company.Despite the changing relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, Masayoshi Son said SoftBank’s commitment remains firm. The company earlier stated it might reduce its stake if OpenAI doesn’t restructure by December 31, but Son clarified on Friday that their support will continue “regardless of what happens with Microsoft.”Son said OpenAI is key to SoftBank’s vision of building the world’s largest ASI platform. He reportedly aims for the company to become the “organizer of the industry in the artificial superintelligence era” within the next decade.SoftBank owns Arm, the UK-based chip company, and recently acquired U.S.-based chip designer Ampere for $6.5 billion. It is also reportedly exploring the creation of a $1 trillion AI-focused industrial complex in the United States.","SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said the company is betting heavily on the artificial intelligence (AI) company, with planned investments worth 4.8 trillion Japanese yen (around $33.2 billion) Son said he believes OpenAI will eventually become “the most valuable company in the world.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122111217,imgsize-22694,width-400,resizemode-4/SoftBank-CEO-and-Founder-Masayoshi-Son.jpg"

‘It's not too late to change course’: Bill Gates

How to detect hidden cameras in a hotel room, just with your smartphone

Microsoft founder and former CEO Bill Gates has once again raised concerns over the impact of US government cutting funding for global health. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), he warned that this could result in an additional 8 million child deaths by 2024. Gates cited a Lancet study on the cumulative impact of reductions in American aid. “It found that, by 2040, 8 million more children will die before their fifth birthday. To give some context for 8 million: That's how many children live in California, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio combined,” Gates said.In the post, he writes “When the United States and other governments suddenly cut their aid budgets, I know for a fact that more children will die.”He said he has worked in the global health space for over 25 years and has seen how important aid is in saving lives. “Over the past 25 years—the same span of time I spent leading Microsoft—I have immersed myself in global health: building knowledge, deepening expertise, and working to save lives from deadly diseases and preventable causes. During that time, I have built teams of world-class scientists and public health experts at the Gates Foundation , studied health systems across continents, and worked in close partnership with national and local leaders to strengthen the delivery of lifesaving care,” he writes.“Global health aid saves lives. And when that aid is withdrawn—abruptly and without a plan—lives are lost,” Gates warned. “At this point, I know as much about improving health in poor countries as I do about software,” he further stated.Microsoft founder Bill Gates said that U.S. cuts to global health aid are already causing problems. He pointed out that important programs like tuberculosis testing and malaria prevention are slowing down, and life-saving medicines are getting delayed.Gates recently visited Nigeria and Ethiopia and said he saw for himself how healthcare services there are being affected by the funding cuts.Still, Gates said there is time to fix the situation. “It’s not too late to change course,” he wrote on X. He urged the U.S. Congress to restore funding for major programs such as PEPFAR (the U.S. plan for AIDS relief) and the Global Fund.",Microsoft founder and former CEO Bill Gates has once again raised concerns over the impact of US government cutting funding for global health.
