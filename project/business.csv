"'Affordable, accessible and approachable': Amit Shah unveils new criminal laws; a major reform for justice in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/affordable-accessible-and-approachable-amit-shah-unveils-new-criminal-laws-a-major-reform-for-justice-in-india/articleshow/122195385.cms,"File Image

NEW DELHI: Stating that the new criminal laws shall be regarded as the biggest reform since Independence, home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said they will shift the people’s mindset from “what will happen if I file an FIR’ to a strong belief that ‘filing an FIR will lead to prompt justice”.Addressing the programme ‘A Golden Year of Trust in the Justice System’ here to mark the successful completion of one year of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA), Shah said new laws introduced by the Narendra Modi will not only make the judicial process “affordable, accessible and approachable” but also “simple, consistent and transparent”.“There can be no greater reform than making the justice system - which protects the rights of the people - transparent, citizen-centric, and time-bound,” Shah said during the event also attended by Delhi LG V K Saxena and chief minister Rekha Gupta.The home minister said the new criminal laws will be fully implemented across the country in nearly three years, while sharing that 23 states and Union territories have already completed 100% capacity building.He complimented Delhi for doing the best, among all states/UTs, to implement the laws expeditiously.Shah, who until now has taken 160 meetings on the new laws, shared that notifications have already been issued for e-Sakshya (electronic evidence) and e-Summons (electronic summons) in 11 states and Union territories (UTs). Nyaya Shruti (electronic court records) has been notified in six states/UTs, and community service as punishment in a dozen states/UTs, he added.In the past year, nearly 14.8 lakh police personnel, 42,000 prison staff, over 19,000 judicial officers, and more than 11,000 public prosecutors were trained in provisions of the new laws.“A golden era of governance based on social, economic, and political justice is about to begin,” Shah said and added that “after the full implementation of these laws, justice in the country will be delivered all the way up to the Supreme Court starting from filing of the FIR, within three years. He explained that BNS, BNSS and BSA lay down strict timelines for the three key pillars responsible for delivering justice to citizens—the police, prosecution, and judiciary.Mentioning the smart use of technology for accurate and speedy criminal justice, the home minister expressed confidence that offenders will be left with no opportunity to escape punishment by availing the benefit of doubt. He said this will raise the conviction rate and make the Indian criminal justice system one of the most modern in the world.Shah said that while the purpose of the old laws was to extend British rule and protect their property, the new laws are focused on protecting the life, property, and all constitutionally guaranteed rights of Indian citizens, with the goal being justice and not punishment.The home minister said the new laws add a separate chapter on crimes against children and women. For the first time, terrorism and organised crime have been defined and provision made for stringent punishment, he underlined.","The home minister said the new criminal laws will be fully implemented across the country in nearly three years. 23 states and Union territories have already completed 100% capacity building. Nearly 14.8 lakh police personnel, 42,000 prison staff, over 19,000 judicial officers, and more than 11,000 public prosecutors were trained in provisions of the new laws.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122195667,imgsize-35686,width-400,resizemode-4/122195667.jpg"

"‘In principle’ nod for J&K hydro power project, dam construction to harness Chenab’s potential",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nod-to-divert-forest-land-for-jk-hydel-unit/articleshow/122193994.cms,"NEW DELHI: Acting on the urgency to speed up projects of strategic significance, an environment ministry panel has given “in-principle” approval for diversion of over 847 hectares of reserved forest and ‘jungle-jhari’ land for construction of the ambitious 1,856-MW Sawalkot hydroelectric project in Ramban district of Jammu & Kashmir. Certain key green provisions were set aside for the purpose, keeping in view national interests.Though the final approval will be subject to grant of environment clearance for the project by the UT govt, the move shows the intent to swiftly take up the dam’s construction for leveraging Chenab river’s potential following suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).The Sawalkot hydroelectric project (HEP) is a major hydropower initiative, intended to harness the potential of the Chenab — one of the western rivers along with Indus and Jhelum whose waters currently flow unchecked to Pakistan despite India’s right to use it for non-consumptive purposes, including hydro-power generation.Minutes of the environment ministry’s forest advisory committee meeting, made public this week, show that while giving its approval on June 24, it took note of the Union home ministry’s June 12 plea arguing that conducting cumulative impact assessment (CIA) and carrying capacity studies (CCS) on the Chenab before giving clearance at this juncture “may risk exposure of sensitive hydrological data, which could be exploited by the downstream neighbouring country”.A day before the home ministry’s note to the advisory committee, the power ministry too on June 11 sought granting exemption from CIA and CCS for the Sawalkot HEP for facilitating its expeditious implementation. It argued how conducting CIA and CCS - prerequisite for grant of ‘in-principle’ approval - may leak sensitive hydrological and environmental data, thereby compromising national interests.Earlier, the UT government submitted a similar reply, saying the river Chenab is falling in the Indus Water Treaty and therefore the data of the studies cannot be published due to security reasons.The CIA of a river basin would reflect the cumulative impact of commissioned/ upcoming hydro-power projects on environmental flow, bio-diversity, muck disposal sites and traffic flow in the region etc. whereas the CCS is important to plan optimal number of power projects in a basin.As per the “in-principle” approval of the advisory committee, the forest diversion for the Sawalkot HEP will take place in Udhampur, Reasi and Ramban districts subject to certain specific conditions including dam safety plan, soil and moisture conservation, and the green nod from the UT government.","An environment ministry panel has given “in-principle” approval for diversion of over 847 hectares of reserved forest and ‘jungle-jhari’ land for construction of the ambitious 1,856-MW Sawalkot hydroelectric project in Ramban district of Jammu & Kashmir.

NEW DELHI: Boosting his chances of securing premature release, Delhi high court Tuesday noted ""demonstrable indicators of reformation"" in Santosh Kumar Singh , convicted in the 1996 rape and murder case of DU law student Priyadarshini Mattoo.Deciding a batch of petitions by murder convicts, including Singh, challenging the rejection of their plea for remission, HC asked the Sentence Review Board (SRB) to consider their applications afresh in next four months.Justice Sanjeev Narula outlined ""an element of reformation"" in Singh and underlined that the nature of the original crime cannot, by itself, be the sole ground for denying premature release.Specifically, in Singh's case, the high court disapproved of SRB's comments that his conduct in jail is not necessarily a barometer of what he may do outside prison.""In the present batch of cases, despite a prima facie reformative conduct and intent exhibited by the convicts, correlation to such material considerations is conspicuously absent,"" the court observed, faulting the SRB for rejecting the plea by Singh and others only due to the gravity, cruelty and perversity of the crime, and the objections raised by police and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The court found the argument that jail behaviour wasn't an indicator of a person's reformation ""deeply problematic"".""While the heinousness of the offence and the views of investigating agencies are undoubtedly relevant, they cannot operate to the exclusion of other equally material considerations such as post-conviction conduct, demonstrated reform, educational and vocational achievements, and institutional assessment through placement in open prisons,"" the court noted.It pointed out that SRB made ""no effort"" to evaluate the petitioner's ""demonstrable reformative progress, including advanced educational qualifications, documented good conduct and participation in rehabilitation programmes.""Justice Narula also highlighted that Singh was at present lodged in an open prison, which entitles him to exit the prison complex daily between 8am and 8pm for gainful employment as a legal consultant.""As noted above, the placement in such a prison category is a reflection of the positive reformative conduct of the convict. This is a critical indicator of reform which the SRB has failed to even acknowledge, let alone evaluate,"" it observed.In an 82-page verdict, HC detected little indication the SRB ""undertook any nuanced or individualised assessment of the petitioners' present psychological stability and emotional rehabilitation, behavioural disposition, institutional conduct or potential for reintegration. The apparent lack of depth in these foundational reports undermines the deliberative exercise that SRB is expected to undertake. ""The court gave SRB three months to convene its next meeting to consider the plea of Singh and two other convicts.""In doing so, SRB shall ensure due application of mind to each case and make a reasoned decision within a period of four months from the date of this judgment,"" the high court specified, laying down in detail what each official involved in the process must do as per guidelines of the jail manual.It ordered the superintendent of the prison housing the convict to prepare a revised note with a clear recommendation and reflect the official's opinion about the prisoner's conduct, mental and physical health, participation in reformative activities and overall suitability for premature release.Next, a senior police officer of appropriate rank shall prepare a report assessing the convict's conduct, antecedents, present risk profile and community impact in a balanced and evidence-based manner.It further directed that the deputy commissioner of police/superintendent of police concerned must furnish a report as required under relevant rules. Where any objection to premature release is raised, it must be supported by cogent reasons, including any credible threat perception or risk of recidivism.""Mere reiteration of the gravity of the original offence shall not suffice,"" the high court said, adding that inputs from the district probation officer shall also be submitted afresh.""It must be a detailed and individualised inquiry into the desirability of the prisoner's release, addressing, on the basis of relevant material, the convict's family and social background, reintegration prospects, community acceptance and any demonstrated reformation of character or attitude,"" the court noted.It further laid down guidelines for SRB while considering remission pleas of convicts.

ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26: As the timeline for filing Income-tax Returns (ITR) approaches (September 15th for this FY, after extension), individuals, particularly those whose income falls below the taxable threshold, as well as Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) who do not earn any income in India, often wonder whether they are required to file a tax return in India. The truth is, filing your return plays a crucial role in various aspects of your financial and legal life.A common misconception is - “If I don’t owe any tax, why should I file a tax return?” Let’s clarify a fundamental point – the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) requires individuals to file tax returns if their gross total income exceeds the basic exemption limit. For Financial Year (FY) 2024-25, the threshold under the old tax regime is INR 2.5 lakhs for individuals below 60 years of age (INR 3 lakhs for resident individuals aged between 60 and 80 years, and INR 5 lakhs for resident individuals aged above 80 years), and it is INR 3 lakhs under the new/concessional tax regime. This means that individuals whose income is not taxable on account of claiming the rebate are also required to file tax returns. However, this is just the starting point. There are many other situations where you must file an ITR even if you do not owe any tax or your income is below the exemption limit. This has been further explained below.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2024-25: How can taxpayers switch between old and new income tax regimes? Explained For example, Mr. A, earned INR 2.4 lakhs in FY 2024–25, primarily from pension and fixed deposits in the bank.Despite being below the exemption limit, his bank deducted INR 6,000 as TDS on interest from fixed deposits. Filing an ITR is his only way to claim a refund of this deducted tax.One key reason to file your ITR, even if you have no taxable income, is the ability to carry forward capital losses for future tax benefits. It is however imperative to note that carry forward of losses from house property are not allowed under the new tax regime.Imagine you incurred a loss from sale of shares during FY 2024-25. If you do not file your ITR on time, those losses cannot be carried forward to offset future capital gains. Filing your return ensures these losses are offset with future capital gains, making a bad investment year potentially work in your favour later.Another crucial reason to file returns, even with low or no income, is the requirement for foreign asset disclosure for individuals qualifying as Resident and Ordinarily Residents (ROR) in India Such individuals must report their overseas assets under Schedule FA of the ITR forms. Foreign assets such as bank accounts, financial interests, ESOPs allotted under the employer’s overseas stock incentive scheme, immovable property are to be reported regardless of the income levels. Failure to do so can lead to penalties under the Black Money Act, 2015 and, even prosecution in some cases.Also Read | ITR e-filing FY 2024-25: What is the benefit of pre-filled ITR forms on the income tax portal? Top points For example, Mr. A and his spouse are joint owners of a foreign property. In this case, both must report the asset in their respective ITRs. This joint ownership requires careful attention to ensure compliance, as failure to report can attract scrutiny from tax authorities.In recent years, global information sharing has increased under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). ROR receiving foreign remittances or holding foreign assets must ensure compliance with tax regulations. Skipping the filing of ITR to avoid FA reporting is not only risky but can also be questioned. Tax authorities are now equipped with automatic exchange of information mechanisms that provide them with insights into foreign transactions/ foreign assets, leading to notices and requests for information. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to file their ITRs accurately and on time to avoid penalties and ensure compliance.The Act specifies various criteria for mandatory tax return filing. Here are some of the scenarios that require individuals to file ITR, irrespective of their income levels:If you meet any of these criteria, even if your income is below the exemption limit, you are required to file your return.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2024-25: Do you need to file your income tax return if TDS has been deducted? Explained In today’s world, ITRs have become essential documents beyond tax compliance. Financial institutions, embassies, and even landlords view your return as a testament to your credibility.If you plan to apply for a visa, especially to countries like the US, UK, Schengen nations, or Canada, you will often need to submit ITRs for the past 2-3 FYs. Not having an ITR could lead to delays or denials. Similarly, loan applications, whether for a home or car, are often assessed based on the income reported in ITRs, even if your bank statements look good.For example, Priya, a freelancer, earned INR 2 lakhs in FY 2024-25. She did not file an ITR, thinking it was not necessary. Later, while applying for a Schengen visa, her application was delayed because she could not submit ITRs from the last two FYs, something consulates often expect, even without taxable income.Also Read | Income Tax Return: What is Form 16? Top things taxpayers should check in this document before filing ITR In conclusion, filing an ITR is more than just a tax obligation; it is a way to establish your financial presence, ensure transparency, claim rightful refunds, and meet compliance requirements in an interconnected world. Whether you are a pensioner with TDS, salaried individual with foreign shares received under an overseas ESOP plan, a student with overseas accounts, or a homemaker planning international travel, your tax return can speak volumes when other documents cannot. Hence, it is essential that you evaluate your situation holistically to determine whether there is a requirement to file a tax return or not.","A common misconception is - “If I don’t owe any tax, why should I file a tax return?” The truth is, filing your return plays a crucial role in various aspects of your financial and legal life.

MOHALI: Trouble mounted for dismissed Punjab police DSP Gursher Singh Sandhu as in a fresh development, the vigilance bureau registered a case against him and his mother Sukhwant Kaur for allegedly possessing assets disproportionate to known sources of income.The action stems from a wider probe linked to the controversial interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi recorded while he was in custody of Punjab police.According to vigilance officials, DSP Gursher Singh earned approximately Rs 26 lakh over three years, but investigations revealed that he spent around Rs 2.59 crore in the same period — an amount nearly 10 times his official income.The case was registered by the flying squad of Mohali, and multiple raids are underway to apprehend him. However, sources in vigilance bureau suspect that Gursher has fled abroad.This new case adds another layer to legal troubles of the former police officer, who was dismissed from service in Oct 2024 after being booked for fraud, forgery, and corruption. His pre-arrest bail plea was rejected in January this year by a local court, after which he went untraceable.Gursher, known as an ""encounter specialist"" during his tenure with Mohali Police, is facing serious allegations of extortion, land fraud, and abuse of official position.He is accused of buying disputed land parcels at throwaway prices and selling them at inflated rates, as well as filing false complaints through proxies to extort money from victims.One such victim approached the Punjab and Haryana high court, which subsequently ordered the registration of an FIR against him. The case includes charges under Sections 419, 465, 467, 468, and 471 of the IPC, along with provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.Gursher is alleged to have played a key role in facilitating televised interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi at the CIA staff office in Kharar. At the time, Gursher was serving as DSP (investigation), Mohali, and was frequently stationed at CIA office in Kharar.The interview caused a political and public uproar, prompting intervention from the high court, which led to his dismissal from service and suspension of seven other police officials. The vigilance bureau has intensified its manhunt for Gursher and is expected to widen its probe into his financial transactions, real estate dealings, and possible overseas links.","DSP Gursher Singh Sandhu and his mother Sukhwant Kaur are accused of possessing assets disproportionate to known sources of income.

HYDERABAD: Death toll in the explosion at Sigachi Industries' multi-storey pharma plant in Telangana's Pashamylaram climbed to 36 by Tuesday evening as rescue teams pulled burnt bodies from the collapsed structure. DNA profiling is underway to identify the severely burnt victims, with 15 still unaccounted for.Police charged Sigachi's management for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, grievous hurt, and attempted murder under BNS, acting on a complaint by Rajanala Sai Yashwanth, son of a deceased worker. His father, a long-time employee, and other workers had repeatedly warned management about ageing machinery, Yashwanth said. ""This was not an accident - it was waiting to happen.""The Rs 500-crore facility operated without a fire department NOC. Fire officials said the plant lacked basic safety systems - no fire alarms, heat sensors, automatic shutdowns. There were no blast-resistant walls or roofs in processing zones that handled microcrystalline cellulose - an inflammable material prone to static electricity. No third-party safety audits were conducted in recent years.A criminal probe is underway, and arrests are likely after forensic and official reports are submitted.

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday told the US that it reserves the right to respond and defend itself against terrorism as well as pre-empt and deter any further cross-border attacks from Pakistan, days after President Donald Trump effusively praised Pakistan army chief Asim Munir while hosting him at the White House.In a 20-minute telephonic conversation with US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth, defence minister Rajnath Singh also made it clear that India's actions were ""measured, non-escalatory, proportionate and focused"" on disabling terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and POK when it launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, sources told TOI. While India believes Pakistan has become a safe haven for terrorists as internationally banned terrorists enjoy immunity there, Trump had praised both Munir as well as PM Modi as ""two very smart people"" for ending May 7-10 hostilities.Also read: Rajnath Singh speaks to US defence secretary Pete Hegseth; reviews defence ties, thanks US for anti-terror support Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir has continued with his rant against India, reaffirming Pakistan's commitment to providing support to the Kashmiri people for their ""legitimate struggle"".Singh, on his part, told Hegseth that India appreciates the unwavering support extended by the US for its fight against terrorism.""On defence cooperation, the two agreed to further build upon the momentum of this critical and mutually beneficial partnership across all its pillars such as interoperability, integration of defence industrial supply chains, logistics sharing, increased joint military exercises and cooperation with other like-minded partners,"" an official said.Also read: Quad meeting: Pahalgam terror attack was economic warfare, says Jaishankar; rules out yielding to nuclear blackmail Singh asked Hegseth to ensure faster deliveries of the long-delayed General Electric GE-F404 engines for the indigenous Tejas-Mark 1A fighters as well as the early conclusion of the agreement to jointly produce the more powerful GE-F414 engines in India.The defence minister also pushed for the delivery of the six Apache heavy-duty attack helicopters that the Indian Army had ordered in a Rs 5,691 crore deal in Feb 2020 but is yet to get.""The six Apaches will now be delivered before this year ends,"" another official said. The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-F404 engines by US firm General Electric, which Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) had ordered for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, is one of the main reasons for not even the first Tejas Mark-1A fighter to be delivered to the IAF yet. After the 83 ""improved"" Tejas Mark-1A jets are delivered under the defence ministry's Rs 46,898 crore deal inked with HAL in Feb 2021, another 97 of those jets for Rs 67,000 crore will also be in the pipeline.","Rajnath Singh made it clear that India's actions were ""measured, non-escalatory, proportionate and focused"" on disabling terrorist infrastructure.

Chief minister Siddaramaiah responded, saying that the government has the option to appeal the CAT ruling.The suspension of Vikash and other senior officers by the Karnataka government came under intense scrutiny after reports suggested that RCB and event organisers bypassed standard protocols. The government had claimed that while RCB CEO had sent an intimation to the Police Commissioner on June 3, no formal approval was granted.The Karnataka government has also issued new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for managing crowds at events and mass gatherings. According to the SOPs released by the Office of the Director General and Inspector General of Police, “Police responses must prioritise life safety, protection of rights, prevention of property damage, and de-escalation of potential conflicts.”The guidelines recognise that “modern gatherings are often spontaneous and influenced by social media, necessitating adaptive strategies.” They stress the importance of “early planning, coordination with stakeholders, and minimal use of force” as essential principles for effective crowd management.The SOPs cover all types of public events, from festivals and rallies to sports celebrations, providing a strategic framework to ensure public safety while maintaining law and order. Pre-event preparation includes “conducting behavioural and spatial analysis” to identify risks and bottlenecks, along with rigorous venue safety audits. Notably, venues that fail to meet safety standards, including capacity limits and evacuation plans, “must not be approved for high-footfall events. ”In wake of the Bengaluru stampede, a criminal case was registered against RCB officials, the KSCA, and DNA Entertainment.

Cardiologists divided

Public urged not to ignore warning signs

NEW DELHI: A wave of sudden cardiac deaths in Karnataka, especially among young people, has jolted the state government into action, with chief minister Siddaramaiah announcing a 10-day deadline for an expert panel to submit its findings. In the past month alone, at least 20 people in Hassan district have reportedly died of heart attacks, many without prior symptoms or pre-existing conditions.Leading the probe is Dr KS Ravindranath, Director of Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, who is working in coordination with the Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences (HIMS) to identify patterns, possible causes, and preventive measures.“Fourteen of the deceased died at home without seeking medical help. Nine were under 30,” said Dr Rajanna B, director of HIMS, confirming that the deaths occurred between May 28 and June 28, 2025.With many cases too old for post-mortems, investigators are depending on local doctors, family testimonies, and patient records. The deaths have sparked concern across the state, with Jayadeva hospitals in Bengaluru and Mysuru reporting a 20% rise in emergency cardiac OPD visits.In a statement on Tuesday, CM Siddaramaiah did not rule out the possibility that Covid-19 vaccines may have contributed to some of the deaths. “We cannot ignore that the hasty approval and distribution of the vaccine could also be a factor, as global studies have hinted at links to cardiac issues,” he said. He added that the same expert committee had been asked in February to study post-vaccination effects and young adult deaths statewide.“Before BJP criticizes us, they should ask their conscience,” Siddaramaiah remarked, accusing opposition leaders of politicizing a public health concern.The medical fraternity appears split on the issue. While the Mysuru chapter of the Cardiological Society of India (CSI) has launched a separate two-year study into rising cardiac cases among youth, led by Dr Shashirekha and Dr Veena Nanjappa, senior cardiologist and MP Dr CN Manjunath downplayed the trend as new.“This is not a sudden phenomenon,” said Dr Manjunath, who cited a 2013–2018 study of 5,000 heart attack patients aged 20–45. “We found 50% were smokers, and nearly 20% had diabetes or high BP. But worryingly, 25% had no conventional risk factors. We need to examine food safety and pesticide exposure too.”While the debate continues, the government is urging citizens not to delay seeking help. “Anyone with chest pain or breathing issues must go to the nearest health centre immediately,” said Siddaramaiah. He cited state-run health programs like Hridaya Jyothi and Gruha Arogya as part of efforts to monitor and respond to rising cardiac risk.The expert committee’s report is expected by July 10.","A wave of sudden cardiac deaths in Karnataka has jolted the state government into action.

Space Station

For Isro, benefits and learnings from the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission to the International Space Station (ISS) will far outweigh the cost it has had to incur in sending Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux).The Rs 548 crore spent on the mission is a fraction of what India would have otherwise needed to spend on replicating the same training, exposure and systems-level experience, Isro chairman V Narayanan told TOI, in his first exclusive interview about the multinational commercial mission.Speaking from Houston, Narayanan said that the learning outcomes — spanning astronaut training (for two astronauts), mission operations, and hardware-software-human interface — cannot be measured purely in monetary terms.“For a country of 140 crore people, what we’ve spent is only marginal,,” Narayanan said. For that, he said: “We’ve gained access to infrastructure and experience that would otherwise require thousands of crores.” If one looks at the per capita cost on the Indian population, it adds up to around Rs 4 per head.Narayanan, dismissing observations that Ax-4 is “just a commercial mission”, said discussions on such strategic missions must be rooted in long-term capability building rather than short-term financial arithmetic.“For a programme like Gaganyaan , which spans Rs 20,000 crore including follow-on missions, these early investments are necessary. Training, confidence, exposure, systems understanding — these are foundational,” he said.He added that maturity in public discourse is essential. “People must recognise that not all benefits can be quantified. But they can certainly be measured in preparedness and capability,” he said.Narayanan identified five key areas where Ax-4 will directly strengthen India’s human spaceflight capabilities: Training exposure, confidence building, operational experience, systems-and-process understanding, and cross-disciplinary learning.“Our astronauts trained in world-class facilities simulating space conditions, including microgravity and life-support systems. Each hour of training they’ve undergone would cost crores if we were to replicate the infrastructure ourselves,” he said.He added that interacting with seasoned astronauts — including those who have flown to space multiple times or performed several spacewalks — helped boost the confidence of Indian crew members and mission teams.Astronauts — Shux and his backup Group Captain Prashant Nair — learnt how to function in space as a team, handle real-time challenges, and carry out experiments. He said working on and observing the mission to ISS has given India insights into module design, layout, onboard systems, and processes that will feed into future Gaganyaan and space station designs.“We will, of course, have our own design and technology, but all this experience will help us develop those better,” he said.Narayanan, who is leading efforts to ensure astronaut safety, said he has himself gained from observing operations in Houston. “From data handling to high-level system safety discussions, our understanding of the end-to-end process has grown. This cannot be acquired by simulation or literature review alone,” he said.He added that the experience is equally valuable for backroom mission teams and decision-makers, who will now have real-world references to draw upon while preparing for Gaganyaan. TOI had reported last week about some specifics the Isro team is learning back in Houston, where mission control for Ax-4 is.India plans to build its own space station after the Gaganyaan crewed flights. Narayanan said direct exposure to the ISS environment will inform the design, configuration, and operational planning of the proposed Indian facility.“We had only studied the ISS on paper. Now we are seeing it in action. We may not adopt the same model, but this will help us make informed design choices,” he said.","Isro chairman V Narayanan tells TOI about the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission to the International Space Station.

SC takes 30 years to implement its own judgment on SC/ST quota,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-takes-30-years-to-implement-its-own-judgment-on-sc/st-quota/articleshow/122193918.cms,"NEW DELHI: More than 30 years after it mandated a 200-point-roster system for earmarking posts for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates in direct recruitments, the Supreme Court has now identified staff posts reserved for SC and ST candidates but provided no quota for OBC candidates.The judgment in R K Sabharwal case was delivered by a five-judge bench on Feb 10, 1995, during the tenure of 26th CJI A M Ahmadi, but it will be implemented now during the tenure of 52nd CJI in Justice B R Gavai, the second Dalit to head judiciary after Justice K G Balakrishnan.CJI Gavai told TOI, “The judgement in Sabharwal case recommended implementation of 200-point roster system for identification of posts for the SC and ST candidates in each category of posts. The identification process is completed and from now onwards vacancies against each reserved post would be filled from the candidates belonging to that category of backward class candidates.”Asked about non-inclusion of OBC quota in direct recruitments, the CJI said, ""I have asked the SC Registry to initiate steps for amendment of the relevant Rules for inclusion of reservation for OBC candidates."" After the Indra Sawhney judgment of 1992, a 27% quota in government jobs was introduced for candidates belonging to OBC communities, but the SC had capped the cumulative reservations at 50% of vacancies.For the 200-point roster system, the SC has enumerated 1280 posts, majority of which comprise junior court attendants (600 posts) and junior court assistants (437). Of the total 1,280 posts, 191 has been earmarked for SC candidates and 93 for STs while the rest 996 posts would be for general category.Since the judgment is of Feb 1995, and the central government circular is of July 1997, it is but natural that there would have been a huge backlog in filling the posts as per the roster system that intends to effectuate 15% and 7.5% quota for SCs and STs respectively.CJI Gavai said, “The backlogs will be gradually filled. This would mean sometimes the reservations in direct recruitments would cross the cumulative 22.5% mark.”In the Sabharwal judgment, a five-judge SC bench led by Justice Kuldip Singh had said, “The only way to assure equality of opportunity to the Backward Classes and the general category is to permit the roster to operate till the time the respective appointees/ promotees occupy the posts meant for them in the roster... As and when there is a vacancy whether permanent or temporary in a particular post the same must be filled from amongst the category to which the post belonged in the roster. ”“The cadre-strength is always measured by the number of posts comprising the cadre… Once the total cadre has full representation of the SCs/STs and Backward Classes in accordance with the reservation policy then the vacancies arising thereafter in the cadre are to be filled from amongst the category of persons to whom the respective vacancies belong,” it had said.","The Supreme Court has identified staff posts reserved for SC and ST candidates.

Double booster shot for India's blue-water combat capabilities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/navys-blue-water-capabilities-get-a-double-boost/articleshow/122193775.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a double booster shot for the country’s blue-water combat capabilities on Tuesday, the last Indian warship to be constructed abroad was commissioned as INS Tamal in Russia, while an indigenous stealth frigate was delivered to the Navy by Mazagon Docks (MDSL).Both the 3,900-tonne frigate INS Tamal and the 6,670-tonne frigate built by MDSL, which will be commissioned as INS Udaygiri next month, are packed with advanced sensors and weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic precision-strike cruise missiles whose range has been extended to 450-km from the original 290-km.“Both the multi-mission frigates, which have enhanced stealth features to reduce detection by enemy radars, pack a deadly punch augmented by their network-centric warfare capabilities,” a senior officer told TOI.For air defence, Udaygiri is equipped with the Israeli-origin Barak-8 surface-to-air missile system, with an interception range of 70-km against fighters, helicopters, drones and cruise missiles. INS Tamal, in turn, has the Russian Shtil vertical launched anti-aircraft missiles with an enhanced range of over 50-km, among other weapons like rockets, guns and torpedoes.Speaking at the commissioning of INS Tamal at the Yantar shipyard in Kaliningrad, Western Naval Command chief Vice Admiral Sanjay Jasjit Singh said, “I am confident the warship will prove its mettle as a force multiplier in our operational architecture towards safeguarding national maritime interests and promoting maritime security.”Overall, the 140-warship Navy now has another 58 ships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards for over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, while another 31 warships are in the planning stage. This naval expansion is crucial to tackle the maritime collusiveness between Pakistan and China, which is making major strategic inroads into the Indian Ocean Region with the world’s largest naval force of 370 warships.Udaygiri is the second of the seven multi-role frigates being constructed under Project-17A, four at MDSL in Mumbai and three at GRSE in Kolkata, at an overall cost of Rs 45,000 crore. The first was commissioned as INS Nilgiri in Jan, while the other five are to be progressively delivered by end-2026.Interestingly, Udaygiri is the 100ship designed and delivered by the Navy’s inhouse Warship Design Bureau. INS Tamal, in turn, is the 51ship produced under the India-Russia strategic collaboration over the last 65 years.It was in Oct 2018 that India had inked the agreement with Russia for four upgraded Krivak-III class frigates, with the first two INS Tushil (commissioned last Dec) and INS Tamal to be imported for around Rs 8,000 crore.The other two, Triput and Tavasya, in turn, are being built at the Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore. These four new warships will add to the six such Russian frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted from 2003-2004 onwards. All these frigates can also carry Kamov-31 early-warning and Kamov-28 multirole helicopters.",The last Indian warship to be constructed abroad was commissioned as INS Tamal in Russia.

"9 of 10 workers stuck in low-competency jobs, suggests report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/9-of-10-workers-stuck-in-low-competency-jobs-suggests-report/articleshow/122193400.cms,"NEW DELHI: Over 50% of India's graduates are employed in roles meant for lower skill levels, underscoring a deep mismatch between education and job opportunities. And what's of even greater concern, despite greater access to higher education, a staggering 88% of India's workforce remains engaged in low-competency occupations, a report by Institute for Competitiveness, India's affiliate of Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School, has said.The crisis is compounded by regional disparities - states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh lag on high-skill job shares, while UTs and states, such as Chandigarh, Puducherry, Goa, and Kerala lead in better utilisation of skilled professionals.The report, ""Skills for the Future: Transforming India's Workforce Landscape"", used Periodic Labour Force Survey data from 2017-18 to 2023-24. It found only 8.25% of graduates (Educational Skill Level 3) are in roles matching their qualifications, while more than half work lower-skill jobs. As much as 88% of the workforce is engaged in low-skill (Skill Level 1 and 2) jobs, such as street vending, domestic work, and manual operations, even as enrolment in education and vocational training has risen.The ""Mismatch Table"" in the report, released by Jayant Chaudhary, minister of skill development and entrepreneurship, revealed that over 50% of graduates are employed in roles like clerks, machine operators, and sales workers (Skill Level 2).While 38.23% of graduates are in Skill Level 4 jobs, 28.12% of postgraduates are in mid-skill occupations, pointing to underutilised talent. It also noted many underqualified cases - workers lacking formal education for higher-skill jobs - were likely compensated by informal training or Technical and Vocational Education and Training .These patterns expose structural inefficiencies in labour market. And they are reflected in wage trends. Skill Level 1 workers earn minimum wages. Those at Skill Level 2 have seen 5-6% annual wage growth, while Skill Level 3 and 4 professionals saw 8-12% growth, reinforcing the need to move more workers into high-competency roles. Delhi, Puducherry, and Goa have seen modest increases in mid- and high-skill job shares.The report also highlights some positive trends. Delhi, Puducherry, and Goa have seen modest increases in mid- and high-skill job shares. Primary education enrollment is near-universal. The Gross Enrolment Ratio for higher secondary is 57.56%, and the secondary-to-higher secondary transition rate was 78.41% in 2021–22. TVET has enabled some underqualified individuals to enter higher-skill roles through practical learning and informal upskilling.To address the mismatch, the report proposes a multi-pronged policy framework: institutionalising a disaggregated Skill Gap Analysis Survey, creating a central Skill Data Repository, and updating the National Classification of Occupations (NCO). It also recommends aligning training programmes with industrial clusters, integrating TVET with general education, and incentivising firms to prioritise PMKVY-certified workers. These steps are seen as key to building a workforce fit for a digital, green, globally competitive economy and realising India’s vision by 2047.","Despite greater access to higher education, a staggering 88% of India's workforce remains engaged in low-competency occupations. The crisis is compounded by regional disparities - states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh lag on high-skill job shares, while UTs and states, such as Chandigarh, Puducherry, Goa, and Kerala lead in better utilisation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122193451,imgsize-2054410,width-400,resizemode-4/122193451.jpg"
"Insurance scam: Officials from 50 firms, finance ministry meet in Sambhal to plug gaps leading to frauds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/insuring-dying-dead-50-firms-finmin-meet-with-senior-cops/articleshow/122193252.cms,"Insurance scam: Officials from 50 firms, finance ministry meet in Sambhal to plug gaps leading to frauds

MEERUT: Six months after a multi-crore insurance scam surfaced in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal district, senior officials from the Union finance ministry, insurance regulatory bodies, over 50 insurance companies, and investigative agencies met in Sambhal to plug critical policy gaps and improve coordination. At the conclave hosted by the UP Police, officials proposed systemic reforms to combat insurance fraud, including changes to Section 45, enhanced data sharing, and stricter scrutiny of investigation processes.The scam, first reported by TOI, involved policies being taken out in the names of terminally ill or deceased individuals across more than 12 states. ""The findings uncovered during the probe prompted the need for a national-level dialogue on fraud prevention. The idea came from the case details we encountered over the past six months,” said Anukriti Sharma, additional SP of Sambhal and lead investigator.The investigation revealed that the network did not stop at forgery. In some cases, operatives allegedly resorted to murder to access insurance payouts. Four such deaths, initially reported as accidents, were later linked directly to the scam. In one case, a paralysed man was killed in Sambhal for a policy worth Rs 95 lakh.In another, a man was murdered in Amroha to claim Rs 2.7 crore. These killings highlighted the organised nature of the racket and its readiness to escalate from document fraud to homicide.Sambhal SP Krishna Bishnoi said the conclave concluded with a range of key suggestions. “We discussed better coordination among insurers, the need to relook Section 45, investor protection, standardisation of investigation procedures, and stronger communication between police and insurance firms,” he told TOI. He added that participants also suggested introducing new legislation tailored to insurance fraud, setting standards for investigation companies, and building structured channels for information-sharing between stakeholders.The scale of the fraud brought Section 45 of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015, into sharp focus. The clause bars insurers from questioning a policy on any ground—including misstatement or fraud—after three years from the date of issuance, revival or commencement, whichever is earlier. Officials said this clause has often been misused to push fraudulent claims.At the conclave, Meena Kumari, Executive Director of IRDAI, pointed out that insurers need to maintain up-to-date policies and procedures at both the underwriting stage and the claims stage, with an appropriate feedback loop. Many companies appear to be missing early signs of fraud because the systems don’t talk to each other,” she said. “Preventing fraud is essential, but equal attention must be paid to ensuring no genuine claim is denied. ” She called for smarter use of data and faster detection tools that don’t delay payouts to honest claimants.Mandakini Balodhi, director (insurance), the finance ministry, said the bigger challenge was the restoration of public trust. “Insurance is a tool of financial inclusion, and social security schemes allow us to serve the most vulnerable. Fraud and abuse in the insurance ecosystem hit these highly vulnerable segments and need to be arrested by concerted efforts of all present in the ecosystem, insurance and outside. ” She added that repeated frauds risk damaging faith in welfare programmes designed for the most vulnerable.Venkat Changavalli, who leads the Insurance Information Bureau, said fraudsters were exploiting the gaps between companies. “We see the same scam patterns being missed because insurers aren’t sharing data fast enough,” he said. “We’re working on systems to flag suspicious claims in real time, but that only works if insurers respond quickly and consistently.”TOI’s investigation revealed that the scam, estimated to be worth over Rs 500 crore, extended into government-backed schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Mukhyamantri Sadak Durghatna Bima Yojana. Operatives used fake death certificates, tampered Aadhaar data, and backdated policies to make fraudulent claims. The investigation exposed links between insurance agents, hospital staff, bank officials, ASHA workers, civic employees, and elected representatives.In Jan, UP Police intercepted an SUV in Sambhal carrying cash, forged PAN cards, Aadhaar details, and fake documents. That bust triggered a wider investigation and culminated in a May case by the Enforcement Directorate under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Police later filed an 800-page chargesheet naming operatives from UP, Bihar, and Jharkhand. Police have so far registered 17 FIRs in Sambhal, Moradabad, Badaun and Amroha, arrested 52 people, and recorded three surrenders.","Officials from 50 firms, finance ministry meet in Sambhal to plug gaps leading to frauds.

The Road Ahead

Ten years ago, we embarked on a bold journey into uncharted territory with great conviction. While decades were spent doubting the ability of Indians to use technology, we changed this approach and trusted the ability of Indians to use technology.While decades were spent thinking that use of technology will deepen the gap between the haves and the have-nots, we changed this mindset and used technology to eliminate the gap between the haves and the have-nots.When the intent is right, innovation empowers the less empowered. When the approach is inclusive, technology brings change in the lives of those on the margins. This belief laid the foundation for Digital India : a mission to democratise access, build inclusive digital infrastructure, and opportunities for all.In 2014, internet penetration was limited, digital literacy was low, and online access to govt services was scarce. Many doubted whether a country as vast and diverse as India could truly go digital. Today, that question has been answered not just in data and dashboards, but in the lives of 140 crore Indians. From how we govern, to how we learn, transact and build, Digital India is everywhere.In 2014, India had around 25 crore internet connections.Today, that number has grown to over 97 crore. Over 42 lakh km of optical fibre cable equivalent to 11 times the distance between Earth and the Moon now connects even the most remote villages.India's 5G rollout is among the fastest in the world, with 4.8 lakh base stations installed in just two years. High-speed internet now reaches urban hubs and forward military posts alike including Galwan, Siachen and Ladakh.India Stack, which is our digital backbone, has enabled platforms like UPI, which now handles 100+ billion transactions a year. Around half of all real-time digital transactions happen in India.Through Direct Benefit Transfer, over Rs 44 lakh crore has been transferred directly to citizens, cutting out middlemen and saving Rs 3.5 lakh crore in leakages. Schemes like Svamitva have issued 2.4 crore+ property cards and mapped 6.4 lakh villages, ending years of land-related uncertainty.India's digital economy is empowering MSMEs and small entrepreneurs like never before. ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) is a revolutionary platform which opens a new window of opportunity by providing a seamless connection between huge market of buyers and sellers.GeM (Govt E-Marketplace) enables the common man to sell goods and services to all arms of govt. This not only empowers the common man with a huge market but also saves money for the govt.ONDC recently crossed 200 million transactions, with the last 100 million in just six months. From Banarasi weavers to bamboo artisans in Nagaland, sellers are now reaching customers nationwide, without middlemen or digital monopolies.GeM has also crossed Rs 1 lakh crore GMV in 50 days, with 22 lakh sellers including 1.8 lakh+ women-led MSMEs, who have fulfilled orders worth Rs 46,000 crore.India's Digital Public Infrastructure - from Aadhaar , CoWIN, DigiLocker and FASTag to PM-WANI and One Nation One Subscription - is now studied and adopted globally.CoWIN enabled the world's largest vaccination drive, issuing 220 crore QR-verifiable certificates. DigiLocker, with 54 crore users, hosts 775 crore+ documents, securely and seamlessly.Through our G20 presidency, India launched the Global DPI Repository and a $25 million Social Impact Fund, helping nations across Africa and South Asia adopt inclusive digital ecosystems.India now ranks among the top three startup ecosystems in the world, with over 1.8 lakh startups. But this is more than a startup movement, it is a tech renaissance.India is doing extremely well when it comes to AI skill penetration and AI talent concentration among our youth. Through the $1.2 billion India AI Mission, India has enabled access to 34,000 GPUs at globally unmatched prices at less than $1/GPU hour making India not just the most affordable internet economy, but also the most affordable compute destination.India has championed humanity-first AI. The New Delhi Declaration on AI promotes innovation with responsibility. We are establishing AI Centres of Excellence across the country.The next decade will be even more transformative. We are moving from digital governance to global digital leadership, from India-first to India-for-the-world.Digital India has not remained a mere govt programne, it has become a people's movement. It is central to building an Aatmanirbhar Bharat, and to making India a trusted innovation partner to the world. To all innovators, entrepreneurs, and dreamers: the world is looking at India for the next digital breakthrough.Let us build what empowers. Let us solve what truly matters.

NEW DELHI: The Cabinet Tuesday approved the Rs 1-lakh crore Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) scheme, aimed at generating more than 3.5 crore jobs in the organised sector.Announced in July 2024, the scheme is meant to counter criticism over inadequate jobs being created in the economy at a time when there is a rising number of job seekers in the market. The decision comes ahead of assembly elections in Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the scheme was finalised after detailed deliberation with industry leaders and other stakeholders.The scheme has two elements, one targeted at first-time employees who earn up to Rs 1 lakh a month and are members of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation. The Centre will pay up to Rs 15,000 each to around 1.9 crore employees. Govt hopes these jobs will be created by Aug 2027.The Rs 15,000 payment to first-time employees will be split into two instalments, with the second payment to be made after 12 months directly into their bank accounts.The second part is targeted at encouraging manufacturing companies to hire more. Govt will offer up to Rs 3,000 a month for two years for each additional employee who stays on for six months or more. For the manufacturing sector, the incentives will be extended to the third and fourth year as well.""Establishments which are registered with the EPFO will be required to hire at least two additional employees (for employers with less than 50 employees) or five additional employees (for employers with 50 or more employees) on a sustained basis for at least six months,"" an official statement said.The scheme may benefit several of the new entrants coming up with new facilities, especially in electronics, semiconductors and the automobiles space.""ELI is a significant step towards boosting employment and formalising India's workforce.

Is Vince McMahon the most controversial boss? Shocking cases that have been filed against WWE's former CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/is-vince-mcmahon-the-most-controversial-boss-shocking-cases-that-have-been-filed-against-wwes-former-ceo/articleshow/122189764.cms,"(Image via Getty Images: Vince McMahon)

The Steroid scandal

The Sable lawsuit





The Rita Marie lawsuit

The two Tanning spa incidents





The hush-money scandal

The Janel Grant lawsuit

Once the biggest name in the world of WWE, Vince McMahon has been a controversy magnet for most of his lifetime. Not just the latest row with former employee Janet Grant, McMahon has been named in numerous other lawsuits over the years. From ex-WWE wrestler Sable filing a s*xual misconduct case against him to the multiple hush money instances that were made public in 2022, he is not lacking for legal troubles. Which is probably why many believe he is one of, if not the most controversial, bosses that are in the public eye.Back in 1994, when the WWE was still known as WWF, Vince McMahon was indicted in federal court because of a steroid controversy, which said he supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the wrestlers in his company. This led to the transfer of control of the WWF to his now ex-wife, Linda McMahon. But McMahon was acquitted of all charges by the jury due to a lack of evidentiary support.One of the earliest instances of a lawsuit being filed against Vince McMahon was when Sable , one of the biggest stars who once graced the WWE ring, filed a s*xual misconduct lawsuit against her boss. It was a $110 million lawsuit that was filed against both McMahon and the company, WWE, for s*xual misconduct and unsafe working environment.But things didn't stir much, as the suit was settled out of court, and Sable returned to work once more under the WWE banner.Yet another s*xual lawsuit was filed against McMahon when a former WWF referee, Rita Chatterton aka Rita Marie, accused him of forcing her to perform oral s*x on him; and when she refused to comply, he r*ped her. This matter was also settled out of court, as the former WWE bossman said he wanted to settle to ""avoid the cost of litigation.""In two separate instances - 2006 and 2011, Vince McMahon was accused by two separate individuals from two separate tanning salons of s*xual misconduct. The first incident was from Miami, and the second from California, but no charges were filed after the investigation.Vince McMahon was accused of paying hush money to a former WWE employee after being in a consensual relationship with them for three years back in 2022. But the case fizzled out and McMahon stated that the discrepancy in finance was due to accounting errors.Back in January of 2024, a lawsuit was filed by former WWE employee Janel Grant , where she accused her former boss, Vince McMahon, and the former WWE EVP John Laurinaitis, of s*xual misconduct and s*x trafficking charges. She said that she was used by McMahon as a barter to make people compliant with him on various occasions.Also Read: WWE founder Vince McMahon has objected to Janel Grant obtaining new evidence in the Vince McMahon s*x trafficking scandal case This eventually led to McMahon having to quit WWE’s parent company, TKO, and leaving behind something that was built by him for the better part of his career.

Taylor Swift granted restraining order extension as stalker threatens her safety

Taylor Swift’s ongoing battle with a dangerous stalker has taken a disturbing turn—and this time, NFL star Travis Kelce is caught in the crosshairs. A Los Angeles judge has extended a restraining order against 45-year-old Brian Jason Wagner, a Colorado man accused of repeatedly harassing the pop icon and making false claims involving both her and Kelce.According to court filings, Wagner showed up uninvited at Swift’s Los Angeles home multiple times over the past year and allegedly attempted to change his DMV records to list her address as his own. He also sent hundreds of unhinged emails to Swift’s team, filled with delusions that she was in a romantic relationship with him and the mother of his son.“Mr. Wagner made various statements about living at my property (not true), being in a relationship with me (not true), believing I am the mother of his son (not true), and needing to see me in person, all of which are untrue and disconnected from reality,” Swift stated in her sworn declaration.While the pop star has unfortunately dealt with stalkers in the past, this case strikes a deeper nerve due to Wagner’s references to Swift’s relationship with Kelce. In July 2024, another man was detained in Germany after allegedly threatening both Swift and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end during her European tour. The pattern of obsession and escalating threats has now forced Swift and Kelce’s security teams to remain on high alert.“I have no relationship with Mr. Wagner and I have never met nor communicated with him,” Swift emphasized, revealing the emotional toll that this ordeal has taken on both her personal life and her safety.This isn’t the first time Kelce has been indirectly dragged into the darker side of Swift’s fame. With the couple constantly in the public eye, privacy has become a luxury—and safety a growing concern.

BENGALURU: With Maharashtra walking back on its decision to introduce Hindi as a third language for class 1 students, Karnataka is witnessing renewed calls to shift away from the three-language formula. On Monday, chief minister Siddaramaiah said his govt is committed to a two-language policy in primary education in state schools.Pressure from various quarters has been building up for the removal of third-language requirement, with many groups calling it ""linguistic imposition"". The demand has reignited debate on the need to reduce academic load and focus on language proficiency, not just exposure.Karnataka is among the few states that implemented the three-language formula recommended by the Dr Kothari Commission in 1968 and reinforced by the National Curriculum Framework.Under the Kannada Language Learning Act, 2015, Kannada must be taught as either first or second language. If Kannada is chosen first, English becomes second language from class 1. A third language — selected from among nine options, including Hindi, Sanskrit and English — is introduced from class 6.Contrary to popular belief, Hindi isn't compulsory. Students can opt for other languages, though most govt schools do offer Hindi as the default third language.On X, the Karnataka unit of Congress said India's strength lies in its mosaic of cultures and languages, and inclusive language policies should offer local identities and Hindi as an option, not a mandate. The Bengaluru-based NGO Namma Naadu, Namma Alvike has launched an online petition, urging the govt to drop the existing policy. The petition, which has garnered 40,000 signatures, argues that the three-language system adds unnecessary stress on students and undermines regional priorities.Meanwhile, the department of school education and literacy clarified there is no proposal under consideration to move to a two-language policy. The existing structure, it said, remains in place.C urriculum guidelines prescribe that in Class 10, second-language proficiency must match that of the first language in class 8, and third-language proficiency should align with first-language standards of class 6.In the recent SSLC exam-1, over 7.2 lakh regular freshers appeared for the third-language Hindi paper. Over 5.7 lakh passed, registering an 80.3% success rate. Across all third languages, the pass rate was 80%, with over 1.4 lakh students failing.Many experts argue this reflects unnecessary academic stress. ""Three languages are a burden and affect cognitive development. We need proficiency, not mere exposure. Outside school, kids can always pick up more languages informally,"" said educationist Niranjanaradhya VP.AS Seetharamu, former faculty member, Institute for Social & Economic Change, agreed partially. ""A third language can be mandatory, but needn't be tested in SSLC. It should be assessed internally from classes 6 to 9. Raising the pass mark to 40 could ensure seriousness without overburdening students.""A govt school teacher added: ""CBSE tests just two languages. Why should our students be pushed harder? And after all that effort, many can't speak Hindi fluently.""Some experts caution against switching to a two-language policy, citing Karnataka's linguistic diversity. ""Unlike Tamil Nadu, where Tamil dominates, Karnataka has Kannada, Tulu, Konkani, and Urdu. A two-language policy risks sidelining mother tongues,"" one expert noted.",Chief minister Siddaramaiah said his govt is committed to a two-language policy in primary education in state schools.

KOLKATA: The Calcutta HC on Tuesday increased the interim maintenance amount to be provided by cricketer Mohammed Shami to his estranged wife Hasin Jahan and their daughter from Rs 50,000 and Rs 80,000 to Rs 1,50,000 and Rs 2,50,000 per month, respectively.Justice Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee reiterated that it was a settled law that even if the wife is earning, it is not sufficient to rule out the application for monetary relief.""Therefore, while it is true that the question of awarding an excessive amount of monetary relief does not arise, awarding a very low amount also cannot be accepted,"" the judge held.Hasin Jahan had asked for Rs 7 lakh per month for herself and Rs 3 lakh for her daughter.Her counsel, Imtiaz Ahmed, submitted that Shami's total income is around Rs 7,19,54,010. They challenged the lower court's mechanical granting of interim relief of Rs 50,000 and Rs 80,000. Ahmed stated Hasin Jahan's income to be Rs 16,000, whereas her monthly expenditure is around Rs 6,12,905.However, Shami's counsel, Sandipan Ganguly, submitted that the petitioner had falsely depicted herself to be a destitute person.""I have lost almost everything while fighting for my rights in the last seven years. I couldn't admit my daughter to a better school. I am thankful to the court,"" Jahan told TOI.","The Calcutta HC on Tuesday increased the interim maintenance amount to be provided by cricketer Mohammed Shami to his estranged wife Hasin Jahan and their daughter.

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.More countries are adopting digital verification systems, and e-passports are expected to further streamline international travel. Travelers will benefit from smoother immigration checks and faster processing through automated e-gates at major airports. With the government's phased rollout underway, carrying a smarter and more secure passport is set to become the new norm for Indian citizens.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S.

Squalid life and India escape





Cindy Rodriguez Singh, wanted for the 2022 murder of her 6-year-old son, Noel Rodriguez Alvarez, has been added to the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, federal officials announced Tuesday.The FBI has increased the reward for information leading to her arrest from $25,000 to $250,000.Joe Rothrock, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Dallas Field Office, said investigators remain committed to finding her. “The message to Cindy is we aren't going to stop [looking],” he said, according to CBS News.Authorities believe Rodriguez Singh fled the US and is currently in India with her husband, Arshdeep Singh , and six of her children. US agents are working with international partners to locate and extradite her.Just days after Noel was officially reported missing, Rodriguez Singh, her husband, and their other children boarded a one-way flight to India on March 22, 2023. Noel was not on that flight and has not been seen since.Rodriguez Singh was indicted by a Tarrant County grand jury in October 2023 on charges of capital murder and other offenses connected to Noel’s disappearance.Though Noel was last seen in November 2022, he wasn’t reported missing until March 2023.Tarrant County district attorney Phil Sorrels said, as reported by CBS News “Let me be clear, fleeing the country does not absolve you of guilt. It reinforces it,” he said.Authorities say Arshdeep Singh, Noel’s stepfather, is of Indian origin and also lived in the same structure. During the investigation, officials uncovered a series of false claims made by Rodriguez Singh about Noel’s whereabouts, including that he was in Mexico with relatives or had been sold to a stranger in a parking lot of a Fiesta grocery store.Noel was one of ten children born to Rodriguez Singh. While three siblings lived with grandparents, the rest, including Noel, lived in squalid conditions with their mother and stepfather in a filthy shed in Everman, a suburb of Fort Worth.Based on the inconsistencies, lack of credible evidence, and witness statements, investigators concluded that Noel was likely deceased.Everman city manager Craig Spencer, formerly the city’s police chief, has described Rodriguez Singh as having an “extensive criminal history.” She had previously been investigated by child protective services.Born in Dallas in 1985, Rodriguez Singh is now the first mother accused of killing her own child to be placed on the FBI’s ten most wanted list, which has included more than 500 of the most dangerous fugitives in US history.","Cindy Rodriguez Singh is wanted for the 2022 murder of her 6-year-old son, Noel Rodriguez Alvarez.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

KOLKATA: International passenger footfall at Kolkata airport has bounced back after a sudden four-day slump in June caused by the closure of airspace over Middle East after Iran launched a missile strike on US air bases in Qatar and Iraq on June 23. Qatar, UAE, Bahrain and Kuwait had scrambled to close their airspace that left all West-bound flights from hubs in the Gulf stranded.According to airport officials, Kolkata’s international flyer count dipped sharply between June 23 and June 26. However, as ceasefire talks between Iran and Israel brought back some stability to the region and airspace restrictions were lifted, flight schedules returned to normal, taking the footfall back to the daily average of around 6,500.“All onward flights from the region — including those of Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad — were disrupted due to the airspace closure. These carriers handle the bulk of West-bound traffic from Kolkata,” said Kolkata airport director Pravat Ranjan Beuria. “Now that flight movement has resumed, we are seeing the numbers return to their usual levels.”While the availability of flights was a major concern, many travellers also cancelled bookings owing to the conflict.According to travel industry sources, about 30% of flyers booked for early last week cancelled their trips.Data shared by airport sources show that as many as 6,664 international passengers travelled via Kolkata on June 21 aboard 43 flights, and 6,705 passengers on 45 flights on June 22. On June 23, however, numbers dropped to 5,254, with only 39 flights plying. The next day, the count slid further to 4,655 on 35 flights. This slide continued till June 26.Once the crisis passed and a ceasefire was announced, flight operations picked up pace. By June 28, passenger volume was 6,496 over 42 flights. On June 29, it climbed to 6,503 across 45 international flights, close to the regular average.For Kolkata, which has no direct flights to the US or Europe, the halt in transit services through Middle-East hubs proved critical. According to chairman of Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), eastern region, Anjani Dhanuka, about 500 passengers travel daily from Kolkata to Europe and the US via hubs like Doha, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. “When the airspace was closed, those journeys were either cancelled or indefinitely postponed. Now that the flights are back on schedule, we are not seeing any fresh cancellations.”“The initial wave of cancellations was a knee-jerk reaction to the geopolitical flare-up,” said Anil Punjabi, national executive committee member of the Travel Agents Federation of India. “But people still see air travel as the most reliable mode, especially for long-haul business and education travel. Businessmen who postponed trips to the US and Europe have now rescheduled their plans and are back in the air. ”","Kolkata's international flyer count dipped sharply between June 23 and June 26.

"Kharif sowing rises over 11%, monsoon gains pace; bodes well for food inflation: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/kharif-sowing-rises-over-11-monsoon-gains-pace-bodes-well-for-food-inflation-report/articleshow/122195321.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

Kharif sowing is off to a robust start this year, registering an 11.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY) increase as of June-end, driven by a sharp jump in rice and pulses acreage, according to a recent report by ICICI Bank.The surge in sowing is expected to support a favourable food inflation outlook for the remainder of the year.As per news agency ANI, the report highlighted that rice sowing is up by an impressive 47.3 per cent YoY, while pulses have seen a 37.2 per cent increase compared to the same period last year. “Kharif sowing is off to a good start (+11.3 per cent YoY) led by rice (47.3 per cent YoY) and pulses (37.2 per cent YoY), which bodes well for the food inflation outlook this year,” the bank stated.The improvement in sowing has been supported by a pick-up in the southwest monsoon, which gained momentum in the latter half of June. According to ICICI Bank, June rainfall stood at 109 per cent of the Long Period Average (LPA), slightly above the IMD’s forecast of 108 per cent. This compares to 108 per cent of LPA rainfall during June last year.A regional analysis shows that key agricultural states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and West Bengal received above-normal rainfall.However, some states like Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Chhattisgarh witnessed deficient rainfall.As per ANI, Northwest India saw the highest surplus at 42 per cent above LPA on a zonal basis, followed by Central India at 25 per cent. In contrast, South India recorded rainfall 3 per cent below LPA, and East and Northeast India were 17 per cent below.The distribution of rainfall has also improved significantly this year. As of June 30, only 10 out of 36 meteorological subdivisions recorded deficient rainfall, compared to 16 subdivisions at the same point last year.Rainfall is expected to remain favourable in July, with the IMD forecasting precipitation at 106 per cent of LPA, which is likely to further support Kharif sowing.In its separate analysis, Bank of Baroda also noted a broad improvement in acreage, especially for urad and moong within pulses, and oilseeds like soybean and groundnut. However, cotton and jute & mesta sowing have declined by 8.9 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively.Reservoir levels have also seen significant improvement. According to ANI, as of June 26, storage across 161 reservoirs stood at 36 per cent of total capacity, up sharply from 20 per cent during the same period last year. The southern region leads with 45 per cent reservoir capacity filled.Meanwhile, Assam has made a record procurement of paddy this Kharif Marketing Season, collecting nearly 7 lakh metric tonnes, its highest ever. “This remarkable achievement reflects our commitment to ensuring that our farmers are connected to markets and the Minimum Support Price they rightfully deserve,” Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma wrote on X.Additionally, Assam’s Majuli district has made headlines by exporting 267 MT of organic red bao rice to markets in the Middle East and Europe.With healthy rainfall, improved sowing, and rising exports, India’s agricultural outlook for the Kharif season appears optimistic, setting a strong foundation for food supply stability and inflation control in the months ahead.","Rice sowing is up by an impressive 47.3 per cent YoY, while pulses have seen a 37.2 per cent increase compared to the same period last year.

NEW DELHI: Despite Union home ministry’s repeated reminders, Telangana has refused to set up a state disaster mitigation fund (SDMF), the only state yet to do it, which could have helped it to avail central funds for disaster mitigation, including modernising and expansion of its fire services and flood mitigation projects among others.All chief secretaries of states, including Telangana, were issued directive as far back as Jan 2022 to set up SDMF in view of added emphasis on reducing all future disaster deaths, whether caused by natural calamities or man-made disasters.On June 30, in one of the worst industrial disasters in the state, at least 36 people were confirmed dead with several more still missing in an explosion at a company in Pashamylaram.The National Disaster Management Authority has from time to time issued detailed guidelines on chemical disaster management and proactive measures to be adopted by states to avoid such accidents.According to sources, in the past four years the Centre has released ₹20,555 crore mitigation funds to SDMFs of states and UTs for various projects related to reducing disaster risk, both loss of lives and properties.There is still over ₹17,000 crore of the mitigation fund available for states, depending on their utilisation and demand, out of ₹37,827 crore allocated for a five-year period from 2020-21 to 2025-26 as per the recommendation of the 15thFinance Commission.The 15th Finance Commission had recommended allocation of over ₹32,000 crore for SDMF, out of a total of ₹1.6 lakh crore of the state disaster risk management fund, to be used during 2020-21 to 2025-26.Though the Telangana police have filed an FIR in the factory blast on Monday, the incident may also trigger investigation under the Disaster Management Act, to ascertain if adequate mitigation safeguards were taken.","Despite Union home ministry’s repeated reminders, Telangana has refused to set up a state disaster mitigation fund.
