NEW DELHI: The Army has now kicked off full-scale patrolling at Demchok in eastern Ladakh , while it will soon follow suit in Depsang Plains after the initial patrols in the area verified that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had completely dismantled its temporary structures and pulled back its troops to pre-April 2020 positions.The patrolling is being conducted after informing the PLA in advance as per the terms of the Oct 21 pact on “patrolling arrangements”, which led to disengagement in the remaining two of the seven major face-off sites that arose after multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020.“Our patrols now have full unrestricted access to the five patrolling points (PPs) in Depsang and two in Demchok, which was earlier blocked by Chinese soldiers. The PLA, too, has begun its own patrols with prior information to us to prevent the possibility of any clash,” a defence source told TOI on Friday.As part of the initial patrols, Indian soldiers went up to PP-10, 11, 11A, 12 and 13 in Depsang Plains for the first time in almost five years through the “Bottleneck”, the area around 18-km inside Indian territory where the PLA was blocking them from going any further since April-May 2020.“The patrols at both Depsang and Demchok will be determined by our operational requirements and tasking,” the source said. The longer duration patrols with more distance to cover will have 20-25 armed soldiers, while the shorter ones will have 10-15 soldiers.Depsang, a table-top plateau located at an altitude of 16,000-feet, is part of India’s vital Sub-Sector North (SSN), which also includes the Daulat Beg Oldie airstrip, and strategically located near the critical Karakoram Pass in the northernmost part of eastern Ladakh. China claims almost all the 972 square km of territory in the Depsang Plains, where both sides have vast overlapping claims.“Depsang, where tanks can also operate, is far more important than other areas like Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh. It is the only place where our PPs fall short of our perception of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). In other places, the PPs are almost bang on the LAC,” another source said.At the Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok in the south, Indian troops will now access two important PPs, while villagers can also go to their traditional grazing grounds there. “Our troops will now be able to patrol right till Charding La (La means pass) at an altitude of over 19,000-feet,” the source said.After “stabilization” at Depsang and Demchok, India’s focus will shift to the restoration of patrolling rights in areas where “no patrol buffer zones” were established after previous rounds of disengagements till Sept 2022.These buffer zones at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3-km to 10-km, largely came up on what India considers to be its own territory. “They were temporary arrangements to prevent clashes. We want unhindered patrolling in these areas as well,” the source said.There is, of course, still a long way to go for India’s demand for de-escalation and de-induction of the over 50,000 PLA troops forward deployed in eastern Ladakh, with another 90,000 across Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector, to be accepted by China.",Army has now kicked off full-scale patrolling at Demchok in eastern Ladakh. It will soon follow suit in Depsang Plains after the initial patrols in the area verified that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had completely dismantled its temporary structures.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114868536,imgsize-57346,width-400,resizemode-4/114868536.jpg"

Why are stampedes witnessed wherever there are vacancies for a handful of jobs? Who is responsible for 70 paper leaks in 7 years? Who snatched 5 Lakh Govt jobs by selling stake in PSUs? Bahut Hui Mehangai Ki Maar?

Why have the household savings plunged to a 50-year low? Why has the cost of a common thali increased by 52% in just last year? TOP — Tomato Prices increased by 247%, Potato by 180% and Onion by 60%? Who levied GST on essential food items such as Milk, Curd, Atta, Dal? Who is penalising Middle Class through LTCG by indulging in Tax Terrorism? What happened to Acche Din?

Rupee is at an all-time low. Is it in ICU or in Margdarshak Mandal? Your Govt has borrowed ₹150 lakh+ crores in past 10 years, amounting to a debt of ₹1.5 lakh on every Indian. MSMEs have been destroyed through DeMO + Flawed GST. Economic Inequality is at a 100-year-high. Average Growth is below 6% in this lost decade, while during UPA it was 8%.

What PM Modi said

NEW DELHI: In a scathing response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's attack on the Congress 's ""unreal"" and ""fake"" promises to the people, party president Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday accused the government of indulging in deceitful tactics and using ""cheap PR stunts"".Referring to the BJP's 100-day plan as ""mere publicity,"" Kharge claimed it lacked substance and authenticity. He also questioned the government's assertion of taking input from over two million people for a 2047 roadmap, noting that a Right to Information ( RTI ) query to the Prime Minister's Office reportedly failed to provide details to substantiate this claim, revealing what he called ""an orchestrated lie."" Kharge went on to remark that the letters ""B"" and ""J"" in BJP stand for ""Betrayal"" and ""Jumla"" (empty promises), slamming the party for what he believes is a continuous betrayal of public trust.This came after Kharge, earlier in the day, advised the Karnataka unit about fiscal responsibility, saying: ""They should announce guarantees based on budget. Otherwise, there'll be bankruptcy. If there's no money for roads, everyone will turn against you."" It was followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's allegations about Congress accepting making ""unreal"" and ""fake"" promises to the state's residents, which prompted the reaction.Kharge then questioned BJP over their promises. Here are the claims the Congress chief directly questioned PM Modi about:Calling out PM Modi for his remarks, the Congress supremo added, ""Modi ji, before finger-pointing, please note that - MODI KI GUARANTEE is a cruel joke on 140 Crore Indians!""Also read: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah reaction to PM Modi's remarks Prime Minister Narendra Modi had slammed Congressfor making ""unreal"" and ""fake"" promises to the people, adding that the poor, youngsters, farmers and women had become the ""victims of such politics.""""The people of the country will have to be vigilant against the Congress sponsored culture of fake promises!

NEW DELHI: Karnataka 's chief minister Siddaramaiah on Friday responded strongly to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's allegations about Congress making ""unreal"" and ""fake"" promises to the state's residents.Criticising PM's remarks, the Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah posted on X, ""Before pointing fingers at Congress, take a hard look at BJP 's disastrous legacy in Karnataka! We are fulfilling every promise we made to our people – all 5 guarantees implemented with a budget over Rs 52,000 crore, and an additional Rs 52,903 crore in capital outlay to build Karnataka's future.""Siddaramaiah further added, ""BJP left Karnataka plagued with 40% commission corruption, draining resources that could have transformed lives. We’re using that same 40%—redirecting it to benefit the people. What was your ‘achievement’ here? Empowering corrupt practices, leaving Karnataka debt-ridden, and using propaganda to cover up your failures? And let’s not forget: under your watch, India’s debt is projected to reach ₹185.27 trillion by FY25—a staggering 56.8% of GDP! This isn’t just bad governance; it’s a burden you’re placing on every Indian’s back.""Siddaramaiah also talked about Karnataka's contribution to the centre but don't get adequate in return. ""While Karnataka contributes significantly to the Union's coffers, your government starves us of our rightful share to prevent us from implementing guarantee schemes. For every rupee Karnataka gives, we only receive 13 paise back. This is not ‘cooperative federalism’; it’s outright exploitation,"" he said.Other Congress leaders also responded to PM Modi 's remark.

But Mallikarjun Kharge and Congress party have warned that we should promise only that much as much as it can be implemented. They are liars.

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad made a sharp criticism at the Congress party on Friday for its ' Shakti scheme ,' demanding an apology from Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi . Prasad accused the grand old party of misleading the public and making empty promises.Speaking at a press conference, Prasad referenced Kharge's recent statement on announcing schemes based on budgetary provisions.""The Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge has accepted that we should make an announcement for only those items for which we have budgetary provisions and financial availability, Has Mallikarjun Kharge taught this lesson to Rahul Gandhi? Rahul Gandhi is an expert in making announcements, and he keeps doing it"" Prasad said.He questioned if Kharge had shared this advice with Rahul Gandhi, who, according to Prasad, frequently makes unfulfilled promises.Prasad also criticised the situation in Himachal Pradesh , where chief minister Sukhvinder Sukhu reportedly asked state employees to forgo their salaries. He pointed out that the Congress government had to withdraw a proposed tax on toilets due to public backlash.He accused the grand old party of making false announcements for votes without any intent to implement them, citing Karnataka as an example. ""They just make announcements and fool the public for the sake of votes and then they don't implement their promises,"" Prasad said.""For the first time, Congress has accepted that they have misled the public...Will Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge apologise for what is happening in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh?...

WASHINGTON: The US imposed sanctions on nearly 400 entities and individuals from over a dozen countries, including India, accusing them of supplying Russia with advanced technology to support its ""war machine"" against Ukraine.The action, taken by the treasury and state depts, was the most concerted push so far against third-country evasion of the sanctions imposed on Russia. It included sanctions on dozens of Indian, Chinese and Hong Kong companies, the most from those countries to be hit in one package so far, according to an official.Also hit were targets in Russia, UAE, Turkey, Thailand, Malaysia and Switzerland.""The US and our allies will continue to take decisive action to stop the flow of critical tools and technologies that Russia needs to wage its illegal and immoral war against Ukraine,"" said deputy treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo .The treasury department imposed sanctions on 274 targets, while the state dept designated more than 120 and the commerce department added 40 companies and research institutions to a trade restriction list over their alleged support of the Russian military.T he US has repeatedly warned against supplying Russia with Common High Priority Items—advanced components, including microelectronics, which the US and European Union believe are likely to be used for Russia’s war in Ukraine.A state department official said there has been an increase in export of such goods from India to Russia, as well as increased interest in taking action against companies facilitating such activity. The action was designed to signal the US would take action against Indian companies if progress is not made through communication.“With India, we have been direct and blunt about concerns about what we see as sort of emerging trends in that country that we want to stop before they get too far down the road,” said an official. India-based Futrevo was among the firms targeted for suspected involvement in supply of highpriority items to Russia-based manufacturer of Orlan drones","The action was the most concerted push so far against third-country evasion of the sanctions imposed on Russia.

I will fondly remember his insights and passion for academic discourse. Saddened by his passing away. Condolences to his family and friends. Om Shanti."" PM added.Known for his far-reaching contributions to economic theory and policy, Dr Debroy was a respected figure in the fields of game theory, law reforms, and Indology, as well as an advocate for poverty reduction and social equity.Debroy was also the chairperson of finance ministry's ‘expert committee for infrastructure classification and financing framework for Amrit Kaal ’, guiding strategic policy frameworks for India's long-term growth.Throughout his career, he received several accolades, including the Padma Shri in 2015. The following year, he was recognized with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the US-India Business Summit.Debroy’s career spanned multiple roles, including his tenure at the Presidency College in Kolkata, Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (GIPE) in Pune and as a key member of the Niti Aayog until 2019.An avid writer, he authored numerous books, research papers, and opinion articles, serving as a Consulting and Contributing Editor for several prominent newspapers, where he shared insights on economic reforms, railway policy, and social disparities.","PM Narendra Modi: Bibek Debroy Ji was a towering scholar, well-versed in diverse domains like economics, history, culture, politics, spirituality and more.

Philosopher economist who traversed Mahabharata and macro with ease,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bibek-debroy-economist-with-epic-career-dead/articleshow/114867467.cms,"When his daytime job was putting together a blueprint for transforming Indian Railways , he combined it with translating a complete 10-volume Mahabharata in English-- only the second Indian to do so. When he was roped in by the finance ministry to research and write a series of reports on legal reforms in India, he also produced some of the most prolific works on India’s negotiations in several rounds of WTO talks. As if the complicated trade talks and legal documents weren’t challenging enough, he would be out on weekends teaching chess to school kids in Delhi.Bibek Debroy, 69, a polymath in the truest sense of the word, passed away at AIIMS Delhi on Friday morning. He was suffering from heart-related ailments. With his undying curiosity and relentless pursuit of knowledge, he created a body of work that defies categorisation. He was chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister. In his tribute, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: “Dr Bibek Debroy Ji was a towering scholar, well-versed in diverse domains like economics, history, culture, politics, spirituality and more. Through his works, he left an indelible mark on India’s intellectual landscape. Beyond his contributions to public policy, he enjoyed working on our ancient texts, making them accessible to the youth.”Debroy’s early work was in theoretical and empirical economics, specialising in trade. Keen on studying physics at the Presidency College, Kolkata, he was nudged to opt for economics by his father. He did his master’s from Delhi School of Economics and pursued PhD from Trinity college, Cambridge. A die-hard believer in ‘free-market economy with well thought-out regulation’, Debroy authored columns and books on subjects as eclectic as history of the fountain pen to absurdities of Indian laws, and from ‘DNA and RNA of corruption in India’ to dogs in Indian mythology. His belief in the free market came from his experience of growing up in what he called a shortage economy. He would recall how he had to wait for years to buy an HMT watch or get an MTNL phone connection in the 1970s and 80s.In the last decade, his most profound work was in the field of translating Indian scriptures. Apart from translating the unabridged Mahabharata into English in 10 volumes, he translated Ramayana in three volumes followed by the Harivamsa and the Vedas. He translated six Puranas in different volumes, though in a column written for Indian Express dated October 28, he mentioned that his work on Puranas wasn’t finished. Other than 19th century scholar Manmatha Nath Dutt, he is the only other person to have translated both the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, in unabridged form, into English.From its inception in January 2015 until June 2019, Debroy was a member of the NITI Aayog . While there, he made a strong case for taxing agricultural income of rich farmers, arguing that tax-free treatment of farm income had become a growing source of tax evasion. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 2015. In her remembrance tweet, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said: “As chairman of EAC-PM he profusely participated in policy making. His interests, inter alia, were—ancient texts, Vedic and classical Sanskrit, Devi, Railways … His book Sarama and Her Children showed his uncanny knack in extracting nuggets from our ancient texts. Bibek, you had so much more to do and to complete— for all our sake! Farewell!”Debroy believed in destiny and higher power. Two decades ago--in January 2004—he had what he later called a brush with death. His heart attack was misdiagnosed and delayed treatment led to several days in ICU. He came out of the hospital with a resolve to write 12 books in a year. He wrote 15!An economist who was known to speak his mind, Debroy stepped down as chancellor of the Pune-based Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (GIPR) on what he had termed “moral grounds”. His resignation came after the Bombay High Court allowed Ajit Ranade to continue as vice chancellor. Ranade was removed as VC by Debroy after a report had concluded that his appointment was not legally tenable as he did not fulfil the criteria.Debroy had also courted controversy for inviting the editor of Organiser to a 2002 conference when he was director of the Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies. In 2004, a study on the economic rating of states which ranked Gujarat on top prompted Congress brass to ask him to get all reports published by the institute to be vetted. Debroy did not agree to the proposal and resigned.In a brutally honest assessment of his life in a piece he wrote on October 28, he said this about his legacy: “…Had a role in the rat race, was temporarily read and passed into oblivion, buried in journal archives.” On this count, Debroy will be proven wrong.","Bibek Debroy, 69, a polymath in the truest sense of the word, passed away at AIIMS Delhi on Friday morning.

NEW DELHI: India has committed to prioritise effective restoration of at least 30% of its degraded terrestrial, inland water, and coastal and marine areas by 2030 in sync with the country's 23 national biodiversity targets as well as the global 30x30 biodiversity goals . It said the country would need an annual average amount of Rs 81,664 crore for implementation of its updated pledges up to 2029-30.The country unveiled its voluntary commitments in its updated National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan ( NBSAP ) during the 16th session of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity ( COP16 ) at Cali, Colombia where countries representatives are negotiating multiple issues to protect nature, including a financial mechanism to support countries towards their efforts.India in its updates also outlined its 23 national biodiversity targets, aligning it with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM-GBF) adopted by 196 countries in Montreal during COP15 in 2022 as part of a larger global goal to protect 30% of the planet Earth by 2030 (popularly known as 30x30 targets) through halt and reverse biodiversity loss and achieve a nature-positive world.India in its updated NBSAP claimed that it spent around Rs 32,207 crore annually on biodiversity protection , conservation, and restoration from 2017-2018 to 2021-2022.India's 23 targets focus on reducing threats to biodiversity, ensuring sustainable use of resources, and enhancing tools for implementation. Each target is linked to specific strategies aimed at promoting ecosystem resilience, species recovery, and sustainable management practices.""India’s diverse geography, climate, and socio-economic conditions contribute to its status as a megadiverse country, housing numerous species across various ecosystems. With over 55,000 plant taxa and 1,00,000 animal species, India plays a crucial role in global biodiversity. This diversity supports essential ecosystem services vital for human livelihoods and ecological health,"" said India's updated NBSAP.It said, ""India employs bothandconservation strategies. Protected areas (PAs) are central to conservation efforts, complemented by community-driven initiatives and managed forest practices. Agrobiodiversity is recognized as critical for food security, with extensive efforts made in conservation and sustainable management of agricultural biodiversity.""Since achieving the country's national biodiversity targets needs, India in its submission noted that the financing of biodiversity initiatives has been identified as a ""significant challenge"".It said, ""The estimated financial requirements for implementing the updated NBSAP are substantial, necessitating innovative resource mobilization strategies. The establishment of a comprehensive biodiversity monitoring framework is also essential for tracking progress against national targets, leveraging indicators that reflect the ecological health and biodiversity status across India.""","India has committed to prioritise effective restoration of at least 30% of its degraded terrestrial, inland water, and coastal and marine areas by 2030.

NEW DELHI: This October was the warmest on record in the country, breaking the previous high of 1951, the Met office said Friday. Central India (Madhya Pradesh, parts of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh) led the mean temperature chart for October, becoming the warmest on record, too, whereas northwest India, which includes Delhi-NCR, became the second warmest on record since 1901.The ‘above-normal’ temperature phase may continue in many parts of the country in the first two weeks of November, with the possibility of a slight fall in the second week followed by a gradual dip in temperature during the rest of the month, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Since La Nina — a climate phenomenon associated with periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in central and east-central equatorial Pacific — has not yet developed, the Met department is not in a position to clearly predict the nature of winter as yet. There is still a prediction of La Nina formation in NovemberDec. If that happens, there is a possibility of a harsher winter (Dec-Feb) ahead.“La Nina is usually linked with a fall in temperature in north and northwest India during winter, but we can’t forecast anything at this juncture. Research is going on to find out why the La Nina condition has not yet developed despite favourable conditions,” IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said.We need to find out why all global models went wrong, IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said, adding, ""Latest global model forecasts indicate a higher chance of La Nina conditions developing during November-Dec, and therefore, we need to wait to make any forecast about the nature of winter at this stage, even as there are many other climate factors which impact the season.""On reasons behind a warm October , Mohapatra attributed it to formation of four low pressure systems, late withdrawal of summer monsoon, and absence of western disturbances during the month. As far as November is concerned, IMD predicted 'above normal' maximum temperatures (warmer days) over northeast and east central India, and some parts of northwest and Peninsular India. ""Normal to below normal maximum (day) temperatures are likely over west central India and adjoining areas of northwest India and north peninsular India,"" it said.In terms of minimum temperatures, most parts of the country, except some areas of northwest, may face 'above-normal' temperatures (warmer nights) during the month.","October was the warmest on record in the country, breaking the previous high of 1951.

"Suhas Subramanyam, tipped to be new member of Samosa Caucus, supports easier path to green card for H-1B holders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/suhas-subramanyam-tipped-to-be-new-member-of-samosa-caucus-supports-easier-path-to-green-card-for-h-1b-holders/articleshow/114860155.cms,"Democrat Suhas Subramanyam, a state senator in Virginia and who is tipped to be new member of Samosa Caucus

TOI correspondent from US:

From policy aide on Capitol Hill and technology advisor to President Obama, you have had diverse political experience. What are some of the important experiences that you will be taking with you, if elected to the US House of Representatives?

Immigration is an important issue for many Indians who live and work in the US. Will you be addressing immigration reforms?

Will you champion lifting of country quotas for green cards?

The Indian Americans in the US House of Representatives are informally called the Samosa Caucus – if elected you would be the sixth member of the group – do you think this is an important ‘lobby’ in the Congress with respect to the India-America relationship?

As state senator and as a candidate for Congress; what are the issues that you have highlighted?

Is your Indian heritage important for you?

Do you see many other young second generation Indian Americans like yourself choosing a career in public life, policy and politics?

Democrat Suhas Subramanyam , a state senator in Virginia, is not a newbie in US politics and was first elected to the state’s legislative body (general assembly) in 2019 as a state delegate. Now running for the US House of Representatives from Virginia’s 10th district, he is tipped to become the sixth member of the ‘ Samosa Caucus ’ of Indian American lawmakers in the US Congress . The state senator, whose parents immigrated to the US to pursue the American dream, has earlier been a staffer on Capitol Hill (the seat of US government) and served in the White House as advisor to President Barack Obama . Subramanyam, who has been endorsed for the House of Representatives seat by incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton, spoke to Ishani Duttagupta of the Times of India, on a range of issues including his support for immigration reform and the role his Indian American background has played in shaping his political views. Edited excerpts from the interview.I will be taking all my experiences with me to the US House - from advisor to President Obama to advisor on Capitol Hill and a member of the community in Virginia, who has roots here and has served as state senator. I think it is important that we listen to our constituents and be responsive to some of their needs. I think that is the most important of my experiences – my time in the community.Immigration is a personal issue for me. My family came to the US in the late 70s and it took them only three months to get a green card. Now it takes some people as long as 15 to 20 years and many are even telling me that it will be a lifetime wait, and they may never get a green card because of the antiquated immigration system that we operate under. I would like to see comprehensive immigration reform. There is a lot of talk about border security; which is fine. I support border security; but we need to talk more about legal immigration. Especially about what we are going to do about people who are on visas like the H-1B. I would like to see us lift the country quotas which I think will be especially good for Indian Americans and a lot of other immigrants from other countries too. I don’t think those quotas are fair. Even if we disagree with what to do about undocumented immigrants; we should agree on border security and legal immigration and try to move those things forward.Right now in my community there are a lot of people who came on H-1B visas, to work mostly in the technology field, and there are other programmes for agricultural workers that are mostly from Mexico or central America who come here legally to help with seasonal work on temporary visas. Both groups should have a path to citizenship especially because of their tremendous contribution to our economy and country. Without them we would be in a very difficult situation, economically.I come from an immigrant family that has benefitted from a system where people had a quicker path to citizenship and perhaps that gives me a biased view. I want to make sure that a legal immigration path to citizenship is available for people who are on these work visas. I think that it will be good for our country in the long term.I am proud to be Indian American, though it’s not what I lead with when explaining why I am running for the elections. But it is something that I consider to be very important to my story – and it’s also something that has shaped me. I was raised Indian American and went to India as a kid; but with that said I look at things from the US perspective predominantly. A strong US-India relationship is good for both the countries and this world. So even with my strong connection to India from my heritage, I also look at the situation objectively and feel that a strong US-India relationship benefits us in the US tremendously. I think that the policy can be best furthered by economic relationships rather than arms deals. The economic relationship between US and India is incredible and powerful. In the long-term, I do see the US having defence co-operation with India; but what makes the relationship strong and powerful are the economic ties. I want to continue on the path to those and improve on them.I have always focussed on economic issues as member of the Virginia General Assembly. I worked very hard on bringing down the cost of prescription drugs. I also tried to make sure that utility bills didn’t over-charge customers. Where I live, there are very high tolls on roads; I passed legislation to prevent further increases. I have always cared a lot about the cost of living here, and that seems to be one of the top issues in this election. I also care about making sure we have access to healthcare. Right now, women are specially concerned about reproductive rights in America; my focus is certainly to support reproductive rights but also to bring down the cost of healthcare generally, so more people have access to good healthcare. That has always been my concern.Education is also something that is very important to me. I want to make sure that schools have all the funds that they need. Here a lot of teachers are underpaid and can’t afford to live in our community. I want to make sure that there is more affordable housing and better pay for teachers so that we can afford to retain them.I celebrate all Indian holidays and also have family that still lives in India. So, I do have a bond with that country naturally. We also have a growing Indian population in my district and they understand the historic nature of my candidacy – the first ever Indian American in Congress from the East coast. But I also want to make sure that the people in my constituency are my priority and that the economy that we have here is strong with a focus on healthcare and education. I want people here to be empowered and have a voice.I do see a change and it’s happening pretty quickly – we’re seeing that we could have an Indian American President and there are also people on the Republican side who have run for president. We are also seeing Indian Americans run and win at the local level which I think is very important. And certainly at the state level, after I was elected, there have been others elected as well. I think it is important to get engaged and involved politically. When my parents came to the US, they had to think of how to make ends meet and how to survive in this place. They told me to pick a profession that is stable. But I understand that this as one way of giving back to the community. And now other Indian Americans are also seeing it that way which is why we are seeing more running for offices. I want to help and encourage Indian Americans and other South Asians including Nepalese, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis to run for Congress and achieve better representation. While I could be the sixth or seventh member of the ‘Samosa Caucus’, in long term I feel there should be more of us becoming a part of political process, and they don’t necessarily always have to win elections. It is important to make our voice matter, next week and later as well.","Democrat Suhas Subramanyam is running for the US House of Representatives from Virginia’s 10th district.

Kamala Harris will boost India-US ties if elected President: Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-will-boost-india-us-ties-if-elected-president-congressman-raja-krishnamoorthi/articleshow/114869372.cms,"Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi expressed confidence about the current vice president Kamala Harris ’s chances in the upcoming Presidential elections . He believes that the democratic candidate will be facing a tight race but will ultimately win.Krishnamoorthi told ANI, ""It's going to be an extremely close election. I think that she's going to ultimately prevail. But as you know, we're going to be looking at six or seven states very closely on election night. Some of those results may not roll in entirely on election night. We're also going to have to be patient as votes get counted. The last time in 2020, it took a week or so for more clarity about each state. We just have to counsel patience... Concerning the election, there's an old saying in Washington, DC if you don't have a seat at the table, you're on the menu. The best way to pull up your proverbial seat to the table is to make sure you vote. Please vote if you're eligible to vote.""Reflecting on the ties between two nations post elections, Krishnamoorthi said that owing to Indian roots through her mother, Harris will go on to be the first ‘Desi’ President, who would further nurture these relations.He stated that if Donald Trump returns to the office, his presidency will likely be marked by a transactional foreign policy in which public disagreements over trade and market access will need to be balanced against strategic priorities.Harris, in contrast, in the same way as President Joseph Biden, will be more dedicated towards strategic convergences, viewing India as the ideal counterbalance to China and ensuring that differences do not escalate into significant divides.However, many, including the Congressman, predict that both candidates will advocate for a strong India-US relationship.""About India, regardless of who is elected as the president, the relationship with India is growing stronger. It's covering more subjects, it's growing deeper. It's going to go to higher heights over time. Kamala Harris, as the first 'Desi' President of the United States, would help to strengthen those bonds. She's visited India so many times as a child and a young adult, given that her mom came from India and instilled those values,"" Krishnamoorthi said.A meme circulating on messaging apps and social media has gained considerable attention, suggests that in Sanskrit, 'Kamala' means lotus, while in America, it means POTUS—President of the United States.The whole Kamala Presidential scenario has gained significant momentum among the Indian American community , which has now grown up to be the second largest immigrant population in the US.These immigrants are transforming states like Texas and Georgia rather than predominantly settling in traditional South Asian strongholds such as California and New York.Despite the possibility of Harris becoming the first Indian American president of the US, a survey by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace indicated that she may receive fewer votes from the community than incumbent President Joe Biden did in 2020.It revealed that approximately 61 percent of respondents from the community plan to vote for Harris, indicating a decrease of nearly 4 percent compared to the last presidential election in 2020. There has been a decline in the community's attachment to Harris's party as well, with 47 per cent of respondents identifying as Democrats, down from 56 per cent in 2020.The researchers also noted ""a modest shift in the community's preferences"", with a slight increase in the willingness to vote for the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump.The Congressman further stated that Indian American voters will have a huge influence on the Presidential elections. He emphasized that while there is bound to be a 'diversity of opinions,' the community as a whole shares certain beliefs that unify them.He said, ""I still think that Indian Americans believe in a few things that unify us as a community. They should hold their elected officials accountable for fulfilling that kind of unified agenda.""Talking about unifying principles, he said that the community supports a legal immigration system seeking elected officials to advocate for reforms in this area. He emphasized belief in public education, noting that most community members are products of it and see it as the gateway to the American dream.He also highlighted the importance of entrepreneurship and small business innovation, aiming to ensure that the country remains a place where entrepreneurs can start their ventures, succeed, and contribute to their communities.These principles, he said, are widely shared among Indian Americans, and he hopes they will hold their elected officials accountable for upholding them.","Krishnamoorthi said that owing to Indian roots through her mother, Harris will go on to be the first ‘Desi’ President, who would further nurture these relations.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Donald Trump Gay Supporters: Gay Trump supporter explains why Trump has 'normal gays',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/normal-gay-guys-for-trump-vance-and-rogan-claim-lgbtq-support-in-push-for-autonomy/articleshow/114846969.cms,"Joe Rogan and JD Vance (Picture Credit:X)

Ohio Senator and Donald Trump 's 2024 running mate, JD Vance , recently appeared on Joe Rogan 's podcast, engaging in a candid discussion on LGBTQ+ rights and broader cultural topics. During the conversation, Vance expressed his belief that he and Trump could capture the support of ""normal gay guys"" due to their emphasis on individual autonomy , especially in areas involving medical interventions.Addressing the current discourse around gender and sexual identity, Vance voiced concerns about pharmaceutical interventions for children exploring gender transitions, suggesting that many Americans, including gay individuals, are uncomfortable with such practices. Vance pointed to a growing desire within the community to maintain personal freedom and avoid medical procedures that he believes are becoming more socially pressured.In response to this conversation, an X user shared their perspective on the LGBTQ+ policies enacted under Trump, contrasting them with what they described as divisive policies from the current administration. The user highlighted Trump’s record on gay rights , noting that he appointed the first openly gay cabinet member, Richard Grenell, and initiated a drive to end HIV/AIDS transmission by 2030. They emphasised Trump’s efforts to expand access to PrEP, a preventive treatment for HIV, and his UN address advocating the decriminalisation of homosexuality worldwide.Moreover, the user said that Trump's administration extended IVF coverage to gay families and proposed an expanded child tax credit for families across the spectrum. They called these moves a ""strong foundation"" for the LGBTQ+ community, contending that Trump’s policies provide tangible support.By contrast, the user criticised current Democratic policies that promote taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries and initiatives like ""tampons in boys’ bathrooms,"" as well as measures allowing boys to compete in girls' sports. They suggested that such policies are out of step with mainstream gay values, labelling them as “pandering” rather than supportive. For many ""commonsense gay men,"" the user concluded, Trump’s approach aligns more closely with their priorities.","Ohio Senator and Donald Trump's 2024 running mate, JD Vance, recently appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast, engaging in a candid discussion on LGBTQ+ rights and broader cultural topics.

Kamala Harris or Donald Trump? 10 charts to explain who Indian-Americans are likely to vote for in 2024 US elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections/kamala-harris-or-donald-trump-10-charts-to-explain-who-indian-americans-are-likely-to-vote-for-in-2024-us-elections/articleshow/114844660.cms,"Mixed bag of sentiments for Harris

Key poll issues



Healthcare and economy: Like many other voters, Indian-Americans prioritise domestic issues such as healthcare and economic stability over foreign policy concerns. These ""kitchen table"" issues dominate their electoral considerations.

Abortion and reproductive rights: Abortion rights have emerged as a significant concern for many voters within this community, particularly among women. The survey indicates that reproductive rights rank as a vital issue for Indian Americans, influencing their support for candidates like Harris.

Gender divide: A pronounced gender gap exists within voting preferences. While 67% of Indian-American women plan to vote for Harris, only 53% of men express similar intentions. This division highlights differing priorities between genders, with men increasingly leaning towards Republican candidates like Donald Trump .

Increasing Republican interest

Perception of economic policies: Some Indian-American voters are drawn to Republican economic policies that emphasize lower taxes and business-friendly regulations.

Cultural resonance: Trump's strong stance on immigration and his populist rhetoric may resonate with certain segments of the Indian-American community, particularly younger men who are increasingly aligning with conservative values.

How Indian-Americans are likely to vote

Democratic commitment declines: Indian Americans remain predominantly Democratic, with 47% identifying as Democrats, a decrease from 56% in 2020. The proportion of independents has increased, indicating a shift in political alignment within the community.

Support for Kamala Harris: 61% of registered Indian American voters plan to support Kamala Harris in the upcoming election, while 32% intend to vote for Donald Trump. This marks a modest increase in Republican support compared to previous elections.

Emerging gender gap: A significant gender gap exists in voting preferences, with 67% of Indian American women supporting Harris, compared to only 53% of men. Conversely, 22% of women and 39% of men plan to vote for Trump, highlighting differing priorities among genders.

Mixed views on Indian-American Republicans: Indian-Americans generally hold lukewarm views towards prominent Indian-American Republicans like Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy , indicating a lack of enthusiasm for Republican candidates despite some engagement from the party.

and , indicating a lack of enthusiasm for Republican candidates despite some engagement from the party. Abortion as a key issue: Abortion and reproductive rights are crucial issues for Indian-Americans this election cycle, ranking it as their second-most-important policy concern, especially among Democrats and women.

Policy discrepancies drive Republican disadvantage: The Republican Party's struggles with Indian-American voters stem from policy misalignments, particularly regarding issues like minority rights and abortion, which many community members find incompatible with Republican stances.

With just days to go before the 2024 US presidential election, Indian-Americans, who constitute a significant and growing demographic in the electorate, are poised to play a crucial role in determining the outcome. With approximately 5.2 million Indian-Americans in the US, around 2.6 million of whom are eligible voters, their political preferences are increasingly influential, particularly in key battleground states.Historically, Indian-Americans have leaned heavily towards the Democratic Party. However, recent surveys indicate a notable shift in this allegiance.According to the 2024 Indian American Attitudes Survey, only 47% of Indian-Americans now identify as Democrats, a decline from 56% in 2020. This drop suggests a growing discontent with the Democratic Party, particularly among younger voters and men within the community.The support for Kamala Harris , the Democratic candidate and current vice president of Indian descent, is also showing signs of decline.Approximately 61% of Indian-American respondents expressed their intention to vote for Harris , which reflects a decrease of nearly 7 percentage points compared to Joe Biden 's support in 2020.This trend may indicate that while Harris's candidacy initially galvanised enthusiasm among Indian-Americans, it has not sustained the same level of support as seen in previous elections.The response of the Indian-American community to Kamala Harris is characterised by a blend of excitement about representation and cautious skepticism based on broader political concerns.Many Indian-Americans are excited about Harris due to her Indian heritage, which resonates deeply within the community, but Indian-Americans do not vote as a monolithic bloc.A significant portion remains aligned with the Republican Party, and many are not swayed by Harris’s candidacy. For instance, some Republican supporters express skepticism regarding her commitment to issues important to them, such as immigration reform.Some community members also feel that Harris downplays her Indian identity in favor of her African American heritage.As the election approaches, her ability to bridge these sentiments will be crucial in securing their votes amidst a diverse array of perspectives within this influential demographic.Several factors are also influencing the voting behavior of Indian Americans this election cycle:Interestingly, there is a growing interest among Indian-Americans in Republican candidates.Support for Trump has risen to 31%, reflecting a modest increase compared to previous elections. Factors contributing to this shift include:The study suggests that the Indian-American community continues to show strong support for the Democratic Party, particularly for candidates like Kamala Harris, but that there are notable shifts that could influence electoral outcomes.The decline in Democratic identification and the rising interest in Republican candidates, especially among younger men, suggest a potential realignment that both parties must heed.As Indian-Americans solidify their role as a pivotal voting bloc, their decisions in the 2024 elections will not only impact local and national races but also reflect broader trends in American politics, making it essential for candidates to understand and address the unique perspectives of the influential community.","According to the 2024 Indian American Attitudes Survey, only 47% of Indian- Americans now identify as Democrats, a decline from 56% in 2020.

US Senator and Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance delved into his evolving views on food, particularly the appeal of Indian vegetarian cuisine , on his apperience on The Joe Rogan Experience . The conversation with Joe Rogan, which spanned three hours, offered insights not only into Vance's culinary journey but also into his marriage to Usha Vance .Rogan began the exchange by voicing scepticism about heavily processed plant-based meats, labelling them ""highly processed garbage"" and highlighting the health and environmental concerns often attached to such products. Instead, he championed traditional vegetarian food, specifically Indian cuisine, as a healthier and more flavourful option. “If you want to eat vegetables and be vegetarian, eat Indian food. They make really delicious vegetarian food,” Rogan stated.Vance, quick to agree, shared how his wife’s Indian heritage has opened him up to a world of vegetarian dishes he previously hadn’t considered. ""I'm married to an Indian-American . They make very good vegetarian food,"". As a self-described “meat and potatoes guy from Ohio,” Vance admitted that his initial forays into cooking for his wife were less than successful. Recalling an early attempt at impressing Usha with a homemade vegetarian meal, he said, ""I rolled out a flat thing of crescent rolls. I put raw broccoli on top of it. I sprinkled ranch dressing, and I stuck them in the oven for 45 minutes."" The result, he admitted, was ""disgusting.""Vance explained that he initially struggled to grasp what vegetarian meals could look like, particularly when he tried to cater to Usha’s preferences. Over time, he came to appreciate the wide variety and depth of flavours in Indian vegetarian cooking. ""If you're any vegetarian, eat paneer and rice and delicious chickpeas. Do not eat this disgusting fake meat,"" he remarked.Vance, a Catholic convert, has previously spoken about his respect for his wife’s Hindu upbringing, noting the nuances and compromises each has made in their relationship. In a prior interview with The New York Times, he expressed mixed emotions about introducing Usha to his faith, explaining that while she encouraged his spiritual journey, she has not converted to Catholicism herself. “She thought that [Catholic teachings] were good for me, in a sort of good-for-your-soul kind of way,” Vance revealed. He acknowledged feeling “kind of bad” about the change, explaining how Usha has had to shoulder responsibilities, particularly in church with their three children, even though she wasn’t raised in the faith.Their relationship, which began at Yale Law School and led to marriage in 2014.","US Senator and Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance delved into his evolving views on food, particularly the appeal of Indian vegetarian cuisine.

In 1980, white men in US who hadn’t been to college earned more than the average American worker. That has changed since. College-educated women earn more today with the US economy now focused less on manufacturing and more on services and knowledge work. Women without a college degree still round off the bottom of the payment pyramid, though.No matter the racial group, men without a college degree “have fallen well below the average full-time worker (women without a degree have long been at the bottom in income, and college-educated men have consistently been at the top)”, says New York Times.Manufacturing jobs that needed workers to man the line on busy factory ﬂoors today make up a “shrinking share of what the average American worker does”, says NYT. Roles in ﬁnancial analysis and software development have consistently paid more in the past few decades. For those without a college degree now, service-sector jobs like cook, maid, etc, offer more well-paying prospects than factories or clerical roles. “There was a clear division between winners and losers in the economy, and the losers were blue-collar white men largely,” Tom Kochan, who studied union work at MIT, was quoted as saying by NYT.California and New York, both coastal states, represent geographies that have seen the highest growth in earnings. The biggest drops were suffered by those in the so-called ‘ rust belt ’ — once the beating heart of US manufacturing — comprising states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. These, along with a handful of other swing states, are expected to decide which way the poll goes as the contest is narrowest here. And it is the Republicans who have gained ground.“We were the party of the middle class and working hard [people] and unions,” Lisa Boscola, a Democratic state senator in Pennsylvania, told NYT. “But something went wrong.” She noted that during her father’s time, it would have been unthinkable for a union worker to vote Republican in their part of Pennsylvania. NYT says that Democrats have lost support among white voters in “places most affected by job losses”. It says that “college-educated voters have increasingly moved towards the Democratic Party, as voters without a college degree have voted more Republican”.NYT said that Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ pitch resonates with a certain section of voters for whom the issue is not so much a drop in earnings, but a decline in social standing and future prospects. “Many voters who turned to Trump were middle income, not poor. But that doesn’t mean economic factors didn’t matter... rightwing populism across Western democracies doesn’t necessarily appeal to those with the lowest incomes, but to those who are downwardly mobile,” it said.","In 1980, white men in US who hadn’t been to college earned more than the average American worker. That has changed since with the US economy now focused less on manufacturing and more on services and knowledge work. Women without a college degree still round off the bottom of the payment pyramid, though.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114868352,imgsize-67606,width-400,resizemode-4/114868352.jpg"
"US elections in November, power transfer in January: Why is there an 11-week transition period?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-in-november-power-transfer-in-january-why-is-there-an-11-week-transition-period/articleshow/114867775.cms,"Constitution and the 20th Amendment:



Electoral college:



The United States has a unique electoral calendar: citizens vote for the president in November, yet the new leader is inaugurated only in January. While many countries quickly transition to new leadership after elections, the US takes a more deliberate approach, allowing an 11-week period between election day and inauguration . This span, though seemingly lengthy, is shorter than the four-month wait originally permitted under the Constitution for the transfer of power.Federal elections are held on the first Tuesday of November, a date that traces back to the early 19th century. Initially, states held elections on different days, but in 1845, a law established a uniform election day across the country. This choice of early November was practical for the largely agricultural society of the time, as it followed the harvest season but still allowed for reasonable weather for travel. Religious and logistical considerations also influenced the timing: Sunday was widely observed as a day of worship, Wednesday was a market day, and polling locations often required long travel, especially from rural areas. Ultimately, Tuesday became the most feasible choice for Election Day.Originally, the Constitution set March 4 as the presidential inauguration date, allowing a four-month "" lame duck "" period between election and inauguration. The term ""lame duck"" refers to an official whose successor has already been elected, diminishing their political influence. However, during the Great Depression, this extended transition proved to be an obstacle to urgent national needs. In response, the 20th Amendment was ratified in 1933, moving Inauguration Day to January 20, thereby reducing the transition to under three months.The transition period allows for a seamless transfer of power, giving the president-elect time to prepare for governance by assembling a cabinet, developing policy strategies, and addressing pressing national concerns. It also provides an opportunity for continuity and effective coordination, as the incoming administration works to lay the groundwork for its agenda.This interval is also influenced by the Electoral College system, which finalises the presidential election outcome weeks after the popular vote. In contrast to parliamentary systems, where the winning party can assume power immediately, the US system includes a formal process in December when electors cast their votes. While this additional step delays the formal start of the new president’s term, it ensures a thorough review and verification of the election outcome.The November election date offers voters time to participate and officials time to validate results, while the January inauguration allows for an organised transition of governance and aligns with the Constitution’s evolved timeline.","The United States has a unique electoral calendar: citizens vote for the president in November, yet the new leader is inaugurated only in January.

Peanut The Squirrel: Social media sensation 'Peanut the Squirrel' euthanized for rabies testing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/social-media-sensation-peanut-the-squirrel-euthanized-for-rabies-testing/articleshow/114867251.cms,"Peanut the Squirrel (Picture Credit: AP)

Two days after Peanut the Squirrel was taken from his home in Pine City, New York, he was euthanized by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and the Chemung County Department of Health. Peanut was a beloved pet of content creator Mark Longo and has 534,000 Instagram followers.Officials announced on Friday that Peanut and Raccoon were both seized from a residence on Wednesday and had been euthanized to test for rabies. The statement said a person involved in the confiscation investigation was bitten by the squirrel.Peanut, or ""PNUT,"" was rescued seven years ago by Longo, after Peanut's mother was killed by a car. Longo, who couldn’t find a shelter to take him in, raised Peanut from infancy, and the squirrel later became a social media sensation .Longo showcased Peanut's entire life on social media with 1,400 Instagram posts, showing him eating waffles, jumping through hula-hoops, and bonding with Longo and his cat, Chloe.In response to Peanut's confiscation, fans created a Change.org petition and GoFundMe campaign, gathering over 28,000 signatures and raising nearly $8,000 to support efforts to bring him home. However, the DEC adhered to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines requiring euthanasia forrabies testing , which involves examining brain tissue. There are no approved methods for testing live animals for rabies.DEC officials reminded the public that it is illegal to keep wild animals as pets, stating that young animals raised by humans often develop an abnormal attachment, which can make reintroduction into the wild difficult and dangerous. They encourage contacting licensed wildlife rehabilitators for any injured or orphaned wildlife.Longo, devastated by Peanut's loss, shared updates on Peanut’s Instagram account, calling the experience a ""terrible nightmare."" In addition to Peanut, Longo runs P'Nuts Freedom Farm Animal Sanctuary in Pine City, where he cares for neglected animals, including horses, cows, alpacas, and a pig.The DEC and health department advised that anyone who had contact with Peanut or the raccoon consult a physician due to potential rabies exposure.","Peanut was a beloved pet of content creator Mark Longo and has 534,000 Instagram followers.
