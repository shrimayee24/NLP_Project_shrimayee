"Gujarat minister counters Kejriwal, says deployment of other state police in polls a routine practice",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-minister-counters-kejriwal-says-deployment-of-other-state-police-in-polls-a-routine-practice/articleshow/117567658.cms,"NEW DELHI: Gujarat home minister Harsh Sanghavi on Saturday countered former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal 's post on 'X' questioning the deployment of Gujarat police personnel for Delhi assembly elections -- days after the Election Commission ordered the removal of Punjab police personnel handling from Kejriwal's security -- saying that it is a routine practice for EC to use forces from other states in a poll-going state.Pointing to the EC's norms, Sanghavi quoted Kejriwal's post to state that the EC has requested forces from various states, ""not just Gujarat"", for poll deployment in Delhi. ""In fact, the Election Commission of India has ordered SRP (state reserve police) deployment from various states, as a routine procedure. ""As per their request, 8 companies of SRP from Gujarat were sent to Delhi for the scheduled election on 11/1/25,"" he shared while questioning the selective mention of Gujarat by Kejriwal.Sanghavi also posted the relevant document, which states that there shall be advance deployment of 70 companies of Central armed police forces by January 8, 2025 for area domination, confidence building measures, conduct of flag marches, surveillance etc during the election process in Delhi. The fax message from the ministry of home affairs to the principal secretary(home) of Delhi government adds that it has been decided to deploy an additional 75 companies of CAPFs/state armed police/India Reserve battalions for conduct of safe, free and fair assembly election in Delhi. The list of these 75 companies, as mentioned in the fax, includes 10 companies of CAPFs like CRPF, BSF, ITBP and SSB and 65 companies of various state armed police (SAR) or India Reserve (IR) battalions. Of the 65 SAR/IR companies, 10 each would be from Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand; 8 each from Chhattisgarh and Gujarat; 7 each from Maharashtra and Karnataka; and five from Rajasthan.With the 75 additional companies, the total availability of forces for poll security in Delhi would be 145 companies, roughly comprising 14,500 personnel, noted the fax.In a separate post also quoting Kejriwal's tweet, BJP leader Amit Malviya further added that it is standard practice to deploy state armed forces alongside CAPFs for election duties. ""Even for Delhi elections, police forces from 12 states and Union territories including Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra have been mobilised,"" he stated while reminding that Punjab police was withdrawn not from election duty in Delhi but Kejriwal's personal security.As per the rules regarding deployment of VIP security, barring SPG protectees, the security detail of a VIP under State protection should be handled by the local state/UT police. Everytime the VIP travels outside the state, the police of the destination state/UT is informed beforehand and requested to arrange the security detail as per the threat level or entitlement of the VIP.","Gujarat home minister Harsh Sanghavi countered former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's post on 'X' questioning the deployment of Gujarat police personnel for Delhi assembly elections.

He clarified that while the state govt does not intend to stop the operations of these firms, it will ensure that borrowers are not coerced.""Microfinance institutions are operating without proper regulation, and I have warned them and RBI officials. If their activities are not regulated, the state govt will intervene,"" he said, stressing the possibility of police action against errant firms.Expressing concern over microfinance companies charging exorbitant interest rates in violation of rules, the CM said there were complaints that these firms were charging interest rates of 20% to 28% annually, despite RBI capping the rate at 17%. He added that these companies were disbursing loans of up to Rs 8,000, despite RBI ceiling of Rs 3,000.He said that outstanding microfinance loans in Karnataka currently stand at Rs 59,368 crore, with a total of 1,09,88,332 accounts in distress, accounting for 15% of the state's population.The chief minister also highlighted the importance of adhering to RBI guidelines, which restrict recovery visits after 5pm and prohibit the use of third-party agents for debt collection. He expressed concerns about unlicensed lenders and called for central govt intervention to regulate them.Deputy CM D K Shivakumar, who attended a meeting chaired by the CM on the issue, said seven cases have already been filed against microfinance companies.","CM Siddaramaiah announced that the state would introduce new legislation based on successful models from other states, such as Andhra Pradesh.

NEW DELHI: ""Mujahideens involved in the Mumbai attacks should receive Pakistan's highest posthumous military honors,"" reads the transcript of an intercepted conversation which Tahawwur Rana had with David Coleman Headley . The disturbing transcripts were cited by US justice department as crucial evidence in Rana's conviction order way back in 2013.A physician, an immigration entrepreneur, a hardline radical with an entrenched hatred for India and a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist managing finances for the outfit - Tahawwur Rana has many faces. He was a confidant of ISI's Major Iqbal plotting the audacious sea-borne terror attack in Mumbai which was seen by the then govt as an undeclared war by Pakistan and had triggered demands for retaliation.Rana alongside Headley established the groundwork for the Mumbai attacks, which was the deadliest of a series of terror runs organised by ISI through outfits like Lashkar and Indian Mujahideen. Rana had arrived in Mumbai via Dubai before the attacks to ensure arrangements were precisely executed, say investigators. ""He had checked into Hotel Renaissance in Powai during his visit to India between Nov 11 and 21 in 2008. The attacks occurred five days after he departed,"" states a police document.With decks cleared for Rana's extradition, India's endeavours since 2019 have finally yielded results.

NEW DELHI: A groom's greed for dowry gold tore apart his marriage within three days, entailed dowry harassment prosecution for 19 years, incarceration for three months, and now the Supreme Court has asked him to pay a compensation of Rs 3 lakh to the bride, who has since married another and settled abroad.The marsriage took place on Feb 3, 2006. The parents of the bride presented her 60 sovereigns of gold and the groom 10 sovereigns.But the groom, an infotech professional, acted pricey and demanded an additional 30 sovereigns for him to participate in the post-marriage ceremonies at the bride's place.Midway through the reception, the groom's father took him away from the 'mandap' accusing the bride's parents of not presenting the 100 sovereigns. The woman, a corporate executive, could take no more of her husband's greed-based tantrums and decided to lodge a complaint under Section 498A of IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prevention Act. The trial court at Saidapet (TN) convicted the groom under provisions of IPC and DP Act and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment with a fine of Rs 3,000 under Section 498A of IPC and a sentence of one year under Sec 4 of DP Act. An additional sessions judge upheld the conviction and sentence.Madras HC confirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence to two years. When the groom appealed against the HC verdict in SC, he was asked to surrender and lodged in jail for nearly three months before SC granted him bail.Noting that the groom had already undergone three months of incarceration during the trial and after the HC judgment, the bench said, ""The marriage was solemnised on March 31, 2006, and the couple lived together for three days. As noticed from the HC order, the de facto complainant (bride) is married and settled abroad. The case was prolonged for nearly 19 years. Both the groom and bride have moved on in life.""Reducing the sentence to the period of incarceration already undergone, court directed the man to deposit Rs 3 lakh within four weeks before the Saidapet trial court and directed the court to ensure this money was paid to the woman for the harassment she suffered at the hands of the groom. SC said if the money is not paid, then the case would be listed again for further hearing.","A groom's greed for dowry gold tore apart his marriage within three days, entailed dowry harassment prosecution for 19 years, incarceration for three months.

‘One Nation One Election’ plan promises to redefine terms of good governance: President Murmu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-nation-one-election-plan-promises-to-redefine-terms-of-good-governance-president-murmu/articleshow/117560700.cms,"President Droupadi Murmu on Saturday lauded the tireless efforts of the farming community, labourers, scientists as well as young Indians for their invaluable contributions to the country’s tangible progress, which has started to influence global economic trends.

NEW DELHI: President of India Droupadi Murmu on Saturday strongly advocated for the "" One Nation One Election "" plan saying that the proposed reform “promises to redefine the terms of good governance”. She said it has the potential to promote “consistency in governance, prevent policy paralysis, mitigate resource diversion, and reduce financial burden” on the exchequer.In her address to the nation on the eve of the 76th Republic Day, Murmu highlighted the reform measures being taken by the govt to weed out remanants of the “colonial mindset” that persisted even after Independence. “We won freedom in 1947, but many relics of a colonial mindset persisted among us for long. Of late, we have been witnessing concerted efforts to change that mindset,” Murmu said as she cited the decision to replace the British -era criminal laws with the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita , the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam.She went on to highlight that based also on “Indian traditions of jurisprudence”, the new criminal laws place the delivery of justice instead of punishment at the centre of the criminal justice system.“Reforms of such magnitude require an audacity of vision,” Murmu asserted. “Another measure that promises to redefine the terms of good governance is the bill introduced in Parliament to synchronise election schedules in the country,” she added.“The ‘One Nation One Election’ plan can promote consistency in governance, prevent policy paralysis, mitigate resource diversion, and reduce the financial burden, apart from offering many other benefits,” Murmu said.Murmu spoke of a fresh engagement with “our civilisational heritage” as she drew attention to the ongoing Mahakumbh and said that it can be seen as an “expression of the richness of that heritage”. She highlighted the govt’s decision recognising Assamese, Bengali, Marathi, Pali and Prakrit as classical languages.Reflecting on 75 years of the Constitution, Murmu said it is marked by an all-round progress of a young republic. “At the time of Independence and even later, large parts of the country had faced extreme poverty and also hunger. But one thing we were not deprived of was our belief in ourselves. India’s economy today influences the global economic trends. India is taking leadership positions in international forums,” she said.“The Constitution has become a living document because civic virtues have been part of our moral compass for millennia. For 75 years now, it has guided the path of our progress,” Murmu asserted as she expressed gratitude to Dr B R Ambedkar, who chaired the drafting committee.The President also pointed to the high economic growth rate of recent years and inclusive welfare measures like making basic necessities such as housing and access to clean drinking water entitlements for citizens.She also referred to efforts made to support marginalised communities, particularly those belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC).She lauded the innovative use of technology in finance, noting that digital payment systems and direct benefit transfers have enhanced transparency and inclusion. “The banking system has been in a healthy condition after a series of bold measures such as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, effecting a substantial reduction in the Non-Performing Assets of Scheduled Commercial Banks,” Murmu said.In her address, Murmu also reflected on India’s growing success in sports. “The achievements in the sports during the year 2024 were capped by D Gukesh, who became the youngest World Chess Champion,” she added..Reflecting on India's historical journey, she urged citizens to remember the brave souls who sacrificed their lives for the nation's freedom, highlighting the 150th birth anniversary of tribal icon Bhagwan Birsa Munda, whose contributions to the freedom movement are now receiving due recognition.","President of India Droupadi Murmu on Saturday strongly advocated for the ""One Nation One Election "" plan.

"No optional questions, NEET-UG ’25 to return to pre-Covid format: NTA",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-optional-questions-neet-ug-25-to-return-to-pre-covid-format-nta/articleshow/117567113.cms,"NEW DELHI: The National Testing Agency (NTA) announced on Saturday that the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) for 2025 will revert to its pre-Covid pattern. There will be no optional questions, and the test duration will return to three hours. The medical entrance exam will now consist of 180 compulsory questions to be attempted within 180 minutes. Additionally, NTA clarified in another notice that the APAAR (Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry) ID is not mandatory, following its January 14 directive for aspirants to update their Aadhaar credentials and integrate their APAAR. However, these piecemeal notices have left candidates confused as they await the start of registrations. Previously, NTA would announce registrations and provide all relevant details in a single information bulletin. Already behind schedule, it is reported that after being reprimanded by the ministry of education, NTA only recently initiated communication regarding the requisition and selection of exam centres.NTA stated that the flexible format introduced in 2021 to accommodate pandemic-related challenges—allowing candidates to attempt 180 questions out of 200—was applicable only until the 2024 exams. From 2025 onwards, all NEET-UG question papers will contain 180 compulsory questions (45 each for Physics and Chemistry, and 90 for Biology) with a total duration of three hours.While the exam format is reverting to its pre-Covid structure, the registration dates for NEET-UG 2025 remain unannounced. By comparison, for the 2020 exam, the online registration period was from December 15, 2019, to January 1, 2020, with a correction window between January 15 and 31, 2020.NTA released the syllabus for NEET-UG 2025 in December 2024, issued a notice about Aadhaar and APAAR on January 14, and announced on January 16 that the exam would be conducted in pen-paper mode. This was followed by two more notices (one again on APAAR) on Saturday.“There are multiple public notices, giving the impression that registration has already started. Ten or eleven days ago, NTA issued a notice on APAAR ID , and today another one stating it is not mandatory. At the end of each notice, they direct us to check the official website for regular updates. Instead of issuing multiple notices with fragmented information, which creates confusion, NTA should release a comprehensive information bulletin as it did in the past,” said an aspirant.According to NTA sources, the agency is far from ready, as it has yet to finalise exam centres. It has been learnt that the MoE has reprimanded NTA over delays in requisitioning and preparing centres. “When NTA informed the ministry on the status, officials clearly conveyed that the process was already behind schedule,” said a source. Following the ministry’s intervention, NTA sent its first communication on the matter only a couple of days ago.The Centre has directed NTA to ensure stringent security measures at the selected centres and adhere to recommendations made by the high-level committee led by former ISRO Chairperson K Radhakrishnan. These include prioritising government-run institutions, such as schools and higher education facilities, as exam venues.The credibility of NTA faced significant scrutiny following the NEET-UG 2024 exam, which was marred by allegations of paper leaks. These incidents led to widespread criticism of the agency’s processes and security protocols, severely damaging its reputation and raising concerns over its operational efficacy.","The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) for 2025 will revert to its pre-Covid pattern.

Rana known to have worked with Headley, a key conspirator of Mumbai attacks

NEW DELHI: US Supreme Court has refused to entertain Mumbai attacks accused Tahawwur Rana's plea against extradition to India, clearing the way for Indian investigators to bring him to the country. The review petition was turned down on Jan 21, removing the last hurdle in the extradition of Pakistani native and Canadian national Rana, an aide of Pakistani-American David Coleman Headley , one of the main conspirators of the 26/11 attacks .The writ was filed in Nov last year against an earlier order of a lower court that had ruled in favour of his extradition to India. ""Petition DENIED,"" Supreme Court said, according to reports from the US.Rana had been sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2011 for conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist plot to behead a Danish newspaper's employees and providing material support to LeT, the UN proscribed terror group responsible for the Nov 2008 Mumbai attacks in which 166 people were killed. Headley, who had pleaded guilty in the Mumbai case, had testified as a govt witness in Rana's trial.Headley testified that he travelled to Chicago and advised Rana, his long-time friend, to look for potential targets for terror attacks in India.Rana lost legal battles in several federal courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the North Circuit in San Francisco.Former US ambassador Eric Garcetti had told TOI in an interview last year that US authorities had built an airtight case for his extradition to India and that he expected him to be extradited soon, citing it as an example of strong counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries.""In the Rana case, we have done everything the right way. Every court has so far upheld the work that India and the US are doing together on this extradition,"" he had said.Rana, who is currently in detention at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, is known to have worked with Headley, one of the main conspirators of the attacks. Headley obtained Rana's consent to open an office of First World Immigration Services as a cover for his activities in India.Earlier, US govt had argued in the court that the petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. US solicitor general Elizabeth B Prelogar said this in its filing before the Supreme Court on Dec 16, according to an agency report from Washington. She said Rana was not entitled to relief from extradition to India in this case.In his petitions for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Rana argued that he was tried and acquitted in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago) on charges relating to the 2008 terrorist attacks on Mumbai.""India now seeks to extradite him for trial on charges based on the identical conduct at issue in the Chicago case,"" it said. Prelogar disagreed.""The govt does not concede that all of the conduct on which India seeks extradition was covered by the govt's prosecution in this case. For example, India's forgery charges are based in part on conduct that was not charged in the United States: petitioner's use of false information in an application to formally open a branch office of the Immigration Law Center submitted to the Reserve Bank of India,"" the US solicitor general had said.""It is not clear that the jury's verdict in this case which involves conspiracy charges and was somewhat difficult to parse means that he has been convicted or acquitted on all of the specific conduct that India has charged,"" Prelogar had said.A total of 166 people, including six Americans, were killed in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks in which 10 Pakistani terrorists laid a more than 60-hour siege, attacking people at iconic and vital locations of Mumbai.","US Supreme Court refuses to entertain Mumbai attacks accused Tahawwur Rana's plea against extradition to India.

"‘Indigenous’ bullet trains to run on Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor, till Japanese Shinkansens arrive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-bharats-to-run-on-bullet-train-corridor-till-japanese-shinkansens-arrive/articleshow/117441558.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid inordinate delay in finalising the deal for procurement of Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains for India’s first high-speed Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor , the railway ministry has invited bids for a signalling system that will allow “indigenous trains”, with a maximum design speed of 280 kmph, to run on this section.Though the ministry had earlier claimed that Shinkansen trains would make their debut on the Surat-Bilimora section by Aug 2026, now it is clear that these high-speed specialised trains may not be a reality before 2030. The operation of Shinkansen trains on the entire corridor — the foundation stone for which was laid in Sept 2017 — would be possible only by 2033, sources said.The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two “indigenous” high-speed trains by the end of 2026. These trains will have the Vande Bharat base and will be designed to run on standard gauge tracks.This became evident after the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHRSCL) last week published the tender for the signalling system for running Vande Bharat trains , which are being developed as India’s indigenous bullet trains. As per the tender document, the successful bidder will have to design, manufacture, supply, install and maintain the signalling and train control system. This will be the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level-2, different from the Japanese DS-ATC signalling for Shinkansen trains.The contract period for ETCS-2 is seven years from the date of award of work. Sources said the deployment of ETCS-2 on the corridor will ensure utilisation of the infrastructure. The plan is to start commercial operations of Vande Bharat trains on this track in 2027.“There is no point in keeping this high capital-intensive project unutilised for want of Japanese trains. Even, when our own high-speed trains are operational, the installation of the Japanese signalling system for Shinkansen trains can be carried out. The timeline for introduction of the E-10 series trains (an advanced version of bullet trains) in 2030 or later can be finalised once the trains meeting Indian conditions are made available,” a source said.As per the plan, once the Shinkansen trains are fully operational, the advanced versions of Vande Bharat trains and the ETCS would be shifted to other projects.Neither the railway ministry nor the NHSRCL respond to queries about the signalling tender and the timeline of Shinkansen train operation on this corridor. However, officials said they are confident of getting the best Japanese bullet trains for the project by 2030, and that the indigenous trains, to be introduced as a stopgap arrangement, would meet the expectation of passengers.","The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two ‘indigenous’ high-speed trains by the end of 2026.

Rapid Increase in Cases The Bacterial Infection Causing It

PUNE: Alerts from three Pune hospitals to local authorities last Monday about a higher-than-usual occurrence of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a rare but treatable autoimmune disease, blew up into an unprecedented cluster of 73 cases by Friday - almost trebling in four days from the initial 26 cases that caused alarm. No GBS-induced death has been reported. Although GBS is known to occur in communities, large hospitals typically admit 1-2 cases a month.Fourteen of the patients hospitalised over the past week were on ventilator support as health authorities in Maharashtra started door-to-door surveys, looking for signs of infection and raising awarness about GBS. Officials said municipal and district health workers surveyed about 7,200 homes in two days.Experts said the pathogenic bacteria Campylobacter jejuni was a known trigger for GBS, in which the patient's immune system attacks the nerves. The recent detection of the pathogen in stool samples from multiple hospitals adds to evidence linking this bacteria to the outbreak.Concern about the spread deepened with reports of an infant and a toddler being among new cases. Health experts and doctors suspect the cluster formed on Jan 9, with the first patient to be admitted being an eight-year-old boy.Union health ministry's Central Surveillance Unit (CSU) has taken cognisance of rising GBS cases in Pune and decided to send a team of doctors to assist local authorities. Healthcare facilities, including Sassoon Hospital, are stocking up on injectables and medicines required to combat the outbreak. The hospital is treating 16 GBS patients.Of the 73 GBS patients reported till Friday, 44 are in Pune rural, 11 in Pune Corporation area and 15 in the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation belt. The highest number of patients are from Kirkitwadi (14), DSK Vishwa (8), Nanded city (7) and Khadakwasala (6). Three patients are under five, 18 between six and 15, and seven above 60.Dr Babita Kamalapurkar, joint director of epidemiology dept, briefed the CSU about the patient profiles.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

TCH Humphreys LLC smelled fraud, and the case unraveled

Sixty felony charges—and it’s not looking good

The cost of counterfeit merchandise

Three individuals—Robert Capone (51) from Philadelphia, LeeAnn Branco (43) from Bristol, RI, and Joseph Parenti (39) from Cranston, RI—are charged with selling 1,138 items bearing forged Jason Kelce signatures. The alleged scheme netted $200,000 in sales but left a trail of deceit that the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office is now unraveling.This isn’t some small-time hustle. It’s a calculated scam. Branco even took a photo with Kelce at a legitimate signing event at Valley Forge Casino Hotel (June 11–12, 2024). That photo became part of their cover story, used alongside Branco’s credentials from Beckett Authentication Services to falsely ""validate"" the forged items.Capone, meanwhile, secured legitimate Kelce-signed memorabilia during the event but kept other items off-site. Why? To later flood the market with forged merchandise, selling it through his business, Overtime Promotions, and Parenti’s company, Diamond Legends.Here’s where things fell apart. TCH Humphreys LLC, the organizers of Kelce’s signing event, noticed irregularities. They had a contract with Kelce and were responsible for managing the official signing event. When they saw forged items popping up, they contacted Montgomery County Detectives and Upper Merion Police, exposing the operation.It turns out, the authentically signed memorabilia from the event had been verified by Professional Sports Authenticator. The forged items? A different story. Jerseys, helmets, photos, footballs—nothing escaped the trio’s counterfeit operation.The Montgomery County District Attorney was notified about counterfeit items in June 2024 by THC Humphreys LLC, the sports memorabilia company that had contracted Travis Kelce for a legitimate signing event at Valley Forge Casino Hotel.Each of the three defendants faces 60 felony charges, including forgery, theft, and deceptive business practices. This isn’t petty crime; this is major. The District Attorney’s Office also claims the fraudulent sales financially hurt both Jason Kelce and TCH Humphreys LLC, further solidifying the case against them.Capone was arraigned on January 22, 2025, and released on $100,000 bail. Branco and Parenti are expected to surrender and face arraignment soon.This scheme wasn’t just about making a quick buck. It damaged reputations, hurt legitimate business partners, and took advantage of fans willing to pay top dollar for authentic memorabilia. The 1,138 forged items weren’t just fakes—they were fraud. And it’s not just Kelce who loses here; it’s the fans who trusted that signature.A preliminary hearing is set for February 5, 2025. It’ll determine the trio’s fate, but the damage? That’s already done. Whether Kelce decides to address this publicly remains to be seen. For now, the case stands as a glaring example of the lengths some will go to exploit the name and legacy of athletes like Kelce.Also Read : A 19 years old Super Bowl video is making the rounds on the internet: A Dinner That Won Hearts and a Championship","Robert Capone, LeeAnn Branco and Joseph Parenti are charged with selling 1,138 items bearing forged Jason Kelce signatures.

I made that clear to him,” Melinda said in an interview. “He was abhorrent. He was evil personified.” Bill has called his working relationship with Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, a “mistake.”","Bill and Melinda were married in 1994 and have three kids Jennifer, 28, Rory, 25 and Phoebe, 22.

As all keen eyes are on what Kamala Harris will do next as she is not in public life first time since 2004, insiders revealed that the former vice president herself does not have the answer as she never made any backup plan for losing the election. Even until 6,7 pm on the election night, Kamala Harris camp was confident that she would win the election and become the president, a source who worked alongside the Harris campaign told the New York Post.Speculations are doing the rounds that she may take up a legal job, or prepare for either the California governor election or the 2028 presidential election but not both, or can retire. But her parting statement that 'she won't go quietly into the night' indicates that she will not take retirement from her political career and would probably prepare for the 2028 election as the governor for a former vice president would be below par. As some side hustle, Kamal Harris may take up writing a book, giving speeches etc.As of now, Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff returned to California, met the firefighters, and victims; and then were seen grocery shopping more recently. According to reports, Kamala Harris somewhat blames Doug Emhoff's past scandals for her election loss as her campaign had to navigate through those allegations.Kamala Harris established an LLC called Pioneer 49 last month in California, according to her presidential campaign's financial disclosure.

Pete Alonso’s Future Takes a Wild Turn—Could LA Be His New Home?



Pete Alonso & Blue Jays closing in on deal, has Mets position changed? | Baseball Night in NY | SNY

MLB Notebook: Padres, Michael King, Roki Sasaki, Dodgers, Jack Flaherty, Angels, Pete Alonso, Mets

Ladies and gentlemen! Just when we were ready to predict how the Pete Alonso free agency would unfold, in waltzes the Los Angeles Angels . The New York Mets have been the favorite for many months to re-sign their powerhouse first baseman. Then numbskull Angels stepped out of nowhere, believing they honestly belonged to the race for the player and feeling they were about to offer a strong enough—$100 million, four-year deal to acquire Alonso.A lot of people are still scratching their heads, wondering how such a large, albeit lucrative, deal can be handed to Alonso, a year after MLB Enter Marc Luino, who expressed doubt as to what market value could ever possibly allow him to fetch such a sum. Remember when outfielder Anthony Santander inked a five-year pact with the Blue Jays? That was the line, and Alonso's worth has been measured against it. Angels are believed to have no limits. They are ready to go all in, and one can tell they are trying to bring a different angle down on their forgettable season of 2024.Now about the dismal days of 2024, the Angels, with a sordid eye-drop season and a decade's worth of vacation-less postseason, turned back onto their fortunes. In its most unexpected shape, an off-season has seen itself begin with 12 free agents they recently signed. Twelve! And this is no addition that came very much remotely easily, in sports that are deemed a bit of a contorted dance when it comes to making competitive adjustments. Many a free-agent signing spells camaraderie across the opportunities that the team can rein in this season. However, one of the glaring needs remains an impactful bat to strike with Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon. Enter Pete Alonso, with his career stats—192 homers and 499 RBIs in just five seasons—practically screaming ""missing piece.""Hence, could Pete Alonso turn the tide for the Angels before they come out of the 2024 crash? Indeed. Just picture a team with Trout, Rendon, and Alonso in the lineup. Then the magic starts happening, and a playoff experience is almost certain with a new flavor that fans may delight in dreaming of.Alonso thinks that he is due for a shakeup. According to the Mets, the recent offer might have insulted their home run expert, inviting speculation that Alonso is now ready to seek a fresh start in greener pastures. Now that the Mets are out of the scene, going on proves that he's all set to close the door on what can be called a not-so-nice chapter. Could Toronto be the city he's going to move to? Or are the Angels offering the next chapter of his life in Los Angeles? One thing is for certain: the Angels would undeniably send to the league some bold signals concerning Alonso leading their team. They are just going on and taking a real risk this 2025 season.As the season draws near, the anticipation grows. The fate of Alonso, and potentially the Angels, hangs in the balance.","The New York Mets have been the favorite for many months to re-sign their powerhouse first baseman Pete Alonso.

No, His Role Is Well-Known Already Yes, He Deserves More Recognition

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the environment was now conducive globally and nationally for India's progress and called upon the youth to draw inspiration from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose 's life journey and focus on building a united and developed India.Highlighting Netaji's emphasis on unity, and the need to sustain it to achieve greatness as a nation, he warned against efforts to divide the country on the basis of caste, language and region, and asked all to ""remain vigilant"" against forces trying to weaken the nation & its unity.Addressing the nation on Netaji's birth anniversary, celebrated as ' Parakram Diwas ', Modi urged people to follow Bose's example of sacrifice while stepping out of comfort zones and aiming for global excellence. ""Netaji did not confine himself to his comfort zone... In the same way, we must step out of ours to build a developed India. We must aim for global excellence, focus on efficiency, and choose greatness,"" he added.The PM said Parakram Diwas celebration this year was being held in Cuttack, Netaji's birthplace, and featured an exhibition showcasing artefacts, books and artworks dedicated to his life.Highlighting Netaji's emphasis on unity, Modi said, ""Netaji formed the Indian National Army for the country's freedom, bringing together brave men and women from all regions and communities of the country. Despite their linguistic differences, their sentiments were united. This unity for freedom offers a great lesson for achieving a developed India today. Back then, we needed to unite for self-rule; today, we must stay united for a developed India.""Earlier, Modi interacted with students in Central Hall of Parliament and discussed India's goals for 2047 with them. Asked what the nation's objective should be, a student replied, ""To make India a developed nation."" Another student highlighted the significance of 2047 as the centenary of India's Independence. Yet another quoted Netaji's iconic words, ""give me blood and I promise you freedom"", and linked his leadership to her own goal of reducing India's carbon footprint through initiatives like electric vehicles.","PM Narendra Modi calls on youth to draw inspiration from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's life journey.

Budget 2025 income tax expectations : Ever since the last Union Budget was presented in July 2024, the world has seen significant changes ranging from various elections, global economic slowdown, geopolitical developments, volatile Indian stock markets, etc. Having witnessed all of this, the common man awaits with eager anticipation from the Hon'ble Finance Minister as she gears up to unveil her eighth straight budget. Some of the key expectations that individual taxpayers may have are discussed below.It is anticipated that with the thrust of the Government on the adoption of the new tax regime, there may be no changes to the old tax regime. The basic tax exemption limit under the new tax regime is currently at Rs 3 lakh. It is hoped that this limit may be increased to Rs 5 lakh, providing more disposable income for individuals to either spend or save, thereby boosting the overall economy.The full rebate of tax is available up to income limit of Rs 7 lakh currently under the new tax regime. It is expected that this limit can be raised to Rs 10 lakh, offering relief to middle income taxpayers and making it easier for them to manage their finances.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Top tax reliefs FM Sitharaman should consider in Union Budget To protect salaried taxpayers, there is a case in point to increase the standard deduction under the new regime from the current Rs 75,000 to Rs 1,00,000. This increase will help combat inflation and address the higher personal expenses incurred due to changes in work culture, such as working from home, hybrid work, and work from anywhere.n line with the Government's objective of ""Housing for All"" and fostering home ownership, it is suggested that the Government reconsider allowing deductions for interest on self-occupied housing loans under the new default tax regime.To reduce the carbon footprint and move towards clean energy, the Government should reintroduce the deduction provided under section 80EEB (deduction for interest on loan taken to purchase an electric vehicle) and extend it to the new regime as well.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Individual taxpayers want FM Sitharaman to lower tax rates, make new tax regime more attractive, says survey Currently, if a property seller is a resident, buyers must deduct tax at 1% of the consideration if the property value is Rs 50 lakh or more and file a challan-cum-statement, which is a simple and convenient process. However, if the seller is a non-resident, the buyer must obtain a TAN for this one-off transaction, deduct tax at a higher rate, and file a TDS return, which is a cumbersome process. The government should consider introducing challan-cum-statement for non-resident sellers akin to resident sellers to simplify the process.The proposed measures pave the way for significantly improving financial well-being and stimulate economic growth.","It is anticipated that with the thrust of the Government on the adoption of the new tax regime, there may be no changes to the old tax regime.

Celebrations across the country

Every year on January 26, Indians celebrate Republic Day-- the day when the Constitution of India came into effect, back in 1950, and India became a ‘sovereign democratic republic’.It is a day of great joy, honour, and patriotic spirit for Indians because back in 1950, this was the day when the Government of India Act was replaced by the Constitution, and Indians received a government and a form of governance that they fought so hard for.Every year on Republic Day Indians are glued to the screens of a TV or their phone in order to watch the Republic Day parade which is no less than a spectacle. It is held every year on ‘ Kartavya Path ’ and invites visitors, audiences, and chief guests from all over the world.

But when you unfurl a flag it is already positioned at the top, and you just spread it by loosening the ropes.See more: Republic Day 2025 Wishes & Quotes: Happy Republic Day 2025: Best Messages, Quotes, Wishes, and Images to share on Republic Day The Republic Day Parade has many highlights and that is why people are excited to not miss it.

NEW DELHI: Indian men’s ice hockey team ’s participation in the forthcoming Asian Winter Games — to be held in China’s Harbin from Feb 7-14 — is still uncertain.As TOI had reported earlier, the ice hockey team was not cleared by the sports ministry for the Games, which had elicited a strong response from PT Usha , the president of Indian Olympic Association (IOA).IOA had cleared the team for participation, sending the list of athletes to the organisers in November.Despite this, the ministry called for a fresh selection trial in Leh on Saturday to pick its choice of ice hockey athletes. The ministry had issued an office circular in this regard on Jan 24, calling in ice hockey players to assemble at Nawang Dorjay Stobdan Sports Complex in Leh for trials.A total of 34 names were listed for trials at the Leh ice hockey rink. However, reportedly, only eight athletes turned up for the trials.This prompted Usha to write to sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya. The federation governing the ice hockey affairs in the country – Ice Hockey Association of India (IHAI) – is recognised by both the sport’s global governing body and IOA.IHAI is also recognised by the ministry as a ‘National Sports Promotion Organisation’.There is another federation claiming to be the official body. Usha wrote in her letter: “The ministry received two lists of players, both of which are not recognised NSFs of ice hockey.Therefore, it has directed SAI to conduct trials. The ice hockey team recommended for participation in the 9th Asian Winter Games has been selected by IHAI which is an affiliated unit of IOA.The selection process was conducted in accordance with the guidelines. The names of the selected team members were entered in the registration system of Winter Games as per the deadline of Dec 7, 2024, and no fresh names can be added.”It remains to be seen what the ministry says to this.","Indian men’s ice hockey team ’s participation in the forthcoming Asian Winter Games is still uncertain.

TikTok ban averted? White House reportedly in talks for Oracle-led majority stake to reduce Chinese ownership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tiktok-ban-averted-white-house-reportedly-in-talks-for-oracle-led-majority-stake-to-reduce-chinese-ownership/articleshow/117568762.cms,"TikTok facing shutdown in US

The White House is currently in talks with software company Oracle and other US investors to take over the global operations of the popular video-sharing app TikTok, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations, quoted by US' National Public Radio (NPR).The proposed arrangement would allow ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, to maintain a minority position, whilst Oracle would supervise the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates. Oracle already provides TikTok's web infrastructure foundation.Under the terms being discussed, Oracle would monitor and provide oversight of TikTok's algorithm, data collection, and software updates, effectively giving American investors a majority stake in the company. The exact terms of the deal are still being negotiated and could change.""The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok,"" said a person directly involved in the talks, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations, quoted by NPR. ""ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership.""Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday to discuss the potential deal, with another meeting scheduled for next week. Oracle is reportedly interested in acquiring a stake in TikTok ""in the tens of billions,"" but the rest of the deal remains in flux.Microsoft is also reportedly amongst other potential investors involved in the discussions. Meanwhile, Perplexity AI also presented a merger proposal to ByteDance last week, offering to combine operations with TikTok's US division, according to CNBC's exclusive report.Trump previously endorsed a TikTok acquisition attempt by Oracle and Walmart in 2020 that ultimately failed. An NPR source close to the current talks indicated the retailer is not participating after concerns about the app's valuation.Appeasing Congress is seen as a key hurdle in the negotiations. Under a law passed by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court, TikTok must execute a ""qualified divestiture"" from ByteDance to continue operating in the US President Trump has wide latitude to interpret what this means, but experts suggest it could involve ByteDance retaining a minority stake.""A key part is showing there is no operational relationship with ByteDance, that they do not have control,"" said a Congressional staffer involved in talks about TikTok's future. ""There needs to be no backdoors where China can potentially gain access.""Eliminating potential ways for Chinese authorities to access TikTok's data and algorithm has been a long-standing concern among technology experts. Sarah Kreps, who focuses on technology and foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, noted the difficulty in proving the absence of Chinese control over data and the algorithm.The current negotiations follow the collapse of a previous national security plan involving Oracle, known as Project Texas, which failed to guarantee TikTok's independence from ByteDance. In April, Congress attached a divest-or-ban measure to a foreign aid bill, giving ByteDance until January 19 to shed its Chinese owner.Chinese regulators, who have previously opposed the selling of TikTok, recently signaled that they would not stand in the way of a TikTok ownership change, stating that acquisitions ""should be independently decided by the enterprises and based on market principles."" White House negotiators believe this indicates that Beijing is not planning to block a deal that gives American investors a majority stake in the company.Meanwhile, Apple and Google have not yet returned TikTok to their app stores after the platform went offline for about 14 hours. Without their support, the app cannot receive software updates or be downloaded on Apple devices or found in the Google Play app store. Trump's executive order was sufficient for Oracle and other web infrastructure companies to restore TikTok's services, but other companies, including Apple and Google, are not taking the risk due to the potential for hundreds of billions of dollars in fines under the TikTok ban law.TikTok which was shutdown for a few hours on January 18 but came back online around 12 hours later, with a message confirming support from Trump, who signed an executive order delaying the looming ban by 75-days on Day 1 of his presidency.","The White House is in talks with Oracle and other US investors to take over the global operations of the popular video-sharing app TikTok.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
