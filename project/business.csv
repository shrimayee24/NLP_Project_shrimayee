HIV jab for 115 nations rests on Indian regulators,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hiv-jab-for-115-nations-rests-on-indian-regulators/articleshow/124199149.cms,"Mumbai: There will be a dramatic shift in how the world prevents HIV and the timelines depend on how quickly Indian drug regulators act. A US-based pharma giant has granted royalty-free licences to four Indian generic manufacturers to produce lenacapavir, which prevents transmission by almost 100%, at $40 per person per year, roughly 0.1% of the original cost.Lenacapavir is an injectable drug whose protection from one jab lasts six months. The licensed manufacturers by Gilead Sciences include Dr Reddy's, Hetero, Emcureand Mylan. The first two have announced their pricing. The drugs are estimated to roll out in 2027. But, it could be much sooner or delayed, and what happens in India will impact local access as well as 115 low- and middle-income countries as these firms will be key exporters. Twenty-six additional such countries where people participated in crucial clinical trials are excluded from it as per licence terms.The exports depend on registration and a certificate of pharmaceutical product from Indian FDA. Besides, there could be regulatory demand for local clinical trials despite strong phase-3 trial data from elsewhere. ""In that case, the delays could spill over into 2027,"" said Leena Menghaney, public health lawyer.There is another pathway to faster access. FDA could provide a waiver for local clinical trials on the grounds that HIV is an epidemic. India reports more than 60,000 new HIV infections annually.There is precedent for such a move. ""Waivers have been given for HIV and TB drugs. These decisions are based on the results of phase-3 clinical trials in countries with very strong regulatory systems,"" Menghaney said.In 2015, the apex committee of the regulator Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation also granted a waiver of local trials for antiviral drugs against Hepatitis C.Even if local production moves ahead quickly, access in India will be limited. National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) has so far included only condoms as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in its HIV prevention programme.There have been drugs similar to lenacapavir, although not on a par in terms of protection and cost, that were not included in the national programme. Naco officials had previously defended this position, saying condoms also help prevent the spread of other STDs and STIs, which increased in some countries when PrEP was introduced and condom use declined.However, Dr Ishwar Gilada, an HIV specialist, said, ""Bringing about behaviour change is difficult, but sex education and awareness are also part of Naco's responsibilities. For the first time in over 40 years, we have a way to control HIV's transmission by almost 100%. This will reduce the number of people requiring lifelong treatment.""Ganesh Acharya, a city-based HIV-TB survivor, said, ""Other such drugs so far have been needed to be taken monthly, are costly and offer relatively lower protection. Even condoms carry a risk of tearing. This drug could bring down new HIV numbers.""","Lenacapavir is an injectable drug whose protection from one jab lasts six months.

Sonu Sood Questioned For Nearly Seven Hours By ED In Betting App PMLA Case

NEW DELHI: With some celebrities, including former cricketers and filmstars, not appearing despite summonses being issued to them in connection with alleged laundering of illegal proceeds of 1xBet online betting platform, ED is considering attaching properties of those linked to cases in which money trails have been established.ED is also likely to soon file a chargesheet in the case, wherein these celebrities may also be named as accused for endorsing illegal activities, sources said.On Sept 24, actor Sonu Sood had appeared before ED at its headquarters for questioning in connection with his alleged association with the 1xBet online betting syndicate. Earlier, cricketers Suresh Raina, Shikhar Dhawan, Robin Utthappa and Yuvraj Singh, and actor and ex-TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty had appeared before the agency and recorded their statements regarding fees received for endorsing illegal betting activities. Actor Urvashi Rautela, who missed the summons issued to her, has been asked to appear for questioning in the same case.The agency is probing the promoters and associates of 1xBet for illegally running a betting and gambling racket in the country and siphoning the proceeds of crime out of India. Attachment of assets in foreign countries is also likely where the agency has found trails of proceeds of crime. Earlier, in the case of Fairplay, another illegal betting app, the enforcement agency had attached assets worth over Rs 307 crore in Dubai, including land, villas and bank balances, linked to the accused.Fairplay was allegedly involved in illegal broadcast of cricket matches, besides online gambling.Among several FIRs registered against Fairplay, one by Viacom18 Media Pvt Ltd in Mumbai accused the betting app of causing loss of revenue of more than Rs 100 crore by illegally broadcasting cricket matches.","ED likely to soon file a chargesheet in the case, wherein these celebrities may also be named as accused for endorsing illegal activities, sources said.

modifiable risk factors

NEW DELHI: The incidence of cancer in India has gone up by 26%, from 84.8 per 1 lakh population in 1990 to 107.2 in 2023, according to a new study. Published in The Lancet, it shows deaths due to cancer increased by 21% during this period, despite advances in treatment.In comparison, both incidence and mortality have declined significantly in US and China over the 33-year period. The reason behind this is strong tobacco control, universal vaccination and organised screening in these two countries, Dr Abhishek Shankar, radiation-oncologist at AIIMS Delhi, said.India, he added, continues to fare poorly on both counts because of persisting risk factors such as high use of tobacco, obesity and infections, coupled with limited access to early detection.Evidence-based strategies like HPV and Hepatitis-B vaccination, mammography, lung cancer screening with low-dose CT, and colonoscopy screening, and timely treatment remain uneven or inadequate.For India to reverse its trajectory, we must urgently strengthen risk prevention strategies, expand evidence-based screening programmes and integrate cancer care into its universal health coverage agenda,"" Shankar said.The study's lead author Dr Lisa Force from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), University of Washington, said, ""Cancer remains an important contributor to disease burden globally and our study highlights how it is anticipated to grow substantially over the coming decades, with disproportionate growth in countries with limited resources.""She added that despite the clear need for action, cancer control policies and implementation remain under-prioritised in global health, and there is insufficient funding to address this challenge in many settings.The study shows cancer incidence has declined by 19% and 20% in China and the US, respectively, between 1990 and 2023, while their mortality rates attributable to cancer has also seen a robust decline - 43% decline in mortality due to cancer in China and 33% in the US.The study estimates that 42% (4.3 million) of the estimated 10.4 million cancer deaths in 2023 were attributable to 44 potentially modifiable risk factors - presenting an opportunity for action.""Behavioural risk factors contributed to the most cancer deaths across all country income levels in 2023, especially tobacco use which contributed to 21% of cancer deaths globally. Tobacco was the leading risk factor in all country income levels except low-income countries, where the leading risk factor was unsafe sex (linked to 12.5% of all cancer deaths),"" the study said.A parliamentary committee report tabled in 2023 suggested raising taxes on tobacco products in India to make them less affordable.""Committee recommends the ministry (health) to pursue with the department of revenue to expedite the decision on raising taxes on tobacco products,"" it said.It also stressed upon the need to link the Population-Based Cancer Registry to Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission to get real time data on cancer patients.The mission is a key health initiative by the govt which aims at providing digital health IDs for all Indian citizens to help hospitals, insurance firms, and citizens access health records electronically when required.Most cancer cases in India are detected in late stages leading to poor prognosis.The parliamentary committee suggested that the issue of screening for cancer should be taken up at 'Jan Aandolan Pace', a mass movement to fight against cancer by timely screening.""A day in a month may be fixed for cancer screening on the lines of reproductive and child health,"" the parliamentary committee suggested.","The incidence of cancer in India has gone up by 26%, from 84.8 per 1 lakh population in 1990 to 107.2 in 2023.

From CEPA To Space: India And UAE Chart A New Growth Map Together, Trade Pact Expands To FDI

NEW DELHI: The UAE remained the leading travel destination for Indian nationals in 2024, followed by Saudi Arabia, the US, Thailand, Singapore, the UK, Qatar, Canada, Kuwait and Oman. Together, these top 10 countries accounted for approximately 71.1% of all Indian Nationals' Departures (INDs) during the year.The data, part of the India Tourism Data Compendium 2025 released by the ministry of tourism, shows that overall, Indian nationals travelled abroad primarily for leisure and recreational purposes (42.5%), followed closely by visits related to the Indian diaspora (34.6%). Business and professional travel accounted for 14.9% of total departures, while pilgrimage (3.9%), education (2.4%) and other purposes (1.4%) comprised the remaining share.""INDs from India have shown a strong upward trend over the past three decades, rising from 1.9 million in 1991 to 30.8 million in 2024, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7%,"" it is stated in the compendium.While the Covid-19 pandemic caused a decline of nearly 73% in travel in 2020, a strong recovery began as restrictions eased, with departures rising by 152.6% in 2022 and surpassing pre-pandemic levels in 2023, reaching 27.8 million - a 29% year-on-year increase.In 2024, India continued its upward trajectory, recording growth of 10.7% over the previous year.Higher disposable incomes, improved air connectivity and greater exposure to global destinations are among the factors that contributed to Indian nationals travelling abroad in greater numbers.The data on traveller profiles shows that in 2024, Indian nationals travelling abroad were predominantly from the working-age population, with the 25-34 age group accounting for the highest share (27.4%), followed closely by the 35-44 age group (24.5%). As far as gender distribution is concerned, while females accounted for 34.1% of travellers in 2024, males made up the remaining 65.8%.If one looks at the data on destination countries visited by Indian nationals for the years 2019, 2023 and 2024, all three years saw the UAE ranked first. In 2024, approximately 7.8 million Indians travelled to the UAE, accounting for 25.2% of total departures - the figure has seen a steady increase, being 6.3 million in 2019 and 7.2 million in 2023.Saudi Arabia maintained its second position, attracting 3.4 million Indians in 2024, up from 3 million in 2023.The US ranked third across all three years, with 2.1 million departures in 2024.

NEW DELHI: India’s cheetah reintroduction programme will notch a historic first on Monday when Mukhi, a female cub born at Kuno National Park, becomes the country’s first India-born cheetah to reach adulthood- a crucial milestone in creating a self-sustaining population.“Mukhi, a female cub born to Namibian cheetah Jwala on March 29, 2023, will reach adulthood, as it will turn 915 days or 30 months old, on Monday, ready to contribute to increasing the cheetah population in India,” Project Cheetah director Uttam Kumar Sharma told PTI.Her survival is notable. “Of the four cubs Jwala delivered, three died due to extreme heat, but Mukhi survived and has grown well. Today our efforts have yielded encouraging results,” Sharma said.Project Cheetah began on September 17, 2022, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the release of eight Namibian cheetahs into a designated enclosure at Kuno—the world’s first inter-continental relocation of a large wild carnivore. Another 12 cheetahs arrived from South Africa in February 2023.India now hosts 27 cheetahs, of which 16 were born in the country. At Kuno, 26 cubs have been born since the project began, but 19 cheetahs—nine imported adults and 10 India-born cubs—have died so far, leaving 24 animals at Kuno and three at Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary.Amid those losses, India today has seven more cheetahs than were initially imported, and Kuno’s cub survival rate stands above 61 per cent, exceeding the global average of 40 per cent.Officials call the progress a “big success” and are negotiating with African nations, including Botswana and Namibia, to bring in 8–10 more cheetahs by December to strengthen the gene pool.","Mukhi, a female cub born at Kuno National Park, will become the country’s first India-born cheetah to reach adulthood.

""This Vijayadashami is special for another reason,"" he said. ""This day marks 100 years of the foundation of RSS. This journey of a century is as amazing and unprecedented as it is inspiring. When RSS was founded 100 years ago, the country had been bound by the chains of slavery for centuries. ""In his I-Day address, Modi had said for the past 100 years, RSS swayamsevaks (volunteers) have dedicated their lives to fulfilling the resolve of ""vyakti nirman"" (character development) and ""rashtra nirman"" (nation building) for the welfare of ""matrubhoomi"" (motherland).Centuries-long slavery had deeply hurt the country's self-respect and self-confidence, and the world's oldest civilisation was facing an identity crisis. ""Our countrymen were becoming victims of an inferiority complex,"" Modi said. ""Therefore, along with the country's independence, it was also important that the country be freed from intellectual slavery. In this context, the most revered Dr Hedgewar began to ponder over this issue.For this herculean task, he founded RSS on the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashami in 1925.""The PM further said, ""After Dr Saheb's passing, Param Poojya Guruji carried forward this great yagya of service to the nation. Param Poojya Guruji used to say, 'Rashtraya Swaha, Idam Rashtraya Idam Na Mam', meaning, 'This is not mine; this belongs to the nation'.""Modi noted that the resolve of RSS founders had inspired countrymen to rise above self-interest and embrace dedication to the nation. ""This statement by Guruji Golwalkar has shown millions of volunteers the path of sacrifice and service."" The PM said the spirit of sacrifice, service, and the discipline it inculcates among its members are the true strengths of Sangh. ""Today, RSS has been relentlessly and tirelessly engaged in national service for over a hundred years. ""He explained this is why RSS volunteers are the first to reach the area whenever a natural disaster strikes anywhere in the country. ""This spirit of 'nation first' always remains paramount in every action and every endeavour of millions of volunteers,"" Modi said and extended his wishes to RSS volunteers.Referring to the coming month, the PM highlighted that Oct 7 marks Maharishi Valmiki Jayanti. ""We all know how great a foundation Maharishi Valmiki laid for Indian culture. It was indeed Maharishi Valmiki who introduced us extensively to the Avatar Kathas of Bhagwan Ram. He presented humanity with the marvellous epic of the Ramayan.""Modi added that the influence of the Ramayan stems from the ideals and values of Bhagwan Ram enshrined in it. ""Bhagwan Ram embraced everyone with a spirit of service, harmony and compassion,"" the PM said.""That is why we feel that the Ram of Maharishi Valmiki's Ramayan is complete only with Mata Shabari and Nishadraj,"" he said, highlighting the significance of the two Ramayan characters, who hailed from marginalised communities.""That is why, friends, when the Ram temple was erected in Ayodhya, a temple dedicated to Nishadraj and Maharishi Valmiki was also built alongside it,"" Modi said and urged those visiting Ayodhya to see Ram Lalla, and the Maharishi Valmiki and Nishadraj temples.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi hails RSS for an ""unprecedented and inspiring"" journey.

However, this requirement has not been proposed for electric two- and three-wheelers, as well as e-rickshaws, which too produce no noise.The draft notification states that all new models of electric passenger and goods vehicles manufactured after Oct 2026 must be equipped with AVAS, and all existing models produced from Oct 2027 onward must have the feature.TOI had reported on July 5 the govt’s move to introduce this regulation requiring vehicle manufacturers to install an electronic system that automatically produces sound when these electric vehicles are moving at speeds of up to 20 kmph. Since such vehicles produce almost no noise, they are categorised as Quiet Road Transport Vehicles (QRTVs).The AVAS is primarily designed for electric and hybrid vehicles to emit artificial sounds to alert pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users to their presence, especially at low speeds when these vehicles are very quiet.“There is a dire need to mandate this feature in electric two- and three-wheelers too.We see more instances of pedestrians being hit by two-wheelers, and since these make no noise, the risk of accidents is greater,” said Anil Chhikara, a former deputy transport commissioner of Delhi.The AVAS will not be required for higher speeds when tyres of EVs generate sufficient noise.Sources said the ministry’s notification also proposes to do away with the requirement to carry a spare tyre for cars, three-wheelers, and quadricycles that have tubeless tyres.","From Oct 2027 all electric cars, buses, and trucks will be required to have an Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System.

Donald Trump's new Gold Card programme, offering a fast-track route to US residency, has sparked growing interest among Indians chasing the American dream, particularly after his administration hiked H-1B visa fees to $100,000.The Gold Card, signed into effect through an executive order on September 19, requires a non-refundable $1 million ""gift"" to the US Treasury, or $2 million through corporate sponsorship.Unlike the EB-5 investor visa, the scheme is positioned as a contribution to ""American industry and commerce.""Immigration firms say the demand has risen significantly since the H-1B overhaul.

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate has filed a chargesheet against businessman Raj Kundra , accusing him of being a beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins worth Rs 150.47 crore received from late crypto-scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj.The chargesheet, filed before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court, states that Kundra concealed crucial evidence and failed to surrender the Bitcoins.The ED claims Kundra remains in possession and enjoyment of the proceeds of crime in the form of Bitcoins. The agency alleges he conducted a transaction with his actor wife Shilpa Shetty at below market rate to disguise funds obtained through criminal activities.The money laundering case originates from FIRs filed by Maharashtra and Delhi police against Variable Tech Private Limited and several individuals including Amit Bhardwaj, Ajay Bhardwaj, Vivek Bhardwaj, Simpy Bhardwaj, and Mahender Bhardwaj.According to the ED, the promoters promised investors huge returns in crypto assets through Bitcoin mining but instead cheated them and concealed the ill-gotten Bitcoins in obscure online wallets.The agency states Kundra received the Bitcoins from Amit Bhardwaj for establishing a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Though the deal didn't materialize, Kundra allegedly retained possession of the Bitcoins.""Thus, it can be safely concluded that the agreement was actually between Raj Kundra and Amit Bhardwaj (his father Mahender Bhardwaj) and the argument given by Kundra that he acted as a mere mediator is not tenable,"" the chargesheet stated.The ED noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins received in five specific tranches after seven years ""solidifies the fact that he was indeed the recipient of Bitcoins as a beneficial owner and not acted merely as a mediator.""The agency reported that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide the wallet addresses where the 285 Bitcoins were transferred. He attributed this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED interpreted as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.The ED said Kundra ""did a genuine transaction with his actor wife Shilpa Shetty at far below market rate to disguise the origin of such funds obtained by commission of criminal activities.""The agency further stated that Kundra ""tried to frustrate the proceeding under PMLA by layering the proceeds of crime and projected the same as untainted.""The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused in the case.According to investigators, Kundra claimed to be a mediator in the transaction but failed to provide ""any underlying documentary evidence to prove the same."" Instead, the agreement titled ""Term Sheet"" was signed between him and Mahendra Bhardwaj.The ED explained that Bitcoins were meant to be used for mining operations, with investors promised substantial returns in cryptocurrency.

New AI agent 'Quick' signals strategic shift





Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman delivered a pointed message to staff during an internal meeting, criticizing the cloud computing giant for slow product rollouts ahead of its flagship Reinvent conference in December. ""The first and very most important thing we've got to do is make sure that we deliver on the roadmap that we have,"" Garman told employees, according to a meeting transcript reviewed by Reuters.The AWS chief emphasized that customers expect immediate access to announced products rather than mere pre-announcements. ""Increasingly, we're finding that when we launch innovative new things at Reinvent it's valuable if we can actually launch them, as opposed to just pre-announce them,"" Garman said during the all-hands meeting.The internal critique comes as Amazon grapples with mounting criticism over its artificial intelligence strategy. During the company's most recent earnings call, a Morgan Stanley analyst questioned CEO Andy Jassy about Wall Street concerns that ""AWS is falling behind in genAI with concerns about share loss to peers.""Jassy defended Amazon's position in an unusually lengthy eight-minute response, arguing that AI development remains in early stages with room for multiple winners.However, the internal pressure from Garman suggests ongoing urgency within the organization to accelerate product delivery timelines.At the meeting, Garman demonstrated a new internal AI product called ""Quick,"" per Reuters, describing as an ""agentic"" AI system designed to perform tasks with minimal prompting. The tool can analyze documents and web pages while automating customized workflows for regular business processes.Quick will soon be available for testing across all AWS employees, representing the company's latest effort to compete in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Garman also stressed the importance of customer attendance at Reinvent, targeting over 60,000 attendees to match last year's conference turnout.However, an Amazon spokesperson disputed the Reuters report, calling it a ""gross misinterpretation"" of what was described as an ""inspiring internal conversation.""","Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has urged his staff to expedite product rollouts, particularly in AI.

With discounting intensity easing and sharper cost discipline, unit economics are improving, supporting a faster path to Instamart profitability.Food delivery (FD) growth, previously impacted by weak sentiment, is set to accelerate.

(With inputs from Manthan K Mehta & Somit Sen)





MUMBAI: In a serious safety lapse, two AC coaches of the Bandra-Amritsar Express got detached twice in a span of an hour Sunday, first in Palghar district of Maharashtra and then after the train crossed into Gujarat. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, though railway officials admitted the incident could have had grave consequences.The first detachment occurred at 1.19pm in Palghar. Alert staff rushed to the spot and reconnected the bogies, allowing the train to resume its journey at 1.46 pm. But barely 25 minutes later, at 2.10 pm, the same two coaches again separated when the train halted at Sanjan station in Gujarat.Technical teams again attended to the snag, and Western Railway officials said the faulty two 2-tier AC coaches would be detached and replaced when the train reaches Valsad station.An inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the precise cause of decoupling of two AC coaches of the Bandra–Amritsar Superfast Express twice within an hour Sunday, officials said. “Such parting of coaches can be due to either a material fault in the couplers or lapses in maintenance,” an official added.Photos and videos shared on social media by passengers show some standing on the train vestibule and some on the tracks waiting for the coaches to be attached.The coaches detached first in Palghar district and then again after the train crossed into Gujarat.Technical teams attended to the snags, and Western Railway officials said the faulty 2-tier AC coaches would be replaced at Valsad station. “We got two 3-tier AC coaches and passengers of the 2-tier were asked to travel in them instead. We did not want to take any chances and replaced the two coaches with new 3-tier coaches available at Valsad,” an official said. “All passengers are safe and there was no disruption to train operations,” a spokesperson said.While the express continued on its onward journey after the recoupling, the repeated nature of the glitch has raised concerns.Railway insiders say instances of coaches detaching mid-journey are rare and considered serious. In the past, similar incidents have prompted nationwide checks of coupler assemblies to ensure safety standards are not diluted.The Bandra–Amritsar Express, a daily superfast train, is a key link between Mumbai and Punjab. On Sundays, it usually carries heavy festive and long-weekend rush. That no passengers were hurt and that the separation happened when the train was not at high speed is being seen as sheer luck by officials.WR officials maintained that the matter was being treated with utmost seriousness. “An inquiry is underway and remedial action will be taken immediately to prevent recurrence,” an official said. A passenger rights activist said the passengers should be given partial or full refunds as they had to bear the inconvenience and shift from 2-tier coaches to 3-tier.","Two AC coaches of the Bandra-Amritsar Express got detached twice in a span of an hour Sunday.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in green on Monday after a week of losses on D-street. While Nifty50 was near 24,700, BSE Sensex was up over 80 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,691.10, up 36 points or 0.15%. BSE Sensex was at 80,510.74, up 84 points or 0.10%.This week has several data releases, with both local and international factors influencing market direction. IIP figures and the RBI's monetary policy announcement will be crucial domestic factors, whilst September derivatives expiry could increase market fluctuations.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The market drifted down continuously during the last six trading days pulling the Nifty below the 24800 level, which was a support zone. Technically the market continues to be weak, but it has reached oversold levels and , therefore, a short-term bounce back is likely any time. However, if any rally is to sustain the market needs positive news particularly on the trade deal with the US. Therefore, the market focus will be on that. The monetary policy expected on October 1st is unlikely to surprise. The present growth-inflation dynamics do not warrant a rate cut.Therefore, the RBI is likely to hold rates while sending a dovish message to support the growth momentum in the economy.”“The weakness in the broader market is likely to sustain given the valuations which continue to remain elevated. Investors can slowly accumulate largecaps in automobiles, banking, telecom, capital goods and cement. Weakness in pharmaceuticals is an opportunity to buy into the segment since India’s generic exports will not be impacted by Trump’s tariffs on patented and branded medicines.""US equities finished higher on Friday before important inflation data, despite weekly losses that ended winning runs for both S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Market participants weighed potential Federal Reserve rate reductions against economic resilience and upcoming corporate results.Regional Asian equities displayed varied movements at opening, with Japanese declines balanced by gains elsewhere.Oil prices declined approximately 1% on Monday following Kurdistan region of Iraq's resumption of crude oil exports through Turkey during the weekend. Additionally, OPEC+'s planned oil production increase for November contributed to the global supply expansion.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 5,687 crore on Friday, whilst domestic institutional investors purchased Rs 5843 crore.","This week has several data releases, with both local and international factors influencing market direction.

Government pressure mounts



Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus has reported another emergency call outage. This is the second time in 10 days that Optus suffered a major outage. As reported by Reuters, the latest incident occurred on Sunday morning in Dapto, about 100 km south of Sydney, affecting around 4,500 customers. The report also revealed that the Australian government is looking for answers about the disruption.As per the Reuters report, Optus revealed that a faulty mobile tower site interrupted services which included access to emergency numbers. The telecom service providers has confirmed that the issue has been resolved and that “all callers who attempted to contact emergency services are OK.”""Singtel takes this matter seriously and will extend full co-operation to the Australian government and authorities to address the Optus issue,” the spokesperson told Reuters.""Optus continues to investigate the cause ... the issue has been restored,"" a spokesperson said by email.The outage comes during the growing scrutiny of Optus, Australia’s second-largest telecom operator, owned by Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel).Following the earlier 13-hour disruption on September 18, which cut off emergency services in two states and the Northern Territory, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the failures “completely unacceptable.”Singtel Group CEO Yuen Kuan Moon is scheduled to meet with Australia’s Communications Minister Anika Wells this week, alongside Optus Chairman John Arthur and CEO Stephen Rue, to address the crisis.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking from New York, declined to say whether Rue should resign but indicated the government has ""action at its disposal"" pending investigation results.

California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has appointed Prof Mansi Manoj Kasliwal as director of Palomar Observatory, making her the first woman and the second PIO to lead the facility. Shrinivas Kulkarni (2006-18) was the first PIO to head the observatory, located atop Palomar Mountain in north San Diego, California.Palomar Observatory is home to three active research telescopes: the 5.1m Hale Telescope, the 1.2m Samuel Oschin Telescope, and the 1.5m telescope. Research there is conducted by a wide community of astronomers from Caltech and other domestic and international partner institutions.Kasliwal, a professor of astronomy at Caltech, is internationally recognised for her pioneering work on explosive cosmic events such as supernovae and colliding neutron stars. In 2022, she received New Horizons in Physics Prize for her leadership in electromagnetic follow-ups of cosmic phenomena.Born in Indore, Kasliwal moved to the US at 15. She earned her bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 2005 and completed her PhD in astronomy at Caltech in 2011.After postdoctoral research at Carnegie Observatories, she returned to Caltech, where she is now a tenured professor.The Kasliwal research group at Palomar Observatory focuses on discovering and characterising ""cosmic fireworks"" - brilliant flashes of light that reveal the lifecycle of stars and the synthesis of elements. ""Our primary discovery engines are two robotic, wide-field infrared and optical cameras at Palomar Observatory. We collaborate with astronomers worldwide to panchromatically characterise the discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum. We pursue a multi-messenger quest to identify electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events,"" Kasliwal's description on the Palomar Observatory website reads.Her research centres on transient astronomy, the study of rapidly changing cosmic phenomena. She leads Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) project, which coordinates a worldwide network of telescopes to capture fleeting cosmic events.Kasliwal also played a key role in designing Palomar Transient Factory and Zwicky Transient Facility, both of which have uncovered thousands of supernovae and other astronomical phenomena.Her contributions extend to multi-messenger astronomy, including crucial follow-up observations of gravitational waves detected by Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. She has also developed infrared-sensitive telescopes that reveal the chemistry and evolution of cosmic explosions.

The US energy department (EERE) has added “climate change,” “green,” and “decarbonization” to its expanding “list of words to avoid” within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.The listed terms are central to EERE’s mission, which serves as the government’s largest investor in technologies aimed at reducing heat-trapping emissions that contribute to climate change and curbing hazardous pollution from fossil fuels.“Please ensure that every member of your team is aware that this is the latest list of words to avoid — and continue to be conscientious about avoiding any terminology that you know to be misaligned with the Administration’s perspectives and priorities,” the directive, issued by acting director of external affairs Rachel Overbey, said, as cited by Politico.In addition to “climate change” and “green,” EERE has prohibited officials from using the term “emissions,” citing concerns that it implies a negative connotation. Other banned terms include “energy transition,” “sustainability” or “sustainable,” “‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ energy,” “carbon/CO2 footprint,” and “tax breaks,” “tax credits,” or “subsidies.”The guidelines reportedly apply to both internal and public communications, including documents such as federal funding requests for information, reports, and briefings.The new rules were introduced just days after US President Donald Trump criticized world leaders at the UN General Assembly for taking action on rising emissions.Trump dismissed global warming and climate change as a “hoax” aimed at weakening the West economically. “Carbon footprint…is a con job. If you don’t get away from the green scam your country is going to be ruined,” he told European nations, while praising Germany for shifting away from renewable energy and returning to fossil fuels, including what he called “big beautiful coal.”Energy secretary Chris Wright has also challenged climate science, promoting a report he commissioned that minimized the impact of rising emissions on worsening extreme weather events.Last week, Wright canceled $13 billion in funding for renewable energy projects and criticized wind and solar incentives, which are set to expire under the Republican legislation after more than three decades in place.“If you can’t rock on your own after 33 years, maybe that’s not a business that’s going places,” Wright said at a press conference, as reported by Politico.Climate change is driven by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, largely resulting from the burning of oil, coal, and natural gas for energy.","The US energy department has added ""climate change,"" ""green,"" and ""decarbonization"" to its ""list of words to avoid"" Other banned terms include ""energy transition,"" ""sustainability,"" ""clean"" or ""dirty"" energy, and ""carbon/CO2 footprint"" The guidelines reportedly apply to both internal and public communications.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124200289,imgsize-694970,width-400,resizemode-4/image-ap.jpg"
Yunus discusses SAARC revival with US envoy Gor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/yunus-discusses-saarc-revival-with-us-ambassador-designate-to-india-sergio-gor/articleshow/124078736.cms,"File photos





While it’s well known that Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived, he has now raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia.Yunus met Gor on the margins of the ongoing UNGA session in New York. According to Dhaka, the chief advisor noted that the interim government has intensified efforts to revive SAARC, which has not held a summit in over a decade.SAARC summits are held biennially but the process has remained stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. The Uri terrorist attack in 2016 put paid to the summit that Pakistan was scheduled to host that year and India has since maintained Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism has made unfeasible the SAARC dialogue, including summits and important meetings.However, India has continued to support SAARC activities in diverse sectors for closer cooperation and blamed Pakistan for blocking trade and connectivity initiatives in the region. While it hasn’t withdrawn from the Association, India has sought to strengthen regional cooperation through the BIMSTEC grouping in which Pakistan is not a member.The US readout said regional cooperation was discussed but didn’t specifically mention SAARC.Bangladesh didn’t say what Gor’s response was to Yunus’ remarks on SAARC but India will be wary of any external pressure to resume the summit process. The idea of Pakistan hosting even a virtual summit has been rendered a non-starter because of the Pahalgam terrorist attack that led to a dramatic military clash between India and Pakistan.India sees the appointment of Gor as ambassador by the Trump administration as a welcome development but will guard against any US attempt to intrude into South Asian affairs through Gor’s dual role, particularly if it has any security fallout for the region. India is already worried about security challenges that Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan might entail. It has shown little interest so far in Yunus’ efforts to, as he said earlier, revive the spirit of SAARC.While countries like Bangladesh and Nepal seek a resumption of the summit process, India maintains that there has been no material change in the situation since the 19th summit that Pakistan had to host was postponed and that there’s no consensus among members on the meeting.India closely followed a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral meeting at Kunming, taking note of reports that this was an effort to create a new bloc in the region, However, Dhaka later denied this was an effort to forge an alliance against any country.Yunus also discussed with Gor the Rohingya crisis, and the “proliferation of disinformation targeting Dhaka”. Yunus has in the past described as fake news some of the reports in Indian media about targeting of Hindus in Bangladesh .According to Dhaka, Yunus also expressed Bangladesh’s interest in joining ASEAN, stating that integration with Southeast Asian economies could significantly accelerate the country’s development. He told Gor Dhaka ismaking “comprehensive preparations” to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful general election in the first half of February.","Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived. Yunus has raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia. SAARC has not held a summit in over a decade.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124078743,imgsize-940257,width-400,resizemode-4/article-6.jpg"
UK to mandate digital IDs for workers to curb illegal migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-to-mandate-digital-ids-for-workers-to-curb-illegal-migration/articleshow/124169674.cms,"(This is a Reuters story)





LONDON: Britain on Friday said it would introduce a mandatory digital ID scheme for British citizens and residents starting a new job as a measure to deter illegal immigration.""It will make it tougher to work illegally, making our borders more secure,"" PM Keir Starmer said in a statement announcing the move, which had been previously reported. Polling shows immigration is top of voters' concerns in Britain, with Starmer under intense pressure to stop migrants entering the country illegally. The plans, which govt had previously said it was considering, drew criticism from opponents who say it would not deter migrants and could infringe on civil liberties.""It's laughable that those already breaking immigration law will suddenly comply, or digital IDs will have any impact on illegal work, which thrives on cash-in-hand payments,"" said a spokesperson for Nigel Farage's Reform UK Party, which leads opinion polls ahead of an election not due until 2029. Govt said the ID would be held on people's mobile phones and would become a mandatory part of checks that employers already have to make when hiring a worker by end of current parliament in 2029. It would, in time, also be used to provide access to other services.","Britain to introduce a mandatory digital ID scheme for British citizens and residents starting a new job.

What’s next?







UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents, aiming to curb illegal immigration and simplify access to government services, according to an official statement. .The government said the new digital ID, which will be stored on users’ smartphones, will streamline applications for services such as driving licences, childcare, welfare, and tax records. While individuals will not be required to carry or present the ID routinely, it will be “mandatory as a means of proving your right to work,” the statement added.Starmer explained the move will help prevent those without legal status from securing employment, thereby cutting off a key incentive for illegal migration. “This will stop those with no right to be here from being able to find work, curbing their prospect of earning money, one of the key 'pull factors' for people who come to the UK illegally,” the government said.Here is what you need to know about the government’s digital ID initiative:The new digital ID will be an app or digital credential stored on individuals’ smartphones. It will serve as a secure, government-backed proof of identity to access a range of services - from applying for driving licences and childcare benefits to accessing welfare and tax records.While the ID will not be compulsory to carry or show routinely, it will be mandatory to prove the right to work in the UK. This aims to prevent employers from hiring workers who lack legal permission to work, thereby reducing illegal employment.Starmer described the digital ID as an “enormous opportunity for the UK” and said it will provide “countless benefits” to ordinary citizens while helping the government enforce immigration laws more effectively.The digital ID will be available to all UK nationals and legal residents, including foreign nationals living in the country. The government emphasised inclusivity, pledging that the system will accommodate those without smartphones, such as the elderly or homeless.Details on the application process will be shaped by a forthcoming public consultation planned for later this year. The government has promised to engage with groups who might face challenges using digital services, ensuring the system is user-friendly and accessible to all.The UK has traditionally resisted introducing national ID cards, with the Conservative government scrapping a previous voluntary identity card system in 2011 established under Tony Blair’s administration. However, the current government views digital ID as a modern solution to immigration and public service access challenges.Illegal immigration remains a politically sensitive issue, and Starmer faces pressure from within his own Labour Party to address it effectively ahead of the party’s annual conference.Opposition voices have been critical. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said on social media that her party would “oppose any push… to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens,” stressing that British people should not be forced into such a system.The Liberal Democrats also rejected the plan, arguing they ""cannot support a mandatory digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives.""Nigel Farage, leader of the hard-right Reform UK party - which polls predict could play a key role in the next government - voiced strong opposition, saying, ""I do not see a single benefit to the government having digital ID other than them controlling what we do, what we spend and where we go.""At present, UK citizens rely on passports, driving licences, and utility bills as forms of identification, depending on the situation. The digital ID aims to unify these disparate proofs into a single, streamlined digital identity.The government will soon launch a public consultation to gather feedback on the digital ID service, including from digitally excluded groups. Officials highlighted that lessons will be drawn from other countries with similar systems to ensure accessibility and privacy protections.(With inputs from agencies)","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents.

TOI Correspondent from London:





Indian biker from Navi Mumbai Yogesh Alekari, whose Adventure motorbike was stolen in Nottingham while he was on a solo round-the-world trip, can now resume his global expedition after a UK motorbike dealer donated a 2020 KTM 790 Adventure to him.“It’s a more powerful bike. It’s overwhelming. British bikers have helped me beyond my imagination. I really appreciate that. This is the actual bikers’ brotherhood,” he said. But he is not sure if he will be able to take the new bike into India as he will have to pay 100% tariff on it. “I wouldn’t have needed to pay this if on then original bike. I request the Indian govt to waive the customs duty. When I reach Kenya I will decide what to do. ”Alekari (33), who runs a small travel company and is a part-time vlogger, was on his second round-the-world trip, covering 50 countries from India to Africa, and had crossed 17 countries on his KTM 390 Adventure motorbike when he was stranded in Britain on Aug 28. The bike and all his belongings were worth £15,000.He found his MacBook as it was thrown out and handed to police.“I was expecting things to go wrong in Africa, but it turned out to be in UK.London and the UK are not secure. I got tremendous support from the British people but still you can’t leave a bike 10 mins away in the UK. I met so many people who said their car had been stolen. UK is the best land for the biker community but police is not that active for theft scenario (sic),” he told TOI.After news of the theft was widely circulated, motorbike dealership The Off Road Centre in Mansfield gifted him an upgraded model not available in India and worth £5,000. It had one previous owner.Alekari said: “Police are cooperating with me now but it has been one month and they still have not recovered the bike. If this had happened in India, Mumbai police would have got it back within 24 hours.”Other businesses have also donated items to him, including camping gear, a Mosko Moto tank bag and tail bag, and a Leatt jacket and boots.The puja of the new motorbike took place at Bhagwati Shakti Peeth temple in Nottingham.He is now back in Mumbai getting new visas for his blank passport – which the Indian high commission in London issued – and a new international driving licence and new debit and credit cards. Then he will return to the UK to resume his journey to Ireland, Europe and Africa. He has 30 countries and 35,000 km to go.An 18-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle in Doncaster on Sept 8. He has since been released on police bail and no further arrests have taken place.Benjamin Ledwidge, managing director of Off Road Centre, said: “We have gifted the bike to him as his main worry was that it was a loan as there were quite a few countries he couldn’t cross if the bike was not in his name. This happened on our doorstep so we wanted to show him there was also good here and make him want to come back.”",Yogesh Alekari's Adventure motorbike was stolen in Nottingham while he was on a solo round-the-world trip.

Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive'

Global talent visa



MAGA chief’s $100,000 hike shakes H-1B dream







Britain is weighing plans to scrap visa fees for the world’s best scientists, academics and digital experts, reports Financial Times.The move is aimed at boosting growth and positioning the UK as a magnet for global talent.The debate comes just as the United States under Donald Trump has raised the fee for an H-1B visa to $100,000.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has set up a “global talent task force” to explore reforms, with officials in Number 10, the PM's office at Downing Street, and the Treasury discussing options to make it easier and cheaper for high-level professionals to settle in the country. One proposal is to abolish visa charges for people with exceptional achievements.“We’re talking about the sort of people who have attended the world’s top five universities or have won prestigious prizes,” one official was quoted as saying to the Financial Times. “We’re kicking around the idea of cutting costs to zero,"" they added.The task force is chaired by Starmer’s business adviser Varun Chandra and science minister Lord Patrick Vallance. The Home Office is not yet formally engaged in the talks, but officials said all immigration routes are kept under review.A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our global talent routes attract and retain high-skilled talent, particularly in science, research and technology, to maintain the UK’s status as a leading international hub for emerging talent and innovation.”The global talent visa was introduced in 2020, and costs £766 per applicant, with partners and children charged the same fee. An annual health surcharge of £1,035 applies to each person. The visa is aimed at people recognised as leaders or future leaders in science, engineering, medicine, humanities, digital technology, or arts and culture. In the year ending June 2023, the number of visas granted rose by 76 per cent to 3,901, reports Financial Times.Chancellor Rachel Reeves is also looking at the tax system to spot barriers that might stop highly skilled people from moving to Britain. Her recent changes to the non-dom tax regime (The non-dom tax system refers to the special tax status in UK for people who live in Britain but are officially considered “non-domiciled”) raised fears that many wealthy individuals would leave. She is now reviewing inheritance tax rules for non-doms before the autumn Budget.Universities have welcomed the review but urged more support. Jamie Arrowsmith, director of Universities UK International, said the government’s £50 million Global Talent Fund was “relatively modest” and added: “Ultimately to attract global talent we need to be able to offer funding and autonomy and make the transition as smooth as possible.”US President Donald Trump shocked the tech industry on Friday when he announced a massive rise in the cost of H-1B visas, hiking the fee to $100,000. The H-1B programme has long been the main route for skilled foreign workers, especially Indians, to take up jobs in America’s technology, research, and healthcare sectors. Indians make up more than 70% of H-1B holders, many of them working in Silicon Valley companies, hospitals, and universities.Immigration policy analyst Gil Guerra said the change is more likely to cause medium- and long-term labour shortages in the US. David Bier of the Cato Institute warned it would deal a “devastating blow” to American innovation and competitiveness.","UK PM Sir Keir Starmer has set up a ‘global talent task force’ to explore reforms.

EU Chief Kaja Kallas To India: Rethink Moscow Ties Or Risk Free Trade Agreement With European Union





The UK has carried out its first deportation under a new returns treaty with France, with home secretary Shabana Mehmood calling it an “important first step” in efforts to curb illegal English Channel crossings.“This is an important first step to securing our borders. It sends a message to people crossing in small boats: if you enter the UK illegally, we will seek to remove you,” Mehmood said Thursday. She added that the government would continue to challenge “last-minute, vexatious” attempts in court, and stressed that Britain would continue to provide refuge through “safe, legal and managed routes — not dangerous crossings. ”According to UK home office sources, the deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August. He was flown on a commercial flight to Paris under the “one-in, one-out” deal signed with France. Once returned, he will be offered a voluntary repatriation scheme to India; refusal would bar him from applying for asylum and could result in enforced removal.The pilot agreement, which began in August and will run until June 2026, allows the UK to deport migrants who arrive illegally while accepting an equal number from France through a new safe and legal asylum pathway, subject to strict eligibility and security checks.The first arrivals under this reciprocal route are expected in Britain in the coming days.Official data show that 2,715 Indian nationals were in UK immigration detention as of August — more than double last year’s figure, an increase of 108 per cent. The deported man is among the first group of migrants held by UK Border Force since the treaty came into force.According to the home office, more than 35,000 people with no right to remain were removed from the UK in the past year, with returns of foreign criminals up 14 per cent and asylum-related removals up 28 per cent.","The deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August.

Want to bring a dog to this Italian city? That'll be $1.75,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/want-to-bring-a-dog-to-this-italian-city-thatll-be-1-75/articleshow/124169606.cms,"Rembrandt copied another artist's dog for 'Night Watch'





Drivers in London, New York and other major cities are used to being charged for bringing cars into the city. Now one municipality may demand payment to bring dogs into town. A bill in Bolzano, Italy, would mean owners of dogs visiting the Tyrolean Alps would face a charge of roughly 1.50 euros ($1.75) per day, Italian media reported. Local dogs won't escape under the bill, which would come into force in 2026 if approved by the provincial council. Residents would be charged an estimated 100 euros per dog, per year, bringing back a dog tax abolished in 2008. These taxes would replace a policy in Bolzano that requires DNA testing for all dogs. The testing requirement, used to identify dogs that left waste behind, as well as those that were struck by cars or that attacked, had proved difficult to implement. Officials say the money raised from the dog taxes will go to street cleaning and building dog parks. Perhaps bidding for the doggy vote, mayor Claudio Corrarati said, ""We would be dogs to impose a tax on dogs."" Asked if such a tax were likely to go into effect, he said: ""In Bolzano, not. For sure. Come to Bolzano with your animals!"" To solve the dirty sidewalk problem, he suggested using neighborhood watches to ""thoroughly report those who disrespect their neighborhood"".It didn't exactly take dogged detective work for an art sleuth in Amsterdam to solve a canine conundrum dating back to the Dutch Golden Age. Anne Lenders, a curator at the city's landmark Rijksmuseum, said it was more or less by accident that she discovered that the barking dog in Rembrandt van Rijn's famous ""Night Watch"" is a near-identical copy of one that features in a 1619 pen and ink drawing by fellow Dutch artist Adriaen van de Venne. She was visiting an exhibition at the Zeeuws Museum in the southern Netherlands when her eye fell on a picture of a dog by Van de Venne. ""The resemblance is so strong that at the very first moment I thought he (Rembrandt) must have used this,"" she added. That's when the research started. ""The head turns in exact the same angle with the mouth slightly opened... Both dogs have long hair and ears that hang vertical,"" she said.","A bill in Bolzano, Italy, would mean owners of dogs visiting the Tyrolean Alps would face a charge of roughly 1.50 euros per day.
