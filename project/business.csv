NEW DELHI: Indian delegation has ramped up efforts for United Nations listing of Lashkar-e-Taiba front The Resistance Front (TRF), according to news agency PTI, which cited sources.A team from India met United Nations under-secretary-general Vladimir Voronkov of the office of counter-terrorism (UNOCT) and assistant secretary-general Natalia Gherman of the counter-terrorism committee executive directorate (CTED) to discuss strengthening counter-terrorism cooperation.The meeting comes amid deteriorating relations between India and Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack , for which 'The Resistance Front' (TRF) had claimed responsibility. TRF is a front for the UN-proscribed Pakistani terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba.On the visit of the Indian Technical Team at UN in New York, a spokesperson told ANI, the meeting revisited commitments made under the 2022 Delhi Declaration, which was adopted by the counter-terrorism committee under India's chairmanship.They also discussed the development of non-binding guiding principles, crafted with CTED's support, to address threats from unmanned aerial systems and the exploitation of new financial technologies by terrorist networks.Voronkov and Gherman extended their condolences to the delegation over the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam. The terrorist attack prompted a sharp military escalation in the region.In response to the Pahalgam incident, the Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The operation led to the deaths of over 100 terrorists affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and Hizbul Mujahideen (HM).Pakistan retaliated with cross-border shelling and attempted drone strikes along the Line of Control. In a countermeasure, India launched coordinated attacks damaging radar systems, communication hubs, and airbases within Pakistani territory.The meeting in New York highlighted ongoing multilateral efforts to implement UN security council counter-terrorism resolutions and the UN global counter-terrorism strategy. Key areas of collaboration between India and the UN bodies include cybersecurity, countering terrorist travel , aiding victims of terrorism, and disrupting terror financing mechanisms.",Indian delegation has ramped up efforts for United Nations listing of Lashkar-e- Taiba front The Resistance Front (TRF) The meeting comes amid deteriorating relations between India and Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack.

The President's 14 questions

Prez:

Deemed assent concept

alien to constitutional scheme

NEW DELHI: In a sharp response to the April 8 verdict of Supreme Court, fixing deadlines for the governor and the President to decide on state Bills in the Tamil Nadu govt versus governor case, President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday asked the apex court how it could have given such a ruling when the Constitution had no such stipulations.Aware that a petition seeking review of the 415-page judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan would not yield positive outcome as it is ought be considered by the same bench in chamber, the Union govt invoked the President’s rarely used powers under Article 143(1) of the Constitution to seek SC’s opinion on a myriad contentious issues thrown up by the judgment, which it considers to be a clear overreach. Specifically, the President sought SC’s view on 14 questions.The President said Articles 200 and 201, applicable to governors and President respectively, “does not stipulate any time frame or procedure” to be followed by them while considering grant or refusal of assent to a bill passed by an assembly.“The exercise of constitutional discretion by governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution, respectively, are essentially governed by polycentric considerations, including federalism, uniformity of laws, integrity and security of the nation, doctrine of separation of powers,” she said, adding that she resorted to Article 143(1) in seeking the SC’s opinion as the apex court has in the past delivered conflicting judgments on the justiciability of presidential assent to bills .Article 200 mandates the governor, on presentation of a bill passed by an assembly, to grant assent or “as soon as possible” return the bill, excluding Money bills, for reconsideration by the House. The provision also lays down that the governor “shall not withhold assent” when the bill, after having been reconsidered, is sent to him .However, when a governor reserves a bill for consideration of the President, she under Article 201 is mandated to declare whether she assents to the bill or withholds it. The Constitution, however, does not prescribe a timeframe for the President to take a particular action once the bill , after having been reconsidered by the assembly, is presented to her again for assent.Without any express provision in the Constitution, the bench of Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan had set a three-month deadline for the governor to either grant or return the bill to the House.If the bill is re-passed by the House and resent to him, then the governor must grant assent within a month, SC had ruled. It had also fixed a three-month deadline for the President to decide whether to grant or refuse assent to a bill.Critical of the SC using its Article 142 powers to rule that the 10 bills pending with the Tamil Nadu governor would be deemed to have been assented to, the President said, “The concept of a deemed assent of the President and the governor is alien to the constitutional scheme and fundamentally circumscribes the powers of the President and the governor”.The President also questioned the logic behind SC ruling that suggested that it would be better if the President seeks the opinion of the apex court in advance on whether to give assent to bills reserved for her by the governors.She said SC needs to give its opinion also contours and scope of provisions contained in Article 142 (which gives omnibus power to SC to do complete justice) “in the context of issues (assent to bills) which are occupied by either constitutional provisions or statutory provisions.In addition, she questioned the states increasingly using writ jurisdiction of the SC under Article 32 (which is meant for remedying violations of fundamental rights of citizens) instead of Article 131 (Centre-state dispute to be adjudicated only by the SC) to adjudicate issues “which by their nature are federal issues involving interpretation of the Constitution.”","President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday asked the apex court how it could have given such a ruling when the Constitution had no such stipulations. The President said Articles 200 and 201, applicable to governors and President respectively, “does not stipulate any time frame or procedure” to be followed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121172131,imgsize-672813,width-400,resizemode-4/murmu.jpg"

It’s time a performance audit of HC judges is done: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-time-a-performance-audit-of-hc-judges-is-done-supreme-court/articleshow/121171904.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: High court judges taking breaks “unnecessarily” and too often found a mention in Supreme Court bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh on Tuesday, which called for their performance audits.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said the top court was receiving several complaints against HC high court judges and it was a high time to assess the expenditure on them vis-a-vis their output.“There are some judges who work very hard but at the same time there are judges who are unnecessarily taking coffee breaks; this break or that break. We are hearing a lot of complaints about HC judges. This is a larger issue which needs to be looked into. What is the performance of HC judges? How much we are spending and what is the output? It’s high time we do a performance audit,” Justice Kant said.The remark came on a plea of four persons who had moved SC claiming Jharkhand HC had reserved its order on a criminal appeal against conviction and life sentence in 2022 but the judgment was not pronounced. Their counsel Fauzia Shakil said after SC’s nudge, HC on May 5 and 6 pronounced the verdicts, acquitting three of the four. The last case resulted in a split verdict and was referred to HC chief justice and the petitioner was granted bail.Shakil said that despite the verdicts, the acquitted persons were not released from jail and in the judgments, HC did not mention the date of reserving the orders.Taking exception, SC asked Jharkhand govt counsel to immediately release them before lunch break & posted the matter post 2pm. The counsel informed SC that the convicts were released. and it was due to the non-availability of release orders from the trial courts that delayed the process.The timeline prescribed earlier by this court for pronouncement of judgments will have to be adhered to along with mechanism which this court will propose, the bench said and directed the registry to collate data from HCs and posted the matter in July.",Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said the top court was receiving several complaints against HC high court judges.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump’s attempt to be a broker in the conflict between India and Pakistan has the spotlight on a deal the hostile neighbour recently negotiated with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture in which the president’s family has 60% stake.The deal was signed between WLF and the hastily-launched Pakistan Crypto Council , which early last month appointed as its adviser Changzpeng Zhao (CZ) — founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance — with the ambitious objective of making Islamabad South Asia’s crypto capital.Though the Crypto Council was barely a month old, WLF sent its heavy guns, including Zachary Witkoff, son of Trump’s golf buddy Steve, to Islamabad where they were feted by Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, and more crucially, army chief General Asim Munir, who just days later “cleared” the mass killing in Pahalgam of tourists who were segregated on the basis of their faith.WLF’s stakeholders include Trump’s two sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr, who, along with their brother-in law Jared Kushner, have been scouring different parts of the world for lucrative business deals and have attracted allegations of leveraging their links to the White House.Witkoff, who, like Trump, is a real estate billionaire focused on New York, is seen as the “man-to-go” in Washington DC. A regular at Mar a Lago, Trump’s golf resort in Florida, Witkoff attracted global attention when he got Israel and the UAE and Bahrain to sign Abraham Accords during the incumbent US President's first term. Trump has now tasked him with getting Russia and Ukraine to sign a peace deal.With the Trump suddenly pivoting away from his “it is for them to sort out” hands off stance towards the conflict between India and Pakistan and arrogating unto himself the role of firefighter, many seem to be wondering whether Pakistan's dramatic foray into crypto currency in partnership with WLF has already started paying dividends.","US President Donald Trump’s attempt to be a broker in the conflict between India and Pakistan has the spotlight on a deal the hostile neighbour recently negotiated with World Liberty Financial.

Normal train operation is on between Qazigund and Baramulla,” said an official.Earlier, the railways had carried out the trial run of special Vande Bharat trains between Katra and Srinagar, but never carried passengers in them.Wednesday’s successful trial run of the train with passengers also gains importance considering that it will be an additional connectivity to Kashmir and for faster movement of men and machineries.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday detailed how the Indian Air Force (IAF) bypassed Pakistan's China-supplied defence systems to destroy military targets in the country during Operation Sindoor . In a detailed statement, the government also confirmed that Pakistan's foiled attacks on Indian cities and military sites involved Chinese and Turkish-origin weapon systems, including PL-15 missiles and Bayraktar-style drones, all of which were successfully neutralised by Made-in-India defence technologies.The government's detailed press release mentioned that Operation Sindoor underscored not just the precision of India's military action but also its technological self-reliance, marking a milestone in the country’s defence doctrine.“Operation SINDOOR emerged as a calibrated military response to an evolving pattern of asymmetric warfare… India’s response was deliberate, precise, and strategic,” the statement read.By bypassing China-supplied defence systems, Indian fighter jets and loitering munitions struck key Pakistani military sites, including Noor Khan and Rahimyar Khan airbases, using indigenous platforms. According to the government statement, these strikes were completed in just 23 minutes.“Indian Air Force bypassed and jammed Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence systems, completing the mission in just 23 minutes, demonstrating India’s technological edge,” the government said.All strikes were executed without crossing the Line of Control or the international boundary, and no Indian assets were lost.Meanwhile, India’s multi-layered air defence successfully intercepted Pakistani attacks using a mix of legacy and modern indigenous systems:“These systems, built over the last decade with continuous government investment, proved to be force multipliers during the operation,” the statement said.Chinese missiles, Turkish drones recoveredThe government confirmed that wreckage from various foreign-supplied weapon systems used by Pakistan was recovered, including:These were deployed by Pakistan in cross-border attacks that targeted Indian military installations between May 7 and May 10.“Despite Pakistan's attempts to exploit advanced foreign-supplied weaponry, India’s indigenous air defence and electronic warfare networks remained superior,” the statement said.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) bypassed Pakistan's China-supplied defence systems to destroy military targets in the country during Operation Sindoor.

HYDERABAD: It's not just the country's western border that took heavy enemy fire during Operation Sindoor .

The attempt was to both embarrass India and also extract sensitive information about its defence systems, including its missiles, they said.According to Interpol trainer and cyber forensic expert Pendyala Krishna Shastry, the attacks were part of a broader campaign waged by Pakistani actors against Indian digital assets. These groups reportedly deployed malware, conducted phishing attacks, and launched denial-of-service operations targeting critical sectors such as finance, telecom, energy, and public services.Zone-H, a website that tracks defacements, reported incidents involving Indian govt domains.

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday asserted it circumvented Pakistan’s air defence (AD) systems of Chinese-origin to carry out the strikes against the nine terror hubs without crossing the border on May 7, and then thwarted multiple retaliatory missile and drone attacks using a robust indigenous AD network during intense hostilities last week.“The IAF bypassed and jammed Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence systems (like the HQ-9 missile batteries and radars), completing the mission in just 23 minutes on May 7, demonstrating India’s technological edge,” a new govt statement said.Despite Pakistan’s attempts to “exploit advanced foreign supplied weaponry”, ranging from Chinese-made PL-15 LR beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to Turkish-origin Byker Yiha kamikaze drones and Asisguard Songar drones, India’s AD and electronic warfare networks “remained superior”, it added.With PM Narendra Modi having drawn new red lines against Pakistan-backed terrorism, the Indian armed forces are currently on a hot standby, maintaining full operational readiness to foil any misadventure. “We are strictly adhering to the May 10 bilateral understanding to cease all cross-border military action. But Pak Army chief General Asim Munir can never be trusted,” a senior military officer told TOI.When military hostilities were fully underway for four days last week, the IAF’s fully-automated integrated air command and control system (IACCS) played a critical role during Operation Sindoor . It connects different radars to a wide array of AD weapon systems as well as the Army’s smaller Akashteer system to present a composite real-time air situation picture.The Army quickly deployed six mobile Akashteer nodes, which it had begun to induct just a few months ago under a Rs 1,982 crore inked with defence PSU Bharat Electronic (BEL) in March 2023, from J&K to Rajasthan, officials told TOI.“Ground-based defence systems integrated with Akashteer made it hell for Pakistan’s air adventures. The system performed beyond users' expectations, providing robust air defence to India during the current conflict,” BEL said in a post on `X’ on Wednesday.The major weapon systems plugged into the AD network included the long-range Russian S-400 `Triumf’ surface-to-air missile systems (380-km interception range), Barak-8 medium range SAM systems (70-km), jointly developed with Israel, and the indigenous Akash systems (25-km). Then, there were Pechora missiles, L-70 low-level anti-aircraft guns, shoulder-fired Igla-S missiles (6-km) and the integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (1-2 km).“This multi-tier defence prevented Pakistan Air Force’s attacks on our airfields and logistic installations during the night of May 9 and 10. It played a crucial role in ensuring that both civilian and military infrastructure across India remains largely unaffected during the enemy’s retaliation attempts,” the govt statement said. It added that at least 10 satellites also continuously worked round-the-clock, quoting ISRO chairman V Narayanan.Before the truce, India launched offensive actions with surgical precision against nine airbases in Pakistan and PoK as well as some radar sites, including the Nur Khan, Rahimyar Khan and Sargodha airbases, which included the use of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other stand-off weapons.“All these strikes were executed without loss of Indian assets, underscoring the effectiveness of our surveillance, planning and delivery systems. The use of modern indigenous technology, from long-range drones to guided munitions made these strikes highly effective and politically calibrated,” the statement said.Operation Sindoor is not just a story of tactical success, but also a validation of India’s defence indigenization policies. From air defence systems to drones, from counter-UAS capabilities to net-centric warfare platforms, indigenous technology has delivered where it mattered, it said.“Operation Sindoor emerged as a calibrated military response to an evolving pattern of asymmetric warfare, one that increasingly targets unarmed civilians along with military personnel. India is ready, armed with its own innovations, backed by a determined state, and powered by the ingenuity of its own people,” it added.","IAF bypassed and jammed Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence systems (like the HQ-9 missile batteries and radars), completing the mission in just 23 minutes on May 7. “We are strictly adhering to the May 10 bilateral understanding to cease all cross-border military action.

leading to GST credit facility misuse: HC

NEW DELHI: Flagging concerns over the misuse of a Central Goods and Services Tax Act provision, Delhi high court has fined a private firm for fraudulently claiming input tax credit (ITC) to escape paying full GST.“This court takes note, with some consternation, that such large-scale fraudulent availment of ITC may, if left unchecked, lead to severe damage to the GST framework itself,” HC said.The GST framework is meant to encourage legally entitled persons and businesses to avail of ITC and other similar facilities, said a bench of Justices Prathiba M Singh and Rajneesh Kumar Gupta in a recent order.HC noted Section 16 of CGST Act was being misused by companies and traders who first availed of the ITC by issuing fake invoices and, when slapped with a penalty by the department, rushed to court in writ jurisdiction.In essence, ITC allows a tax entity or person to claim credit & deduct from payable GST on purchase of goods and/or services used in the chain of business transaction, as it has been taxed earlier. However, court noted that due to fake invoices leading to fraudulent claims by persons, the facility is being misused, along with writ jurisdiction of the court.“This court... is exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution and when there is an allegation of such large-scale fraud, to the tune of more than Rs 56.2 crore, being committed with the involvement of a total of 527 firms including the petitioner firm, the court has to be circumspect in the exercise of its powers,” HC noted while imposing costs on the private entity after it emerged fake invoices were created to escape GST liability.",Delhi high court has fined a private firm for fraudulently claiming input tax credit (ITC) to escape paying full GST.

CJI Gavai will have to constitute a Constitution bench comprising a minimum of five judges to give its opinion to the President’s 14 queries.The oath administered in Hindi by the Prez at 10.05am was solemnly affirmed by Justice Gavai, departing from the general practice of swearing in in the name of God. Dhankar, LS Speaker Om Birla, defence minister Rajnath Singh, home minister Amit Shah and other Union ministers, along with ex-CJIs including Justice Sanjiv Khanna and judges of SC and HCs, were present.Justice Gavai is the first Buddhist and second Dalit to become CJI, the first being Justice K G Balakrishnan. The second Dalit President Ramnath Kovind, the first being K R Narayanan, was present at Justice Gavai’s oath ceremony .When he took oath, President Murmu was to his right, a fifth century statue of Buddha in Abhay mudra was behind and a grand portrait of Mahatma Gandhi adorned the high wall on his left at Ganatantra Mandap, earlier known as Durbar Hall and as Throne Room during British reign.After being sworn in as 52nd CJI, Justice Gavai touched the feet of his octogenarian mother Kamaltai, who flew in from Amravati and was seated on the front row, to seek her blessings. She was instrumental in shifting Bhushan from a Marathi medium to an English medium school to ensure he did not lag behind siblings studying in a convent school in Mumbai.From Rashtrapati Bhavan, the CJI reached SC and went straight to Dr BR Ambedkar’s statue to pay floral tributes. He also paid tributes at the statue of Mahatma Gandhi. “The first day went well,” Justice Gavai told TOI. A contingent of nearly 400 lawyers from Maharashtra had arrived to felicitate him. Unprecedentedly, there were judges from across HCs who attended his swearing in.","Justice Bhushan Ramakrishna Gavai is the 52nd Chief Justice of India (CJI) He is the first Buddhist and second Dalit to become CJI, the first being Justice K G Balakrishnan.

3.3 lakh Indian tourists visited Turkiye in 2024, spent an estimated $350-400m

NEW DELHI: Indian interest in Türkiye and Azerbaijan is rapidly losing altitude after both nations openly supported Pakistan during Operation Sindoor. The backlash is most visible in tourism, with widespread cancellations and a halt in new bookings.Türkiye’s military support to Pakistan, including drone supplies used during recent attacks on Indian border regions, has sparked a wave of anger. Indian travel agencies and platforms are now grounding promotions and advising customers to avoid both destinations.“Enough is enough! Blood and bookings won’t flow together,” wrote ixigo co-founder Aloke Bajpai on X, announcing a suspension of all flights and hotel reservations to Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and China.Other platforms, including India’s largest online travel agency MakeMyTrip, have stopped short of bans but issued strong advisories discouraging non-essential travel.Bookings for Turkiye and Azerbaijan have dropped 60%, and cancellations jumped by 250% in just one week,” a MakeMyTrip spokesperson said Wednesday.Travel agents across major metros reported that public outrage is translating into decisive action. “There’s a growing perception that Indian money spent on tourism could be fuelling hostile actions against us,” said a Mumbai-based agent.RPG Group chairperson Harsh Goenka weighed in online. “Indians gave over Rs 4,000 crore last year to Turkiye and Azerbaijan through tourism... Today, both stand with Pakistan after Pahalgam. Plenty of beautiful places in India and the world. Please skip these two places.”Indian outbound travel to both countries had surged before tensions escalated. Turkiye saw nearly 3.3 lakh Indian tourists in 2024, a 21% jump from the previous year. Azerbaijan welcomed 2.4 lakh Indians — more than double its 2023 figure. Direct connectivity by airlines like IndiGo played a role in boosting interest.But fallout has been swift. EaseMyTrip estimates Indian tourists spent $350-400 million in Turkiye last year alone, with average spending per person ranging between $1,200-1,500. That flow has slowed dramatically.Travel industry groups like Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) and Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI) have stopped promoting both destinations. Refunds are being processed, with select airlines cooperating, said TAAI’s south region chairperson Devaki Thyagarajan.Digital visa platform Atlys confirmed a steep drop in Azerbaijan-bound applications, despite the country’s growing popularity as a budget-friendly alternative to Europe. “People wanted something new beyond Singapore or Thailand. Azerbaijan offered a European feel at a fraction of the price,” said Sejoe Jose of Indian Association of Tour Operators. “That interest has disappeared.”Kolkata has seen Turkiye-bound travellers fall from 200 a day to under 50. Azerbaijan’s daily footfall has dropped to single digits, said TAAI east chairman Anjani Dhanuka. MakeMyTrip and EaseMyTrip data show a 30% spike in Azerbaijan cancellations and a 22% increase for Turkiye.Agents now suggest similarly priced destinations. For couples who once chose Turkiye, where a weeklong trip cost Rs 3-4 lakh, alternatives include Russia, Hungary, Czech Republic or Germany. Azerbaijan’s budget travellers are being redirected to Vietnam, Singapore, Bali or Dubai.","Türkiye’s military support to Pakistan, including drone supplies used during recent attacks on Indian border regions, has sparked a wave of anger.

The might of BrahMos

The Akash Shield

How D4 disabled enemy drones

Indo-Israeli collaborations

Import dependence

As the dust settles after Operation Sindoor, directed against Pakistan and terror actors on its soil, what is becoming clear is the resounding success of India’s nascent defence industry.It is believed India used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other precision-strike weapons to inflict damage to terror bases and military installations deep inside Pakistan. Indian armed forces also deployed indigenous Akash air defence missiles and D4 anti-drone systems to repel wave after wave of Pakistani aerial strikes, letting very little pass through.“During this operation, the credibility of our Made-in-India weapons was firmly established. The world now recognises that the time for Made-in-India defence equipment in 21st-century warfare has arrived,” PM Narendra Modi said on May 12 in his address to the nation after Operation Sindoor’s success.For the past several years, the govt has been pushing to maximise acquisition of defence equipment through indigenous sources and promote domestic manufacturing to reduce dependence on foreign-origin weapons as part of its flagship ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ programme. Parallelly, India’s defence exports reached a record high of Rs 23,622 crore in 2024-25, a 12% surge over the previous year.BrahMos (the name represents two rivers: the Indian Brahmaputra and Moskva of Russia) flies at a speed of Mach 2.8, or almost three times the speed of sound, and is considered to be one of the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missiles.It is produced by BrahMos Aerospace Pvt Ltd, a Delhi-based joint venture between Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia’s NPO Mashinostroyeniya or NPOM.BrahMos can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft, or land platforms. India has successfully tested all variants of BrahMos and inducted the missile system into its military years ago.In 2019, the range of this home-grown missile was enhanced up to 450km with a top official then saying, “India is now the only country in the world to integrate long-range missiles into fighter jets [Sukhoi 30]”.India recently exported these missiles to the Philippines as part of a $375 million deal signed in 2022.Efforts are also on to develop a hypersonic version of the missile, tentatively named BrahMos-II. According to the memorandum of understanding (MoU) between New Delhi and Moscow, BrahMos-II will be based on a hypersonic scramjet technology. The main purpose of such a weapon is to target deeply buried enemy nuclear bunkers and heavily protected locations; all three military services will utilise this weapon.Referring to the new BrahMos integration and testing facility that was inaugurated in Lucknow last week, former DRDO chief G Satheesh Reddy said it is capable of delivering 100-150 missiles annually. India has two more BrahMos production facilities — in Hyderabad and Thiruvananthapuram.Developed by DRDO and manufactured by state-run Bharat Dynamics Ltd (BDL), Akash is a short-range surface-to-air missile (SAM). It is part of India’s multi-layered air defence system, which played a decisive role in thwarting Pakistani aerial incursions into India recently.Akash is probably the first-of-its-kind system in the world that is capable of engaging four aerial targets simultaneously at a range of 25km. The new variant — Akash-NG — has an extended range of 70-80km.The missile is equipped with electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM) capabilities, enabling it to penetrate enemy jamming and other evasion tactics.The Akash system is designed for mobile platforms, making it highly agile and capable of rapid deployment anywhere.While some analysts have likened India’s Akash with Israel’s famous Iron Dome missile system, there are some fundamental distinctions between the two.First, Akash is a larger platform than the Israeli one. Also, while the Iron Dome is a potent shield against short-range rockets and artillery shells, Akash is capable of intercepting missiles, combat drones as well as aircraft.India reportedly signed a deal with Armenia in 2022 to export 15 units of the Akash missile systems. Brazil and Egypt have also shown interest in this weapon.India resorted to both kinetic and non-kinetic (jamming) warfare to thwart Pakistani drone swarms. Reports suggest the DRDO-developed D-4 anti-drone system was used in the recent military operations. It can disable ordinary drones as well as unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) employing electronic jamming and spoofing techniques.D4 (Drone-Detect, Deter and Destroy) also has a laser-based kill mechanism to destroy enemy drones. It’s unclear if this hard-kill method was used in the recent conflict.This system integrates radars, RF (radio frequency) sensors, and EO/IR (electro-optical/infrared) cameras, thereby offering a multi-sensor and 360-degree approach to detect incoming drones.Multiple DRDO labs, including the Electronics & Radar Development Establishment (LRDE), Bengaluru; Defence Electronics Research Laboratory (DLRL), and the Centre for High Energy Systems and Sciences (CHESS), both in Hyderabad; and Instruments Research and Development Establishment (IRDE), Dehradun, contributed towards developing this system.Weapons jointly developed with Israel such as Barak-8 missiles and SkyStriker kamikaze drones also contributed significantly to India’s defensive and offensive actions during Operation Sindoor.Barak-8 is a medium range surface-to-air missile (MRSAM) jointly developed by DRDO and Israel Aerospace Industries. India’s military last month conducted successful tests of this air defence system.The MRSAM includes mobile launchers that can be deployed on land or on navy vessels. The missile is capable of intercepting targets of up to 70km range.In India, it is produced by BDL, Kalyani Rafael Advanced Systems (KRAS) and Tata Advanced Systems (TASL).SkyStriker is a loitering munition jointly developed by Israel’s Elbit Systems and Adani Group’s Alpha Design Technologies. Although a drone, SkyStriker can be used as a precision weapon. It hovers over the target area to identify and engage threats, operating either autonomously or under human supervision.While India did demonstrate the effectiveness of its Made-in-India weapons, it still remains heavily dependent on arms imports. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), India is the second-largest arms buyer in the world, with an 8.3% share of global imports between 2020 and 2024.Russia remains India’s main weapons supplier, accounting for 36% of its arms imports. Russia’s overall share, however, has been steadily declining (72% in 2010-14 and 55% in 2015-19) with India increasingly turning to countries like France, Israel and the US.","India used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other precision-strike weapons to inflict damage to terror bases and military installations deep inside Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: From naming ' Operation Sindoor ' to deploying women officers to present India's perspective to the world and dedicating the success of the Indian armed forces in destroying terror hubs in Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has kept women at the centre of India's retaliation against the hostile neighbour.Calling the Pahalgam terror attack a personal tragedy, PM Modi on Monday had dedicated the bravery and courage of the armed forces involved in 'Operation Sindoor' to every mother, sister and daughter of the nation.PM Modi said the barbarity displayed by terrorists in Pahalgam had shocked the entire country and the world.Stating that more than 100 dreaded terrorists were killed in the strikes by India, PM Modi said not only were the buildings of terrorist organisations destroyed, but their courage was also badly shaken. ""The terrorists had wiped out the sindoor of our sisters, and India responded by destroying their terrorist headquarters,"" he said.Sindoor, or vermilion, is a symbol of marriage in Hindu custom. The word derives from the Sanskrit word Sindura, referring to red, orange-red or maroon cosmetic powder worn by married Hindu women in the parting of their hair. Sources said naming the operation after vermilion was suggested by PM himself, who wanted a strong message to be sent to the terrorists about the consequences of hurting Indian women.Since the operation was launched, several parents have named their newborn baby girls 'Sindoor' in many parts of the country, with such reports emerging from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.Also read: 17 newborns named ‘Sindoor’ in UP’s Kushinagar Details of the retaliatory attacks on Pakistan were given to the world by two women officers - Col Sofia Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh.

NEW DELHI: Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah moved Supreme Court on Thursday after the Madhya Pradesh high court took suo motu cognisance of his remarks against Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, a senior Indian Army officer who was among the public faces of Operation Sindoor briefing.The Indore bench of the high court, in a strongly worded order on Wednesday, directed the state DGP to immediately register an FIR against Shah under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), warning that failure to comply would result in contempt proceedings.The FIR is to be filed under BNS Sections 152 (acts endangering sovereignty, unity and integrity of India), 196(1)(b) (promoting enmity on grounds of religion) and 197(a)(c) (outraging modesty or character of a woman through speech), with immediate effect.A division bench of Justices Atul Sreedharan and Anuradha Shukla noted that Shah’s comments were made at a public event in Raikunda village, Mhow, on Monday and were directed against Col Qureshi through “a nauseating remark” delivered “by way of an innuendo which can refer to none other than her alone.”“This court has been compelled to take up this matter suo motu on account of an incident published in various newspapers and digital media networks that has taken place at a public function at village Raikunda in Ambedkar Nagar, at Mhow, on Monday.A sitting minister of Madhya Pradesh govt, whose name is Vijay Shah, has used scurrilous language against a senior official of the Indian Army,” the bench said.The judges underlined the significance of the armed forces, calling them “perhaps the last institution existing in this country” that continues to represent “integrity, industry, discipline, sacrifice, selflessness, character, honour and indomitable courage” with which citizens can identify.“India’s armed forces have been targeted by Vijay Shah who has used the language of the gutters,” the court said, observing that the content of Shah’s speech was not ambiguous. “There are newspaper reports and a plethora of digital material on the internet in which the minister’s speech is clear and unequivocal… His comments are disparaging and dangerous not just to the officer in question but to the armed forces itself. ”The bench said Shah’s words “encourage feelings of separatist activities… which endanger the sovereignty or unity and integrity of India”, thus satisfying the requirements under BNS Sec 152. It further said that Section 196(1)(b) would also apply, as “Col Qureshi is an adherent of Muslim faith.”Shah’s plea before the Supreme Court, challenging the high court’s direction, is expected to be taken up urgently.","Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah moved Supreme Court on Thursday.

Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa expressed concerns that the company may need to increase the price of the upcoming Switch 2 console in the United States due to recently implemented tariffs on Chinese imports.

The company expects these trade measures to impact profits by ""tens of billions of yen.""Furukawa highlighted broader economic concerns beyond direct manufacturing costs. ""If prices of daily necessities like food increase (because of the tariffs), then people will have less money to spend on game consoles.

WWE's strategic partnership with Netflix continues to yield a positive response as it is ruling Netflix's global rankings. In a major move earlier this year, WWE has partnered with Netflix to bring its flagship programming to the streaming giant from April 1, 2025.This deal ensured that fans across India and globally get an immersive and seamless viewing experience and non-stop action 52 weeks a year. The partnership blended entertainment and high-octane live sports, offering fans a seamless and engaging platform to watch their favorite WWE superstars in action.However, it has come to light that both ""Monday Night Raw"" and the recent "" Backlash 2025 "" event have secured prominent positions in the streaming platform's global rankings. Here are more details of Netflix’s global rankings of WWE RAW , and the recently held WWE Backlash.WWE Raw and Backlash 2025 have topped the Netflix global rankings this time.

Telangana Monsoon Expected Early This Year Due to Changing Weather Patterns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/monsoon-to-arrive-early-in-telangana-thanks-to-changing-weather-patterns/articleshow/121170315.cms,"



Hyderabad: The monsoon is expected to hit the state earlier than usual this year, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting its arrival around June 4 or 5, nearly a week ahead of the typical onset date of June 8 to 10.""This shift comes as part of a larger pattern, with the southwest monsoon likely to hit Kerala by May 27, five to six days in advance,"" said A Sravani, a scientist with the IMD.Weather experts attribute this early onset to stronger-than-usual cross-equatorial flow and increased moisture transport from the Bay of Bengal. ""Usually, the monsoon's journey begins over the South Andaman Sea by May 15, and it moves toward Sri Lanka around May 22, reaching the Myanmar coast by May 26. From there, it sweeps into Kerala around June 1; however, this time it has been preponed,"" said AVM Sharma, a meteorologist with Skymet, an independent weather forecast agency.According to him, the last time such early onset was recorded was in 2009, when rain reached Kerala on May 23 and before June end, it covered this region.This year, the state witnessed uncharacteristic weather patterns. May, typically the hottest month with maximum temperatures crossing 45°C, remained relatively cool.Some days even recorded temperatures below 40°C, thanks to frequent and widespread rainfall.""It is caused by a combination of opposing weather systems—moisture-laden southwesterlies from the Bay of Bengal clashing with dry northwesterly winds. This creates instability in the atmosphere, leading to intermittent rainfall and suppressed temperatures,"" said YV Rama Rao from Telangana Development Planning Society.Urban factors are also amplifying these effects. Rapid urbanisation, rising emissions, and the urban heat island effect are interacting with broader climatic shifts to create unpredictable patterns. Equally concerning is the loss of forest cover in the state. Data shows that Telangana's recorded forest area (RFA) saw a decline from 18,561.98 sq km in 2021 to 18,456.11 sq km in 2023. While this may appear minimal at first glance, environmentalists warn that even small losses in green cover—especially around urban and semi-urban areas—can have outsized impacts on local temperature regulation.""Urbanisation, particularly in and around cities like Hyderabad, is accelerating this trend. Over-concretisation leads to the creation of heat islands, where built-up areas absorb and re-emit the sun's heat more than natural landscapes. As a result, cities are heating up faster and retaining that heat for longer durations, with minimal night-time cooling,"" said Narsimha Reddy Donthi, an environmentalist.""From May 16 onwards, temperatures are expected to rise again as dry heat from the northwest returns. However, with rain systems gaining strength in the Bay of Bengal, relief may not be far behind,"" Rao added.",The monsoon is expected to hit the state earlier than usual this year. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicts its arrival around June 4 or 5. This is nearly a week ahead of the typical onset date of June 8 to 10.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday said that no one can halt the development momentum of the state, asserting that the Mahayuti government is working at full speed across sectors. Speaking to reporters at Kashigaon—around 20km from Thane—Fadnavis said the Kashigaon-Dahisar metro line , part of the larger Mumbai Metro expansion, is in its final stages of technical testing and will soon be operational.The line, once opened, is expected to significantly ease congestion on the Western Express Highway and bring much-needed relief to daily commuters.Responding to questions about the ruling coalition, Fadnavis said, “All three parties are together and we are running the state’s development express in a speedy manner. No one can put a speed-breaker in it. If they (opposition) want to give a booster, it is a different thing. There is no room for a speed-breaker here.”Calling the metro system the “best medium” for urban transport, he said the upcoming launch of this phase will add to the metro lines already connecting parts of Mumbai like Andheri. The objective is to create “seamless connectivity” along the Western Express Highway, from NS Bose Maidan to Bandra, with phased development currently underway.Highlighting a major feature of the project, the CM said, “The good thing about this project is that for the first time in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), a double-decker bridge is being built.This innovative design will help decongest critical stretches such as Mira Bhayandar.”He further announced future plans, including metro connectivity extending up to Virar, and emphasised the need for better integration across metro lines to provide end-to-end commuting solutions.Commending the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for its role in driving the project, Fadnavis said the government is now aiming to accelerate the pace of construction. “Henceforth, we will work with extra speed. This year, 50 kilometres and next year, 62 kilometres—we have decided to carry out works in such phases,” he added.Fadnavis reiterated the government's commitment to completing the metro network that began in 2015. “The major network which we started will be completed by the end of 2027. This is our aim, due to which people in Mumbai and the MMR will be most benefited for travel,” he said.He also confirmed that a bullet train station is coming up near Vadhvan in Palghar, and integration planning for that is in progress.Deputy chief ministers Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, along with transport minister Pratap Sarnaik, were present at the event.",Devendra Fadnavis said the Kashigaon-Dahisar metro line is in its final stages of technical testing and will soon be operational.

AICTE-relaxed norms reason for CS seat surge





BENGALURU: Karnataka is considering a freeze on the increase of computer science (CS) seats in engineering colleges across the state.Higher education minister MC Sudhakar said the move is being weighed in the light of recent developments in Telangana, where a similar restriction has been upheld by the high court.Telangana high court recently dismissed a batch of writ petitions filed by private engineering colleges that had challenged the govt’s decision to reject proposals for increased CS intake for 2024–25 academic year. The court upheld the state’s authority to regulate engineering education.“Several colleges (in Karnataka) are indiscriminately increasing computer science seats, often by converting civil and mechanical engineering seats — streams that are seeing reduced demand — into CS seats,” the minister said.“If this trend continues, we’ll have lakhs of engineering graduates from CS and related disciplines. Should the industry face a downturn, most of them could be left unemployed. We have to prevent that outcome or risk being blamed for our inaction,” the minister added.The number of CET seats in computer science and related programmes stood at around 24,000 in 2021-22 and rose to approximately 39,500 last year.In total, there were 79,907 CET seats across all disciplines last year. The seat matrix for 2025–26 is yet to be announced.This surge in CS seats has been attributed to relaxed norms from national regulatory body AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education). Colleges have been allowed to start or expand CS programmes with relative ease, including by converting seats from other disciplines. “We’re closely observing developments in Telangana. We’re reviewing the court judgment and the background before making a final call,” Sudhakar added.Last year, Karnataka wrote to AICTE requesting a cap on the increase in CS seats. However, the request was declined.“AICTE gave colleges two options — increase seats by meeting infrastructure and faculty norms or reallocate seats from other streams,” explained a Bengalurubased engineering college principal.“Riding the wave of demand for CS courses, colleges rushed to convert seats. Some autonomous colleges now have up to 1,000 seats in CS and allied fields. But with placements seeing a downturn this year, many institutions have decided not to expand further. Colleges are struggling to place students, and fear this could impact admissions as well,” he said.","Karnataka is considering a freeze on the increase of computer science seats in engineering colleges across the state.

Liberty Media chief sheds light on Formula 1’s battle to win American viewers and secure better TV deals



When Liberty Media took the reins of Formula 1 in 2017, it kickstarted a new era for the sport—one that embraced storytelling, social media, and global expansion like never before. Fast-forward to 2025, and the picture is evolving. The U.S. market, once viewed as a cornerstone of F1’s future, is no longer being treated as the primary growth engine. Instead, Liberty Media is starting to look beyond American borders, signalling a possible pivot to untapped international opportunities.Newly appointed Liberty Media CEO Derek Chang made this shift clear during his remarks at the J.P. Morgan Global Technology, Media, and Communications Conference. “In the US, we [F1] are not a major player, but globally, we are,” he stated bluntly. This candid admission reveals a sobering reality: despite the surge in American F1 interest driven by Netflix’s Drive to Survive, Formula 1 still sits on the periphery of mainstream U.S. sports culture.The Vegas experiment has been a wake-up call. Liberty Media’s direct involvement in organising and promoting the Las Vegas Grand Prix was seen as a major commitment to the U.S. market. But year-over-year enthusiasm has dimmed. “The fall-off from the first year to the second year was a bit more dramatic than anticipated,” Chang admitted. Still, he remains “cautiously optimistic,” noting improved ticket movement this season, a signal that lessons have been learned and adjustments made.Yet, the American media landscape is proving to be another tough nut to crack. ESPN currently holds F1 broadcasting rights through 2025, but their future involvement remains uncertain. Formula 1 is reportedly eyeing a $180 million per year deal from 2026, yet heavyweights like NBC have already bowed out of the race for rights, while ESPN may not see the value at such a price point. Chang, however, isn’t just looking for the biggest check—he wants a media partner who can embed F1 deeper into American culture.“We’re obviously looking for a partner that can help us continue to grow the fan base,” Chang said. He emphasized that Formula 1, compared to leagues like the NFL, NBA, and MLB, still has “a lot of headroom” in the U.S. “It’s up to us to go out and capitalize on that.”Interestingly, Chang isn’t fixated on traditional media deals. In his view, F1 is no longer merely a racing series—it’s a content-rich, cultural phenomenon. In the age of streaming, where digital platforms hunger for compelling content, the sport has become more about lifestyle, drama, and cinematic appeal. This cultural momentum is set to get another boost with the upcoming Brad Pitt-led F1 film, which hits theatres June 25. “I think this is a pretty significant moment in terms of the amount of investment and promotion that Apple and Warner Bros are putting into a project like this,” said Chang, expressing optimism for its impact.Globally, Chang sees brighter prospects. Markets like China and India are now on Liberty Media’s radar. “You look at a market like China where we’ve actually had a race, and we probably haven’t probably not invested what we should,” he noted. India, with its deep love for entertainment and sports, is another frontier with immense potential. “Can we break through in a way?” Chang asked, drawing parallels between F1’s glitzy appeal and Bollywood or the IPL.What emerges from Chang’s vision is not a retreat from the U.S., but a recalibration. The goal is no longer solely to “Americanize” Formula 1, but to globalise it with tailored strategies for each region. The sport may never rival American football stateside, but worldwide, it’s gearing up to tap into the next billion fans.In many ways, Liberty Media is back at the drawing board—armed with data, experience, and now, the humility to accept that not every market responds the same way. But for a brand as visually thrilling and globally revered as Formula 1, the track ahead is still filled with opportunity.Also Read: F1 drivers get more freedom of speech as FIA eases swearing penalties after backlash from fans and teams","Liberty Media CEO Derek Chang says the U.S. market is no longer the primary growth engine for F1.

Muslim man allowed to have multiple wives if he can treat them equally: Allahabad HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/muslim-man-allowed-to-have-multiple-wives-if-he-can-treat-them-equally-allahabad-hc/articleshow/121176497.cms,"Representative photo (Generative AI)





NEW DELHI: The Allahabad high court recently ruled that a Muslim man is entitled to marry more than once, provided he treats all his wives equally.A single bench of Justice Arun Kumar Singh Deswal made the observation while hearing a petition related to charges against a man named Furkan in Moradabad.The court noted that polygamy is permitted under the Quran “for a valid reason” but is often “misused” by men for “selfish reasons,” a report by Bar & Bench website said.“This Court would further like to observe that Article 25 of the Constitution of India gives religious freedom to profess, practice and propagate, which also includes external overt acts of individual as per his religious faith, but this right is subject to public order, morality and health and other provisions of Part-III of the Constitution. Therefore, religious liberty under Article 25 is not unfettered and can be regulated by the State,” the judgment said, as per the Bar & Bench report.The bench explained that polygamy was allowed historically to protect widows and orphans in the early Islamic community.“There was a time in history when a large number of women were widowed, and children were orphaned in primitive tribal tussles in Arabs. The Muslims suffered heavy casualties in defending the nascent Islamic community in Medina.It was under such circumstances that the Quran allowed conditional polygamy to protect orphans and their mothers from exploitation,” it said.The case relates to a 2020 complaint by a woman who accused Furkan of marrying her without disclosing he had another wife. She also alleged rape during the marriage. Police issued summons to Furkan and two others.The case began after a woman said Furkan did not tell her he was already married when they wed. Furkan’s lawyer argued that Muslim law allows a man to marry up to four wives.The court ruled that the charges of bigamy and rape did not apply, as the marriage was valid. It said the matter needed further examination and issued a notice to the complainant.Meanwhile, the police were ordered not to take any coercive action against Furkan or the other accused. Furkan was represented by advocates Alok Kumar Pandey, Prashant Kumar, and Susheel Kumar Pandey.",The Allahabad high court recently ruled that a Muslim man is entitled to marry more than once.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.
