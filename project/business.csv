BENGALURU: Indian spacetech firm Dhruva Space is set to launch its first commercial satellite mission, LEAP-1, in the third quarter of 2025 aboard SpaceX’s Falcon 9.Confirming the development Monday, the firm said the mission brings together payloads from Australian firms Akula Tech and Esper Satellites, hosted on Dhruva’s indigenously developed P-30 satellite platform. It marks the Hyderabad-based company’s transition from technology demonstrator to full-fledged commercial player in the global Space market.“LEAP-1 mission will carry two payloads: Akula Tech’s Nexus-01, an artificial intelligence module for on-orbit data processing and re-training, and Esper Satellites’ OTR-2, a hyperspectral imaging system. Both are designed to support applications in defence, disaster response, agriculture, and environmental monitoring,” Dhruva said.Following its successful in-orbit qualification of the P-30 bus during the LEAP-TD mission on Isro’s PSLV-C58 in Jan 2024, Dhruva Space now expands into commercial operations. The mission will also include Ground Station-as-a-Service and real-time operations via the firm’s Integrated Space Operations & Command Suite (ISOCS).“This is a major milestone for us and for Indo-Australian collaboration in Space,” said Sanjay Nekkanti, CEO and Co-founder of Dhruva Space.“We are seeing increasing global traction from partners in Europe and Asia, and missions like LEAP-1 prove that affordable, scalable satellite solutions can come from India.”Akula Tech’s AI system aims to place autonomous, adaptive intelligence directly in orbit. “This launch will give flight heritage to five of our AI software products. It will allow AI/ML models to retrain onboard and provide real-time insights, effectively putting a geospatial analyst in Space,” Nishq Ravindranath, Chief AI Officer, said.Esper Satellites, launching its fourth mission, sees this as validation of its low-cost approach. “We’ve delivered an entire campaign for under $1 million,” said Co-founder Shoaib Iqbal. “That’s cutting-edge Earth Observation at a fraction of traditional costs.”Dhruva said that the LEAP-1 patch, revealed alongside the announcement, symbolises the strategic triad of India, Australia, and the United States—reflecting a broader shift in commercial Space collaboration.Dhruva Space, crediting early support from Isro, IN-SPACe, and the Australian Space Agency, whose engagement in 2022 helped build a long-term commercial bridge, said: “With interest now coming from firms in Italy and France, the LEAP programme is growing into a recurring platform for hosted payload missions. LEAP-1 is not just a technological deployment, it signals Dhruva’s entry into global Space services at scale. ”","Indian spacetech firm Dhruva Space is set to launch its first commercial satellite mission, LEAP-1, in the third quarter of 2025 aboard SpaceX’s Falcon 9.

These top 10 richest billionaires not only hold staggering personal fortunes but also shape the global economy with their innovative ideas and strategic ventures. According to Forbes, nine out of these ten billionaires are American, showcasing the dominance of the US in wealth creation, while Bernard Arnault represents Europe’s luxury empire. From Elon Musk’s space ambitions to Jeff Bezos’s e-commerce revolution and Warren Buffett’s legendary investing style, their wealth-building stories are remarkable examples of vision, execution, philanthropy, and global impact. They influence policies, drive innovation, create jobs, and set trends in markets worldwide. Check the full updated list of the world’s top 10 billionaires influencing markets, industries, and future innovations.Elon Musk stands as the world’s richest individual, owing his fortune to groundbreaking ventures in electric vehicles, space exploration, and artificial intelligence. He holds about 12% of Tesla, the electric car pioneer valued at hundreds of billions, and owns a 42% stake in SpaceX, a leader in commercial space technology.Musk’s 2022 purchase of Twitter (renamed X) for $44 billion further solidified his influence in social media and AI-driven communication. Known for his ambitious projects, such as Neuralink and The Boring Company, Musk’s vision revolves around sustainable energy, interplanetary travel, and integrating AI into human life.Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle Corporation, built one of the most successful software companies in the world, specializing in databases and enterprise solutions. He owns 40% of Oracle’s shares, which drive most of his wealth. In addition to technology, Ellison is known for his real estate ventures, most notably his purchase of 98% of Lanai Island in Hawaii for $300 million. A board member at Tesla until 2022, Ellison continues to influence the tech industry with his investments and strategic vision. His lifestyle and property holdings place him among the wealthiest tech moguls globally.Jeff Bezos revolutionized retail through Amazon, transforming it from a humble online bookstore into a global e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse. Even after stepping down as CEO in 2021, Bezos retains significant wealth with a 9% stake in Amazon and ownership of Blue Origin, a space exploration company. Recently, he married Lauren Sánchez, marking a new personal chapter. Bezos also focuses on philanthropy, investing in climate change initiatives and education. His success story is a prime example of how innovation and risk-taking can create unprecedented wealth.Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook in 2004, a social media platform that became an integral part of global communication. Now rebranded as Meta Platforms, Zuckerberg’s company is heavily investing in AI and the metaverse—a virtual reality-based internet experience. He owns about 13% of Meta, which drives most of his fortune. Despite facing privacy controversies and regulatory scrutiny, Zuckerberg remains one of the most powerful tech leaders, continuously shaping how billions connect and interact online.Larry Page co-founded Google in 1998 alongside Sergey Brin, creating the most widely used search engine in the world.

He is also known for investments in artificial intelligence and robotics, emphasizing innovation beyond traditional internet services.Jensen Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993, leading it to dominate the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, which powers gaming, AI, and supercomputing.

His leadership and strategic direction have positioned Nvidia as one of the most valuable tech companies, crucial to the growth of AI and cloud computing industries.Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton), oversees more than 70 luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora. He is the only non-American on this list, representing the luxury fashion and goods sector. Arnault’s five children also play active roles in the family business, ensuring continuity in leadership. His fortune showcases how luxury goods and global branding can rival tech industry wealth.Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, transformed the company during his tenure (2000–2014), significantly expanding its software and enterprise services portfolio. After retiring, Ballmer purchased the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion, diversifying his investments. Much of his wealth comes from Microsoft stock holdings, which continue to grow as the company remains a leader in cloud computing and software.Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is known globally as the “Oracle of Omaha” for his unmatched value investing strategies. Berkshire Hathaway owns diverse businesses like Geico, Duracell, and Dairy Queen, making it a financial powerhouse. Buffett is also a leading philanthropist, pledging most of his fortune to charitable causes through the Giving Pledge initiative. Despite his immense wealth, Buffett is known for his modest lifestyle and long-term focus on ethical, disciplined investing.Together, these billionaires not only reflect individual success but also underscore the sectors defining the 21st-century economy—tech, AI, luxury, and finance. Their influence spans across industries, policy, innovation, and philanthropy, shaping the world far beyond just their net worth.","The world’s wealthiest individuals dominate industries ranging from technology and e-commerce to luxury goods and investment.

'Jaw broken, spine injured': SpiceJet staff attacked by Senior Army Official; Video Goes Viral

NEW DELHI: An Army official allegedly “grievously assaulted” four SpiceJet employees at Srinagar Airport on July 26, 2025, after they asked him to pay for excess cabin baggage he was carrying on a flight (SG 386) to Delhi. The airline says its staff members “suffered a spinal fracture and serious jaw injuries after being attacked with punches, repeated kicks and a queue stand.”The passenger, an army officer, “was carrying two pieces of cabin baggage weighing a total of 16 kg, more than double the permitted limit of 7 kg. When politely informed of the excess baggage and asked to pay the applicable charges, the passenger refused and forcefully entered the aerobridge without completing the boarding process – a clear violation of aviation security protocols. He was escorted back to the gate by a CISF official. At the gate, the passenger grew increasingly aggressive and physically assaulted four members of the SpiceJet ground staff,” a SpiceJet spokesperson said.""One SpiceJet employee collapsed unconscious on the floor but the passenger continued kicking and hitting the fainted employee. Another staff member suffered bleeding from the nose and mouth after receiving a forceful kick to the jaw while bending down to assist the colleague who had fainted.The injured employees were rushed to hospital and remain under treatment for the grievous injuries sustained,” he added.PRO (Defence), Srinagar, said in a statement: ""The matter involving an alleged altercation between an Army personnel and airline staff at Srinagar Airport on July 26, 2025, has come to the notice of the Indian Army.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Sunday fact-checked Congress MP P Chidambaram 's allegations of voter shift and migrant inclusion in Tamil Nadu, calling them ""misleading and baseless.""Responding strongly to Chidambaram 's allegations, EC said, ""There is no need for political leaders to spread false information with respect to the SIR exercise being conducted by ECl at national level.""The poll agency added that such information is being ""deliberately peddled in the media with a view to obstruct the exercise.""""As far as voters who have permanently shifted from Bihar to other states and are ordinarily resident in those states, the exact figures can be known only after the SIR has been conducted,"" it added.""The Constitution of India read with RP Act 1950 envisages the Enrollment of voters with respect to the constituency in which they are ordinarily resident.

While 65 lakh voters are in danger of being disenfranchised in Bihar, reports of ""adding"" 6.5 lakh persons as voters in Tamil Nadu is alarming and patently illegal.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Suspended JD(S) leader Prajwal Revanna has been designated prisoner number 15528. He spent a tearful and visibly distressed first night at Bengaluru’s Parappana Agrahara central prison following his life time sentencing in a rape case involving 47-year-old domestic worker.Prison authorities said Revanna was emotionally overwhelmed and appeared stressed throughout the night. According to prison health officials, he broke down during a medical examination conducted after his arrival on Saturday night. They noted that his medical condition was stable.""He broke down during the medical check-up and expressed his anguish to the staff,"" a senior medical official said. He is currently housed in a high-security cell under enhanced protection.He also informed the staff that he has moved the high court to challenge his conviction. Prison authorities confirmed that standard dress codes are being followed and Revanna will be required to wear the prison uniform given to all prisoners.A special court on Friday for elected representatives convicted Revanna former Hassan MP and grandson of ex-Prime Minister HD Deve Gowdafor raping a 47-year-old domestic worker in 2021.The court found him guilty of multiple offences and booked him under multiple sections including repeated rape, sexual harassment, voyeurism and criminal intimidation.Prajwal was awarded life imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life under Sections 376(2)(k) and 376(2)(n), along with a fine of Rs 5 lakh under each.

"Govt says National Medical Commission rules allow complaints against docs, but commission rejects them",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-says-national-medical-commission-rules-allow-complaints-against-docs-but-commission-rejects-them/articleshow/123076303.cms,"NEW DELHI: Responding to a Parliament question on whether the National Medical Commission (NMC) was biased towards doctors, the health ministry has stated that the ethics regulation of 2002 provided for complaints against doctors. However, NMC’s ethics section has been rejecting all patient appeals claiming that the NMC Act prevails over the 2002 ethics regulation.The NMC act states that doctors can file appeals against state medical council decisions. Referring to this, the ethics section has been dismissing all appeals filed by patients claiming that only doctors can file an appeal, even though it is against the law.The NMC Act itself clearly states that “the rules and regulations made under the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, shall continue to be in force and operate till new standards or requirements are specified under this Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder”.Since the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 has not been replaced, it still stands. Clause 8.8 of the 2002 ethics regulation states: “Any person aggrieved by the decision of the State Medical Council on any complaint against a delinquent physician, shall have the right to file an appeal to the MCI within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of the order passed by the said Medical Council”.Yet, over 162 appeals of patients have been rejected by the NMC.In the reply to Parliament, minister of state for health Anupriya Patel stated that “to ensure that the NMC functions in a transparent and fair manner”, the central government appoints the chairperson and presidents of four autonomous boards as per the NMC Act 2019. However, there is no transparency as even the minutes of the meetings of the NMC and its autonomous boards are not available in the public domain as used to be the case with the erstwhile Medical Council of India. Moreover, all autonomous boards including the posts of presidents are currently almost entirely vacant with the government having failed to make appointments for over 10 months.The few minutes of commission’s meetings accessed using RTI show that most non-doctor ex-officio members hardly ever attend meetings and hence most decisions are taken by commission members, almost most of whom are doctors. Of the 33-member commission, about 20 are doctors.“I have complained to the health ministry and the law ministry by registered post about NMC rejecting patient appeals and hence I have proof. So, the health ministry cannot claim to have not received any complaints,” said Gokul Aneja, husband of a victim of alleged medical negligence, who appealed against the decision of the Punjab state medical council, only to have his appeal rejected twice.","The NMC act states that doctors can file appeals against state medical council decisions. Over 162 appeals of patients have been rejected by the NMC. Of the 33-member commission, about 20 are doctors.

'He Has His Reasons...': Shashi Tharoor Reacts To Rahul Gandhi's Remark On Trump Tariffs

Poll How do you view the current state of the Indian economy? Somewhat positive Neutral

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday refused to comment on Rahul Gandhi ’s endorsement of US President Donald Trump ’s remark calling the Indian economy ""dead."" Tharoor said the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha may have had his ""own reasons"" for saying so, but stressed that maintaining economic ties with the US is vital for India.When asked about Rahul Gandhi's statement, Tharoor said, ""I don't want to comment on what my party leader has said. He has his reasons for saying so. My concern is that our relationship with the US, as a strategic partnership and economic relationship, is important for us. We are exporting around 90 billion worth of goods to America. We can't be in a position to lose that or have it diminish significantly.""He added, ""We must wish our negotiators strength to get a fair deal for India. We should also be talking to other regions for exporting our goods. Then we could make up for some of what we might lose in the US. We have to support our negotiators.""Tharoor’s response came after Rahul Gandhi, on Thursday, agreed with Trump’s description of the Indian economy. Gandhi had said, ""Yes, he is right. Everybody knows this except the prime minister and the finance minister. Everybody knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. I am glad that President Trump has stated a fact. The entire world knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. BJP has finished the economy to help Adani. ""Trump had made the comment on Wednesday through his social media platform, Truth Social. In that post, he announced a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods and warned of additional penalties in response to India importing oil from Russia.","'He Has His Reasons...': Shashi Tharoor Reacts To Rahul Gandhi's Remark On Trump Tariffs.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to increase the penetration of electric buses, cars and trucks, and to spur their sales, government is likely to clarify soon that the 15-year 'End of Life' (EoL) regulation isn't applicable to EVs.The power ministry will also expedite extending the CAFE norms (regulations designed to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions) to urban freight vehicles, trucks and buses.These were among the steps finalised at a recent high-level meeting chaired by Niti Aayog member Rajiv Gauba amid concerns over the slow progress of EV penetration in the country, which was barely 7.6% in 2024, as against the target of 30% by 2030. While EV penetration is higher for two- and three-wheelers and buses, it has been slow for four-wheelers, with e-trucks not having taken off so far.Sources said that responding to an observation from road transport secretary V Umashankar that most over 15-year-old buses are privately owned, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam suggested that if the 15-year EOL regulation is not applied to EVs, it may spur sales.Umashankar also held that a mandate for EV adoption works best at places where a certain level of penetration and ecosystem are in place.Sources said there was a consensus to move from incentives to mandates and disincentives for faster EV adoption and for strategies to have saturation in five cities for buses, para-transit and urban freight vehicles. A source said there was unanimous agreement on the need for fast expansion of charging infrastructure, deployment of fast chargers, development of new battery technologies to reduce import dependence and easier finance for e-buses and e-trucks.Days later, the finance ministry held talks with banks to address their reluctance to finance EVs and the issue of higher interest rates.At the meeting chaired by financial services secretary M Nagaraju, banks urged govt to standardise batteries, bring down vehicle costs and announce some incentive for purchase of new batteries, considering that batteries usually have to be replaced in 6-7 years and account for 40-50% of the cost of EVs.","Government is likely to clarify soon that the 15-year 'End of Life' regulation isn't applicable to EVs.

He said the same was true of other constitutional bodies.""The credibility of EC is at stake, and until some parliamentary oversight is brought over EC, it will remain a tool at the hands of govt,"" he told TOI. Gogoi said the nature of parliamentary oversight could be debated but the fact that it was required cannot be disputed any more.The opposition is set to escalate its focus on EC in coming days, with INDIA bloc demanding that govt schedule a discussion on Bihar's rolls review in Parliament, a demand that looks likely to blockade the two Houses in the coming weeks.

Philippines eyes buying more defence equipment from India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/philippines-eyes-buying-more-defence-equipment-from-india/articleshow/123082592.cms,".

NEW DELHI: As the Indian govt prepares to host Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, Manila has expressed interest in purchasing more defence equipment from India.Defence, security and maritime cooperation are among the key pillars of the relationship and will top the agenda of Marcos' bilateral engagement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, along with trade ties.Ahead of the president's visit, the chief of Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Romeo Brawner, said the Philippines is looking to purchase more weapon systems from India, citing the quality and affordability of Indian defence equipment.Talking about the ongoing delivery of BrahMos cruise missiles to Manila, Brawner also said two sets of the India-Russia jointly developed missile systems will arrive in the Philippines in the next few years. The Philippines' maritime dispute in the South China Sea (SCS), or what Manila calls the West Philippine Sea, has seen it scaling up defence cooperation with countries like India and Japan to blunt Chinese aggression and ensure peace and stability in the contested waters.India will also join the Philippines this week for a joint patrol in the South China Sea. In the middle of its own border tensions with China, India in 2023 joined Manila in explicitly asking China to abide by a 2016 arbitral tribunal award that refuted Beijing's expansive claims over SCS waters.Modi and Marcos are also expected to discuss India's offer for concessional Line of Credit to meet Philippines' defence requirements, acquisition of naval assets, and expansion of training and joint exercises on maritime security.According to Manila, six agreements in a range of areas like science and technology, law and culture are expected to be signed.The Modi-Marcos meeting, however, takes place in the middle of efforts by both India and China to rebuild their relationship and it will be interesting to see how much play the South China Sea issue can get in the meeting. During Marcos' recent visit to the US, President Donald Trump reportedly told him he wouldn't mind if Manila got along with China.The two countries will also discuss efforts to enhance trade ties, as they both look to conclude a bilateral trade deal with the US to avoid getting caught in the cross hairs of Trump's trade war.While the US president has announced 25% tariffs on imports from India, he has slapped Manila with a 19% levy.Bilateral trade crossed $3 billion for the first time in 2022-2023 and the two sides have agreed to commence negotiations for a bilateral Preferential Trade Agreement.According to the ministry of external affairs (MEA), development cooperation is another crucial aspect of bilateral relationship.""India is implementing six Quick Impact Projects (QIPs) in the areas of agriculture, disaster risk reduction & management, health-care and livelihood support, in the Philippines, under an MoU on Indian Grant Assistance for the implementation of QIPs, signed on Feb 7, 2023,"" said an official.","Defence, security and maritime cooperation are among the key pillars of the relationship.

"Delay hits Scorpene retrofit to boost stealth, endurance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delay-hits-scorpene-retrofit-to-boost-stealth-endurance/articleshow/123082184.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has once again missed the boat to enhance the underwater operational endurance and stealth of its latest Scorpene or Kalvari-class conventional submarines, with the already delayed air independent propulsion (AIP) system developed by DRDO still not ready for integration with the vessels.The first Scorpene submarine to be built at the Mazagon Docks (MDL) with French collaboration, INS Kalvari, which was commissioned in Dec 2017, will now complete her ongoing maintenance refit at the Mumbai naval dockyard without being retrofitted with the AIP plug as was originally planned, defence ministry sources told TOI.""The fuel cell-based AIP system developed by DRDO's Naval Materials Research Lab, which has L&T as the prime industry partner, is still not yet operationally available. Hopefully, it should be ready by the time the second Scorpene (INS Khanderi) comes for her scheduled normal maintenance refit in mid-2026,"" a source said.The Navy after a long delay has inducted six diesel-electric Scorpene submarines, constructed by MDL in collaboration with the French Naval Group under Project-75 for over Rs 23,000 crore, with the sixth INS Vagsheer being commissioned in Jan this year.There is major concern about the continuing delay in the indigenous AIP project, which was originally slated for completion by June 2017 after being sanctioned in 2014 at an initial cost of Rs 270 crore.Amid the delay, MDL and Naval Group signed an agreement for the integration of the indigenous AIP energy system plugs on the Scorpenes only on July 23. Under it, each submarine will undergo a complex project called ""jumboisation"", involving precision cutting of the hull, safe insertion of the AIP plug and then rejoining the structure to ensure the vessel is fully operational again.Unlike nuclear-powered submarines, which have unlimited underwater endurance, diesel-electric boats must surface or snorkel every couple of days to get oxygen to recharge their batteries. Those fitted with AIP, however, can stay submerged for around two weeks to significantly boost their stealth and combat capabilities.With Pakistan on course to induct eight Yuan or Hangor-class conventional submarines with AIP from China in a major capability jump, India's depleting conventional underwater combat arm has become a major worry. China, of course, now has the world's largest navy, which includes over 50 diesel-electric and 10 nuclear submarines.Apart from the six French-origin Scorpenes, India has seven very old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW diesel-electric submarines at present. It also has two operational SSBNs (nuclear-powered submarines armed with nuclear ballistic missiles) in INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, with the third to be commissioned as INS Aridhaman this year, as reported by TOI earlier.The long-pending projects to build three additional Scorpenes for Rs 38,000 crore and six new-generation diesel-electric submarines, with both AIP and land-attack cruise missiles, for Rs 70,000 crore under Project-75-India at MDL, are also yet to be finalised and inked.","India has inducted six diesel-electric Scorpene submarines, constructed by MDL in collaboration with the French Naval Group under Project-75 for over Rs 23,000 crore.

INDIA bloc planning march to EC office

NEW DELHI: As the month-long monsoon session of Parliament enters its third week on Monday, another round of deadlock is not ruled out even as the govt has no option but to seek passage of several crucial bills, amid opposition's determined bid to carry on with its protests over the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls.Opposition parties have been demanding a discussion on the SIR exercise, which the govt has rejected because it cannot make a reply on behalf of the Election Commission, an independent constitutional body not represented by any department. Besides, the govt has cited a ruling of former speaker Balram Jakhar that Parliament can't discuss the administrative work of constitutional bodies like EC.The govt is likely to remain firm on its stand and has more reasons for it as it will cite the ""double voter ID"" held by Bihar opposition leader, RJD's Tejashwi Yadav. Yadav had said that his name from the voters' roll had been omitted, a claim promptly rejected by EC, which disclosed the voter roll number and sought a reply from him for holding two EPIC cards.The govt's confidence to negate the opposition's claims has further grown as the analysis of SIR figures has shown no systematic targeting of Muslims. Figures released Friday also show that migrants have not been affected and the number of deletions in constituencies where BJP-led NDA candidates won is not higher than in those taken by the opposition 'Mahagathbandhan' in Bihar.With more reasons to assert that there are no irregularities in the SIR exercise, the govt is likely to push the passage of a key sports bill in Lok Sabha. The Lower House has listed the National Sports Governance Bill, which envisages greater transparency in the functioning of sports bodies, including BCCI, for consideration and passage.Rajya Sabha has listed for passage on Monday a resolution from home minister Amit Shah on the extension of President's Rule in Manipur by another six months with effect from Aug 13.Except for a two-day discussion on the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor in both the Houses, parliamentary proceedings have been all but a washout since the session began on July 21 as the SIR has ignited vociferous protests from opposition parties.INDIA bloc, which has in previous sessions often spoken in different voices, has joined ranks over the issue, alleging that EC's exercise is aimed at removing voters sympathetic to its agenda and boosting the prospects of NDA.EC has said it will roll out the exercise nationally to ""protect"" the integrity of electoral rolls to ensure only eligible voters are allowed to cast votes. However, leader of opposition in LS Rahul Gandhi has accused EC of ""vote chori (stealing votes)"" and has been fiercely critical of the poll body. EC in a statement Saturday rejected Rahul's allegations as ""baseless"", ""unsubstantiated"" and ""misleading"".INDIA bloc is mulling a march to the EC office on Friday to protest the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar and the exercise being planned nationally. The march, if finalised, would come a day after the opposition alliance meets for a dinner discussion on Thursday. The meeting has been called to discuss the Bihar SIR exercise, but Rahul Gandhi may give a presentation to allies on the “deep dive” in a sample seat — Bangalore rural LS — that Congress has done which, he claimed, has unearthed irregularities in the voters’ list.

An 80-year-old Agra-born adventurer-cum-businessman, Arvinder ‘Arvi’ Singh Bahal, lifted off to the edge of space aboard Blue Origin’s NS-34 mission along with five other crew members on Sunday. The suborbital flight lifted off from the company’s Launch Site One in West Texas at 6:00 p.m. IST, marking another milestone in private human spaceflight.Bahal was part of Blue Origin’s 14th human flight to suborbital space. The flight, lasting 11 minutes, carried a six-member crew to the Kármán line — the internationally recognised boundary that separates Earth's atmosphere from space. Bahal was accompanied by tech entrepreneur Justin Sun, Turkish businessman Gokhan Erdem, Puerto Rican meteorologist Deborah Martorell, British teacher Lionel Pitchford and venture capitalist JD Russell.Describing Bahal, Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin wrote, “Arvi is a real estate investor born in Agra, India, and now a naturalised US citizen. A lifelong traveler and adventurer, Arvi has visited every country in the world, the North and South poles, and skydived Mount Everest and the Pyramids of Giza”.

Later, he worked on a Scottish-owned tea plantation in Darjeeling for nearly four years. By 1970, he ventured into the garment manufacturing business near Delhi. He later migrated to the US.Besides setting up Bahal Properties — a real estate company he has led since 1975, Bahal has built successful ventures in fashion, sportswear and hospitality over the past 45 years. He recently wrote his first book, Tireless Traveler, and plans to write many more travel books.","Arvinder ‘Arvi’ Singh Bahal was part of Blue Origin’s 14th human flight to suborbital space.

NEW DELHI: A charter aircraft flying Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal Sharma from Delhi to Phalodi on last Thursday (July 31) landed on a “wrong” airstrip at its destination. While the Falcon 2000 was to land at Phalodi Air Force Station, it landed at a civil airstrip of the city. Sources say the pilots realised their mistake and then took off from the civil airstrip to land the jet at the IAF station. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing this case and has taken the pilots off flying duty pending investigation.“The CM flew from Delhi to Phalodi on July 31 at 3 pm. The aircraft landed at the civil airstrip in Phalodi. The pilots immediately took off from the wrong airstrip and then landed at the Phalodi IAF station, which was the scheduled airport for it and about 5 km away from the former. The CM alighted there and a couple of hours later flew the aircraft to Jaipur. The Falcon 2000 then flew back to Delhi the same night,” said people in the know.The charter company filed a voluntary report on the “wrong airport landing incident” with the DGCA. The civil airstrip and the IAF station in Phalodi are about 5 km apart and both the facilities have similar geographical positioning. “Both the runways have similar orientation and visual characteristics.The flight crew misidentified the intended runway during approach. Seemingly there was inadequate pre-flight briefing about the presence of two airfields in close vicinity. Pilots must get proper pre-flight briefing and that is something operators need to work on to ensure such things don’t happen,” say sources. The Dassault Falcon 2000 is a French business jet that can carry 8-10 passengers with a range of upto 6,000 km.This case has raised concern as an aircraft supposed to land at the civil airstrip by mistake entering the restricted military airspace could have legal and safety consequences. “The civil airstrip may not support the aircraft’s weight category, compromising landing safety. Also, military-civil coordination may be lacking during such mis-landings, increasing response time for corrective action,” they add.The headquarters for the eponymous district, Phalodi is also called the “salt city” due to the salt industry in Rin. Phalodi is in the buffer zone of Thar Desert and close to Bikaner, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer.",Charter aircraft flying Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal Sharma from Delhi to Phalodi landed on a “wrong’ airstrip at its destination.

NEW DELHI: Private car owners in Telangana won’t be able to avail the Annual Toll Pass scheme for National Highways (NHs) and expressways to be launched by the Centre on Aug 15, as vehicles registered in the state have not yet been migrated to the Vahan database (central registry of vehicles). The annual pass, to be issued from next week, requires real-time validation of vehicle class through the Vahan portal.Union transport secretary V Umashankar, in a letter addressed to Telangana chief secretary last week, sought the “personal intervention” of the top state official to expedite the migration of the state’s vehicle data to Vahan portal and ensure “equitable access to the nationwide facility for road users”.In his letter, Umashankar highlighted how the Centre had reached out to the state govt in May this year for merger of state registers for driving licence (DL) and registration certificate (RC) of vehicles with the national registers —Sarathi and Vahan -- but the same has not happened yet.Except Telangana, all other states have come on board, officials said.

Tiger population tells success of India’s wildlife conservation story but challenges remain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tiger-population-tells-success-of-indias-wildlife-conservation-story-but-challenges-remain/articleshow/123078808.cms,"Where Tigers Get Caught Between Faith And Tourism | I Witness

NEW DELHI: In 2006, India had just 1,411 tigers left in the wild. By 2022, there were 3,682, almost 75% of the world’s wild tiger population — a 161% jump in just 16 years.More than 50 years since the launch of Project Tiger in 1973, the numbers tell a tale that’s obvious: tiger conservation has been a roaring success. But challenges remain.The numbers are significant, especially in the backdrop of a decline in tiger population in the 1980s, and a period of not-so-robust growth thereafter because of multiple factors, primarily poaching. By 2004, the situation had become so bad that tigers were on the brink of extinction at Rajasthan’s Sariska Tiger Reserve. The country’s wildlife managers and biologists sensed the urgency and started taking multiple measures to protect the existing tiger population and increase the number of big cats.But, in the journey from 1,411 in 2006 to 3,682 in 2022, many lessons have been learnt — primarily about human-tiger conflict and the lurking threat of poaching.“The country has been a leader in tiger conservation,” said Yadvendradev V Jhala, a senior scientist at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, and a former dean of Wildlife Institute of India (WII). But Jhala — who has been part of the journey to bring back tigers through policy intervention and management strategies, following the Sariska situation — cautions that the threat to tigers has never gone away.“Though India now has approximately 3,700 tigers, they are still vulnerable and can be decimated if poaching is left unchecked, as the market for illegal tiger parts and products still thrives outside India. ”He also reminded that the tiger population increase had not been uniform: reserves such as Palamau (Jharkhand), Achanakmar (Chhattisgarh), Satkosia (Odisha), Dampa (Mizoram) and Buxa (Bengal) have seen declines and localised extinctions.On the other hand, big cat populations in Uttarakhand and eastern Maharashtra had increased so much that man-animal conflict has become an issue. “Also, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand have registered declines, though they have good habitats because of prey base depletion,” Jhala said.India began its efforts to protect the tiger population when it launched Project Tiger as a centrally sponsored scheme in 1973 in nine reserves (Assam, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Bengal) over a 14,000sq km area. Since then, project coverage has expanded to 58 tiger reserves, over more than 84,487sq km across 18 states, occupying nearly 2.5% of the country’s total geographical area.The numbers show that approximately 35% of our tiger reserves urgently require enhanced protection measures, such as habitat restoration, ungulate augmentation and subsequent tiger reintroduction.“Tiger recovery is linked with rural community prosperity and law and order,” Jhala said. “In the last 20 years, wherever there has been extreme poverty and armed conflicts (Maoist activity or other law-and-order problems), we have seen tiger extinctions. Improving the livelihoods of forest communities, so that they do not have to rely on forest produce for a living, will reduce their negative impact on biodiversity. ”He, however, stressed that India would need a strategy to manage the growing population of tigers. “If this is not done in time, there will likely be a severe backlash from local communities, and we stand to lose all we gained in the past 20 years.”The conflict has, indeed, taken a human toll. The environment ministry told Parliament on July 24 that 73 lives were lost in tiger attacks in 2024, with Maharashtra reporting the highest (42), followed by UP (10), MP (6), Uttarakhand (5) and Assam (4). There were 51 human lives lost in 2020, 59 in 2021, 110 in 2022 and 85 in 2023.Indian Forest Service officer and Barabanki DFO Akash Deep Badhawan said during his tenure as DFO Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, Bahraich, forest personnel grappled with a mix of threats: a 45km porous border with Nepal, with cross-border gangs and illegal wildlife trade putting staff at risk. Understaffing and resource shortages are another constraint. “Human-wildlife conflict fuels mistrust between communities and enforcement teams. Efforts to evict encroachments or set up fencing provoke resistance from villagers, compounding socio-political tension. Balancing legal constraints, regulatory delays, and ecological imperatives adds further administrative and ethical complexity.”","In 2006, India had just 1,411 tigers left in the wild.

"Canada wildfire: Thick smoke chokes Midwest, Northeast US; air alerts widen",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/canada-wildfire-thick-smoke-chokes-midwest-northeast-us-air-alerts-widen/articleshow/123084098.cms,"



Thick smoke from hundreds of Canadian wildfires drifted across the border, causing hazy conditions over parts of the Midwest and northeastern United States on Sunday.According to government records, Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season, with nearly 4,000 fires documented this year, NPR reported.The cross-border smoke has impacted air quality across several US states. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota experienced concerning air quality levels this weekend. Air quality alerts were issued for parts of Illinois and Indiana.Authorities in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine advised residents to reduce outdoor activities due to smoke pollution.Bob Oravec, National Weather Service Lead Forecaster, told NPR that current wind patterns are facilitating the movement of polluted air from Canada into the US.""Air is moving at all levels and a lot of times it'll move in the same direction through the whole depth of the atmosphere, so the smoke is rising into the winds and the winds just transport it downstream, like anything — like a leaf getting blown,"" Oravec explained.Minnesota's Pollution Control Agency extended its statewide air quality alert until noon on Monday, August 4th.According to Minnesota Public Radio, the state is experiencing its longest air quality alert since the agency began issuing alerts in 2008, expected to last seven days.Some areas of Minnesota saw improved conditions on Sunday. Earlier in the weekend, the agency predicted the air quality index (AQI) would reach the severe ""red"" level statewide, considered unhealthy for all residents.The Pollution Control Agency stated that even healthy individuals might experience symptoms including eye irritation, coughing, or breathing difficulties. They warned of more severe impacts for others.""Sensitive or more exposed individuals may experience more serious health effects, including worsening of existing heart or lung disease and respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, possibly leading to an asthma attack, heart attack, or stroke,"" according to the Pollution Control Agency statement.Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources extended air quality alerts until noon on Monday, August 4th, primarily in southeastern counties. Michigan officials also extended alerts across all counties through Monday.The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported over 700 active fires across Canada on Sunday, predominantly in southern Manitoba, north of Minnesota. Over 500 fires remain uncontrolled, forcing thousands of Canadians to evacuate.Canada has faced wildfires throughout the year. Two individuals perished in a southeastern Manitoba wildfire in May. Similar smoke conditions affected the US in June.Oravec suggests poor air quality could persist in US regions.""It looks like that pattern maintains itself going forward through this week, so it doesn't really appear to be any big break. There may be a day or so where there's a temporary break to it, but overall it looks like there is potential for additional smoke to be transported southeastward into the United States,"" he said.On Sunday afternoon, IQAir ranked Detroit, Chicago, and Minneapolis among the US cities with the most polluted air.","Smoke from hundreds of Canadian wildfires drifted across the border, causing hazy conditions over parts of the Midwest and northeastern U.S. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota experienced concerning air quality levels this weekend.

This exemplifies the unwavering commitment of the UAE's visionary leadership to support national projects that propel the progress of our nation.”

“Today, we stand on the cusp of a transformative era in the UAE's transportation landscape and take immense pride in and deeply appreciate the support we have received for this national project,”





In a significant step toward reshaping the UAE’s transportation landscape, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, travelled aboard a passenger train between Dubai and Fujairah. This symbolic journey marks a critical phase in the Etihad Rail project, one of the most ambitious rail networks in the world, laying the groundwork for full passenger operations by 2026.His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum shared photos on X of his journey aboard the Etihad Rail passenger train between Dubai and Fujairah, calling it a memorable ride. He was welcomed by a delegation from Etihad Rail led by Chief Business Support Officer Saeed AlAhbabi, along with several senior company executives.During the visit, Sheikh Mohammed was briefed on the project’s progress and key construction milestones. Speaking about Etihad Rail, he said:He described it as one of the country’s most significant infrastructure projects, with far-reaching economic, social, and developmental benefits that enhance connectivity and support national goals. He noted that the project reflects the spirit of the Union and contributes to sustainability, integration, and quality of life across all emirates.The passenger service is expected to begin commercial operations in 2026.Etihad Rail is a 1,200km-long national railway infrastructure project designed to connect key regions across the UAE and extend outward to neighbouring countries. With an investment of AED 40 billion (approximately $11 billion), the network will transport both freight and passengers, linking the Gulf coast with the Indian Ocean.The network will ultimately span the country from Ghuweifat on the Saudi border to Fujairah on the eastern coast. The western section connects to Saudi Arabia via Ghweifat, while the eastern extension links Oman through Al Ain. It traverses vital strategic locations including:The railway system is being built in two phases:The network connects industrial hubs, raw material sources, ports, and major urban centres. Key nodes include Khalifa Port, KIZAD, Jebel Ali Port, and various inland cities, facilitating an integrated logistics and transport framework for the UAE and beyond.Scheduled to launch commercial operations in 2026, the Etihad Rail passenger service represents a major leap forward in public transportation. It will provide a fast, reliable, and sustainable alternative to road and air travel, with trains expected to operate at speeds of up to 200 km/hr.The passenger rail will stretch approximately 900km, connecting 11 key cities and regions across all seven emirates, including:Trains will initially operate through four major stations: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, and Fujairah. Each train will be capable of accommodating up to 400 passengers, with annual ridership expected to reach 36.5 million by 2030.The design emphasizes passenger comfort and efficiency, promising reduced travel times and improved access across the country. As part of the UAE’s broader goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, the rail system is built with sustainability at its core, offering a green alternative to road transport and helping to reduce the nation’s carbon footprint.The passenger service is also expected to improve daily mobility, boost tourism and regional development, strengthen social ties across emirates, and support the UAE’s broader logistics strategy.His Highness Sheikh Theyab bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Chairman of Etihad Rail, highlighted the importance of Sheikh Mohammed’s involvement, noting:He emphasized Sheikh Mohammed’s integral role in the project's evolution, from its inclusion in the “Projects of the 50” initiative in 2021 to the recent inauguration of the national freight network in 2023:he said, emphasizing the project’s role in strengthening connectivity and boosting the nation’s economic integration.Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s visit to the Etihad Rail passenger train highlights his direct involvement in key infrastructure projects that connect the entire country and support the UAE’s development plans.Last week, he made an unannounced visit to a Dubai Tram station, riding the tram and engaging directly with commuters to assess public transport services firsthand. This follows a similar visit in 2023, when he quietly rode the Dubai Metro. Together, These visits exemplify his hands-on approach to leadership and governance, reflecting a familiar and consistent commitment to staying connected with developments on the ground.","Etihad Rail is a 1,200km national railway project that began in 2016 and is being developed in phases at a cost of Dh40 billion.

Matt Deitke’s rise and how Mark Zuckerberg stepped in with a historic offer

Building Molmo and earning global recognition at the Allen Institute for AI



Vercept and Deitke’s vision for autonomous AI agents





In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, few names have made waves quite like Matt Deitke. At just 24, Deitke turned heads by rejecting a $125 million offer from Meta to join its elite AI division. What followed was even more astonishing: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally met with him and doubled the offer to an eye-popping $250 million. Deitke’s decision to finally accept showcases the extraordinary lengths Big Tech is now going to in order to secure top AI talent. But who is Matt Deitke, and why is he considered one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today?Matt Deitke began his academic career in a PhD programme in computer science at the University of Washington. Despite his early academic promise, he left the programme to pursue more hands-on work in artificial intelligence. This move surprised many but proved instrumental in shaping his career. Deitke joined the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) in Seattle, where he quickly made a name for himself.At AI2, Deitke led the development of Molmo, a state-of-the-art multimodal chatbot capable of understanding and reasoning through a combination of text, images, and audio.His groundbreaking work earned him an Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS 2022, one of the most prestigious AI conferences in the world. With his rising reputation, it was not long before top tech companies began to notice.In 2024, Meta approached Deitke with a $125 million compensation package spread over four years to join its Superintelligence Lab. Surprisingly, he declined the offer, choosing to stay focused on independent research and his entrepreneurial ventures. Refusing to give up, Mark Zuckerberg personally met with Deitke to discuss Meta’s vision for the future of AI. Following their conversation, the offer was doubled to approximately $250 million, with up to $100 million front-loaded in the first year. It was one of the most generous recruitment packages in AI history. This time, Deitke accepted.Before joining Meta, Deitke had already made significant contributions to AI research. At the Allen Institute for AI, he helped pioneer work on Molmo (Multimodal Language Model), a system designed to move beyond traditional text-based interaction by integrating visual and auditory data. Unlike chatbots that rely solely on language models, Molmo could respond with images, reason through spatial information, and interpret sensory input in real time.Deitke’s work positioned him at the forefront of the next generation of AI tools—intelligent systems that combine perception and reasoning. His NeurIPS 2022 paper, which won an Outstanding Paper Award, drew attention for its bold approach to human-like AI reasoning. The achievement made Deitke not just a standout engineer but a thought leader in the AI space, someone capable of redefining how humans and machines interact.In late 2023, while still outside the Big Tech ecosystem, Deitke co-founded Vercept, a startup aimed at building AI agents that can autonomously perform complex tasks on the internet. Unlike conventional AI tools that rely on human prompts, Vercept’s agents are designed to understand goals, search the web, execute sequences of tasks, and adapt to new contexts. They essentially act like intelligent assistants with real-world functionality.Vercept began with just 10 employees but quickly attracted the attention of major investors. The company secured $16.5 million in early-stage funding, with notable backing from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The vision behind Vercept was simple but powerful: to create AI agents that don’t just talk, but act.Matt Deitke’s work at Vercept, combined with his academic and research accomplishments, painted a clear picture of his potential. As Big Tech continues its billion-dollar race to dominate AI, it is clear why Meta was willing to go to such extraordinary lengths to bring Deitke into the fold.","Matt Deitke is one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today.

Thinking Machines Lab: a startup with billion-dollar belief

Why Murati’s team said no to Meta

A name to watch in AI’s future





Mira Murati, the Albanian-American tech visionary behind some of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, is once again in the spotlight—this time for turning down an eye-watering $1 billion offer from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . As the former CTO of OpenAI and now the founder of the AI startup Thinking Machines Lab, Murati has become one of the most influential figures in the global AI race. Her team's unanimous rejection of Meta’s massive offer speaks volumes about their confidence in her leadership and their belief in the startup’s long-term vision.Before launching Thinking Machines Lab, Mira Murati served as the chief technology officer at OpenAI, one of the most influential positions in the modern AI world. During her tenure, she played a pivotal role in leading the development of groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Codex—systems that have since transformed the way people interact with artificial intelligence. She also oversaw OpenAI's deployment of safety protocols that became foundational to industry-wide AI governance frameworks. Her work helped bring generative AI into the mainstream, sparking a global wave of innovation across industries from education and healthcare to design and coding.Murati wasn’t just a technical leader—she was a strategic visionary. At OpenAI, she emphasized the importance of safety, alignment, and responsible development, pushing the organization to think deeply about the societal impact of powerful AI systems.Internally, she earned the reputation of being the “AI brain” behind OpenAI’s most ambitious projects, praised for her calm, focused demeanor and her ability to guide multidisciplinary teams through intense periods of innovation. She was instrumental in assembling the original alignment teams, ensuring ethical considerations were baked into product design from the earliest stages. Murati once remarked, “We don’t just code intelligence—we craft responsibility,” a phrase that has since become a rallying cry for ethical AI development. Her combination of engineering precision and human-centered thinking set the stage for her next bold move: founding her own AI company.In early 2025, she delivered a keynote at the World Economic Forum in Davos, warning that “AI without values is intelligence without conscience,” sparking international dialogue on AI ethics and sovereignty. She’s also been advising the European Commission on emerging AI regulatory frameworks, a rare role for a startup founder. Her ability to bridge the worlds of deep tech and global policy has made her one of the few technologists shaping both the tools and the laws that will define this century. Her growing influence in policy circles signals that she’s not just building AI—but helping shape the rules by which it will operate.Founded in early 2025, Thinking Machines Lab has rapidly emerged as one of the most-watched AI startups. Despite not launching a single product yet, the company recently raised a stunning $2 billion seed round at a valuation nearing $12 billion, led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup’s goal: to create customizable, interpretable, and widely accessible AI systems that could redefine the AI landscape. The company is pioneering customizable, interpretable AI systems designed to be tailored to local languages, cultures, and industries—advancing the democratization of advanced AI technology globally. Industry insiders say the company’s stealth mode only adds to its mystique. With Murati at the helm, expectations are sky-high for what comes next.According to a Wired report, Zuckerberg's Meta offered some of Murati’s team members compensation packages ranging from $200 million to $1 billion to join its newly launched Superintelligence Lab. But every single offer was turned down. Sources say the Thinking Machines Lab team believes their equity in the startup has the potential to be worth far more—and more importantly, they value their independence and Murati’s vision over big-tech paychecks. This wasn't just a rejection of Meta—it was a stand against the commodification of AI talent.In a tech industry where massive paydays often drive decisions, the loyalty displayed by Murati’s team stands out. The rejection of Meta’s lucrative offers highlights their belief in the startup’s mission and long-term potential. Their decision also reflects a broader shift in tech culture—one where founders and engineers alike are prioritizing purpose, values, and trust over headline-making payouts. Many observers also note that the chance to help shape AI’s future from the ground up, without the constraints of a corporate giant, is a rare and meaningful opportunity—one Murati has worked hard to create.Mira Murati’s leadership has already been recognized worldwide—she was featured in Time’s 100 Most Influential People in AI (2024) and Fortune’s 100 Most Powerful Women in Business (2023). With Thinking Machines Lab gaining momentum and Meta's billion-dollar offers rebuffed, Murati has solidified her place not just as a builder of AI—but as a shaper of its future. She has become a quiet icon of resistance against the centralization of AI power—choosing to innovate outside the usual corporate echo chambers, empowering diverse voices, ethical frameworks, open collaboration, and long-term human-centric progress.",Mira Murati is the founder of AI startup Thinking Machines Lab.

'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Rs 11.3 lakh will have to be paid to survivor

DKS: Why BJP leaders not talking about it?

BENGALURU: A special court on Saturday sentenced former MP Prajwal Revanna to life imprisonment. The verdict was pronounced a day after the former parliamentarian from Hassan was found guilty of repeatedly raping his 47-year-old domestic help.Of the three rape cases and one sexual harassment case against Prajwal, this is the first to go to trial and reach a verdict. The 34-year-old grandson of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda was once seen as a rising political star of the JD(S) first family.Special Judge Santosh Gajanan Bhat announced the punishment in a packed court hall around 4.30 pm. With his head down, Prajwal listened to the judge as he detailed the quantum of punishment under different sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He was visibly shattered upon hearing the sentence. Later, he silently walked out of the court hall.In the first part of the day, Justice Bhat heard the arguments of the special public prosecutors as well as the counsel for Prajwal, who was found guilty under eight IPC sections.Among them, IPC 376 (2) (K) (being in a position of control or dominance over a woman, committing rape on such a woman) and 376 (2) (N) (committing rape repeatedly on the same woman) resulted in life imprisonment.Police found it difficult to escort Prajwal out of the jam-packed court hall, with advocates, mediapersons, and others present.According to special public prosecutor Ashok Nayak, Prajwal can appeal the sentence in high court.The court also imposed a fine of ₹11.6 lakh on Prajwal, of which, ₹11.25 lakh will have to be paid to the survivor as compensation.He can make a plea for suspension of the sentence first. If the court upholds the sentence, then Prajwal can appeal for reduction in the punishment. However, if the high court rejects both, then he may knock on the doors of Supreme Court,” special public prosecutor Ashok Nayak said.Apart from IPC 376 (2) (K) and and 376 (2) (N), the other sections under which Prajwal was found guilty and punished include: IPC 354A (sexual harassment; three years’ rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs 25,000); IPC 354B (assault or use of criminal force on any woman; seven years’ rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs 50,000); IPC 354C (voyeurism; three years’ rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs 25,000); IPC 506 (criminal intimidation; two years’ rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs 10,000); IPC 201 (tampering of evidence; three years’ rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs 25,000); Section 66 of Information Technology Act (three years’ rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs 25,000).Declining to comment on the conviction, deputy CM DK Shivakumar said the reactions of JD(S) and BJP functionaries were more important than his.“You should ask for the reactions of JD(S) and BJP leaders than asking for my comments. They have to tell us what is right and what is wrong. We respect the law and abide by it. Why are BJP leaders, including CT Ravi, Ashoka and Narayanaswamy, not talking about this?”","Prajwal Revanna found guilty of repeatedly raping his 47-year-old domestic help.

Life behind bars

Wage arrears hit convicts





BENGALURU: Just last year, Prajwal Revanna drew a basic salary of Rs 1.2 lakh a month plus various allowances until he was disqualified as an MP in April 2024. Today, as a life prisoner (no. 15528) lodged in Bengaluru Central Prison, his earnings will not exceed Rs 540 per day, the standard pay fixed for convicts who work eight-hour shifts and six days a week.As per prison rules, all convicts are eligible to work and earn, except Sundays. But Prajwal is yet to be assigned any job, prison officials told TOI. ""New convicts usually begin with unskilled work, like assisting in the bakery or doing basic tailoring. After a year, if found suitable, they may be promoted to skilled labour roles such as weaving or smithy work,"" a senior prison source said.As the former Lok Sabha member from Hassan was shifted to the convict barrack Friday, he will be given time until Monday to choose his work. ""Every Monday, new convicts are allocated their tasks. Regardless of the nature of work, the fixed wage is Rs 540 per month,"" the official added.Another senior official said, ""Any inmate sentenced to rigorous imprisonment should compulsorily work as per the prison guidelines. ""Convicts, unless exempted for health reasons, begin their day at 6.30am. After basic routine, breakfast is served. ""It's a rotating menu through the week: veg pulao on Sunday, tomato bath on Monday, chitranna on Tuesday, poha on Wednesday, puliyogare on Thursday, upma on Friday, and vangibhath on Saturday,"" a source said.Lunch is served between 11.30am and noon, and all inmates must return to their barracks by 6.30pm.

‘Bill Gates has no role in toxic food coating’: Michelle Pfeiffer apologises after spreading misinformation; what is the controversy about Apeel’s food coating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-gates-has-no-role-in-toxic-food-coating-michelle-pfeiffer-apologises-after-spreading-misinformation-what-is-the-controversy-about-apeels-food-coating/articleshow/123037875.cms,"Bill Gates’ name wrongly linked to Apeel in viral misinformation

How did Apeel respond

Pfeiffer apologizes and retracts earlier claims

The larger debate on food tech, trust, and responsibility





In July 2025, actress Michelle Pfeiffer sparked controversy when she shared posts on social media claiming that Apeel, a food technology company backed by Bill Gates , was contaminating organic produce. Pfeiffer's posts stated that organic produce ""is no longer safe"" because Apeel's edible plant-based coating, recently approved by the USDA for organic certification, is invisible and ""cannot be washed off. "" She implied a direct connection between Gates and ownership of Apeel. Shortly after, Apeel clarified that Bill Gates has no ownership or involvement in the company beyond two small grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012 and 2015. Pfeiffer later apologized, acknowledging she had shared outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel and its safety.Apeel Sciences, founded in 2012, develops an edible coating made from plant-derived ingredients such as citric acid and baking soda, designed to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables and reduce food waste. The product, called OrganiPeel, was formally FDA approved in 2024 and has been used in grocery stores since 2017. Apeel received two grants totaling approximately $1.1 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but Bill Gates himself is neither a founder, shareholder, nor involved in operations. The company emphasizes its commitment to sustainability and improving food access worldwide.On July 10, 2025, Michelle Pfeiffer shared posts warning her followers that organic produce coated with Apeel was no longer safe to consume, emphasizing the coating's supposed invisibility and inability to wash off.She also posted a list of major grocery chains that do not sell Apeel-coated produce. These claims echoed long-running social media smear campaigns that falsely accused Apeel of contaminating food and overstated Gates's involvement. The misinformation prompted backlash from Apeel, its representatives, and many food safety experts who contested Pfeiffer’s assertions.Apeel representatives firmly denied the allegations related to food safety and company ownership. They stressed that their product is edible, made from responsibly sourced plant oils, and can be removed by simply rinsing and gently scrubbing produce. Apeel also clarified that Bill Gates has ""zero involvement or ownership"" in the company, and that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's funding was limited to grants with no controlling influence. The company reaffirmed its transparent mission to reduce food insecurity and improve sustainability in food systems.Three weeks after her initial posts, Pfeiffer returned to social media to issue a public apology. She admitted to unintentionally sharing outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel's product and ownership. Pfeiffer confirmed having spoken directly with Apeel representatives, learning that OrganiPeel is neither a new product nor exclusively linked to Bill Gates. She emphasized the importance of accurate public conversations on food safety and sustainability and expressed regret for spreading misinformation.This incident reflects ongoing tensions and misinformation in public discourse surrounding new food technologies and influential figures like Bill Gates. While some commentators applauded Pfeiffer for raising awareness, others criticized the spread of unverified claims that fuel distrust in science-based innovations. Apeel's case highlights the challenges companies face in balancing transparency, innovation, and public perception amid rapid advances in food technology. Pfeiffer's correction serves as a reminder of the responsibility public figures hold in verifying information before sharing it widely.","Actress Michelle Pfeiffer sparked controversy when she shared posts on social media claiming that Apeel, a food technology company backed by Bill Gates, was contaminating organic produce.

Reddit’s financial earnings



Reddit is all set to make a bold pivot towards becoming a full-fledged search engine. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman recently announced the plans to prioritise search functionality and AI-powered answers across the platform. The announcement came as part of the company's Q2 2025 shareholder letter, which highlighted strong financial performance driven by advertising and a growing user base. “Reddit a go-to search engine, and expanding internationally,” said Huffman. The move comes amid explosive growth in Reddit’s internal search usage, which now sees over 70 million weekly queries.During the earnings call, CEO Steve Huffman framed the initiative as a natural evolution for the platform, which has long been the de facto search engine for millions seeking genuine, opinion-based answers. ""For years, people have been adding 'reddit' to their search queries to find real experiences, recommendations, and discussions,"" Huffman stated. ""Our communities are the world's most valuable database of human experience. We're simply building the infrastructure to make that wisdom more accessible and searchable.""Reddit’s pitch is simple: real people, real answers. In a world increasingly dominated by algorithmic summaries, Reddit believes that nuanced, lived experiences are irreplaceable. A recent survey showed that 80% of users trust human responses over AI-generated ones for complex questions.“To focus on the areas that matter most, we are deprioritising a few initiatives, including our work on the user economy. It’s still an opportunity we believe in, but we’re concentrating our resources on the areas that will drive results for our most pressing needs: improving the core product, making Reddit a go-to search engine, and expanding internationally,” said Huffman.Reddit’s Q2 revenue hit $500 million, up 78% year-over-year, with a net income of $89 million and a gross margin of 90.8%.

In the face of US President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs and warnings of additional penalty for trade with Russia, India is also hardening its stance. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken a defiant stance against Trump's tariff warnings, whilst encouraging people to buy locally made products. The Modi government has also not stopped purchasing Russia’s crude oil.The United States has shifted its stance towards India, with President Trump now targeting the nation as part of his strategy to pressure Vladimir Putin regarding the Ukraine conflict. Trump's recent criticism specifically addressed India's participation in BRICS and its continued Russian relations, stating ""they can take their dead economies down together.""On Saturday, PM Modi emphasised the necessity of protecting India's interests during global uncertainty. Modi’s comments at a public gathering come at a time when the Donald Trump administration has imposed a 25% duty on Indian exports. The White House has also indicated potential additional measures if India continues its Russian oil imports.Also Read | India buying Russian oil an ‘irritant’ for Trump administration!

This approach has become increasingly significant following the implementation of US tariffs.At Saturday's rally, Modi said: ""The interests of our farmers, our small industries and the employment of our youth are of paramount importance.""According to sources who spoke to Bloomberg, the government has not directed refineries to cease Russian oil purchases, nor has any decision been finalized regarding the suspension of these imports.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"Tim Cook breaks Steve Jobs’ this record at Apple, what it says about Apple’s evolution",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tim-cook-breaks-steve-jobs-this-record-at-apple-what-it-says-about-apples-evolution/articleshow/123060520.cms,"Tim Cook surpasses Jobs’ CEO tenure: a historic leadership milestone

Apple's evolution under Tim Cook: Beyond the iPhone

Financial transformation: From billions to trillions

The legacy debate: innovation vs. sustainability

What lies ahead for Tim Cook and Apple?

Tim Cook has officially become the longest-serving CEO in Apple’s history, surpassing the legendary Steve Jobs . As of August 1, 2025, Cook has led the tech giant for 5,091 days—one day longer than Jobs’ combined tenure as CEO. This milestone marks not just a shift in leadership duration but reflects Apple’s evolution from a design-centric innovator under Jobs to a global services and hardware powerhouse under Cook. The transition tells a larger story about how Apple has matured, diversified, and continued to thrive even in a post-Jobs era.Steve Jobs served as Apple’s CEO in two phases: first as interim CEO (1997–2000) and then officially until his resignation in 2011, totaling 5,090 days. Tim Cook, who took over immediately after Jobs stepped down, has now served for 5,091 days and counting. Though Jobs is credited with Apple’s dramatic resurgence and visionary product launches, Cook’s long-lasting leadership has brought financial stability, record-breaking market caps, and expansive global growth.Steve Jobs was known for his intense, hands-on, visionary leadership style. He spearheaded revolutionary products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Tim Cook, in contrast, is a calm and strategic operator who optimized Apple’s supply chains, expanded into services, and championed sustainability and accessibility. Cook’s approach relies more on empowering teams and long-term planning, reflecting a matured corporate culture.While Jobs reshaped consumer tech with breakthrough devices, Cook diversified Apple’s ecosystem. Under his leadership, the company launched the Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, AirTag, Vision Pro, and its own Apple silicon chips. On the software and services front, he led the growth of Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, News+, and Fitness+, turning Apple into a recurring revenue machine beyond just hardware sales.In Jobs’ final year (2011), Apple earned around $108 billion in revenue. Under Cook, Apple crossed a staggering $394 billion in annual revenue by 2022. More impressively, Apple became the world’s first $3 trillion company in market capitalization, reinforcing Cook’s reputation as a financial powerhouse who brought unprecedented shareholder value and stability.While Jobs’ era is remembered for disruptive innovation and iconic product moments, Cook’s tenure is defined by sustainability, inclusivity, and long-term growth. Cook built on Jobs' foundation, but his success sparks debate: has Apple lost its spark of innovation, or has it simply evolved into a mature, diversified tech empire? Either way, Cook’s milestone highlights the company’s transformation from a volatile innovator into a global economic titan.As Apple continues to explore AI, spatial computing, and health tech, Cook remains at the helm with no official successor in sight. Speculation is growing that he may also assume the role of chairman, consolidating his leadership. Whether or not Cook eventually steps aside, his tenure has redefined what it means to lead Apple—and shaped the company’s trajectory for the next generation.","Tim Cook has officially become the longest-serving CEO in Apple’s history, surpassing the legendary Steve Jobs.

‘They want a win in November’: Trump administration schedules first ‘Golden Dome’ test ahead of 2028 election -Here's what report said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-want-a-win-in-november-trump-administration-schedules-first-golden-dome-test-ahead-of-2028-election-heres-what-report-said/articleshow/123083700.cms,"



The Pentagon has scheduled its first major test of President Donald Trump's space-based Golden Dome missile defence system just before the 2028 elections, CNN reported, citing sources.This ambitious schedule aims to demonstrate the feasibility of transforming President Trump's concept of a space-based protective shield for the entire United States.This scheduling aligns with Trump's May announcement to “have it done in three years.”""Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world,"" he said.A defence official informed CNN that while missile tests typically require extensive advance planning, the timing of this test in the fourth quarter of 2028 appears strategically placed.""They want a win to point to in November [2028],” the official told CNN and added, “and DoD wants to avoid anything they perceive will slow them down.”The defence official revealed that the MDA plans to designate the test as FTI-X, where 'FTI' indicates Flight Test Integrated, encompassing the coordination of Golden Dome's various sensors and weapons systems against multiple targets.The three-year implementation presents significant challenges, considering the US has researched space-based missile interception for decades.The defence official highlighted technical complexities, particularly regarding the substantial number of satellites required for effective coverage of the continental United States.Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein, appointed by Trump in May to oversee Golden Dome's development, addressed these challenges at a recent industry summit, focusing on the technical and economic feasibility of space-based interceptors at scale.Initial tests in 2028 may represent only the first phase, according to another source, emphasising the current focus on swift progress using existing systems to demonstrate the concept's viability for additional funding.The project's allocated budget of $25 billion, announced by Trump in May, is expected to expand significantly into hundreds of billions. Various companies are already testing relevant technologies, including Northrop Grumman's work on space-based interceptors.The Pentagon recently announced successful testing of a Lockheed Martin long-range radar system in Alaska, capable of tracking ballistic missiles from Russia and China, likely to be incorporated into Golden Dome.The industry awaits Guetlein's comprehensive system design plan. A memo signed by defence secretary Pete Hegseth outlined a 60-day deadline for initial architecture and 120 days for implementation planning.Concerns exist regarding the accelerated development approach and reduced oversight. The Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation's role was diminished after announcing its involvement in Golden Dome testing oversight.Guetlein has been granted significant autonomy in contract allocation and technology procurement, reporting directly to Deputy Secretary Stephen Feinberg. The programme operates outside standard Pentagon oversight procedures for major weapons systems.Multiple companies, notably SpaceX, Anduril, and Palantir, are competing for involvement, having presented directly to Hegseth, who has expressed interest in their proposals.",The Pentagon has scheduled its first major test of President Donald Trump's space-based Golden Dome missile defence system just before the 2028 elections.

Pakistanis Describe Strikes; ‘Worse Than Earthquake…’ | India Destroys Terror Camps | Op Sindoor





A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning, causing panic among residents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and the capital Islamabad, as reported by ARY News.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) reported that the earthquake occurred at 2.04 am PST at a depth of 102 kilometers. Its epicentre was located in the Hindukush mountain region in Afghanistan.Tremors were also felt across various regions in Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the NSMC confirmed.In Pakistan, the tremors were reported in multiple districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Peshawar, Swat, Malakand, Nowshera, Charsadda, Karak, Dir, Mardan, Mohmand, Shangla, Hangu, Swabi, Haripur, and Abbottabad.Tremors were also felt in several parts of Punjab province including cities such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Attock, Taxila, Murree, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sheikhupura, Ferozwala and Muridke.Although the earthquake caused no reported loss of life or property, it led to widespread panic. Many residents rushed out of their homes in fear and began reciting verses from the holy Quran, according to ARY News.Pakistan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, as it lies at the intersection of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This collision zone makes the region highly vulnerable to frequent seismic activities.High-risk areas include Balochistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, which are located near major fault lines like the Main Central Thrust. Punjab, situated on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, also remains susceptible. Sindh, though relatively less prone to earthquakes is also not free from risk due to its tectonic positioning.One of the most powerful earthquakes in the country's history was the 1945 Balochistan earthquake that measured 8.1 in magnitude.","A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning.

‘Enduring partnership in days to come’: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif thanks Trump; calls US-Pakistan trade agreement historic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/enduring-partnership-in-days-to-come-pakistan-pm-shehbaz-sharif-thanks-trump-calls-us-pakistan-trade-agreement-historic/articleshow/123017421.cms,"Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif (ANI)





Pakistan's prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday thanked US President Donald Trump for the ""historic"" trade deal between Islamabad and Washington.“I wish to convey my profound thanks to President Trump @realDonaldTrump for his leadership role in finalization of the historic US-Pakistan trade agreement, successfully concluded by our two sides in Washington, last night. This landmark deal will enhance our growing cooperation so as to expand the frontiers of our enduring partnership in days to come,” Sharif said in a post on X.On Wednesday, Trump announced that the United States has reached an agreement with Pakistan to jointly develop the country’s “massive oil reserves.”“We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,"" the US president said in a post on Truth Social.The development comes amidst a meeting between Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick, and US trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer, as per the state-run Radio Pakistan.Pakistan has long asserted the presence of significant oil reserves along its coastline, but efforts to tap into them have seen little progress. To meet its energy needs, the country continues to rely on oil imports from the Middle East, reports PTI.“We are in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership. Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling Oil to India some day!” Trump said.The announcement followed just hours after Trump imposed a 25 per cent tariff on all goods imported from India, along with an additional penalty for India’s purchases of Russian military equipment and energy.""I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India — their tariffs are too high, among the highest in the world. Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.The tariffs are scheduled to go into effect on Friday.","Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked US President Donald Trump for the ""historic"" trade deal between Islamabad and Washington.
