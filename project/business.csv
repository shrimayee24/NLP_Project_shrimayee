Why Agnipath may not fire for BJP in Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-agnipath-may-not-fire-for-bjp-in-haryana/articleshow/113777585.cms,"Locals say Hisar’s Mahabir Stadium once used to teem with those training for armed forces recruitment. Aspirants now accuse the govt of turning its back on them with the Agniveer scheme

As Tide Of Armed Forces Aspirants Turns Into A Trickle In Jat-Dominated Districts And Elsewhere, Youths Make Their Displeasure Loud And Clear Ahead Of

Assembly Polls

Pressing issue

Tough choices

HISAR: Occupying the town’s sweet centre, Mahabir Stadium is 52 years of age. But these days the sprawling sports arena looks unmistakably geriatric and utterly unkempt. It’s been an abundant monsoon.And the punishing rains have left their mark. The running tracks are a mess, the tall weeds could delight a goshala of cows and the battered stands might employ masons and house painters for weeks.Over the decades, this multipurpose sports complex in central Haryana has not only played host to national competitions but also been a theatre of dreams for those readying themselves for the armed forces and the paramilitary. Thousands of young men — also a few women — have come here from nearby districts and states, indeed from everywhere, to toil and train.For months now though, the number of aspirants has kept plummeting, says Sonu Lamba. Describing himself as “a defence coach”, Lamba says he trains would-be soldiers for a fee. He shows an old video on his mobile phone of hundreds of army and paramilitary aspirants.“Log junoon ke saath taiyyari karte thhey (Aspirants used to prepare with passion). That is gone. Once I had 1,700 trainees. They came from Rajasthan, Punjab, even Uttarakhand. Now there are only 44,” he says.Jyoti Saini, 21, talks about the large gathering of enthusiasts when she first started practising here in 2021. The crowd has since dwindled. “I used to run with a group of 10-15 girls. Now, that is down to just about a handful,” she says.Talking to other hopefuls in Hisar and other districts, it is undeniable that the armed forces’ Agnipath scheme, which the Union govt launched in 2022, has dealt a harsh blow to their job dreams. And for the disgruntled — it includes both the aspirants and their families — the scheme is a major election issue. More so in a state where the unemployment rate among 15-29 years-old is marginally higher than India’s national average, per 2023-24 govt data.Jobs in the armed forces are much sought-after in Haryana. A fauji gets economic benefits and, equally importantly, social prestige. Village gateways are erected to pay homage to soldiers martyred in the service of the nation. With Agnipath, jobs and emotions have combined to create a volatile cocktail ahead of the Oct 5 assembly polls.Among different caste groups, Jats are the most vocal against the scheme in which an Agniveer gets to serve in the army for four years. Only 25% of a batch will get a full tenure. The Jats are numerically substantial and electorally crucial in districts like Hisar, Sonipat, Jhajjar, Rohtak and Jind.“What’s the point in training for years for a four-year job. When it is over, you are neither in sports nor in the army. Does it make sense?” asks Amandeep Pangal, who trains at the Hisar stadium.Another Jat, Ajit Sehrawat of Khandrai village in Sonipat district, has a similar question. “If an Agniveer spends four years in the army and then is made to quit, how will he serve his family in the future? He will no longer be eligible for other jobs.” The age limit for an Agniveer applicant is between 17.5 and 21 years.In July, CM Nayab Singh Saini’s govt announced a series of concessions for Agniveers who have to leave after serving for four years. It included a 10% horizontal reservation in recruitment for posts of constable, mining guard, forest guard, jail warden, and SPO (special police officer). That guarantees them a fixed proportion of positions in those categories. Those establishing their own business, the announcement said, can receive an interest free loan of up to Rs 5 lakh.But boxing coach Pradeep Sawant insists that changing one’s line of work is far more complicated than is being made out. “Despite what the govt is saying, it won’t be easy for an Agniveer to get a new job.”It isn’t just the Jats. Ashish Valmiki, a Dalit who works as a sweeper in a govt office in Gohana in Sonipat district, doesn’t like the scheme either. “For every selected candidate, a hundred are rejected. All Agniveers will be capable. Why retain only 25%?” he asks.Ajay, who uses only his first name, travels back and forth every day for training from nearby Fatehabad district. “Jo choubees ghante ghar se door rahega uski pension khatam kar rahe ho. Jo aath ghante ke liye office jaata hai, usko pension de rahe ho (those who stay away from home totally will not be eligible for pension. And those who work for eight hours in office will get it).”The merit of such questions is open to debate. And it is possible to argue that they are missing the big picture. But one thing is clear: by their own admission, none of the Agniveer aspirants that TOI spoke to are likely to provide endorsement for the scheme in the upcoming vote.","Jobs in the armed forces are much sought-after in Haryana.

Government unveils draft rules to take terminally ill off life support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-unveils-draft-rules-to-take-terminally-ill-off-life-support/articleshow/113777504.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Life support can be withdrawn from a terminally ill patient if both the primary and secondary medical boards constituted by a hospital, as well as the family or surrogate of the patient, give their consent, the health ministry has suggested.In draft guidelines released for public comment, the ministry states that many patients in ICUs are terminally ill and are not expected to benefit from life-sustaining treatments (LST), which include (but are not limited to) mechanical ventilation, surgical procedures, parenteral nutrition, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).""In such circumstances, LST are non-beneficial and increase avoidable burdens and suffering to patients and therefore, are considered excessive and inappropriate. Additionally, they increase emotional stress and economic hardship to the family and moral distress to professional caregivers. Withdrawal of LST in such patients is regarded as a standard of ICU care worldwide and upheld by several jurisdictions,"" the ministry says.Terminal illness refers to an irreversible or incurable condition from which death is inevitable in the foreseeable future. Severe devastating traumatic brain injury which shows no recovery after 72 hours or more is also included.According to the health ministry's draft guidelines, life support can be withdrawn if a patient is brain dead or prognosis suggests she or he is not likely to benefit from aggressive therapeutic interventions or in case the patient/surrogate has documented informed refusal, following prognostic awareness, to continue life support.A surrogate is a person or persons other than the healthcare providers who is/are accepted as the representatives of the patient's best interests, who will make decisions on behalf of the patient when the patient loses decision-making capacity. If the patient has made a validadvanced medical directive (AMD), the surrogate would be the person or persons named in the directive. If there is no valid AMD, the surrogate will be the next of kin (family) or the next friend or guardian (if any) of the patient.According to govt guideline, the primary medical board (PMB) which has to assess inappropriateness of life support should consist of the primary physician and at least two subject experts with at least five years of experience. After that, the decision is to be verified further by the secondary medical board (SMB) which should consist of one registered medical practitioner (RMP) nominated by the CMO and at least two subject experts. A member of the PMB cannot form part of the SMB. Additionally, govt guidelines suggest, the hospital may constitute a clinical ethics committee of multi-professional members for audit, oversight and conflict resolution.Dr R K Mani, one of the doctors involved in drafting the guidelines, told TOI that the last date for submission of comments is Oct 20. ""Any issues raised will be addressed by the expert group on behalf of the health ministry,"" he said.Dr Sumit Ray, head of critical care department at Holy Family hospital , said, ""The Supreme Court, in its wisdom, has placed the safety of the individual as the highest priority, but that unfortunately has made the process very complex and complicated and difficult to implement. But, it is surely a step forward and hopefully it will be reviewed in the near future after some experience with this process, to make it smoother and less complex, while continuing to maintain the autonomy and safety of the patient and the wishes of the family in mind,"" he said.","Life support can be withdrawn from a terminally ill patient if both the primary and secondary medical boards constituted by a hospital, as well as the family or surrogate of the patient, give their consent.

Nandini: A popular household name in South India

Leadership at KMF

The origins of

Karnataka Milk Federation

(KMF)

How KMF functions today

NEW DELHI: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam ( TTD ) has appointed ‘ Nandini ’ as the new ghee supplier, with the supply order already issued to the company. The Andhra Pradesh government took this action amid controversy over the alleged adulteration of laddus at the Tirupati temple, following claims of the use of animal fat and other substances.‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.It is Karnataka’s biggest milk brand and is also recognised in neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Goa. The ‘Nandini’ brand is owned by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Limited ( KMF ), the second-largest dairy cooperative in India, after Gujarat’s Amul.The current managing director and CEO of KMF is Karnataka administrative service officer MK Jagdish.KMF’s history dates back to 1955, when the first dairy cooperative was established in the Kodagu district of Karnataka. At that time, there was no system of packaged milk, and farmers delivered milk directly to households. There was also a shortage of milk. It wasn't until the 1970s, during India’s ‘White Revolution,’ that efforts to increase milk production took hold, supported by World Bank projects.In 1974, the Karnataka government created the Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (KDCC) to implement these dairy projects. By 1984, KDCC was renamed the Karnataka Milk Federation, and it began selling packaged milk and other products under the brand name ‘Nandini.’ Over time, ‘Nandini’ grew into Karnataka’s most popular dairy brand and expanded to neighbouring states.KMF operates 15 dairy unions throughout Karnataka, including the Bengaluru, Kolar, and Mysore Cooperative Milk Unions. These unions buy milk from village-level Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS) and deliver it to KMF for processing. According to the Karnataka Milk Federation’s website, KMF purchases over 86 lakh kilos of milk daily from 26 lakh farmers in 24,000 villages.One of KMF’s standout features is its daily payment system for milk suppliers, who are mainly small farmers and producers. The federation distributes more than Rs 28 crore in daily payments. KMF has 15 units that process and package milk, which is then sold through various channels.","‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.

Water shortage in Bengaluru: Tanker bill per house goes up to Rs 25k here,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/water-shortage-in-bengaluru-tanker-bill-per-house-goes-up-to-rs-25k-here/articleshow/113683003.cms,"The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand.

BENGALURU: Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now, forcing them to rely on very few private water tankers to meet their daily needs. The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand, and each household is spending anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 every month on water.BWSSB officials attribute the delay in addressing the issue to the pending activation of Cauvery Stage 5.Rishabh Aditya, a software engineer and new father, shared the difficulties faced by his family due to irregular water supply. ""I have an infant at home, and water has become a top priority for us. We need it for cooking, cleaning, and giving warm baths to the baby. Unfortunately, we receive no support from BWSSB, and we are forced to rely on tankers,"" he said.Aditya described the frustration of having to stay awake until late at night to ensure water delivery. ""Tankers supply water based on who books first. With more than 100 people in the layout, we often have to wait until 1am, which is exhausting,"" he said.The cost of water from tankers varies, with residents paying anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000 for a 5,000-litre load. For larger families, the expenses quickly add up. Naveenchandra Keshavmurthy, another resident, shared that his household spends Rs 20,000 to Rs 35,000 each month on water. ""We are in absolute misery because of the lack of BWSSB water supply. Despite our complaints, nothing has been done,"" he maintained.Senior citizens living in the area are also feeling the pinch, especially those who rely on pension and savings. Jaishankar V, an elderly resident, expressed concern over the financial strain caused by the ongoing crisis. ""It is painful for us, especially those who are retired. Depending on tankers every day is draining our savings, and monthly costs are overwhelming just for basic water supply,"" he lamented.Venkateshwar, a local tanker owner, said the challenges faced by operators in sourcing and supplying water to the area. ""There is a huge demand for water here, and it is difficult for us to source enough to meet everyone's needs. We charge reasonable rates, but residents still complain.""The residents approached BWSSB officials multiple times, but have only received assurances. According to BWSSB chairman Ram Prasath Manohar, the delay is due to the pending release of Cauvery Stage 5 water. ""These layouts, including Kamadhenu, were developed in 110 villages, and water supply was not originally allocated for them. However, in a few weeks, they will receive water from BWSSB. We are working to address the tanker mafia problem in the area,"" he said.","Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now.

The incident in Hosur is the latest to affect Apple's iPhone supply chain just as the company is looking to diversify beyond China and sees India as a key growth market.It is also the latest in a string of incidents to affect Apple suppliers in India over the last few years.The fire broke out near another building inside the Tata complex which will, in coming months, turn out complete iPhones. The fire was contained to one building and has been extinguished, top district administrative official K M Sarayu said, adding no decision has been made on when manufacturing can restart.Sarayu said that 523 workers were on shift when the fire broke out early morning and that all workers had been evacuated and accounted for.Tata Electronics is one of the major contract makers of iPhones in India, along with Foxconn. The company said it was investigating the cause of the fire and would take necessary steps to safeguard employees and other stakeholders. ""Our emergency protocols at the plant ensured that all employees are safe,"" a Tata Electronics spokesperson said.J Saravanan, a senior district official charged with handling industrial safety, said the injuries were all related to smoke inhalation.Production was halted and employees sent home for the day following the fire, a person with direct knowledge of the incident said, describing the blaze as chemical-related.Apple made no immediate comment on the incident.The fire began in an area used to store chemicals, a fire official said. Last year, Apple supplier Foxlink halted production at its assembly facility in Andhra Pradesh after a massive fire led part of the building to collapse.","Tata Electronics is one of the major contract makers of iPhones in India, along with Foxconn.

It’s ‘karma’ that Pakistan ills are consuming its own society: Jaishankar at UNGA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-karma-that-pakistan-ills-are-consuming-its-own-society-jaishankar-in-unga/articleshow/113773942.cms,"Jaishankar at UNGA

NEW DELHI: Foreign minister S Jaishankar lashed out at Pakistan for its PM Shehbaz Sharif 's remarks against India at the UN , saying that a dysfunctional nation coveting the lands of others must be exposed and countered.Countering Sharif's ""bizarre assertions"" in which he had spoken about an alleged Hindu supremacist agenda and claimed that the people of Kashmir had struggled for freedom like Palestinians, Jaishankar said Pakistan's cross-border terrorism policy will never succeed and it can have no expectation of impunity.On the contrary, the minister said, actions will certainly have consequences.""The issue to be resolved between us is now only the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan. And of course the abandonment of Pakistan's long-standing attachment to terrorism,"" said the minister, underscoring that terrorism is antithetical of everything that the world stands for and all its forms and manifestations must be resolutely opposed.This latest run-in comes weeks before a possible and rare visit by Jaishankar to Pakistan for a meeting of the SCO heads of governments. Government sources have not so far ruled out high-level participation by India in the meeting, in keeping with its plurilateral obligations.While addressing the UNGA , Jaishankar also said sanctioning of global terrorists by the United Nations should also not be impeded for political reasons, adding that while many countries get left behind due to circumstances beyond their control, some make conscious choices with disastrous consequences.""A premier example is our neighbour, Pakistan. Unfortunately, their misdeeds affect others as well, especially the neighbourhood. When this polity instils such fanaticism among its people, its GDP can only be measured in terms of radicalisation and its exports in the form of terrorism,"" Jaishankar said. ""Today, we see the ills it sought to visit on others consume its own society. It can't blame the world; this is only karma,"" added the minister.While delivering India’s national statement, Jaishankar also spoke about the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts saying the world cannot be fatalistic about the continuation of violence on a large scale, no more than be impervious to its broader consequences.Whether it is the war in Ukraine or the conflict in Gaza, the international community seeks urgent solutions, he said. “Respect for international law and commitments are among the foremost in that regard. If we are to ensure global security and stability, then it is essential that those who seek to lead, set the right example. Nor can we countenance egregious violations of our basic tenets,” Jaishankar said.The minister said that reforming multilateralism is an imperative and that the UN in its present form was ill-equipped to handle global challenges.“Leaving no one behind means advancing peace, ensuring sustainable development and strengthening human dignity. This cannot be delivered by a UN paralyzed when faced with division, conflict, terrorism and violence. Nor can it be advanced if access to food, fuel and fertilizer is jeopardized. When capturing markets lacks restraint, it damages the livelihood and social fabric of others,” said the minister.",Foreign minister S Jaishankar lashed out at Pakistan for its PM Shehbaz Sharif's remarks against India at the UN.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Saturday launched a ‘handbook’ with a glossary of terms that perpetuate stereotypes about disabilities that must be avoided and provides alternative, respectful language for use in legal documents, orders, and judgments.“Engaging with stereotypes and biases is crucial, as these can subtly influence legal proceedings — whether in the assumptions made about the capacity of a child with disabilities to testify or in the way their credibility is assessed,” Chief Justice of India Dhananjay Chandrachud asserted.He was speaking at the inaugural session of a two-day annual national stakeholders consultation on child protection organised under the aegis of the Juvenile Justice Committee of the Supreme Court in association with UNICEF .Chandrachud emphasised it must be ensured that the justice system, from the police stations to the courtrooms, understands and responds to the compounded vulnerabilities of children with disabilities. He also cited absence of reliable data on children with disabilities, especially those who are survivors of sexual offences or who come into conflict with the law, as a significant challenge. He said improving data collection systems must be a priority as it is the “foundation for meaningful reforms”.The ‘Handbook Concerning Persons With Disabilities ’ launched by SC on Saturday advised against use of “offensive terms such as crippled, idiot, loony, mad, junkie and retard in any derogatory contexts.” Some other descriptions to be avoided when referring to PwDs include “infirm; stunted; unfit; helpless; crippled; defected; deformed; invalid; lame; maimed; mutilated; or subnormal”.The CJI asserted that “the handbook aims to aid and sensitise not only the legal community but also society at large, in using inclusive terminology when referring to disabilities.”When referring to persons with intellectual or learning disabilities or mental health conditions, the terms to be avoided include “crazy; freak; idiot; insane; loony; mad; maniac; nut case; nuts; nutter; psycho; simpleton; stupid or unhinged”.To avoid stereotypical judgments about a person’s disability, it is stated in the handbook that rather than assuming that all persons with disabilities are “brave, heroic, inspiring, or suffering, burdened, and victimised, avoid value judgments about the person’s experience”. “Use neutral language to simply state the nature of the disability when relevant to the context,” the handbook states.Also instead of using ‘disabled person’ the handbooks recommends “using the phrasing “person with a disability” as this reflects a people-first approach. It also pointed out that some terms such as “people of determination,” “special,” and “differently abled” are also considered condescending and offensive because they stigmatise the language around disability by substituting it. “Also when possible and if in doubt, ask the individual in question how they would prefer to be described,” it is recommended.Pointing that the theme of the consultation “protection services for children with disabilities holds a special place in his heart the CJI drew upon his personal journey with his foster daughters who he shared are born with a genetic condition. “As someone who fosters two wonderful young daughters, I am reminded daily of the joy, purpose, and love they bring into my life. They have transformed not only how I see the world but also how I engage with it — strengthening my commitment to creating a more inclusive society where every child, regardless of their abilities, is cherished and protected,"" the CJI said.",The Supreme Court on Saturday launched a ‘handbook’ with a glossary of terms that perpetuate stereotypes about disabilities.

Band of 10 from Europe struck by J&K’s ‘peace and serenity’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/band-of-10-from-europe-struck-by-jks-peace-and-serenity/articleshow/113773779.cms,"Representative image

Ten tourists from Europe in J&K, some of whom had visited the region earlier during its years blighted by terrorism, have confessed to being struck by the “peace and serenity” now, more so when elections are underway.Octogenarian Glenys Gem of UK first came to Kashmir Valley when she was 43. “We first came in 1980 and were captivated by Kashmir’s beauty.This time we have arrived with our group of ten, some from Switzerland, some from Luxembourg and the rest from Germany. We’ve all been struck by the peaceful atmosphere even though local assembly elections are on here. It’s been of added interest to witness campaigning with processions and no sign of any trouble at all,” Glenys, now 87, said.For Mario and his wife Suzanne from Switzerland, there seems “a new settled feel here now, with local Kashmiris enjoying life with a new hope”.Thiele and wife Werner from Germany had similar feelings about their trip this time. Between their many sightseeing rounds, they packed in a trip to watch the second phase of elections in Srinagar on Sept 25. “We have not seen such peaceful elections in Kashmir earlier. This land was always in bad news. But this time around, the situation has changed,” Thiele said.Luxembourg’s Danielle and wife Nadine could not stop raving about the “serenity” of their Shikara (houseboat) rides on Srinagar’s Dal Lake .For UK’s Glenys, the current visit presented a contrast with some of her earlier trips. “I have visited Kashmir several times, sometimes when it was enduring serious turmoil,” she recalled. This time, it was great to relive the great memories. “We had the good fortune to stay with the Wangnoo family on their beautifully comfortableWangnoo Sheraton houseboats (on Dal Lake), then headed up by Sultan Wangnoo and now by his son Habib,” Glenys said.All this was music to the ears of those connected to tourism, once J&K’s mainstay and an area on which the Centre has renewed its focus since the 2019 abrogation of J&K’s special status. The chorus reached a crescendo last week when the Union ministry of tourism declared Aru village in J&K’s Pahalgam one of the winners of Best Tourism Villages Competition, 2024. The honour was announced on World Tourism Day on September 27.This year, the competition featured 991 villages from 30 states and Union territories; 36 villages won in various categories. Aru top-scored in adventure tourism, which includes a range of activities like trekking, skiing, and camping. Hoteliers from other parts of India have started investing in star hotels in Aru, many with local businessmen as partners, setting the stage for generation of jobs for J&K youths, said a senior tourism department official.","Ten tourists from Europe in J&K have confessed to being struck by the “peace and serenity” now, more so when elections are underway.

Health ministry comes up with new draft guidelines on passive euthanasia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/health-ministry-comes-up-with-new-draft-guidelines-on-passive-euthanasia/articleshow/113771653.cms,"NEW DELHI: Doctors should take a ""considered decision"" on withdrawal of life support in terminally ill patients on the basis of certain conditions including a documented informed refusal by the patient or their kin, according to draft guidelines by Union Health Ministry . The guidelines laid out four conditions on passive euthanasia for taking a ""considered decision in a patient's best interests, to stop or discontinue ongoing life support in a terminally ill disease that is no longer likely to benefit the patient or is likely to harm in terms of causing suffering and loss of dignity.""The conditions are whether the individual has been declared brainstem death , if there is a medical prognostication and considered opinion that the patient's disease condition is advanced and not likely to benefit from aggressive therapeutic interventions, patient/surrogate documented informed refusal, following prognostic awareness, to continue life support and compliance with procedure prescribed by the Supreme Court.The 'Draft Guidelines for Withdrawal of Life Support in Terminally Ill Patients,' also state that doctors should take a considered decision to not start a life supporting measure in a terminally ill patient that is unlikely to benefit the patient and is likely to lead to suffering and loss of dignity.In such a case, three conditions - on whether the individual has been declared brainstem death, if there is a medical prognostication and considered opinion that the patient's disease condition is advanced and not likely to benefit from aggressive therapeutic interventions, patient/surrogate documented informed refusal, following prognostic awareness - has to be taken into account.The Union ministry has invited feedback and suggestions from the stakeholders on the draft by October 20.The draft guidelines have not gone down well among the members of the medical fraternity, with the IMA's national President Dr R V Asokan stating it exposes doctors to legal scrutiny and puts them under stress.""Such clinical decisions have always been taken in good faith by doctors. The patient's relatives are explained and given all information, taken into confidence in a given case and decision is taken on merit in every single case. Putting it down in sort of guidelines and also alleging that inappropriate decisions have been taken or they have been prolonged is misunderstanding the situation,"" Dr Asokan said.""First the perception and assumption that unnecessarily machines are used and lives are prolonged is wrong. It exposes the doctors to legal scruity.""More so what is left of a doctor-patient relationship... trying to define it in four corners of black and white documentation which is legally scrutinised is nothing but exposing the doctors to further stress,"" he said.There are things which should be left to relatives, patients, and doctors based on science and situation, Dr Asokan said.The Indian Medical Association , Dr Asokan said, will study the document and submit its views seeking a revision of the draft guidelines.Terminal illness in the draft guidelines has been defined as an irreversible or incurable condition from which death is inevitable in the foreseeable future. Severe traumatic brain injury which shows no recovery after 72 hours or more is also included.The draft document states that many patients in the ICU are terminally ill, and not expected to benefit from life sustaining treatments (LST) that include (but are not limited to) mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, dialysis, surgical procedures, transfusions, parenteral nutrition or Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.""In such circumstances, LST are non-beneficial and increase avoidable burdens and suffering to patients and therefore, are considered excessive and inappropriate. Additionally, they increase emotional stress and economic hardship to the family and moral distress to professional caregivers.""Withdrawal of LST in such patients is regarded as a standard of ICU care worldwide and upheld by several jurisdictions. Such decisions have medical, ethical and legal considerations. It may be considered that the above mentioned also applies at the time of initiating Life support treatments to individuals with,"" the draft said.The draft calls for taking a considered decision not to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of anticipated cardiac arrest if there is no realistic possibility of survival or meaningful recovery.According to it, the legal principles outlined by the Supreme Court state an adult patient capable of taking healthcare decisions may refuse LST even if it results in death.Further, according to principals, LST may be withheld or withdrawn lawfully under certain conditions from people who no longer retain decision-making capacity, based on the fundamental Right to Autonomy, Privacy and Dignity and that there is an Advance Medical Directives , or AMD, that meets specified requirements is a legally valid document.AMD is a written declaration made by a person with decision-making capacity documenting how they would like to be medically treated or not treated should they lose capacity.For a patient without capacity, Foregoing of Life Support proposals should be made by consensus among a group of at least three physicians who form the Primary Medical Board (PMB).The PMB must explain the illness, the medical treatment available, alternative forms of treatment, and the consequences of remaining treated and untreated to fully inform the surrogate.A Secondary Medical Board of three physicians with one appointee by the Chief Medical Officer of the district must validate the decision by the PMB.""Active Euthanasia is the intentional act of killing a terminally ill patient on voluntary request, by the direct intervention of a doctor for the purpose of the good of the patient. It is illegal in India,"" the draft document said.","Draft guidelines laid out four conditions on passive euthanasia for taking a ""considered decision in a patient's best interests"" The conditions are whether the individual has been declared brainstem death, if there is a medical prognostication and considered opinion that the patient's disease condition is advanced.

The two consecutive decisions will push outbound shipment of the key foodgrain just ahead of an estimated bumper summer crop and when stocks at FCI warehouses are at capacity.Traders said they have started receiving calls from overseas as soon as the government order became public.India is the world's biggest exporter of rice. The government had banned export of non-basmati white rice in July 2023 and had also imposed a 20% duty on parboiled rice exports amid fear of reduction in paddy production due to below-normal rainfall. Rice export was allowed only to some countries through diplomatic channels to meet their food security requirement.Recently government also removed the ban on export of onion and MEP for basmati rice.“There is enough stock of rice in the market and also with the govt. We will have a bumper crop . It was necessary for government to remove the ban. Farmers, traders and exports have suffered losses. Now we can reassert our dominance in the global rice market. After we stopped export, countries were buying the foodgrain from Pakistan, Thailand and Vietnam. Now we can regain the market. We have started getting calls for export,” said Suraj Agarwal, CEO of Kolkata-based entity, Rice Villa.African countries, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Nepal and several western countries largely depend on Indian rice.Government sources said with Food Corporation of India (FCI) having around 390 lakh tonne of rice, more than three times of the buffer stock requirement, there will be no problem to meet food security requirements even if there is no fresh procurement. “If because of global demand our farmers get better price than MSP then it’s good.

It would be implemented in a phased manner, in three phases, in a period of almost next 30 years.Underlining the NGT’s order of April 2023 which stated that slightly over 7 sq kms of the total project area fell in the prohibited zone, Ramesh said, “Now the ministry’s counter-affidavit denies that this is the case. What is the basis of the dramatic U-turn and what confidence can be placed in the new set of facts being presented?”The ministry has, meanwhile, filed an application with the NGT, seeking a larger bench of six members to hear the pending petitions regarding the project.","The Congress has raised concerns over the way the government is going ahead with the Great Nicobar Island Development Project.

Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu has denied having an “India Out” agenda, asserting that the island nation had a “serious problem” with the presence of foreign military on its soil.Muizzu, who is in the US to attend the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly, made the remarks on Thursday while responding to a question at Princeton University’s “Dean’s Leadership Series”.“We have never been against any one country at any point. It’s not ‘India Out’. Maldives faced a serious problem with foreign military presence on this soil,” Maldivian news portal adhadhu.com quoted him as saying. “The people of Maldives do not want a single foreign soldier in the country,” he said.Ties between India and Maldives came under severe strain since November last year when Muizzu, known for his pro-China leanings, took charge as Maldivian president. Muizzu had asked India to withdraw nearly 90 Indian military personnel operating three aviation platforms gifted by the country. India withdrew its military personnel by May 10 and replaced them with civilian personnel to operate a Dornier aircraft and two helicopters.Muizzu further stressed he had taken action against deputy ministers for insulting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media. “No one should say such a thing. I took action against it. I will not accept insulting anyone like that, whether he is a leader or an ordinary person. Every human being has a reputation,” the report quoted him as saying.Earlier this year, deputy ministers in Maldives’ youth ministry were suspended for derogatory social media posts against Modi following a backlash, with New Delhi strongly raising the matter with Male. The deputy ministers criticised Modi for his post on X following his visit to Lakshadweep, inferring that it was an attempt to project the Union territory as an alternative tourist destination to the Maldives.

She further claimed that Combs impregnated her, and despite pressure from his associates to terminate the pregnancy, she experienced a miscarriage, the Deadline reported.The lawsuit outlines a troubling pattern of conduct, accusing Combs of coercing the plaintiff to consume ketamine and alcohol while subjecting her to non-consensual sexual acts while she was in an unconscious state.“At every visit, (Combs) would make her ‘perform a show’ for him and would ply her with alcohol and substances until she passed out — she would wake up with bruising and injuries but with no recollection of how she sustained her injuries,” it added.According to the lawsuit, she claims she first met the rapper at an ""overseas location,"" where he paid for her travel, and the two began seeing each other ""regularly"" afterward, BBC reported.Represented by Joseph L. Ciaccio from Napoli Shkolnik's Personal Injury Practice, Jane Doe is seeking unspecified damages.These serious allegations surface while Combs remains incarcerated, adding to a growing series of complaints. They echo those made by his former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in November 2020, as well as a separate filing byThalia Graves , who alleges that Combs and a bodyguard raped her in 2001, with footage of the incident later being sold.Nine additional plaintiffs have also come forward with similar claims. Although Combs has denied most of the allegations and pleaded not guilty in the Department of Justice case, the investigation is ongoing.Testimony from a male sex worker regarding Combs' alleged activities has emerged, potentially leading to additional charges.A Houston attorney, Tony Buzbee said that his firm is now spearheading efforts for more than fifty individuals who have allegedly suffered sexual abuse at the hands of Combs, suggesting that more claims may surface.Combs was arrested on September 16 at a Manhattan hotel and is facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering.

In an extremely wet monsoon , which broke several rainfall records, Mapusa joined the 4,000+ mm club on Saturday, as Valpoi and Sanguem were way ahead with seasonal totals of 5,536.2mm and 5,437.6mm, respectively.Eight other centres, Sanquelim, Quepem, Ponda, Old Goa, Panaji, Canacona, Pernem and Margao, had crossed the 4000mm threshold earlier.So far, Mormugao has recorded 3,886.4mm and Dabolim is at the bottom with a rainfall of 3512.1mm.This monsoon saw extremely high rainfall of 236 mm recorded as state average rainfall on July 8. It being the wettest day of the season, Panaji recorded 360.8mm and Old Goa 333.8mm in 24 hours. As the four-month monsoon will end on Sep 30, the rainfall was widespread in the state. The highest rainfall recorded by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Panaji, was 18.2 mm at Canacona.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
China is striking deals to cement its role as Asia's trade hub,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-is-striking-deals-to-cement-its-role-as-asias-trade-hub/articleshow/113778078.cms,"Ping thy neighbours (NYT photo)

HUNCHUN: China has made several moves in recent months to advance its ambitious aim to become the trade and transportation hub of Asia.To its west, China has agreed to build a rail line across Central Asia. Beijing also said it would help Vietnam plan three rail lines leading to the countries' shared border. And China is trying to persuade Russia and North Korea to let it reopen a long-closed port on the Sea of Japan.If successful, the plans would give China closer ties to the economies of Northeast and Southeast Asia , the Mideast and even the Arctic, the latest steps in its 11-year-old Belt and Road Initiative to create a more China-centered global order.Each of the efforts, in varying ways, faces obstacles. The nation's top leader, Xi Jinping, will need close cooperation from border countries, some of which are politically volatile, like Kyrgyzstan, or internationally isolated, like North Korea. Neighboring countries that have long been wary of China, like Vietnam, will need to be reassured.A similar venture, a 3-year-old rail line that China has forged into landlocked Laos in Southeast Asia, has been welcomed by some there for bringing an influx of Chinese mining investments and tourism to the country. But others have warned of Chinese domination of the Laotian economy.""They ended up owning a lot of the land, or at least using a lot of the land, and squeezing out some of the locals,"" said Ja Ian Chong, a professor at the National University of Singapore.The new initiatives would also be expensive, and China has begun emphasizing smaller Belt and Road projects elsewhere.A central factor in the country's moves is its geopolitical relationship with Russia, whose invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has both helped and hurt China's effort to build regional transport links.Russia now depends on China for trucks, drones and other supplies for the war, and has become less of a counterweight to China in struggles for regional influence. As ties have warmed between the two countries, even including many joint military exercises lately in the Sea of Japan and elsewhere, Moscow has been giving more diplomatic support to Chinese projects, notably on the short Russian border with North Korea.Yet the war in Ukraine has produced a severe labor shortage in Russia, drawing workers in from Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan, in particular, has been left with too few skilled workers to construct the rail line that China wants to build across its mountains toward Afghanistan and Iran.""The problem is not just having enough engineers and workers, but enough with the right technical training and background to stay and work in Kyrgyzstan,"" said Niva Yau, a specialist on the country at the Atlantic Council, a research group in Washington.But the collective scope of the projects shows how Xi is wielding infrastructure to cement China's role as the trade and geopolitical center of Asia.The toughest project for China, but one with a potentially big payoff, lies in trying to secure access to the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean via the Tumen River .In the mid-19th century, Russia seized from China a large area of Siberia, including a coastal strip of land that runs south to North Korea and obstructs northeastern China's access to the ocean. The Tumen River flows along more than 300 miles of China's border with North Korea, but the last 9 miles of it lie between Russia and North Korea. A low railroad bridge across the river, which the Soviet Union hurriedly built during the Korean War to haul supplies, has blocked all but fairly small boats ever since.Replacing that bridge with a taller one that would allow oceangoing ships to use the river has long been the dream of Chinese leaders. The goal is to link the Pacific Ocean with a port in Hunchun, an otherwise landlocked Chinese city a few miles up the river. Some residents of Hunchun, like Zhao Hongwei, a real estate investor, share that dream.""If there is a port, there can be trade, and we can become prosperous,"" Zhao, 49, said.For Beijing, opening Tumen River traffic would ease trade to Russia, northern Japan and the northeast coast of the Korean Peninsula and even create new shipping lanes to Europe as climate change shrinks the Arctic ice cap.""The Tumen River, as the only direct passage into the Sea of Japan, has extremely high strategic value,"" said Li Lifan, executive director of Russian and Central Asian studies at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.With Russia expressing a new willingness in recent months to replace the bridge, the big question now is North Korea's stance. Russian and North Korean officials signed their own agreement June 20 to build a highway bridge over the Tumen River.Some analysts are skeptical that North Korea will agree to removing the low bridge. The country has long tried to pit China against Russia when it has suited its geopolitical needs. North Korea, which already faces China along almost its entire northern border, may not want to see Chinese influence on the last segment with Russia.""Even if China and Russia reach agreement, they still have to persuade North Korea,"" said Hoo Chiew Ping, a Korea specialist at the East Asian International Relations Caucus in Malaysia.",China has agreed to build a rail line across Central Asia. Beijing also said it would help Vietnam plan three rail lines leading to the countries' shared border. China is trying to persuade Russia and North Korea to let it reopen a long-closed port on the Sea of Japan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113778087,imgsize-961944,width-400,resizemode-4/113778087.jpg"
