‘We Need Skilled Professionals’

On Complex Visa Process

On Indian Democracy

German Political Crisis

Trump And Europe

A Trump-Putin Deal Possible?

On Competition With China

As Germany grapples with the double whammy of an economic slump and political instability — all in the middle of a raging war in Ukraine — German ambassador to India, Philipp Ackermann , participated in a TOI editors’ roundtable to discuss a range of bilateral and global issues. In a freewheeling conversation, he spoke about the implications of Trump’s return for Europe and its likely impact on the war. Ackermann also addressed issues related to the tedious Schengen visa process and Germany’s efforts to attract more skilled professionals from India. Edited excerpts:■ Bilateral relations are at an all-time high. I have never seen such close and differentiated relations between India and Germany. The new element is migration. And the second one is that Germany has decided to become a stable security partner for India. So, we just got the latest statistics of arms exports and India is No.6 in the list, which is quite remarkable. Ukraine, of course, is No.1 but that’s not a regular arms production exchange. India is almost at the same level as the US...That shows how the German govt sees the Indian partnership and how strategic it considers the Indian partnership to be.Other than that, we have a very, very strong business connection. We have more than 2,000 German companies in India and not only the big ones, but also small and medium-sized companies who come here to try to unite mechanical production with digital solutions. We expect a growth in bilateral economic relations, not least because we very actively encourage German businesses to go elsewhere than China.■ Germany is in urgent need of skilled labour. We have changed our laws and I’d say Germany arguably has the most liberal immigration laws now. And that is a big difference between Germany and most other Western countries, including the US. We have one big disadvantage: language. But we have, I think, a certain advantage compared with other countries. And that would lead to an increase in the Indian community in Germany. We have about 260,000 Indians in Germany and that will grow over the next couple of years. We have good cooperation not just with the central govt but also state govts.■ I fully understand that the procedure (to get a Schengen visa) is seen as humiliating. (But) in the US, for a long-term visa, they ask me whether I have ever been a member of a terrorist organisation! (Laughs) The Schengen regulations are the same all over. There is no difference between Germany, Luxembourg, Estonia, Spain and Portugal. There are rulings made in Brussels and these rulings are relatively rigid.Now, let me tell you that we are doing 200,000 visas a year with an increase of 10% to 15% a year. Europe doesn’t have 10-year visas but we have fiveyear visas. We are very generous with long-term, multipleentry visas. I recommend everybody to attach a letter with their application form saying they want a long-term visa. It is not a category that you can click on but if you say you want to go several times, then our visa section is very happy to give you a long-term visa. We will digitise our visa procedure to make it easier. I think in the next year you will see much more progress. And then you should also not forget the waiting period for our visas is four weeks now. We want Indians to come to Europe.■ I’m convinced that Indian democracy works quite okay. Look at the elections to the Lok Sabha… people know ex actly what they vote for and why. When I talk to a Delhi autowallah, he tells me he votes for (Arvind) Kejriwal in state elections and (Narendra) Modi in national elections. There is a polarisation in India. But look across the world. Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands — (they have) govts with right-wing parties, which we would have never thought possible. So, polarisation is a bit of a global phenomenon... Solutions can only come from inside, not outside. I’m very encouraged by the force of the civil society here.■ After the coalition fell, there is now a very clear path to new elections. So, on Feb 23, we will have our elections, six months ahead of schedule. There are two big parties — the Conservative Party undera candidate who is running for govt office for the first time, Friedrich Merz, and the current chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who wants to get a second mandate. If you look at the (opinion) polls today, the conservative candidate has about 30-34% support. Social Democrats are in the range of 15-16% and the Greens are a little less, maybe 11-14%. And, then, there’s this right-wing party in Germany, AfD. They are nationwide between 16-18%. But then it is pretty safe to say that they will not play any role in the new govt. There is a firewall in German (politics) — this party cannot be part of any govt.■ I think we have at least a little experience of how our American friends will now govern and we are prepared. There is no doubt that for us times will be more difficult than under Biden, who was very European-oriented and a Germanophile. But I think from what we have seen of Trump, it’s possible to deal with a Trump administration, to find solutions with them.■ We would be more than thrilled if this war was over today, rather than tomorrow. It is very costly for everybody. The Russians, I’ve read, are losing up to 1,500 soldiers a day, and I’m not sure about the Ukrainians. It’s a senseless and absurd war. Now, I would say that any deal should, first and foremost, include Ukraine. So, is it possible for us to accept a deal between Trump and Putin that excludes Ukraine? I would say no. I think Trump also will reach out to Ukraine. If he cuts a deal with Russia and Ukraine where both sides can live with or agree with something, why should we not agree to it? The crucial point is the involvement and acceptance of the Ukrainians.■ The Germans were always very good with machine production. And what we see in China now, they are good and cheaper. So, in machine production, the Chinese have really caught up big time... German automotive producers really benefited in the last 15-20 years because they sold a lot of cars in China. But that’s not the case anymore. So, we are facing a certain economic crisis.I wouldn’t call it a complete crisis because we do have a little growth, but the growth is not good enough. And there are many reasons for that. We have growing competition with China and also the US to a certain extent. Another reason, of course, is the energy insecurity in the aftermath of Ukraine. Electricity in Germany is reasonably priced now. It’s not as volatile as it was after the invasion. We are in the middle of an energy transformation where 60% of our electricity is from renewables. Sometimes there’s no wind and no sun, and then the prices go up for an hour and then they go down. So, it’s a new energy system, which is good but is posing some challenges.","Philipp Ackermann: Bilateral relations are at an all-time high. We have more than 2,000 German companies in India and not only the big ones. We want Indians to come to Europe. There is a polarisation in India.

NEW DELHI: BJP received around Rs 2,244 crore in contributions of Rs 20,000 and above from individuals, trusts and corporate houses in 2023-24, which is more than three times its donations inflow in 2022-23. Congress, on the other hand, received Rs 288.9 crore through the same route in 2023-24, as against Rs 79.9 crore in the previous year.As per contribution reports of the two parties for 2023-24, now available on the EC website, BJP received Rs 723.6 crore worth of donations from Prudent Electoral Trust, which also contributed Rs 156.4 crore to Congress. Simply put, around one-third of BJP's and more than half of Congress's donations in 2023-24 came from Prudent Electoral Trust. The top donors to Prudent in 2022-23 included Megha Engg & Infra Ltd, Serum Institute, Arcelor Mittal group & Bharti Airtel.Total donations declared by BJP and Congress do not include receipts via electoral bonds, as rules require this detail to be declared by political parties only in their annual audit reports and not contribution reports. The electoral bond scheme was struck down by Supreme Court in Feb 2024, leaving contributions, either received directly or through the electoral trust route, as the primary source of funding for political parties.Some regional parties, however, have voluntarily declared their receipts through electoral bonds in their 2023-24 contribution reports. These include BRS, which received Rs 495.5 crore in bonds; DMK, which received Rs 60 crore and YSR Congress that got Rs 121.5 crore through the now-defunct instrument. JMM declared Rs 11.5 crore receipts through bonds, though its other contributions were just over Rs 64 lakh.BJP recorded a 212% rise in its contributions in 2023-24, compared to the previous year, though this is not unusual since it was the year before general elections. In 2018-19, the year before 2019 general election, BJP had declared contributions worth Rs 742 crore, and Congress, worth Rs 146.8 crore.BJP received Rs 850 crore through the electoral trust route, of which over Rs 723 crore came from Prudent, Rs 127 crore from Triumph Electoral Trust and Rs 17.2 lakh from Einzigartig Electoral Trust. Congress received over Rs 156 crore through the trusts route, though Prudent was the sole donor here.Prudent also contributed Rs 85 crore and Rs 62.5 crore to BRS and YSR Congress respectively in 2023-24, both of which were voted out of office the same year. TDP, now the governing party in Andhra Pradesh, received Rs 33 crore from Prudent. DMK received Rs 8 crore from Triumph Electoral Trust and Jayabharath Trust.Interestingly, BJP has declared Rs 3 crore worth of donations from Future Gaming and Hotel Services in 2023-24, the company owned by Santiago Martin, also known as the 'Lottery King' of India. Future Gaming was the biggest donor through the electoral bonds route, with Trinamool Congress being the top beneficiary. Martin is under the lens of Enforcement Directorate and income-tax department for alleged money laundering.Among other national parties, AAP declared contributions worth 11.1 crore in 2023-24, down from Rs 37.1 crore the previous year. CPM's contributions went up to Rs 7.6 crore in 2023-24 from Rs 6.1 crore in 2022-23. National People's Party, which is in office in Meghalaya, declared Rs 14.8 lakh in contributions. BSP declared nil donations in excess of Rs 20,000 yet again. BJD too declared nil donations for FY 2023-24.TDP declared contributions of over Rs 100 crore in 2023-24, BJD nil and Samajwadi Party Rs 46.7 lakh as compared to Rs 33 crore the previous year.","BJP received around Rs 2,244 crore in contributions of Rs 20,000 and above from individuals, trusts and corporate houses in 2023-24.

NEW DELHI: Three years ago, on January 19, 2022, a Gujarati family - 39-year-old Jagdish Patel, wife Vaishali (35), daughter (11) and son (3) - froze to death on the US-Canada border in Manitoba while trying to illegally cross over to the US. The traffickers had left the family in the middle of a snowstorm at -37 degrees Celsius.Three years later, a money laundering probe by the ED against the agents involved in the Patel family case has found an international syndicate of human traffickers that includes at least 260 colleges in Canada that issued student visas to ""illegal migrants"" to take the Canadian route to the US.Those who found the student visa route more convenient, compared to the 'donkey route', paid around Rs 50-60 lakh each to the agents to arrange their student visa and travel to Canada before being ""pushed"" into the US. The probe is still under progress on the transactions of the Canadian colleges and how much money they made from such ""illegal migrants"".""Investigations reveal that to send Indians to the US illegally, the agents arranged their admission in colleges/universities in Canada and sent them on student visas. Once in Canada, instead of joining the college, they illegally crossed the US-Canada border,"" ED said.On December 10 and 19, ED carried out searches at eight premises across Mumbai, Nagpur, Gandhinagar and Vadodara on several agents who were involved in sending illegal migrants through these Canadian colleges.""During searches, it was found that around 35,000 illegal migrants are sent abroad every year by just two agents, based in Mumbai and Nagpur,"" ED said on Wednesday. The probe also found that around 1,700 agents/partners in Gujarat and around 3,500 across India were involved in this racket. ED estimates that more than 800 agents are still active despite a multi-agency crackdown on them.The agency said its probe found that at least two such agents based in Mumbai and Nagpur have signed agreements with several universities and colleges abroad for admission of students on commission basis. All potential illegal migrants are then prepared with required documentation for a student visa.During the searches, ED seized Rs 19 lakh in bank accounts of the accused besides seizure of documents and digital devices. The money laundering case is based on an FIR registered by Ahmedabad police against accused Bhavesh Patel, an agent involved in arranging the travel of Jagdish Patel (of Dingucha village) and his family in 2022.","Three years ago, a Gujarati family - 39-year-old Jagdish Patel, wife Vaishali (35), daughter (11) and son (3) - froze to death on the US-Canada border in Manitoba.

GST Council's popcorn taxation sparks backlash on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-gst-rates-on-popcorn-spark-backlash-on-social-media/articleshow/116601956.cms,"NEW DELHI: The GST Council's proposal to levy different tax rates on popcorn based on whether it contains sugar or salt has faced extensive backlash on social media, with two former government economic advisers criticising the taxation framework established in 2017.The GST Council, led by the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Saturday proposed 5% GST for non-branded popcorn with salt and spices, 12% for pre-packaged and branded varieties, and 18% for caramel popcorn, classified under sugar confectionery.The Union finance minister defended the 18% tax on caramel popcorn, stating that items containing added sugar attracts different taxation.Later, the GST Council issued a clarification, saying that pre-packed and labelled ready-to-eat snacks will attract a 12 per cent tax while an 18 per cent GST will be levied if it is caramelised. There is no change in the tax rate of popcorn and the GST Council has only agreed that the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) will issue a circular clarifying the current taxation regime of popcorn.However, opposition politicians, economists and government supporters expressed their disapproval while others responded with humour and satire.""Complexity is a bureaucrat's delight and citizens' nightmare,"" said former Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian on X, questioning the decision's value given its minimal revenue impact and public inconvenience.Additionally, his predecessor Arvind Subramanian, criticised the move for increasing complexity rather than simplifying the system, mentioning issues with enforcement and rationality.Meanwhile, Congress party leader and spokesman Jairam Ramesh criticised the ""absurdity of three different tax slabs for popcorn under GST"", saying how it exemplifies the increasing complexity of what was intended to be a straightforward tax system.","GST Council proposed 5% GST for non-branded popcorn with salt and spices, 12% for pre-packaged and branded varieties, and 18% for caramel popcorn, classified under sugar confectionery.

Their objective was just that and people never benefitted,"" Modi said.""After taking charge of the Prime Minister's office, I reviewed past projects and I was amazed.

India to commission 2 frontline warships & a sub in New Year in big boost to blue-water capabilities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-commission-2-frontline-warships-a-sub-in-new-year-in-big-boost-to-blue-water-capabilities/articleshow/116650145.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major boost to India’s blue-water combat capabilities to counter China’s ever-expanding footprint in the Indian Ocean Region and beyond, the Navy is all set to commission two indigenous frontline warships and a diesel-electric submarine next month, even as the new Russian-built frigate INS Tushil also heads home.The biggest of the new warships will be the guided-missile destroyer Surat, with a displacement of 7,400-tonne, followed by stealth frigate Nilgiri (6,670-tonne) and submarine Vagsheer (1,600-tonne), all of which are packed with heavy-duty sensors and weapons for a deadly punch.Surat and Nilgiri were delivered to the Navy by the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) last week. On commissioning, the 164-metre-long Surat will join the first three such warships, INS Visakhapatnam, INS Mormugao and INS Imphal, constructed under the Rs 35,000 crore Project-15B at MDL.“Surat is also the Navy’s first AI-enabled warship to enhance its operational efficiency manifold times,” an officer said. With an indigenous content of 72% and endurance of 4,000 nautical miles, these destroyers are armed with BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, Barak-8 medium-range surface-to-air missiles, 76mm super rapid guns and anti-submarine weapons like rockets and torpedoes.Nilgiri, in turn, is the first of the seven multi-role frigates being constructed under Project-17A, four at the MDL and three at GRSE in Kolkata, at an overall cost of around Rs 45,000 crore.All these seven frigates, with the requisite hull-shaping, radar-transparent deck fittings and other measures to make their detection by enemies difficult, are slated for delivery by late-2026.Vagsheer is the sixth and last of the French-origin Scorpene or Kalvari-class submarines built at MDL under the over Rs 23,000 crore `Project-75’. India and France are now also in final negotiations for three more Scorpenes to be built at MDL for around Rs 36,000 crore, with the first slated to roll out in six years, followed by the other two at intervals of a year each.Overall, the Navy now has 60 warships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards.

""These days, all documents and communications are digitally stored, either in phones or laptops/computers. Where do you look for evidence if you don't recover them from phones or other digital devices?"" a source said.An SC bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Pankaj Mithal, while posting the matter for Feb 17, accepted Martin's prayer to ""issue an ex-parte interim order directing the respondents not to access and copy the contents of mobile phone iPhone 15 Pro"", besides other electronic devices (phones, laptops/computers) seized from his employees.The court also accepted his request for ""ex-parte interim order staying the effect and operation of summons"" issued to him. The agency, Martin argued in his petition, wanted his presence in the ED office ""for the purpose of extraction of data stored in the respective digital devices"" with regard to an ongoing investigation against him. ""In the meanwhile, there will be ad-interim relief in terms of prayer clauses (i) and (ii) of the application for interim relief,"" the bench said.Martin was the biggest political donor, with electoral bonds worth Rs 1,368 crore, and the biggest beneficiary was DMK, with Rs 509 crore of contributions received from him. The ED had fought to restart the investigation against Martin after two years of court battles where the PMLA probe was closed by an SC order after the Tamil Nadu police withdrew the predicate offence (FIR) based on which ED had initiated its money laundering case.The probe restarted last month after Madras HM asked Tamil Nadu police in Oct to restore the FIR as there was enough evidence against Martin to proceed against him. During a search on his premises in Chennai and Kolkata last month, ED officials seized Rs 12 crore in unaccounted cash and several electronic devices and iPhones. The ED had issued summons to Martin to appear before the investigating officer when his phone would be unlocked in his presence to gather evidence related to the case.","The top court has also put on hold summons issued to Martin for two months.

He was 91.As an accomplished chronicler of Nair tharavadus (traditional upper caste households) in terminal decline, Nair - aka MT - wove in lived experiences into seminal novels, starting from Nalukettu, his first. He won the Kerala Sahitya Akademi award at 25 for it.Asuravithu (The Demon Seed, 1962), Manju (Mist, 1964) and Kaalam (Time, 1969) trod the same path, as did Arabiponnu, which he co-authored with NP Mohammed. Randamoozham, which explored Mahabharata from the perspective of Bhim, was as radical as it was riveting. Varanasi, written in the late 1990s, was MT's last novel.At his peak, MT had a huge influence on Malayalam cinema too, where his themes reflected broad and diverse realities. His women characters, unlike those in his novels, were often liberated and lived on their terms. He wrote screenplays for 54 films and won national awards for Best Screenplay four times - for Vadakkan Veeragatha, Kadavu, Sadayam and Parinayam.Born on July 15, 1933, in Kudallur as the youngest of the four sons of T Narayanan Nair and Ammalu Amma, MT's literary journey began early. He quickly became known for his storytelling prowess, as well as his poignant and touching portrayal of the human condition, through stories and characters strongly rooted in his village of Kudallur.MT graduated from Government Victoria College, Palakkad, in chemistry in 1953 and taught for a while at MB Tutorial College in Palakkad. The proprietors of the college published a magazine called Malayali, to which MT often contributed. His first short story, Raktam Puranda Mantharikal, was published while he was studying at Victoria College. At 20, he won the first prize in the World Short Story Competition by New York Herald Tribune.In 1956, MT joined Malayalam weekly Mathrubhumi as a sub-editor and later became its editor in 1968.MT ventured into the film industry in the mid-1960s, when Malayalam cinema was evolving and seeking to find a unique narrative style and visual language. His first screenplay, Murappennu (1965) was followed by a succession of films that solidified his reputation. MT quickly became the most acclaimed and in-demand screenwriter in Malayalam cinema, penning some of the greatest hits like Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha.MT also directed six films, including Nirmalyam (1973) which won National Award.As literary editor, MT made seminal contributions to Malayalam literature by finding out and fostering a generation of writers. He won the Jnanpith Award in 2005 and was honoured with the Padma Bhushan in 2005.MT married writer- translator Prameela in 1965, from whom he separated after 11 years. He later married dancer Kalamandalam Sarawathi.

The extradition of Hasina, who faces 51 cases, including 42 for murder, is governed by the extradition treaty signed between Bangladesh and India in 2013 and amended in 2016. The treaty states that ""extradition may be refused if the offence for which it is requested is an offence of a political character.""However, it also specifies that certain offences, such as murder, ""shall not be regarded as offences of a political character"" for the purposes of the treaty. One ground for refusal of extradition is if the charges being pressed have not been ""made in good faith, in the interest of justice,"" according to the BSS report.","Bangladesh sent India a note verbale (formal diplomatic note), requesting extradition of its ousted PM Sheikh Hasina.

Removing H1B cap for Indians? David Sacks and Elon Musk back Sriram Krishnan's views on green cards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/removing-h1b-cap-for-indians-david-sacks-and-elon-musk-back-sriram-krishnans-views-on-green-cards/articleshow/116631049.cms,"Laura Loomer's Critique



Accusations that Krishnan’s policies prioritize foreign workers over American STEM graduates.

Criticism of Trump for allowing individuals she deemed ""career leftists"" to hold positions in his administration.

The Controversy Around H-1B Policies



Defending Sriram Krishnan’s Policies



Highly skilled immigrants contribute significantly to the US economy, founding companies and creating jobs.

Immigration reforms that prioritize merit can strengthen America’s position as a leader in technology and entrepreneurship.

Krishnan’s proposals aim to address inefficiencies in the current system, not to undermine American workers.

Misinterpretations and Political Backlash



The Role of AI and Immigration in US Policy



Indians and the H-1B Visa



The appointment of Sriram Krishnan as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has sparked a heated debate online. Laura Loomer , a far-right commentator, took to X (formerly Twitter) to express her disapproval, claiming Krishnan’s appointment was inconsistent with the ""America First"" agenda. She criticized his support for immigration reforms, including the removal of country-specific caps on green cards, as undermining American STEM graduates and the domestic job market.Loomer’s accusations prompted swift rebuttals from prominent figures like David Sacks and Elon Musk . Sacks clarified the nuances of Krishnan’s views, stating, ""Point of clarification: Sriram didn’t say he wants to remove all caps on green cards. He said he wants to remove country caps on green cards. Right now, every country in the world gets allocated the same number of green cards, no matter how many qualified applicants it has. So applicants from India have an 11-year wait, whereas applicants from many other countries have no wait at all. Sriram still supports skills-based criteria for receiving a green card, not making the program unlimited.""Elon Musk succinctly supported Sacks’ position, commenting, ""Makes sense.""Loomer’s original post expressed concerns about Krishnan’s alleged alignment with policies she described as harmful to American workers. She labeled his appointment a betrayal of Trump’s ""America First"" agenda and suggested that figures like Krishnan were attempting to enrich themselves through government contracts.Loomer’s claims included:The H-1B visa program, which allows US companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialized fields, has long been a contentious issue. Critics argue that the program is often abused, with companies using it to undercut wages and displace American workers. Others view it as a vital tool for attracting global talent, especially in STEM fields.Krishnan’s advocacy for removing country-specific caps on green cards—not eliminating caps entirely—has been misinterpreted by detractors like Loomer. Current immigration laws allocate the same number of green cards to every country, regardless of demand. This creates significant delays for applicants from high-demand countries like India, who often wait over a decade for approval, while applicants from low-demand countries face no such delays. Krishnan’s position is that merit-based reforms would streamline the process for skilled workers, ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in the global tech economy.Supporters of Krishnan’s policies, including influential voices like Sacks and Musk, emphasize the importance of attracting skilled immigrants to foster innovation. They argue that:Loomer’s criticism reflects broader concerns among some conservatives about immigration policy and its impact on American workers. However, her framing of Krishnan as a ""career leftist"" and opponent of the ""America First"" agenda has been widely debunked. Krishnan’s track record includes notable achievements in the tech industry, investments in American companies, and a commitment to fostering innovation domestically.As Senior Policy Advisor for AI, Krishnan’s primary focus will be shaping the nation’s strategy on artificial intelligence. However, the debate surrounding his appointment underscores the intersection of technology, immigration, and politics. While some view his stance as progressive, others interpret it as a challenge to traditional conservative values. The ongoing discourse highlights the complexities of balancing economic growth, national security, and immigration reform in an increasingly competitive global landscape.The H-1B visa issue for Indians stems from systemic inefficiencies and outdated immigration policies in the US, particularly around green card allocation. The primary bottleneck lies in the per-country cap on employment-based green cards, which limits the number of green cards any single country can receive annually to 7% of the total pool. This cap applies uniformly, regardless of the size of a country’s population or the demand for visas from its citizens.India, with its large pool of highly skilled professionals, particularly in technology and STEM fields, produces a disproportionately high number of applicants for H-1B visas and green cards. Due to the 7% cap, Indian applicants face staggering delays—sometimes waiting over a decade for green card approval. In contrast, applicants from smaller countries with fewer applicants may experience little to no wait time.The H-1B program allows US companies to hire foreign workers in specialized fields, but these workers often aim to transition to permanent residency through green cards. The backlog disproportionately affects Indians, as the demand from this group far exceeds the allocated number of green cards. This leads to years of uncertainty for workers and their families, with challenges like visa renewals, restrictions on job mobility, and limitations on spousal employment.Advocates for reform, including figures like Sriram Krishnan, propose removing country-specific caps to prioritize merit and streamline the process for skilled workers. Critics argue that such reforms might disadvantage American workers by intensifying competition. However, supporters emphasize that highly skilled immigrants drive innovation, create jobs, and strengthen the US economy. Addressing this issue requires balancing global competitiveness with fairness in immigration policy to alleviate backlogs and retain top talent in the US.","Sriram Krishnan is the Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. His appointment has sparked a heated debate online. Laura Loomer, a far-right commentator, claimed Krishnan’s appointment was inconsistent with the ""America First"" agenda.

The GST Council recently made an announcement on the tax structure of popcorn, triggering a flood of online jokes and confusion. The council held its 55th meeting and ruled out any alteration in the current tax regime and categorised popcorn into several categories depending upon their mode of preparation. Caramelised popcorn, which is sweet, is taxed at a higher rate, 18% whereas plain or salted popcorn attracts 5-12% tax.

Here's a break-up of the GST rates:This is because of the method of preparation and the characteristics of each type of popcorn. For example, caramelised popcorn, which falls under sugar confectionery, attracts a higher rate of GST since it contains sugar, while salted popcorn remains at a lower rate because of its simplicity.

So, what’s the money for? Inquiring minds want to know …

Elon Musk’s $1 billion proposal to rename Wikipedia remains on the table. The offer, initially made in response to a post declaring, “Wikipedia is not for sale,” comes with a validity of at least one year, according to Musk.Doge Designer , a frequent recipient of Musk’s interactions on X, recently shared the original post, prompting Musk to reaffirm that his offer is still active.“Elon Musk once offered Wikipedia $1 billion to change their name to ‘ Dickipedia ’,” the post from Doge Designer read.Musk was quick to respond saying, “True. Offer still stands.”Whether Wikipedia will take Musk up on his offer remains to be seen. However, the offer itself – extended in October last year – has generated significant attention.Last year, Musk shared a photo which read, “Wikipedia is not for sale”. Musk criticised it by saying:Then in a separate post, he said, “I will give them a billion dollars if they change their name to Dickipedia”, adding that he would do so “in the interests of accuracy.”When a user responded saying, “@Wikipedia, Do it! You can always change it back after you collect,"" Musk replied by saying, “One year minimum. I mean, I'm not a fool lol.”","Elon Musk’s $1 billion proposal to rename Wikipedia remains on the table.

The enigmatic Brazilian prophet Athos Salomé , often referred to as the "" Living Nostradamus ,"" has once again sent shockwaves through the global community. Known for his alleged foresight of events like the COVID-19 pandemic, Queen Elizabeth II’s passing, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Salomé has now unveiled his predictions for 2025—and they are nothing short of extraordinary.Salomé has again painted a chilling panorama of breakthroughs, crises, and revelations that could redefine humanity's future, as per the report by the Daily Star.Salomé predicts that secret genetic experiments will finally be revealed, introducing humanity to genetically modified individuals designed to be smarter, stronger, and disease-resistant. Governments and corporations, using technologies like CRISPR and cloning, have allegedly been creating ""perfected"" humans in clandestine labs.Key insights:According to Salomé, 2025 could witness a digital apocalypse as artificial intelligence reaches a critical tipping point. Autonomous AI systems, some rumored to exhibit rudimentary self-awareness, could make irreversible decisions in key areas like cybersecurity and transportation.The big question: How will humanity respond to the realization that it has created a force beyond its control?Salomé claims 2025 will be the year governments officially acknowledge the existence of extraterrestrial life. Evidence may include microbial findings on Mars or proof of advanced civilizations.A global energy crisis, Salomé warns, will be engineered to maintain control. While revolutionary technologies like zero-point energy generators exist, they remain deliberately concealed.Implications:Salomé foresees the widespread adoption of implantable chips under the guise of health and security advancements. However, these chips could become tools for mass surveillance, suppressing dissent.The warning: The groundwork laid during the Covid-19 pandemic could make this transition smoother than expected.Salomé also predicts geoengineering could trigger unprecedented climate disasters, with hurricanes and droughts appearing in unexpected regions. He hints at weather manipulation technologies being used as tools of war and economic dominance.Underground bases, gravitational propulsion systems, and futuristic weapons like direct-energy systems will finally be exposed, Salomé predicts.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Trump’s vision for AI leadership

The

immigration debate

reignited

A divisive narrative

David Sacks , the President-elect’s nominee for White House AI and Crypto Czar , has launched a scathing attack on critics targeting Sriram Krishnan , calling the backlash a “cabal” driven by misinformation and divisive agendas. Sacks took to X (formerly Twitter) and said, ""This whole cabal against Sriram is totally out of control. There’s no self-serving agenda whatsoever here, nor character flaws. We should celebrate people like Sriram who are going to leave so much $ on the table to serve the country. Enough of this nonsense.”The controversy erupted last week after Donald Trump nominated Krishnan, an Indian-American entrepreneur, as senior policy advisor for Artificial Intelligence .Social media backlash quickly followed, fueled by far-right commentators like Laura Loomer. The criticism ranged from immigration fears to baseless allegations about Krishnan’s US citizenship and supposed political contributions to Kamala Harris.In a series of tweets, Sacks tore into the criticisms, suggesting they were part of a calculated effort to derail the conversation around pressing issues like illegal immigration. He wrote, “A recap of the past few days: A woman was burned alive by an illegal migrant on the NY Subway. The whole country was unified in its outrage. Everyone wants to seal the border and stop migrant crime.""Then the online conversation suddenly shifted to a non-existent threat of unlimited H1Bs by attacking a tech appointee who has never advocated for that position, Sacks noted. ""His remit doesn’t even include immigration.""""When I corrected the record, the lies just shifted, including to some nasty attacks that he wasn’t a US citizen, and a false accusation that he contributed to Kamala Harris. Hard to say what’s going on here, but it seems like a division grift if I’ve ever seen one.""Sacks further criticized the misplaced outrage over employment visas compared to the broader issue of illegal immigration. “Number of illegal aliens/year: 3+ million. Number of employment visas/year: 140k. As a start, maybe we should focus on the 95% where we all agree,” he wrote on X.Announcing the appointment last week, Donald Trump said Krishnan would play a pivotal role in advancing US leadership in artificial intelligence. Trump said, “Working closely with David Sacks, Sriram will focus on ensuring continued American leadership in AI, and help shape and coordinate AI policy across Government, including working with the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.”Krishnan, who began his career at Microsoft as a founding member of Windows Azure, is considered a rising star in the tech world. Trump’s decision to pair him with Sacks reflects a commitment to leveraging private-sector talent for public policy.Although Krishnan’s role is unrelated to immigration, his appointment has sparked renewed discussion about the US visa system. Critics have tied his nomination to concerns over H1B visas and the longstanding green card backlog disproportionately affecting countries like India.According to the Immigration Act of 1990, every country is allocated an equal number of green cards regardless of population size, creating a massive backlog for countries with larger populations. For instance, India, with a population of 1.4 billion, faces the same quota as the Marshall Islands, home to just 36,930 people.This imbalance forces skilled immigrants from India to endure decades-long waits for green cards, restricting their ability to work, travel, or settle permanently in the US Krishnan, along with figures like Sacks and Elon Musk, has been vocal about attracting global talent to strengthen the American economy, an argument that stands at odds with the recent criticism.The backlash against Krishnan underscores the polarization surrounding Trump’s cabinet picks. Sacks, however, remains firm in his defense, portraying Krishnan as a patriotic figure making personal sacrifices to serve the country.As Sacks put it: “We should celebrate people like Sriram who are going to leave so much $ on the table to serve the country.”","David Sacks, the President-elect’s nominee for White House AI and Crypto Czar, has launched a scathing attack on critics targeting Sriram Krishnan.

How Mangione's Christmas has been in jail



Prison consultant Sam Mangel who is working with other inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center revealed that Luigi Mangione is sleeping on a mattress that's 2 inches thick at best and has no separate pillow The mattress has a little bump in the end for a pillow, the consultant told People. He is not working with Mangione but his revelations are based on what generally happens to other prisoners. For example, Mangel revealed that Mangione's Christmas meal must have been green beans and a meal of Cornish hen.Mangel said depending on which section Mangion has been housed in, he could either be entirely alone or have some form of company. It was not known whether Mangione was removed from protective custody where inmates are initially taken for monitoring purposes. Mangel revealed that if he is in protective custody, he will be alone in his cell on Christmas day with his food being provided to him through a sliding window.High-profile units like Diddy and Bankman-Fried have provision for an hour-long visit from family members on Christmas Day. ""While you're allowed to hug the person when they come in, you can't be next to them, you have to face them [when seated],"" Mangel says.Inmates in this section are typically given a holiday bag from staff, he says, which could include an extra bag of hot chocolate, cinnamon buns and eggnog.In the common area of the jail, Mangione will be allowed to be with the other inmates where they can watch sports and play board games.MCD is known as the hell on earth because of its abysmal healthcare facility. Luigi Mangione has been in this jail since December 19 after he was brought to New York from Pennsylvania.Mangione's stay in the Pennsylvania jail was smooth as he had admirers inside the jail. He also got a glow-up, a haircut and a shaving inside the jail before he was shifted to New York. Reports claimed that other inmates arranged for Luigi Mangione's glow-up inside the jail as he became popular there.","Prison consultant Sam Mangel who is working with other inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center revealed that Luigi Mangione is sleeping on a mattress that's 2 inches thick at best and has no separate pillow.

What is the H-1B row and how are David Sacks, Krishnan and Laura Loomer part of it?



David Sacks who will be working with Sriram Krishnan on artificial intelligence on the part of the incoming Donald Trump administration issued a reminder to the MAGA exponents amid the ongoing H-1B row . Sacks reminded that in 2022, it was the same Krishnan, Sacks and Elon Musk who were working toward restoring the then-Twitter (now X) accounts of the MAGA people. ""Many were grateful at the time,"" David Sacks wrote targeting Laura Loomer who has been at the center of this new flashpoint over Indian immigrants in the US and the H-1B.""Since people are digging up old tweets, here’s one of @sriramk working with me and @elonmusk to restore free speech on Twitter and get MAGA their accounts back. Many were grateful at the time. Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah!"" David Sacks wrote.Elon Musk reacted to it saying 'good times' as he has been supporting Krishnan's call to remove the country caps for green cards.Sriram Krishnan recently suggested to Elon Musk that anything to remove country caps for green cards would be huge. This was before his nomination for the AI role. MAGA activist Laura Loomer called out Sriram Krishnan for undermining America First and opening jobs for more Indians by removing the cap on H-1B.David Sacks clarified that Sriram did not say he wanted to remove all caps on green cards. ""He said he wants to remove ""country"" caps on green cards. Right now, every country in the world gets allocated the same number of green cards, no matter how many qualified applicants it has. So applicants from India have an 11 year wait whereas applicants from many other countries have no wait at all,"" Sacks said. Elon Musk supported this argument.Laura Loomer kept on ranting against India and Indians in her fight against Elon Musk, David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan. She also replied to David Sacks' reminder that they worked toward restoring her Twitter account. She said she is grateful that her X account was restored by Elon Musk but she would still push for accountability from big tech.""Dining with Trump is a reward. Advising the Trump admin is a reward.

'Diddy can handle s**t but Mangione is scared'



'It's like living in your bathroom'



Inmates get Christmas snack



A prison expert said Luigi Mangione , the accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson , will soon be on psych meds inside the Brooklyn jail which is known as the hell on earth. Larry Levine, the director and founder of Wall Street Prison Consultants, told the US Sun that Mangione would soon turn into a zombie as prison life is not what he's been prepared for and not the this infamous prison at least.Larry Levine said Luigi's mind is a ""little f**ked up"" right now as he never thought that he'd be in the feds. It is the same jail where Diddy had been held since his arrest in September. But Diddy and Luigi Mangione are different, Levine said analyzing both of their response to the arrests.""Luigi is acclimating himself to his new surroundings. His lawyers are thanking God he's in New York, and they don't have to travel to Pennsylvania to visit him. So he's just adjusting to where he's at.""""But Diddy can handle his s**t. I just know Mangione is f**king scared, and now they're probably trying to force-feed him. They're gonna offer him psych meds. He's gonna be like a f**king zombie. That's a given.""Levine served 10 years in federal prison on racketeering, securities fraud, obstruction of justice, and narcotics trafficking charges.Levine said if Mangione is living in a cell like Diddy was for a while, it would be like living in your bathroom. There is no TV, no computer and nothing to read except the Bible. Even in jail, Mangione has no dearth of funds as money is pouring in for the accused killer from all corners but there is no good food that he can buy in that jail, Levine said. Mangione can have cheese crackers and maybe a bottle of a soda and everything is knock-offs, no original food is available.Traditionally, the inmates get a Christmas or holiday snack including goodies such as cookies, potato chops and candy. ""It's a bunch of crap that probably was purchased because it was out of date because the prison system sells you out-of-date stuff. And they're trying to act like they're doing the inmates a favor,"" Levine said.Mangione pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges in his recent production in the court. His lawyer Karen Agnifilo blasted New York mayor Eric Adams for orchestrating Mangione's perp walk and said her client is being treated as a political fodder, a human ping-pong ball.","Luigi Mangione will be put on a steady diet of psych meds, a prison expert said.
