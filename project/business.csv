Voiding our own orders will weaken court's authority: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/voiding-our-own-orders-will-weaken-courts-authority-sc/articleshow/125602727.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday turned its critical gaze on its own functioning. On the growing trend of benches overturning orders of earlier ones within days or months of them being pronounced - such as on the menace of dog bites, retrospective environmental clearance, Bhushan Steel Ltd's insolvency and the ban on fire crackers - the apex court observed ""painfully"" that the practice would ""undermine this court's authority"".In another instance, though it was done through a curative petition filed against SC's 2021 verdict on the dispute between Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and Reliance Infrastructure's Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Ltd (DAMEPL), the court had overruled the judgment last year, quashing the Rs 7,687-crore award in favour of DAMEPL.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih said that public confidence in the judiciary would be undermined if cases were reopened and special benches set up to re-hear them at the behest of parties aggrieved by the verdicts.Quoting Justice Robert Jackson, it said, ""We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.""""In the recent past, we have rather painfully observed a growing trend in this court (of which we too are an indispensable part) of verdicts pronounced by judges, whether still in office or not and irrespective of the time lapse since the pronouncement, being overturned by succeeding benches or specially constituted benches at the behest of some party aggrieved by the verdicts prior in point of time.To us, the object of Article 141 of the Constitution seems to be this: the pronouncement of a verdict by a bench on a particular issue of law (arising out of the facts involved) should settle the controversy, being final, and has to be followed by all courts as law declared by SC,"" the bench said.It said that if a verdict was allowed to be reopened, the very purpose of enacting Article 141 (law declared by SC is binding) would stand defeated. The court passed the order while hearing a plea seeking relaxation of bail conditions for an accused who was directed not to leave Kolkata during trial of a murder case. The court noted that he had filed an application after the retirement of the apex court judge who had imposed the condition, and dismissed his plea.The bench held that judicial discipline, propriety and comity demanded that a succeeding bench of different judges defers to the view expressed by the earlier bench, unless there was something so grossly erroneous on the face of the record or palpably wrong that it necessitated a relook in exercise of inherent jurisdiction either through a review or curative petition. ""...As judges of this court, we are alive to the position that overturning a prior verdict by a later verdict does not necessarily mean that justice is better served,"" the bench said.""However, with an over looming sense of dissatisfaction and remorse, we propose not to walk that path. While it is true that in a case of the present nature - where an issue of a citizen's right to move freely throughout the territory of India is involved - the principle of finality may not be applied strictly against the party whose right has been so restricted, but the antecedent facts in the light whereof the restriction is imposed assume significance and must, of necessity, bear serious thought. Any restrictive order of the nature under consideration has to be and must be premised on some worthy reason,"" the bench said.","Supreme Court turned its critical gaze on its own functioning.

Experts Analyse India-China Diplomatic Row After Shanghai Airport Incident

Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

New Labour Codes: Why will your take home pay go down?

Mandatory retirement contributions, including provident fund and gratuity payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages.

and payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages. The new regulation requires that an employee's basic salary must constitute at least 50% of their total CTC, or meet the government-specified percentage.

This adjustment will lead to higher contributions as both PF and gratuity calculations are based on an individual’s basic pay .

. Whilst this change ensures enhanced retirement benefits for workers, it also means reduced take-home pay, as the increased contributions will come from the existing CTC.

The regulation concerning basic salary aims to stop organisations from intentionally maintaining low basic salary whilst increasing allowances to reduce their obligations towards retirement benefits and gratuity.

Currently, PF contributions are set at 12% of the basic salary, whilst gratuity payments are determined by the final basic pay and tenure at an organisation.

New labour Codes: Impact on Take-Home Salary

.

New Labour Codes: Top points to know

.

New labour codes 2025: In a significant move, the government has notified the new labour laws that may require companies to ensure that the basic salary makes up at least 50% of the total cost-to-company (CTC). This could potentially prompt changes in how pay packages are structured. As a result, for many employees, take-home pay could come down over time as contributions to retirement savings are likely to rise.With the new labour codes, the Narendra Modi government has unified 29 labour-related central laws into four extensive Labour Codes: the Code on Wages (2019), Industrial Relations Code (2020), Code on Social Security (2020), and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code (2020). Starting November 21, 2025, these Codes seek to simplify regulatory compliance, enhance worker safeguards, and modernise India's workforce regulations in accordance with contemporary economic conditions.The Code on Wages became operational on Friday, with the government expected to announce detailed rules within the next 45 days. Companies will need to restructure their salary frameworks to comply with these new regulations.According to experts, employees might receive reduced take-home pay under the new rules, as both provident fund and gratuity contributions would increase within the existing CTC framework.""The new labour codes unify the definition of 'wages' under the Code on Wages and Social Security. This would mean better retirement security through higher gratuity and provident fund but a possible dip in take-home pay if employers restructure allowances downward to offset costs,"" Suchita Dutta, executive director of the Indian Staffing Federation was quoted as saying by ET.The standardisation of wage definitions across labour codes ensures uniformity in computing social security benefits.""Wages now include basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance; 50% of the total remuneration (or such percentage as may be notified) shall be added back to compute wages, ensuring consistency in calculating gratuity, pension and social security benefits,"" explains Anjali Malhotra, partner at professional services firm Nangia Group.According to Puneet Gupta, partner, People Advisory Services at EY India, the implementation of labour codes could result in increased gratuity payments since calculations will be based on ""wages"", encompassing basic salary and all allowances, excluding HRA and conveyance allowance.The new labour codes introduce universal minimum wages for all employees across organised and unorganised sectors, replacing the earlier system that covered only about 30% of workers.A statutory floor wage will be set by the government based on minimum living standards, and no state can fix wages below this benchmark.A uniform definition of wages now applies, where basic pay, dearness allowance, and retaining allowance together must account for at least 50% of total remuneration.The codes mandate gender equality, prohibiting discrimination in hiring, wages, or employment terms for similar work, along with universal wage payment coverage that ensures timely payments and prevents unauthorised deductions for employees earning up to ₹24,000 per month. Overtime compensation must be paid at twice the normal rate.Several compliance and enforcement reforms are included as well. Decriminalisation of offences replaces imprisonment with monetary penalties for first-time violations, and compounding of offences allows certain fines to be settled without prosecution.The threshold for government approval of lay-offs, retrenchment, or closure has increased from 100 to 300 workers, with states allowed to raise it further.Work-from-home is formally recognised in services sectors based on mutual agreement, while dispute resolution will be handled by two-member tribunals for faster outcomes.A mandatory 14-day strike notice aims to prevent sudden disruptions and includes mass casual leave within the definition of a strike.The codes extend social protections to new categories, requiring aggregators to contribute 1–2% of annual turnover towards gig and platform workers’ social security (capped at 5% of their payments).Fixed-term employees become eligible for gratuity after just one year of continuous service instead of five.The inspector-cum-facilitator system introduces randomised, technology-driven inspections to reduce harassment and improve transparency. Compliance is simplified through digitisation of records, as well as a streamlined one license, one registration, one return system.Employers must issue formal appointment letters detailing job roles, wages, and social security.The codes also expand labour flexibility and reduce burdens on small units.Night shifts for women are permitted in all establishments with their consent and safety measures. Contract labour rules include an all-India licence valid for five years.Factory thresholds have been raised to 20 workers for units using power and 40 for those without, reducing compliance requirements for smaller factories.Finally, working hours remain capped at 8 hours per day and 48 hours per week, with flexible weekly structures allowed through mutual consent.","Mandatory retirement contributions, including provident fund and gratuity payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages. The new regulation requires that an employee's basic salary must constitute at least 50% of their total CTC, or meet the government-specified percentage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125516988,imgsize-41896,width-400,resizemode-4/new-labour-code-impact.jpg"
EC empowered to conduct SIR; we will fix flaws if needed: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-empowered-to-conduct-sir-we-will-fix-flaws-if-needed-sc/articleshow/125602065.cms,"EC To Launch SIR in 12 States and UTs in Phase 2, CEC Gyanesh Kumar Says Zero Complaints in Bihar

CJI cites Bihar, says no impact on ground

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday emphatically said the Election Commission is statutorily and constitutionally empowered to conduct the pan-India Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls and that it would not stall the process, while assuring that it would order corrective measures, if any irregularities were brought to its notice.CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi rejected arguments questioning the justification of SIR, with the former saying not a single objection was filed against the updation of electoral rolls after the process was fine-tuned at the apex court's instance.Appearing for RJD MP Manoj Jha, senior advocate Kapil Sibal commenced arguments questioning SIR's constitutional validity, saying there are millions of illiterate people who can't fill voter enumeration forms, which have become a tool for exclusion.""Why should a voter be asked to fill an enumeration form at all? Who is EC to determine whether a person is an Indian citizen or not? Aadhaar card mentions the place of residence and date of birth, which should be enough for persons above 18 years to get enrolled as voters if they give a self-declaration that they are Indian citizens,"" Sibal argued.CJI Kant said, ""Sibal, you have experience of contesting elections in Delhi, where many people do not vote.But in rural areas, elections are a festival. There, everyone is concerned about their votes. A maximum number of people participate, and everyone knows who a resident of the village is.""Senior advocate Kapil Sibal said such an exercise had never been conducted in India because the ethos of our 'Poorna Swaraj' mantra from the freedom struggle days was inclusionary, not exclusionary. Justice Bagchi said, ""It is a matter of record that in 2012 and 2014, the number of voters exceeded the total adult population. Is it not necessary to correct the electoral roll? If EC has a doubt about someone's citizenship, is it not entitled to inquire about it? If EC carries out an aggressive revision of the electoral roll, there will be deletions. ""CJI Kant said the SIR of Bihar's electoral rolls was a prime example. ""Initially, the court was told that crores of voters are being deleted. We issued certain directions to streamline the process. Eventually, what happened? Among the deletions from the voter list were those found to have died or migrated outside. No one filed an objection. We did not find any impact on the ground level,"" he said.The bench's observations led Sibal to switch from highlighting the ill-impact of SIR to focus on questioning its constitutional validity. ""The process must be inclusive and the burden of proving citizenship cannot be fastened on the voters. If there is a doubtful voter, his/her case should be referred to the competent authority to determine the citizenship issue. A booth level officer (BLO) has no right to inquire into the citizenship of a voter,"" he said.

""While the upgrade will be carried out indigenously, Russia will have some role in it,"" another source said.India has been trying to strike a balance between its long-standing arms supplier Russia and the increasingly transactional US under the Trump administration that wants to punish countries for buying Russian oil and arms.Several defence deals are in the pipeline with the US, which has already bagged Indian contracts worth $26 billion over the last 15 years. After the over $1 billion (Rs 8,900 crore) deal with US major General Electric for another 113 GE-F404 engines to power Tejas Mark-1A fighters was inked earlier this month, CCS on Wednesday cleared a Rs 7,000 crore ""follow-on support package"" for the 24 American MH-60R Seahawk helicopters being inducted by Navy for Rs 15,157 crore.On the Russian front, Moscow has assured New Delhi it will deliver by Nov 2026 the remaining two of the original five S-400 squadrons, ordered for $5.4 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) in 2018, after a long delay due to the Ukraine war.IAF is keeping its fingers crossed.

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday dismissed Pakistan’s comments on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s participation at the Ram temple ceremony in Ayodhya, with ""the contempt they deserve”.The sharp response came a day after Pakistan’s foreign office issued a statement objecting to the flag-hosting ceremony at the Ram temple on Tuesday.

As a country with a deeply stained record of bigotry, repression, and systemic mistreatment of its minorities, Pakistan has no moral standing to lecture others. Rather than delivering hypocritical homilies, Pakistan would do better to turn its gaze inwards and focus on its own abysmal human rights record.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hoisted the dharma dhwaja atop the spire of Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Temple, marking the completion of the temple structure. Addressing the gathering, he said the flag symbolised civilisational resurgence and declared, “This sacred flag will stand as a testament that truth ultimately triumphs over falsehood.”The Prime Minister said democracy was deeply rooted in India’s civilisational fabric and highlighted the government’s commitment to inclusive development. He said, “Ram does not discriminate, and the government is also moving forward with the same spirit,” urging citizens to uphold unity as the nation moves toward Viksit Bharat.Calling the ceremony the fulfilment of a 500 year old resolve, Modi said longstanding wounds were beginning to heal and described Ayodhya as a rising centre where spirituality and modernity would converge. Recounting the moment of the flag installation, he said, “The process started at 11:40 PM. I pressed the button, and the flag was installed at 11:50. The entire process took 4 minutes.”PM Modi held a roadshow in Ayodhya, where crowds lined the streets to welcome him.

Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","AI-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality.

"Let's balance rights and duties, PM urges citizens on Constitution Day",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lets-balance-rights-and-duties-pm-urges-citizens-on-constitution-day/articleshow/125602038.cms,"PM Modi Pens Powerful Letter On Duties And Democracy, Reflects On His Constitutional Journey

Constitution gives us rights, reminds us of our duties: PM

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi marked Constitution Day on Wednesday by urging citizens to never miss out on their constitutional right to vote and renewed his pitch for balancing rights with duties.PM Modi has often emphasised that while the issue of people's rights has received attention, the Constitution's similar focus on their duties was overlooked. He cited a host of stalwarts, including Mahatma Gandhi, to underscore the primacy of duties for social and economic progress.As the country moves forward to realising the dream of a developed India, people must always place their duties towards the nation foremost in their minds, he said.In a letter to citizens on Constitution Day, which was announced by his government in 2015, PM Modi suggested that people organise special events on November 26 to mark the coming-of-age of youngsters in schools and colleges to celebrate first-time voters.First-time voters will make them feel that they are also active participants in the process of nation-building, PM Modi said. ""It is our duty to never miss the opportunity to vote in national, state and local elections where we are registered,"" the PM said. His remarks came amid high turnouts in recent polls and the ongoing SIR of electoral roll drive in several states and UTs.With Congress leading the charge against his govt for allegedly weakening constitutional values, Modi in his letter took a swipe at the party for not celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Constitution's adoption in 2010 in a befitting manner. Sadly, he said, the occasion did not receive the due national attention. However, the then Gujarat govt headed by him had organised a 'Samvidhan Gaurav Yatra', he added.PM Modi credited the Constitution for enabling someone like him from a disadvantaged background to serve as the head of a govt continuously for over 24 years, which includes his stint as Gujarat CM from Oct 2001.The 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Birsa Munda this year marks the occasion as special, he said, asserting it was the country's first home minister's inspiration and courage of conviction that guided his govt in repealing Article 370 and 35(A) and ensuring the Constitution is now fully implemented in J&K.He noted that he had bowed and touched the steps of Parliament when he entered it for the first time in 2014 and had touched the Constitution with his forehead on his re-election in 2019 as a mark of reverence, and paid tributes to Constituent Assembly chairman Rajendra Prasad and its drafting committee chair BR Ambedkar. Modi also attended a programme at Samvidhan Sadan, where President Murmu addressed a gathering to mark the day.On X, he said, ""While it (Constitution) empowers us with rights, it also reminds us of our duties as citizens, which we should always try to fulfil. These duties are the foundation of a strong democracy. Let us reiterate our commitment to strengthening Constitutional values through our actions.""","PM Modi has often emphasised that while the issue of people's rights has received attention, the Constitution's focus on their duties was overlooked.

NEW DELHI: India's rice production during the 2025-26 kharif season that ended in Oct reached a record 124.5 million tonnes (MT), which is 1.7 MT (over 1%) more than the production of kharif rice last year, the agriculture ministry said on Wednesday. Output of pulses, oilseeds and cotton, however, marginally declined.The ministry's first advance estimates of kharif crops output put the total estimated foodgrain production for the 2025-26 season at around 173 MT, up from 169 MT a year earlier.These estimates are based on yield trends from previous years, other ground-level inputs, regional observations and data received from states.Revisions of output figures are made during subsequent estimates when the actual crop cutting experiment yield data becomes available. The ministry releases four advance estimates before final production figures for a crop year.Sowing of kharif crops starts at the onset of monsoon in June, and harvest generally begins in Oct.""Excessive rainfall in some areas of the country affected crops, but most areas have benefited significantly from a good monsoon, leading to overall good crop growth,"" agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said.Maize production is estimated at 28 MT in 2025-26, up from nearly 25 MT the previous year. On the other hand, pulses production is estimated marginally lower at 7.4 MT compared to 7.7 MT in 2024-25. Similarly, oilseeds output is estimated at 27.5 MT, down from 28 MT the previous year.Cotton output is also pegged lower at 29.2 million bales (170 kg each) compared to 29.7 million bales a year earlier, while jute and mesta output is estimated at 8.3 million bales (180 kg each), down from 8.4 million bales.","India's rice production during the 2025-26 kharif season that ended in Oct reached a record 124.5 million tonnes.

PM Modi Pens Powerful Letter On Duties And Democracy, Reflects On His Constitutional Journey

NEW DELHi: President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday said women representation in judiciary, legislature and executive continues to be low despite Parliament amending the Constitution to enact Women's Reservation Act in 2023 to reserve one-third of seats for women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies.""Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam is a historic step towards empowering women and a homage to all women who took part in the Constituent Assembly to frame the Constitution. But we continue to lag in giving women adequate representation in judiciary, legislature and executive,"" Murmu said at the Constitution Day celebrations organised by Supreme Court, which has only one woman among 33 judges.Speaking in the presence of CJI Surya Kant and law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, the President said taking steps to give adequate representation to women in all three wings of governance will require a change of mindset. It was SCBA president Vikas Singh who mentioned extremely low representation of women in judiciary - 13% in HCs and 35% in trial courts.She said annual commemoration of the Constitution's adoption on Nov 26, 1949, is often marked by speeches made by dignitaries. ""Have we ever looked back and assessed in the last 75 years how much we have progressed in achieving the constitutional goals of justice, equality, liberty and fraternity for every citizen? If not, can we do it in the next 24 years when we will be celebrating the centenary of the adoption of the Constitution? That is the question, not only for the judiciary, legislature or executive, but for everyone.Addressing another Constitution Day event in Central Hall of old Parliament building or Samvidhan Sadan, Murmu described the Constitution as the bedrock of ""our national pride and national identity"", and as a guiding text for taking India forward with a ""nationalist mindset by abandoning the colonial mindset"".In front of an audience that included Vice-President C P Radhakrishnan, PM Narendra Modi, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, opposition leaders of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi, respectively, and members of both Houses of Parliament, Murmu cited implementation of legislations related to the criminal justice system as an example of the effort to shun the colonial mindset.Murmu also said that by repealing the provisions of Article 370, an obstacle that had been hindering the country's inclusive political integration was removed.At the function in SC, Murmu praised CJI's renewed focus on mediation and termed it a big step to reduce litigation.CJI Kant said when it comes to justice delivery system, there is still a disquieting gap between constitutional vision and the experience of many, especially the marginalised section of population for whom the access to justice remains elusive because of exorbitant cost of litigation, language of courts, distance and delay. Promising to improve the justice delivery system on all these fronts, the CJI said, ""The time is also ripe for us to reinforce predictability in our judicial approach.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Wednesday hailed the Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC ), which is celebrating its centenary, as “one of the most important institutions in India’s democratic and administrative framework that has, in its hundred-year journey, embodied transparency, impartiality, confidentiality, and accountability”.Birla, while delivering the keynote address at UPSC’s two-day ‘Shatabdi Sammelan’ here, lauded the institution’s ability to adapt to changing times, citing the reforms in examination systems, promotion methods, and digital adoption as examples of its progressive spirit.Highlighting the inclusive nature of UPSC’s processes, the Speaker said, “Candidates from every region, language, and socio-economic background participate in this examination with complete faith in its fairness. That trust is the greatest testimony to UPSC’s credibility.”Junior minister for personnel Jitendra Singh , ‘guest of honour’ at the event, also hailed UPSC as the “guardian of India’s steel frame of governance”, saying it has stood tall as a pillar of integrity, fairness and transparency through the country’s pre and post-Independence era.Speaking in the presence of UPSC chairman Ajay Kumar, Singh recalled Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s description of the civil services as the “steel frame of India” and said, “it is the UPSC that has lived up to the responsibility of being the guardian of this steel frame.”Applauding UPSC’s continuous evolution, Singh drew attention to several recent initiatives that reflect the commission’s forward-looking approach. He especially commended UPSC’s ‘Pratibha Setu’ portal, which seeks to create new opportunities for candidates who have cleared all the Civil Services Examination stages but did not make it to final list of recommended candidates, by connecting them with private sector and institutional openings. He termed the move “an innovative bridge between talent and opportunity”.Singh emphasised UPSC’s larger role beyond recruitment, which covers framing and updating service rules, reviewing administrative practices, and setting ethical standards for public service.“The architects of Viksit Bharat @2047 will emerge from this very institution that has trained generations of India’s finest civil servants,” he remarked.",Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla hailed the Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC) as ‘one of the most important institutions in India’s democratic and administrative framework’ He was delivering keynote address at UPSC's two-day ‘Shatabdi Sammelan’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125595729,imgsize-26168,width-400,resizemode-4/om-birla.jpg"

Fei-Fei Li’s education and early work experiences shape her AI breakthroughs





Fei-Fei Li combining science and perseverance to build AI





How early experiences shaped Fei-Fei Li’s AI work









Fei-Fei Li, often called the ""Godmother of AI,"" is the founder of World Labs, a rapidly growing AI startup valued at over $1 billion within its first year. Her journey, however, began far from the tech spotlight. Li immigrated from China to the United States at the age of 15. Her family faced financial difficulties, and they decided to open a small dry-cleaning business in Parsippany, New Jersey, to make ends meet.Li spent seven years running the shop alongside her parents. She handled customer calls, billing, inspections, and daily operations, joking that she was the ""CEO."" This early immersion in responsibility not only developed her resilience but also taught her critical problem-solving skills that would later guide her scientific career and influence her leadership approach in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence.Even while pursuing her education, Li remained closely connected to her family’s business. She attended Princeton University for her undergraduate degree, deliberately staying near the dry-cleaning shop. Later, during her Ph.D. at Caltech, she continued managing the business remotely. She credits this period with teaching her how to balance demanding responsibilities, reinforcing her work ethic and adaptability.Li first gained prominence through her work on ImageNet, a large-scale visual database that transformed computer vision. ImageNet provided AI systems with vast amounts of labelled visual data, enabling them to recognise objects and understand images with unprecedented accuracy. This innovation laid the foundation for modern AI research and demonstrated the potential of teaching machines to ""see"" and understand the world.At World Labs, Li is now focused on building world models, advanced AI systems designed to understand and interact with the physical world. Unlike current large language models, which primarily process text, world models integrate spatial and visual intelligence. This allows AI to perceive its environment, reason about complex situations, and make informed decisions. Li believes this approach represents the next phase of the AI revolution, moving beyond language-based intelligence toward machines capable of more human-like understanding.Li attributes her career achievements to two qualities: resilience and curiosity. Her experience as an immigrant managing her family’s shop taught her perseverance in the face of challenges, a mindset that is essential in scientific research, which is often non-linear and filled with trial and error. Her innate curiosity, fostered from a young age, led her to explore science passionately rather than pursue other distractions common among her peers.Li’s work in AI is closely connected to her personal history. Managing a business as a teenager and young adult required her to navigate complex problems, communicate effectively, and stay organised under pressure. These skills translated naturally into her research career, where problem-solving, adaptability, and persistence are paramount.

"Midnight meeting between Shivakumar, Jarkiholi intensifies churn in Cong",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/midnight-meeting-between-shivakumar-jarkiholi-intensifies-churn-in-cong/articleshow/125594776.cms,"Bengaluru: A late-night meeting Tuesday between deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar and long-time rival and cabinet colleague Satish Jarkiholi triggered fresh buzz of a political churn in Karnataka. The two met at an undisclosed location in Bengaluru, with discussions reportedly stretching past midnight.Both confirmed the meeting Wednesday but insisted it centred on preparations for the 2028 assembly and 2029 Lok Sabha elections. However, aides of Shivakumar said he sought Jarkiholi's support in persuading chief minister Siddaramaiah to honour an ""unwritten pact"" that he would step down at the halfway mark, a deal that was brokered in New Delhi in 2023.""The meeting with Jarkiholi was about elections in 2028 and 2029 and party organisation. What's the harm in meeting Satish, he is my cabinet colleague,"" Shivakumar said Wednesday. On the 2023 deal, he said: ""I can't speak about it with the media.""However, the development comes amid strained relations between the two, especially over political dominance in Belagavi — Jarkiholi's stronghold. Shivakumar had openly backed women and child development minister Laxmi Hebbalkar, also from Belagavi, against Jarkiholi.Last month, Siddaramaiah's son Yathindra had also described Jarkiholi (not Shivakumar) as the inheritor of Siddaramaiah's political legacy and someone capable of carrying forward the Ahinda vote bank of backward classes, minorities, and SC/ST communities.But Shivakumar insisted the meeting was part of routine party coordination. ""I am the party president, Satish is the working president,"" he said. ""Besides, we are close friends. Our relationship is good and we have worked together. Both of us are currently working in the same cabinet. Jarkiholi is a big asset to the party. We will continue our work together. The govt has completed two-and-a-half years. We discussed what work needs to be completed in the remaining term. Other than that, there is nothing special about our conversation.""Jarkiholi took a similar line, pointing out that Shivakumar had met with many functionaries recently. He said the party high command must decide on leadership matters and noted that Siddaramaiah himself had suggested that the decision be made soon.On home minister G Parameshwara's claim to the CM post, Jarkiholi said: ""There is nothing wrong in making such claims… but who will finally decide? That happens in Delhi. All that we can do is just make a claim.""Shivakumar dismissed reports of factionalism. ""I don't have a faction. There is only one faction — the ‘Congress faction'. My number is 140. This party has been built through collective leadership. I alone didn't work for it. Under the leadership of Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, Siddaramaiah and with the efforts of all MLAs, we brought the party to the helm in the state. Satish Jarkiholi and I met to discuss ways to sustain this. ""Asked whether the halfway point would mark a transition, he said: ""There are no personal issues here. The party decides everything. The CM post or high office is unimportant. What is important is working together with everyone and bringing the party back to the helm.""On reports of a Saturday (Nov 29) meeting in Delhi, he said: ""The 28th is Constitution Day… The 29th is still far away; let's see. I don't know.""","Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar met long-time rival and cabinet colleague Satish Jarkiholi.

BENGALURU: Days after busting the fake Nandini ghee racket that stretched across Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Central Crime Branch sleuths Wednesday arrested husband-wife duo — Shivakumar and Ramya — alleged masterminds of the large-scale distribution of the counterfeit ghee.A week ago, CCB sleuths, along with Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) vigilance wing officials, had exposed the extensive counterfeit manufacturing and supply chain that attempted to exploit the reputation of state govt-owned KMF dairy brand.CCB officials said the couple had set up an advanced production unit in Tamil Nadu, complete with industrial-grade machinery capable of mass-producing adulterated ghee. The fake product was then repackaged to look identical to genuine Nandini ghee before being pushed into markets in both states. During raids, police seized several heavy-duty machines used in the adulteration and repackaging process, indicating the scale and sophistication of the operation.Before nabbing the masterminds, CCB had arrested four individuals linked to the racket's supply chain — KMF distributor Mahendra, his son Deepak, and associates, including Muniraju.The scam surfaced when unusual supply fluctuations raised red flags during internal KMF checks. Acting on a tip-off, a joint team from CCB's special investigation squad and KMF vigilance wing raided godowns, shops and vehicles linked to Krishna Enterprises in Nanjamba Agrahara, Chamarajpet, on Nov 14.Investigators found that Mahendra, an authorised KMF distributor, purchased original Nandini ghee in Bengaluru and shipped it to Tiruppur district in Tamil Nadu. There, the stock was diluted with palm oil, coconut oil and dalda — creating up to four litres of fake ghee for every litre of the genuine product and then diverted to Nandini booths and other grocery stores in Bengaluru.CCB DCP-I Sriharibabu said the arrested couple had previously been booked in Mysuru for similar offences. Police have now frozen Rs 60 lakh from their bank accounts. Samples of the adulterated ghee have been sent to Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) for detailed analysis. Interrogation of the duo is underway to trace the wider network, including suppliers of raw materials and potential interstate collaborators.",CCB officials said the couple had set up an advanced production unit in Tamil Nadu.

Nvidia’s historic milestone



JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn’t sugarcoat AI impact on jobs





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has now hailed Nvidia as an unbelievable company and has also cautioned investors that some artificial intelligence stocks may be trading at an unsustainable levels. Speaking with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Dimon said that the US remains the ‘most prosperous’ economy in the world. He adds that the US economy is supported by diverse and deep capital markets including venture capital, private credit and hedge funds. “There’s no question some people will lose money,” Dimon said, drawing parallels to the dot-com era. “But mankind should benefit,” he added, emphasising that the underlying technology is real and transformative—even if valuations are currently inflated.Dimon emphasized that AI is a genuine productivity revolution, comparing its current stage to the early days of the Internet. “It’s almost at the beginning,” he said, noting that while not every company will succeed, AI will produce transformative winners just as the internet gave rise to Google, Facebook, and Amazon.Dimon acknowledged that valuations in the AI sector may be inflated, but stressed that the underlying technology will reshape industries and improve lives.“Mankind should benefit,” he said, even if “valuations today may be too high for some of these folks.”In October 2025, Nvidia became the first company in history to surpass a $5 trillion market valuation. Its market cap currently stands at $4.74 trillion, underscoring its dominance in the AI chip market. Dimon’s remarks came shortly after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted that China will win the AI race, a claim that drew sharp pushback from President Donald Trump, who vowed the U.S. would not allow other nations access to Nvidia’s most advanced chips.In another interview with Bloomberg TV, Dimon talked about the impact of AI on the job market. “People shouldn’t put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs,” he said. “AI will enhance some aspects of work, but also eliminate some jobs.” However, Dimon also stressed on the fact that JPMorgan is focused on retaining and redeploying employees whose roles are impacted by automation. “We’ll have more jobs, but there’ll probably be less jobs in certain functions,” Dimon added. “You’re better off being way ahead of the curve,” Dimon added.Dimon also added that the bank has invested about $2 billion as an annual investment in AI and is already making $2 billion in direct benefits. This includes the headcount reductions and operational savings. “We know about $2 billion of actual cost saves,” he said. “It’s the tip of the iceberg.”","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has hailed Nvidia as an unbelievable company.

"Apple CEO Tim Cook may not be retiring soon, here’s why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-may-not-be-retiring-soon-heres-why/articleshow/125533511.cms,"Apple CEO Tim Cook Confirms Majority Of iPhones Sold In U.S. Now Made In India

Tim Cook to reportedly retire in 2026

Tim Cook’s continued leadership

What’s next for Apple’s executive team





Apple CEO Tim Cook may not be retiring anytime soon. Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Tim Cook is planning to step down as soon as next year. However, a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggests that Cook has no plans of stepping down in the near future. Apple has been preparing for a leadership transition for quite some time. In 2024, Bloomberg revealed that Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus was at the center of succession discussions. Ternus the youngest member of Apple’s executive team looks after the hardware division and is also widely respected by Apple CEO Tim Cook and former COO Jeff Williams.Then in October this year, Bloomberg suggests that the internal spotlight on Ternus was ‘intensifying’, making him the likely candidate to succeed Cook.Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook may step down from his position in between January and June 2026. As per the report, the current CEO Tim Cook is said to be succeeded by John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice-president of hardware engineering. However, no final decision has been made, sources told the publication. They also stressed that the transition plans are not tied to Apple’s current performance, as the company heads into what is expected to be a strong holiday season for iPhone sales.Taking about this upcoming transition, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman wrote, “Based on everything I’ve learned in recent weeks, I don’t believe a departure by the middle of next year is likely.” This means there are less chances of Tim Cook retiring anytime soon.Cook, who turned 65 this month, took over as CEO in 2011 after co-founder Steve Jobs died. Under his leadership, Apple’s valuation has climbed from around $350 billion to $4 trillion. Despite strong results last month, Apple’s roughly 12% stock rise this year trails rivals like Alphabet, Nvidia and Microsoft, which have surged on AI momentum.“Yes, Apple will eventually have a new leader. And, yes, it’s probably Ternus. But unless there is some unexpected event that forces Cook to step down sooner than planned, that moment is not at hand. But there still may be significant movement on Apple’s executive team. As I recently reported, silicon chief Johny Srouji is seriously evaluating his future at the company, while Apple has been on the hunt for a new AI leader,” said Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.While the retirement of Apple CEO Tim Cook is not imminent, Bloomberg reveals that the company will still witness some leadership changes in the coming weeks. As per the report,Apple’s silicon chief, Johny Srouji may be evaluating his future at the company. Also, Apple is actively looking for a new AI leader in order to strengthen its position in generative AI sector.","Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Tim Cook is planning to step down as soon as next year.

We are experiencing an issue with Google Meet beginning on Tuesday, 2025-11-25 21:41 PST.

Our engineering team continues to investigate the issue and work on a mitigation strategy.

We will provide an update by Wednesday, 2025-11-26 02:00 PST with current details.

We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.





Google Meet, Google’s video conferencing platform is experiencing widespread outage. Thousands of Google Meet users in India were not able to join meetings. According to outage tracking website, DownDetector, 65% users were not able to access the website for Google Meet. Around 33% users complained of server connection issue and 2% had issues with the video quality.According to Downdetector, reports of issues surged around midday, with users citing “502 error” messages and failed attempts to connect to ongoing meetings. The outage mainly affected users in India and some users in other countries also reported the issues. Many users also complained of log in issues and many were also not able to join the scheduled calls including work calls, online classes and other virtual events.At its peak, about 1700 people in India reported problems with the app. Downdetector suggests that the issue has now been resolved as the number of reports are showing a downward curve.In easier words, '502 Bad Gateway' error in Google Meet means that there is a temporary server communication failure.There may three reasons for it:The primary issue is typically on Google's side, not your personal device or internet connection.In this case, restarting your machine or router won't solve the problem.Google's servers (or an intermediary system required to connect you to the service) temporarily failed to get a valid response from the backend service needed to load your meeting.The platform cannot load or connect you to the meeting at that moment. A bug could have broken the process, causing a server-side problem. This means that the error is temporary and generally resolves once Google restores stability to the service.As of Wednesday afternoon, Google had not issued a detailed statement on the cause of the outage. The company’s status dashboard showed service disruptions, but no timeline for resolution was provided.The company has update the staus page at 2:08 pm IST with this message:","Google Meet, Google’s video conferencing platform is experiencing widespread outage.

ChatGPT maker OpenAI 's CEO Sam Altman is optimistic about Google 's recent successes in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In a recent internal memo to colleagues, Altman acknowledged that the AI startup rival's success couldHowever, Altman reassured that OpenAI isand anticipates emerging as the leader in the AI race. It's important to note that Altman's memo was written before Google's Gemini 3 was released, a model the tech giant has described as its most capable to date. Software developers have reported that the new model performed well on tasks such as automating website and product design and writing code, which is a lucrative revenue stream for OpenAI and its competitors, such as Anthropic.Concerns about OpenAI's slowing growth arose late this summer. During a recent quarterly earnings call with investors, the company’s CFO, Sarah Friar, confirmed that user engagement with the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT had cooled, despite the company's otherwise positive financial results.According to a report by The Information (as seen by The Economic Times), Sam Altman's memo noted that competitors such as Google and Anthropic are narrowing the gap in the AI raceAnthropic’s Claude model generates computer code for various tasks using conversational prompts.Meanwhile, Google has been integrating its Gemini AI chatbot into its search app, productivity tools and other services. However, recently, Claude gained a new challenger from OpenAI with the introduction of Codex.Google also holds an economic advantage. OpenAI’s growth has been rapid and the company now carries a valuation of around $500 billion as a for-profit entity. It is expected to bring in about $13 billion in revenue, but is estimated to burn roughly $100 billion in its push toward superintelligence.With a market value of about $3.5 trillion, Google reported free cash flow of over $70 billion in the past four quarters. A significant portion of this comes from providing cloud services to OpenAI, Anthropic and other competitors.Sam Altman also encouraged OpenAI employees to stay confident and focus on the company's larger goals.Altman wrote in the internal memo.Altman added.Recently, OpenAI partnered with Apple's biggest suuplier Foxconn to design and build AI data-centre components in the US. Under this partnership, OpenAI will help develop future server systems and may purchase Foxconn-produced hardware in the coming days. Altman noted that this collaboration can strengthen American manufacturing infrastructure.Commenting on the partnership, Altman said:Foxconn will join OpenAI’s supply chain to manufacture AI-related hardware in a more American way. The company, known for iPhone assembly, also manufactures AI servers and supplies components to Nvidia.Commenting on the partnership, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said that the companyIn September, Oracle also inked a $300 billion deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Since then, the company has shed more than $300 billion in market value, and Wall Street is starting to wonder if a partnership between the companies will bring returns or pose risks for Oracle.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledges Google's AI advancements, noting potential temporary economic challenges but expressing confidence in OpenAI's rapid progress.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai on AI layoffs









Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0. Announcing the launch of Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that it is ‘the best model in the world for multimodal understanding’. Now weeks after the intense work on Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has acknowledged that his engineers are overdue for a break. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Google AI” Release Notes podcast, Pichai said “I think some folks need some sleep,” adding that hopefully he and his teams “get a bit of rest” now that the milestone launch is behind them.The comment made by Pichai comes as Google is moving towards a $4 trillion market cap as the stock price of the company has surged by nearly 70% this year, including a 12% jump following Gemini 3’s debut on November 18. The Gemini 3.0 model has been widely praised for its reasoning, speed and multimodal capabilities. Recently, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also described the Gemini 3.0 model as an ‘insane’ leap forward. He also added that after using Gemini 3.0 for two hours he will not go back to ChatGPT.After the successful roll out of Gemini 3.0, Google has managed to reclaim its frontrunner position in the AI race. Pichai noted that years of hard work of the company is the sole reason behind this success.“In 2016, I wanted the whole company to be AI-first,” he said, pointing to milestones such as the creation of Google Brain in 2012, the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014, AlphaGo’s victory in Go, and the unveiling of Google’s own tensor processing units (TPUs), which were used to train Gemini.Pichai further talked about the Google’s strategy. Pichai explained that Google always worked towards a “full-stack” approach to innovation, improving everything from infrastructure to model training and test-time compute. He admitted that when generative AI first gained traction, Google was short on capacity and had to invest heavily to scale. “If you were on the outside, it would look like we were quiet, or we were behind, but we were putting all the building blocks in place, and then executing on top of it,” he said.Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked about AI layoffs. In a recent expansive interview with BBC, Sundar Pichai pushed back against concerns that AI could eventually lead to mass job cuts. Pichai said that the tech will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others -- ramifications that mean ""people will need to adapt.""Pichai further added that AI may be gunning for his job, but he doesn’t seem too worried about it. AI is advancing so swiftly, he said, that over the next 12 months the tech will be able to perform “complex” tasks and act as an agent on a users' behalf.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Udaipur’s High-Profile Wedding

UDAIPUR: All eyes were on Donald Trump Jr as he arrived in Udaipur for a high-profile wedding, but the families hosting the lavish celebrations are far from ordinary.

After arriving with his girlfriend, he toured the Udaipur City Palace with Rama Raju and met Lakshyaraj Singh Mewar.The meeting reflected deep cultural traditions, with discussions on Mewar’s history. Singh presented symbolic emblems, which Trump Jr described as “special and memorable,” expressing admiration for Maharana Kumbha, Maharana Sanga, and Maharana Pratap.The lavish celebrations, the international guest list, and the layers of security have all drawn attention — but at the heart of it lies the story of Rama Raju Mantena, the Vijayawada-born entrepreneur whose American dream has led to one of Udaipur’s most talked-about weddings.","Rama Raju Mantena, an Andhra-origin US entrepreneur, married Vamsi Gadiraju on Sunday.

Chhattisgarh liquor scam: EOW files 7th chargesheet against ex-officials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/chhattisgarh-liquor-scam-eow-files-7th-chargesheet-against-ex-officials/articleshow/125604061.cms,"RAIPUR:

Chhattisgarh Economic Offences Wing (EOW) on Wednesday filed a seventh chargesheet in alleged liquor scam case, naming former excise commissioner and excise secretary Niranjan Das and five others in what investigators describe as a deeply entrenched “commission and cash” syndicate that allegedly bled the state exchequer of hundreds of crores.The chargesheet was submitted before the Special Court (Prevention of Corruption Act) in Raipur.With this, EOW has so far filed charge sheets against 50 accused in the case, while the investigation into the wider network and money trail remains ongoing.According to Amresh Mishra, the EOW/ ACB chief, its probe has “proved” that during his nearly three-year tenure in the Excise Department, Niranjan Das pushed through unnecessary changes in excise policy and law, tampered with tender conditions and deliberately distorted departmental systems to benefit a liquor syndicate allegedly patronised by senior bureaucrat and retd IAS Anil Tuteja and businessman Anwar Dhebar.In return, investigators allege, Das received a “fixed share” of at least ₹50 lakh per month from the illegal collections.Analysis of transactions during his posting has so far thrown up evidence of no less than ₹16 crore in illicit gains attributed to him, EOW has stated, adding that this amount could rise as scrutiny deepens. The agency says it has found indications that this illegal income was invested in immovable properties purchased in the names of Das and his family members, which are now under examination.The latest chargesheet also focuses on what EOW calls a “faulty” FL-10A foreign liquor licensing regime, allegedly designed to extract commissions from liquor manufacturers. The agency has named two directors of private beverages company, as beneficiaries of the policy.Investigators claim the duo acted as middlemen between the syndicate and liquor companies, collecting commissions from manufacturers and funnelling the money to the cartel. Because of this licensing framework, the state govt is estimated to have suffered a revenue loss of at least ₹530 crore, the EOW has said, while beverages company and its directors allegedly gained around ₹114 crore in unlawful economic benefit. The money-handling arm of the syndicate is also under the scanner.The chargesheet names Nitesh Purohit, a close associate of key accused Anwar Dhebar, and his son Yash Purohit, accusing them of playing an active role in collecting, storing, managing and moving cash generated from the liquor racket.According to the probe, large volumes of cash were allegedly routed through their hotel located on Jail Road in Raipur, where collections were kept, pooled and dispatched further on instructions from the syndicate.Preliminary findings suggest that more than ₹1,000 crore of illegal funds may have been handled through this channel alone, the EOW claims, adding that a detailed forensic analysis of the flows is still underway.Another accused, Deepen Chawda — described as an old associate of Anwar Dhebar and manager of another hotel — has been accused of handling “big-ticket” cash operations for the cartel.","Chhattisgarh Economic Offences Wing (EOW) on Wednesday filed a seventh chargesheet in alleged liquor scam case.

The factors influencing turkey prices this Thanksgiving

Grocery stores in the US are absorbing the rising cost of turkeys this Thanksgiving. A spike in bird flu cases has pushed up wholesale prices, according to new data from the US department of agriculture (USDA). But these higher costs are not being passed on to shoppers.USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year. Experts say stores are taking the hit to keep customers coming in, reported NBC News. Even the projected cost of a full Thanksgiving meal has stayed broadly steady.The main reason for the higher costs is a drop in supply. Bird flu has spread again among commercial poultry farms this autumn. By October, more than 2 million turkeys had been culled after exposure. Minnesota, the largest turkey-producing state, reported six confirmed outbreaks that month.David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University, told NBC, another virus avian metapneumovirus is also affecting production by reducing the number of viable eggs laid by hens. This has slowed farmers’ efforts to rebuild their flocks.Overall, turkey supply is tightening. The USDA expects production to fall to 4.8 million pounds this year, down from 5.1 million pounds in 2024.This shortage has pushed up costs for retailers. USDA data shows the wholesale price of frozen turkeys, the type most families buy for Thanksgiving, has jumped by about 80% since last year, rising from under $1 per pound to more than $1.70.A separate USDA report shows retail prices for frozen turkeys staying flat. Ortega said shops may be absorbing these increases to stop customers from switching stores. Retailers often use turkeys as a “loss leader”, selling them at or below cost to draw in shoppers and make up the difference through other items in their baskets.While turkey prices have stayed stable for shoppers, the overall cost of a Thanksgiving meal varies depending on the data source. Some estimates show prices rising by nearly 10%, while others show a fall of up to 5%.",USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year.

New details on Gold Card visa program

The application is to be filed with the Department of Commerce

The $15,000 fee per application is non-refundable

The petition is to be filed with USCIS, following which USCIS would assess the applicant's eligibility for the new visa category.

The vetting process also includes a check on whether the fund originated from a lawful source.

Once the petition is approved and when an immigrant visa number is available, then the applicant has to complete the consular processing at the embassy.

The applicant would then get an immigrant visa to travel to the US and be admitted as a lawful permanent resident.

What is the $5 million visa program?





In a major update of Donald Trump's Gold Card visa program, which is to be implemented by December 18, the Department of Homeland Security and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services prepared the draft of the petition that an applicant has to submit. Form I-140G, also known as Immigration Petition for the Gold Card Program, have been submitted for clearance with the Office of Management and Budget. Bloomberg reported that the department has already got an emergency approval from White House.An individual would be eligible for permanent residence under this visa program after a donation of $1 million and for corporate petitioners, the amount is $2 million.
