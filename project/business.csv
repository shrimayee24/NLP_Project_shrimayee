Iran airspace sudden closure: AI cancels 3 US flights; IndiGo flight returns to Baku,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iran-airspace-sudden-closure-ai-cancels-3-us-flights-indigo-flight-returns-to-baku/articleshow/126537748.cms,"Flightradar24 at 9 am IST

'Leave By Any Means': India Issues Fresh Advisory As Iran Protests Intensify Across Cities

""IndiGo flight 6E1808 is now the last non-Iran-registered passenger aircraft in Iranian airspace,”

Flightradar24 said on X at 3.49 am (IST) Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Flights between India and the west will get longer as airlines have stopped overflying the Iranian and Iraqi airspace due to the evolving situation in the region. The sudden closure of Iranian airspace for some time on Wednesday-Thursday night meant Air India had to cancel Thursday morning’s Delhi-New York JFK (AI 101), Delhi-Newark (AI 105) and Mumbai-JFK (AI 119). The return flights were consequentially also cancelled.IndiGo’s Baku-Delhi flight early Thursday morning returned to the Azerbaijan capital within an hour as it was to overfly Iran after crossing the Caspian Sea. Air India will cancel some flights where rerouting is not possible. For Indian carriers, avoiding Iran and Iraq will mean not overflying the entire stretch from Iraq right upto Pakistan. Accordingly, IndiGo could take a call on its Almaty, Tashkent and Baku flights shortly as flying between those places and India will mean taking an extraordinary long route that will require a felling halt some place like Jordan.The Iranian airspace was suddenly closed on Wednesday-Thursday night.A notice to airmen (NOTAM) issued Thursday at 22:15 (UTC or GMT) said: “Tehran flight information region (FIR) closed to all flights except international civil arrivals and departures to and from Tehran FIR with prior permission from Iran Civil Aviation Authority.”Subsequently another NOTAM was issued saying “Tehran FIR resumed normal operations” but multiple airlines are avoiding the airspace for safety reasons.Air India said on X Thursday morning: “Due to the emerging situation in Iran, the subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of the safety of our passengers, Air India flights overflying the region are now using an alternative routing, which may lead to delays. Some Air India flights where currently rerouting is not possible are being cancelled. We request passengers to check the status of their flights on our website before heading to the airport. Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to passengers due to this unforeseen disruption. Safety of our passengers and crew remain top priority.”A Lufthansa spokesperson said: “Due to the current situation in the Middle East, the Lufthansa Group has decided, after careful evaluation, to operate flights to and from Tel Aviv and Amman as day flights from Thursday, January 15 up to and including Monday, January 19, 2026. This means that crews fly back immediately afterwards without an overnight stay on site. In some cases, there may also be flight cancellations. In addition, Iranian and Iraqi airspace will be circumnavigated by all Lufthansa Group airlines until further notice.”“The Lufthansa Group continues to monitor the situation closely and will continue to assess the situation in the coming days. Affected passengers will be automatically rebooked and proactively contacted. Alternatively, guests can rebook to a later travel date. The safety of our guests and crew members is always our top priority,” the spokesperson said.A Jan 11 analyst update by Osprey Flight Solutions titled “Iran: Main urban centres: Further violent clashes near certain in the short term amid deteriorating security situation” says: “Operators are advised that the security situation in Iran's main urban centres remains fluid and subject to rapid change amid the ongoing violence. While airport operations have remained largely unaffected, disruption is possible in the short term, to include airport worker involvement in protests, impacting staffing levels at facilities. Additionally, fuel shortages at airports and direct protest action at/near facilities are possible in the short term….”","The Iranian airspace was suddenly closed on Wednesday-Thursday night. Air India had to cancel Thursday morning’s Delhi-New York JFK (AI 101), Delhi- newark (AI 105) and Mumbai-JFK (AI 119) The return flights were consequentially also cancelled.

PM Modi at Pongal celebrations at minister L Murugan’s Delhi residence

A few days ago, I was in the sacred land of Somnath to be part of the Somnath Swabhiman Parv, marking a thousand years since the first attack on Somnath, which took place in 1026. People from all across India had come to be part of this moment of remembrance, united by a shared reverence for history, culture and the enduring spirit of the people of India. During the programme, I met a few people who had previously come to Somnath during the Saurashtra-Tamil Sangamam and had been to Kashi during the Kashi Tamil Sangamam.Their words of appreciation for such platforms touched me and so, I thought of sharing a few thoughts on this subject.During one of the Mann Ki Baat programmes, I had said that not learning Tamil is a major regret of my life. Fortunately, over the last few years, our govt has had several opportunities to further popularise Tamil culture across India and to deepen the spirit of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.’ A prime example of such an effort is the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam. In our ethos, Sangam or confluence has a special place. Seen in this light, the KashiTamil Sangamam stands out as a truly distinctive initiative, one that celebrates the living unity of India’s many traditions while honouring their unique identities.And what can be a better place than Kashi to host such a Sangamam. The same Kashi, which has remained a civilisational anchor from time immemorial… where, for thousands of years, people from all over have come in search of knowledge, meaning and Moksha.Kashi’s connection with Tamil people and culture is very deep. It is in Kashi that Baba Vishwanath resides, while Tamil Nadu has Rameswaram. Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu is known as Kashi of the south or Dakshin Kashi. Saint Kumaraguruparar Swamigal forged a lasting link between Kashi and Tamil Nadu through his spirituality, scholarship and institution-building. Mahakavi Subramania Bharati, one of Tamil Nadu’s greatest sons, found in Kashi a space of intellectual growth and spiritual awakening. It was here that his nationalism deepened, his poetry sharpened and his vision of a free, united India took clearer shape. There are several such instances that highlight this close bond.The first edition of KashiTamil Sangamam took place in 2022. I recall attending the inauguration programme. Scholars, artisans, students, farmers, writers, professionals and many others from Tamil Nadu travelled to Kashi, Prayagraj and Ayodhya.Subsequent editions expanded the scale and depth of this effort. The aim was to keep introducing fresh themes, innovative formats and deeper engagement, thus ensuring that the Sangamam continued to evolve while remaining rooted in its core spirit. In the second edition in 2023, technology was used on a larger scale to ensure that language does not become a barrier for people. In the third edition, the focus was on Indian knowledge systems. At the same time, academic discussions, cultural performances, exhibitions and interactions witnessed greater participation. Thousands of people have taken part in these events.The fourth edition of the Kashi Tamil Sangamam commenced on Dec 2, 2025. The theme picked was very interesting, Tamil Karkalam — Learn Tamil. It presented aunique opportunity for people in Kashi and other parts to learn the beautiful Tamil language. Teachers came from Tamil Nadu and the students of Kashi had a very memorable experience! There were many other special events this time.Tholkappiyam, the ancient Tamil literary classic, was translated into 4 Indian languages and 6 foreign languages.A unique event, Sage Agasthya Vehicle Expedition (SAVE), was undertaken from Tenkasi to Kashi. On the way, various initiatives such as eye camps, health awareness camps, digital literacy camps, among other things, were held. The expedition paid homage to King Adi Veera Parakrama Pandiyan, the great Pandya ruler who spread the message of cultural oneness. There were exhibitions at Namo Ghat, academic sessions at Banaras Hindu University, as well as cultural programmes.One of the things that makes me most happy about the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam is the participation of thousands of youngsters. It illustrates the passion among our Yuva Shakti to deepen their connect with our roots. It is a brilliant platform for them to showcase their talent and creativity during the various cultural programmes.In addition to the Sangamam, efforts have been made to make the journey to Kashi memorable for the participants. The Indian Railways operated special trains to take people from Tamil Nadu to Uttar Pradesh. In many railway stations, particularly in Tamil Nadu, they were cheered, and the train journey was marked by melodious songs and conversations.Here, I would also like to appreciate my sisters and brothers of Kashi and Uttar Pradesh for their warmth and hospitality shown to the delegates of the various Kashi-Tamil Sangamams. Several people opened the doors of their homes for the guests from Tamil Nadu. The local administration worked round the clock to ensure the guests had a seamless experience. As the MP from Varanasi, I could not be prouder! This time, the valedictory function of the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam was held in Rameswaram and it was graced by the Vice-President of India, Thiru CP Radhakrishnan Ji, who is himself a proud son of Tamil Nadu. He delivered a very inspiring address, emphasising India’s spiritual greatness and how such platforms deepen national integration.The Kashi Tamil Sangamam has delivered meaningful outcomes like strengthening cultural understanding, fostering academic and people-to-people exchanges and creating lasting bonds between parts of the country that share a civilisational ethos. In the coming times, we want to make this platform even more vibrant. Most importantly, it has furthered the spirit of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’. This spirit has flourished for centuries through our festivals, literature, music, art, cuisine, architecture, systems of knowledge and more.This time of the year is very auspicious for people across the length and breadth of India. People are enthusiastically marking various festivals like Sankranti, Uttarayan, Pongal , Magh Bihu, which are, among other things, associated with the Sun, nature and farming. These festivals bring people together and deepen the spirit of harmony in our society. I convey my best wishes for these festivals and hope they continue to inspire us to deepen national unity through our shared heritage and collective participation.The writer is the Prime Minister of India","PM Modi was in the sacred land of Somnath to mark a thousand years since the first attack on the holy site. He was also in Kashi for the fourth edition of the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam.

Gold price prediction

today:

Gold and silver prices may continue to rally with a positive bias, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. He shares his outlook for gold and silver prices in the coming days:

Bullions Weekly Update

Gold and Silver Storm to Record this week as Fed Hit With DOJ Subpoenas, Geopolitics continues to augment safe haven flows.

Gold & Silver climbed to records in a broad-based metals rally as the US Justice Department threatened the Federal Reserve with a criminal indictment, reviving concerns about the central bank’s independence

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier in the week that the potential indictment comes amid “threats and ongoing pressure” by the administration to influence interest-rate decisions

Geopolitical tensions remained elevated from the start of week, boosting safe-haven assets such as Gold.

US Macro cues showed the US economy added 50,000 jobs in December, below the consensus as Gold price ended the last week with a 4.10% gain. Job growth fell well below expectations; the unemployment rate also edged down.

Structural support also remains strong with China’s central bank extending its gold-buying streak to 14 months, tightening available supply.

US CPI numbers witnessed inflation remaining steady but Core CPI edged down on yearly & monthly basis indicating more interest rate cuts could persist this year while focus remains on PPI numbers to be released later this week.

Gold Price Outlook

Weekly View:

Gold (CMP $4579/Oz) – Positive Bias

Silver – (CMP $86.50/Oz) - Buy on Dips with levels of $ 90 – 95 achievable in 1 – 2 weeks

Repeated attacks on the Fed by the Trump administration were a major factor propelling gold and silver to successive peaks last year, and that driver looks set to persist this year.

A potentially bigger risk to the Fed comes on Jan. 21 when the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the case against Fed Governor Lisa Cook

More than a dozen money managers said they’ve opted not to take too much money off the table in gold, holding conviction in its long-term appeal

Deadly protests in Iran have reintroduced a fresh layer of uncertainty, with the key risk being the prospect of renewed US involvement in the region

The US Supreme Court, meanwhile, set Wednesday for the next possible opinion day on President Donald Trump’s tariffs. A ruling against the levies would undercut his signature economic policy and deliver his biggest legal defeat since returning to the White House

Traders are also waiting for results from the so-called Section 232 investigation, which may lead to US tariffs on silver, platinum and palladium

All eyes remain on US CPI as well PPI data for further direction to precious metal prices.

Silver, having breached all-time highs yesterday @ $ 84.01/Oz in spot tested in the last week of December, is all set to rally further on bullish breakouts seen on technical charts. It looks increasingly positively biased for next month with levels of $ 95 – 98 /Oz looks achievable in 2 – 3 week’s timeframe with MCX futures might rally further towards Rs. 2,95,000 – 3,00,000/Kg levels.

MUMBAI: As Maharashtra heads to elections on Thursday for 29 municipal corporations, all eyes are on Mumbai, where the BJP-led Mahayuti is locked in a battle with the united Thackeray front for control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Polling for the 2,869 seats spread across 893 wards will begin at 7.30 am and conclude at 5.30 pm on January 15. A total of 3.48 crore voters are eligible to decide the fate of 15,931 candidates, including 1,700 in Mumbai and 1,166 in Pune. Counting of votes will take place on January 16.More than 25,000 police personnel, including senior officers, will be deployed across Mumbai to oversee elections to the BMC and vote counting. Except for Mumbai, the other 28 urban bodies have multi-member wards.This will be the Shiv Sena’s first BMC election since the 2022 split, when Eknath Shinde broke away with a majority of the party’s legislators, along with its name and symbol. The undivided Shiv Sena had held sway over the country’s richest civic body for 25 years.In a political turn ahead of the elections, estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray reunited after two decades in their bid to consolidate Marathi votes, even as rival NCP factions forged a local alliance in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In this election, the Opposition Congress has asserted its presence in Mumbai by stepping out of the shadow of its Maha Vikas Aghadi allies — Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP). The Congress has joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh in the state capital, even as it contests independently in Nagpur.Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years, with their terms having ended between 2020 and 2023. Of these, nine fall within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the most urbanised belt in India.The battlegrounds include Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Mumbai, Solapur, Amravati, Akola, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Ulhasnagar, Thane, Chandrapur, Parbhani, Mira-Bhayandar, Nanded-Waghala, Panvel, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Latur, Malegaon, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, Jalgaon, Ahilyanagar, Dhule, Jalna, and Ichalkaranji.Chief Minister Fadnavis, along with his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, campaigned extensively across Maharashtra, while cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray concentrated their efforts on Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where Uddhav held a rally. Telangana minister Mohammad Azharuddin, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, and Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai were also among the star campaigners for the polls.Populist promises for women were the highlight of the manifestos of both the Mahayuti and the Shiv Sena (UBT)-MNS. The Mahayuti has promised a 50 per cent concession for women in BEST bus travel, while the Thackeray cousins have assured a Rs 1,500 monthly allowance for women domestic helps and a property tax waiver on houses up to 700 sq ft. The Congress manifesto, by contrast, prioritises combating Mumbai’s pollution, upgrading the BEST fleet, and strengthening the city’s financial health.The race for Mumbai’s mayoral post took centre stage in the campaign, with the BJP claiming that a Sena (UBT) victory could lead to a Muslim mayor, a charge the Uddhav Thackeray-led party countered by assuring voters of a Marathi mayor. CM Fadnavis also guaranteed that the mayor will be a ""Hindu and Marathi.""In the 227-ward Mumbai, the BJP is contesting 137 seats, the Shiv Sena 90, while the NCP is fighting separately on 94 seats. The Shiv Sena (UBT) has fielded 163 candidates, the MNS 52, the Congress 143 and the VBA 46. The Congress has fielded 1,263 candidates across the rest of the state.The Maharashtra State Election Commission on Friday announced that Thursday, January 15, will be a public holiday in areas falling under the 29 municipal corporations where polling will be held, an official said.The holiday will apply to government and semi-government offices, corporations, boards, public undertakings, banks, and central government offices within the jurisdiction of the civic bodies.The poll comission said administrative preparations, including readiness of EVMs, have been completed and urged the public to take an active part in the democratic exercise.","Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years.

India’s gateway to Central Asia

How Iran historically balanced Pakistan

The Shia factor

Trade relations and economic stakes

The China angle

Pragmatism and caution: India’s Dilemma

As protests driven by economic distress and political fatigue spread across Iranian cities, New Delhi is watching events unfold with quiet unease. For India, the question is not whether Iran’s clerical leadership can weather the unrest, but what a weakened or collapsing Iranian state would mean for India’s already constrained strategic environment.India’s engagement with Iran has never been ideological. It has been shaped by geography, access and balance. With Pakistan blocking overland routes to Afghanistan and Central Asia, Iran has long functioned as India’s only viable western corridor. It has also acted as a counterweight to Pakistani influence in the region and as a stabilising pillar in India’s carefully calibrated West Asia policy, which seeks engagement across rival power blocs.A sudden weakening or collapse of the Iranian state would not produce a clean transition. It would generate uncertainty at a moment when India’s strategic room for manoeuvre is already narrowing — with Bangladesh in uncertainty with reports of minority killings, Pakistan being Pakistan, China expanding its footprint across the region and the US under Donald Trump hurtling the world into one crisis after another.Any disruption in Iran would ripple outward, reshaping trade routes, diplomatic alignments and security calculations that India has spent decades managing.But why does Iran matter to India?For decades, Iran has served as India’s most viable land bridge to Afghanistan and Central Asia. With Pakistan denying India overland access, Tehran became the cornerstone of New Delhi’s westward connectivity strategy.At the heart of this vision lies Chabahar Port. Developed with Indian assistance, Chabahar was designed to give India direct access to the Iranian coast, bypassing Pakistan entirely, and linking onward to Afghanistan and Central Asia through road and rail networks. For India, Chabahar was not merely a commercial port; it was a strategic statement — proof that geography need not be destiny.JNU professor Rajan Kumar in conversation with the Times of India says: “Iran remains India’s most important land bridge to Central Asia, since Pakistan denies India access to overland routes.” Even after the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan and the stalling of rail projects due to sanctions, the logic of Chabahar has not disappeared. If anything, it has become more critical.A regime change that leads to prolonged instability would place these projects in jeopardy. Connectivity corridors require political coherence, security guarantees and long-term planning. As Kumar warns, “In a post-Khamenei power struggle, Chabahar risks becoming a hostage to instability rather than a strategic asset.” For India, losing Iran as a stable transit partner would mean losing its only realistic access point to Central Asia.Iran’s value to India has not only been geographic; it has also been strategic. Despite being a Muslim-majority country, Tehran has never aligned itself with Pakistan’s anti-India narrative. On the contrary, Iran has consistently opposed Sunni extremist groups that threaten Shia populations — the very networks that have targeted Indian interests over the decades.This divergence mattered deeply in the 1990s and early 2000s. As Pakistan backed the Taliban to secure “strategic depth” in Afghanistan, Iran and India found themselves on the same side, supporting anti-Taliban forces. This convergence quietly limited Pakistan’s influence in the region and prevented Islamabad from monopolising Afghanistan’s political future.If Iran weakens or splinters, that balance erodes by default. Pakistan’s influence in Afghanistan and Central Asia would grow — not necessarily through dramatic victories, but through the absence of a counterweight.Kumar puts it starkly: “If Iran weakens or fragments internally, Pakistan stands to gain indirectly.”Iran has also been a diplomatic counterweight to Pakistan. In the mid-1990s, when Pakistan pushed for international sanctions on India over Kashmir, Tehran came to India’s aid.A weakened Iran would remove these quiet levers of influence against Pakistan. Professor Kumar warns that “India would certainly lose an important counterweight in the region if there is a regime change in Iran and a government hostile to India comes to power”.For India already facing a locked-out western corridor (due to Pakistani opposition), Tehran’s support on regional issues – even if largely rhetorical – is valuable. As Kumar notes, Iran has “never aligned itself with Pakistan’s position on Kashmir in any substantive way.”Iran is the world’s largest Shia-majority power, and its position in West Asia gives it a distinctive role as a counterweight to Sunni-dominated states such as Saudi Arabia.A collapse of Iran’s Shia clerical system – or its replacement by a Sunni-leaning government aligned with Gulf capitals or the United States – could leave the Middle East more uniformly Sunni-oriented. For India, that shift would matter. New Delhi has carefully built relationships across religious and political divides, engaging simultaneously with Tehran, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, Tel Aviv and Washington. This broad-based engagement has long reflected India’s non-aligned and pluralist foreign policy tradition. A marginalised or weakened Iran would deprive India of one of its key diplomatic levers.There is also scepticism about the assumption that regime change would automatically produce a more moderate or liberal government. As Dr Ashok Sharma cautions, “even if there is a regime change, it does not automatically mean the next dispensation will be liberal or fundamentally different”. He adds that “whether the regime is Shia or Sunni does not radically alter the strategic picture, because the internal dynamics in West Asia are far more complicated”.From New Delhi’s perspective, the collapse of the current order could simply lead to another ideologically rigid theocracy, making outcomes harder to predict. India has often found it safer to deal with a familiar, if difficult, clerical establishment than to navigate an uncertain and potentially hostile alternative.This dilemma is sharpened by India’s deep economic and human ties with the Sunni Gulf states, where millions of Indian nationals live and work.Yet India’s diplomatic success in West Asia has rested on its non-sectarian posture. As Kumar observes, “India has quietly benefited from Iran being the principal Shia power in West Asia.” With Iran in its current role, India has been able to maintain productive relations across the region.Kumar argues that India’s strength lies in “multi-alignment”, combining close ties with the US, Israel and Gulf Arab states with a long-standing partnership with Tehran. A more one-dimensional, Sunni-aligned Middle East would force India into uncomfortable strategic trade-offs.There is also a security dimension. Iran has often opposed Sunni extremist groups that threaten both Shias and Indian interests.Organisations such as the Taliban and ISIS have targeted Shia communities in Iran, prompting Tehran to deploy forces like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps against them.These are the same militant networks that have attacked Indian interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Losing Iran as a counterweight to such extremism would add to regional instability. As Prof Kumar puts it, “India has strong relations with Shia Iran as well as Sunni countries… if Iran were also to turn hostile, [that] would create serious strategic problems for India in West Asia and beyond”.In trade terms, India–Iran commerce is currently small, but not negligible. India’s total bilateral trade with Iran was about $1.3–$1.7 billion in the past year – roughly 0.1% of India’s overall trade. The bulk of this is Indian exports of foodgrains (especially basmati rice), pharmaceuticals and agricultural goods. Conversely, India’s imports from Iran are limited – mostly dry fruits and some chemicals – and oil imports have been virtually eliminated by sanctions. In practice, most Indo-Iran trade today qualifies as “humanitarian” (food and medicine) and is exempt from penalties.So why does Iran matter economically? First, trade is a signal of wider connectivity. The fact that India still ranks among Iran’s top 10 sources for exports (around 8th place in 2025) indicates these linkages, however small, are hard to replace.Second, India has sunk over $1 billion into Chabahar and related projects, with committed credit lines for infrastructure. Any regime change that imperils these investments would be a direct hit on taxpayer money. Already, India had to delay or restructure parts of the project to comply with US sanctions. Another disruption could force India to write off or renegotiate more of its contributions.Iran’s tilt in favor of China is another reason India must be wary of upheaval in Tehran. In 2021, Iran and China inked a much-publicized 25-year strategic cooperation pact. Trade data reflect this pivot. In 2024–25, China was by far Iran’s largest export market, over $14.5 billion worth of Iranian goods went to China, most of it oil and gas. In fact, as Western sanctions have bitten, Tehran has leaned heavily on Beijing to buy its discounted oil and fund infrastructure projects.If Tehran were to break with its existing regime, China could potentially reap more benefits. An Iran in chaos or a regime installed with external backing might lean even further on Beijing for security and investment. Already, Iranian officials are discussing Chinese-funded power plants and port projects in Khuzestan. Subnational ties are growing too: President Xi has visited Iran and assured continued support. A new Chinese-aligned government in Tehran could marginalize India’s role.Conversely, India’s presence in Iran – especially at Chabahar – is a modest counterbalance to China’s inroads. Beijing-backed Gwadar Port in Pakistan and the INSTC are part of two competing visions.For New Delhi the loss of Tehran as an independent player only leaves more space for Chinese dominance.Professor Kumar emphasizes this point: “Given the ongoing protests, India is likely to adopt a ‘wait and watch’ policy,” he says, wary of what a US-backed or sudden regime change could mean. If a new Iranian government tilts sharply toward one side, India’s ability to engage with multiple poles (Tehran, Riyadh, Washington, even Beijing) would shrink. Thus, regime upheaval could inadvertently advantage China: a stronger Iran–China axis would give Beijing a bigger say in Iran’s regional posture, potentially to India’s detriment.Faced with these realities, India’s foreign policy has so far been cautious. New Delhi has refrained from overtly supporting Iranian protesters or endorsing regime change. As Prof. Kumar notes, “India would not support protest groups or any form of external intervention in Iran… Any political change, if it occurs, must be domestic.” India’s BRICS philosophy of sovereignty and non-interference is also guiding this approach. The priority is to keep lines of communication open with Iran’s government, however challenged it may be.Dr Sharma highlights that India’s goal is continuity of engagement, not ideological victory. “Even if there is a regime change… from India’s perspective, whether the regime is Shia or Sunni does not radically alter the strategic picture,” he told the Times of India.New Delhi’s policy, he argues, will remain pragmatic: engaging Tehran while managing relations with other powers. In practice, that means making sure that sanctions or a new government do not strangle projects like Chabahar entirely. It also means relying on India’s deep ties with the United States and the Gulf to maintain leverage.The glass-half-empty scenario for India is clear: Iranian clerical rule remains imperfect, but it is predictable and has afforded India important strategic benefits. A sudden regime change – especially one that is precipitated or exploited by foreign powers – could upend this delicate equilibrium.As Prof Kumar bluntly puts it, “Continuity in Iran’s current system has often served India’s interests better than chaos.”Iran’s current system is constraining, often frustrating, and increasingly brittle. Yet it remains a known quantity, one with which India has learned to negotiate access, balance rivals, and preserve strategic autonomy.A fractured Iran, or one pulled decisively into the orbit of a single external power, would narrow India’s diplomatic options and weaken its long-standing policy of multi-alignment.For India, a stable if frosty Tehran is less risky than an unstable or hostile one.","India's engagement with Iran has never been ideological. It has been shaped by geography, access and balance. With Pakistan blocking overland routes to Afghanistan and Central Asia, Iran has long functioned as India’s only viable western corridor. A sudden weakening of the Iranian state would not produce a clean transition.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126527868,imgsize-1408327,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Where is Sena (UBT) headed?

The January 15 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections will be an acid test for the Shiv Sena (UBT), marking its third electoral battle since the dramatic split of June 2022. Having lost control of the civic body it governed for 25 consecutive years as the undivided Shiv Sena , it is now seeking to reclaim Mumbai’s powerful municipal corporation, which last went to the polls in February 2017.The task, however, is far from straightforward for the Uddhav Thackeray-led Sena (UBT). In a bid to consolidate the Marathi vote, the former Maharashtra chief minister has formed an alliance with his once-estranged cousin Raj Thackeray. Raj had broken away from the Shiv Sena in November 2005 to form the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) in March 2006.Despite this reunion, Sena (UBT) confronts multiple hurdles in its effort to regain control of the Maharashtra capital’s municipal authority — India’s richest civic corporation and one of the wealthiest in Asia.The civic body, formally known as the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), was established in 1873. It was only in 1948 — the year following India’s independence — that the BMC held its first elections based on adult franchise.The corporation, with an annual budget exceeding those of several small states, introduced 140 single-member constituencies in 1963, followed by elections in 1968. The number was later increased to 170 (in 1982) and then 221 (in 1991).The current strength of the corporation — 227 seats — was fixed in 2002.The corporation’s long history, its status as the civic body of the country’s largest metropolis — also the nation’s financial and entertainment capital — and its close links with the state’s politics mean that the BMC polls carry greater significance than many state assembly elections and attract more attention than those forany other municipal corporation.A significantly weakened Shiv Sena (UBT) now faces the following challenges in its bid to wrest back control of the BMC.The BMC has often been referred to as a “Sena-controlled” body. Yet, this description does not tell the fullstory - the party has never won an outright majority on its own and has always governed by forming alliances. It first won the BMC in 1985, securing 74 out of 170 seats (140 contested). Its best performance to date came in 1997, when it won 103 of the total 221 seats. After that, its tally slipped below 100, eventually settling at 84 in 2017, proof of its limitations.Initially the junior partner in its alliance with the Sena, the BJP finally became the “big brother” in the 2014 Maharashtra assembly elections and later, the state’s largest party. Its BMC tally, which had long hovered in the 20s and 30s since its formation in 1980, surged dramatically to 82 in 2017—just two short of its then-ally. It now aims to take control of the corporation for the first time, a task that, while not straightforward, appears less challenging than it once did.The Sena split dealt a double blow to Uddhav Thackeray . Not only did it bring down his MVA government and saw him lose the status of the “real” Shiv Sena, but the real damage came in Eknath Shinde taking away a large portion of the original Shiv Sena’s core strength—its ground cadre—and its traditional vote base. In the 2019 assembly polls, the united Shiv Sena had won around 16% of the vote. Five years later, the two factions together secured what would have been over 20% vote as a joint entity: 12% for the Shinde group and 10% for Uddhav.The score currently stands at 1-1: the Uddhav faction emerged ahead in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, while the Shinde group led in the state elections just a few months later.Often labelled a “firebrand” leader, Raj Thackeray has struggled to convert rhetoric into lasting electoral gains for the MNS. The party, known primarily for its anti-migrant plank, peaked early—winning 13 seats in the 2009 Maharashtra assembly elections, including six in Mumbai. Its only other notable success came in the 2012 BMC polls, where it secured 27 seats, a performance it has been unable to replicate since. Beyond these brief highs, the MNS has struggled to remain electorally relevant as Maharashtra’s politics consolidated around bigger players.The proportion of Marathi-speaking residents in Mumbai is lower than might be expected—not surprising for a cosmopolitan city. The 2011 Census showed that in the capital of a Marathi-speaking state, only 35% of the 12.5 million residents reported it as their mother tongue, followed by Hindi at 25% (and naturally, not all Marathi-speakers in the city vote for either party).Further, the anti-migrant image of both Sena (UBT) and MNS limits their reach among the non-Marathi communities.Historically, Muslims had largely avoided voting for the Shiv Sena because of its Hindutva identity. That changed in 2019 with the formation of the MVA. Many in the community voted for the Sena (UBT) also to keep the BJP out—a pattern seen with anti-BJP parties in other parts of India. Uddhav’s new “moderate” image also played a big role in drawing Muslims votes. According to a CSDS study, the MVA secured 55% of the Muslim vote in the 2024 state elections, while the BJP-led Mahayuti received 22% of the community’s support.With Sena (UBT) now aligned with the MNS, another Hindutva party, it remains to be seen whether Muslim voters will continue to back Uddhav Thackeray. The presence of other parties for whom the community has traditionally voted could also lead to a fragmentation of the vote.As per the 2011 Census, Muslims constituted 21% of the city’s population.Civic issues are expected to play a key role in the BMC elections, with annual monsoon waterlogging remaining one of Mumbai’s most persistent problems. Despite repeated promises and heavy spending on drainage projects, large parts of the city continue to be paralysed every year. Given the Shiv Sena’s long dominance of the BMC, this issue is closely linked to its civic governance record, making it a crucial test for Sena (UBT) as it seeks to reclaim control of the corporation.It is often said in politics that 1 + 1 equals 11, not two. With little to lose and much to gain, a reunion of the Thackerays could play to their advantage. While the sympathy factor did not help Uddhav Thackeray in the 2024 state polls, a renewed alliance with his cousin could resonate strongly with Marathi pride and identity.The numbers also offer encouraging signs for the Sena (UBT). Of its 20 seats in the Maharashtra assembly, Mumbai alone accounts for half. In six of these constituencies, UBT candidates even defeated nominees from the Shinde faction, suggesting that the party’s core base in the metropolis has not completely eroded.In their joint manifesto, titled “Vachan Nama, Shabd Thackerencha” (promissory note of the Thackerays), the Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS alliance has promised that Mumbai’s land would be usednly for housing Mumbaikars. It has also announced that the BMC would have its own housing authority, 100 units of free power for residential use through the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking, Rs 1,500 financial assistance for house helps and women from the Koli community, women’s restrooms on major roads, and a property tax waiver for houses up to 700 sq ft, among other civic measures.The long-delayed BMC polls will test Sena (UBT)’s relevance in Mumbai, the city of its birth and its home since then. After years of ups and downs, the results will show whether the Thackeray faction can rebuild its base and reclaim influence in the city. A win would provide a much-needed boost, while a defeat would leave the party grappling with even more questions about its future.","The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections will be an acid test for the Shiv Sena (UBT) The party has never won an outright majority on its own and has always governed by forming alliances.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim - dispute explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126523897.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?

NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.

Third Stage Trouble Strikes Again: Inside ISRO’s PSLV-C62 Deviation And What The Failure Means Ahead

NEW DELHI: When its third phase failed on Monday, Isro’s PSLV-C62 launch vehicle lost 15 satellites from several countries and Indian companies, including the primary payload. However, a football-sized Spanish satellite called KID (Kestrel Initial Demonstrator), survived, though it transmitted “critical data” back to Earth for only about 3 minutes.The 25-kg satellite separated “against all odds” from PSLV's fourth stage despite the third-stage anomaly that caused the mission to fail. The satellite’s developer, Orbital Paradigm, said on X, “Our KID capsule... separated from PSLV C62, switched on, and transmitted data…”KID, designed for re-entry testing towards a splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean, endured peak deceleration forces and thermal stresses that would pulverise most experimental hardware. “We’re reconstructing trajectory. We survived peak heat and peak g-load (~28g recorded). We have internal temps. Full report will come,” the company said.Developed with French partner RIDE, KID validates Orbital Paradigm’s reusable re-entry technology, crucial for future satellite servicing and de-orbiting.The startup plans a detailed report soon and is likely to accelerate Kestrel’s full-scale development programme.Tragedy struck PSLV when an “anomaly” in the third stage diverted the rocket from its flight path, preventing sun-synchronous orbit insertion of its payload.Isro chairman V Narayanan said on Monday, “Near the end of the third stage, we observed some disturbance in the vehicle, and there was a deviation in its flight path. As a result, the mission could not proceed as expected.” After his statement, it was assumed that all the 16 satellites, including primary payload EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a hyperspectral earth imaging satellite developed by DRDO for national security and surveillance, were lost.KID turned out to be the only to survive long enough to transmit signals. Orbital Paradigm is yet to confirm if the capsule later burned out or splashed down on Earth.","Isro’s PSLV-C62 launch vehicle lost 15 satellites from several countries and Indian companies, including the primary payload.

NEET-PG cut-off score now fixed at -40 out of 800,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-pg-cut-off-score-now-fixed-at-40-out-of-800/articleshow/126514156.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday lowered qualifying cut-off for NEET-PG 2025, paving the way to fill over 9,000 vacant PG medical seats, amid concerns that a big chunk of training capacity was being wasted at a time of acute doctor shortages.Under the revised criteria, qualifying percentile for general and EWS candidates has been reduced from 50th to 7th percentile, and for general persons with benchmark disability (PwBD) from 45th to 5th percentile. For SC, ST and OBC candidates, the percentile has been reduced from 40 to zero, with the corresponding cut-off score fixed at -40 out of 800 (due to negative marking).The decision was notified by National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS), which revised qualifying percentiles across categories to expand eligibility for counselling and admissions. Officials said around 2.4 lakh candidates appeared for NEET-PG this year, but a high cut-off had left thousands of seats unfilled.Officials said India has 65,000-70,000 PG medical seats, and allowing nearly one in seven seats to remain vacant would weaken teaching hospitals and strain healthcare delivery, particularly in govt institutions that rely heavily on resident doctors. The relaxation followed a representation by Indian Medical Association (IMA), which had written to Union health minister JP Nadda on Jan 12, seeking a rational revision of cut-offs to prevent large-scale vacancies.Explaining the move, NBEMS officials said the entrance exam is meant to generate a merit list, not to reassess the competence of doctors who have already cleared MBBS and university exams. ""You can't afford to let 9,000-10,000 PG seats go to waste,"" an official said.The official acknowledged that sharp percentile reductions attract criticism but said the admission cycle was already delayed. ""Earlier, cut-offs were lowered in stages. This time, we are late. The focus is to fill seats and avoid losing national medical resources,"" he said.NBEMS clarified that the cut-off change does not alter exam scores or ranks, but only decides who is eligible to participate in counselling. Officials said the percentile system is used to rank already qualified doctors, and the cut-off was lowered simply to ensure enough candidates are available to fill all PG seats.IMA warned that vacant PG seats worsen resident doctor shortages, increase workload, disrupt academics and hurt patient care, especially in government and peripheral hospitals.","Officials said India has 65,000-70,000 PG medical seats, and allowing nearly one in seven seats to remain vacant would weaken teaching hospitals.

Sacrifices of IPKF troops who took part in Lanka peace mission neglected: Rajnath,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sacrifices-of-ipkf-troops-who-took-part-in-lanka-peace-mission-neglected-rajnath/articleshow/126536797.cms,"NEW DELHI: The sacrifices of Indian soldiers during Operation Pawan in Sri Lanka nearly 40 years ago should be recognised and honoured, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday regretting that the then govts did not “respect” their contributions.“The decision taken by the then govt to send Indian troops to Sri Lanka is open to debate, but the neglect of IPKF troops who took part in the operation cannot be justified in any sense. Their sacrifice and struggle during that period was not respected,” Rajnath said at an event to mark the 10th Armed Forces Veterans’ Day. India had lost around 1,200 soldiers during the IPKF’s stay in Sri Lanka between July 1987 and March 1990.The Modi govt is “not only acknowledging the contribution of the peacekeepers who participated in Operation Pawan with an open mind, but is also in the process of recognising their contribution at every level”, he said, adding that during the operation Pawan, the Indian forces displayed amazing courage and valour.“Many soldiers died in the line of duty. Their courage and sacrifice should have been an inspiration for our future generations, but unfortunately it did not happen,” Rajnath said.When PM Narendra Modi visited Sri Lanka in 2015, he paid homage to Indian soldiers at the IPKF memorial, he said. “Now, we are also recognising the contributions of the IPKF soldiers at the National War Memorial in New Delhi and giving them the respect they deserve,” the minister said.India and Sri Lanka signed a historic peace accord on July 29, 1987, following which New Delhi deployed the IPKF in the island nation to bring peace in Tamil-dominated areas that had witnessed widespread violence and civil strife for years. However, peace eluded the regions and the IPKF was eventually pulled out. While the decision to send the IPKF was taken by the Rajiv Gandhi govt, the troops were pulled out of the island nation when the VP Singh dispensation was in power.Rajnath described veterans as the living pillars of national consciousness, symbols of collective courage, and an inspiration to the future generations. He urged them to guide the youth through their experiences. provide the right direction to Agniveers and young soldiers. He reiterated his govt’s resolve of veterans’ welfare, enumerating the concrete steps taken in this direction, including fulfilling the long-pending demand of One Rank One Pension (OROP) and strengthening Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS).The secretary (ex-servicemen welfare) pointed out that around 60,000 soldiers retire every year, resulting in about 3.5 million veterans, which indicates that the welfare of ex-servicemen is a huge responsibility that the nation must fulfil.","India lost around 1,200 soldiers during the IPKF’s stay in Sri Lanka between July 1987 and March 1990.

LeT Commander's Jihad Call Mirrors Pak Army Rhetoric As Terror And State Lines Blur On Kashmir

NEW DELHI: In a chilling display of their desperate desire to avenge the destruction they suffered during Operation Sindoor, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) top commander Abu Musa Kashmiri has been captured on video spewing genocidal venom against India and the Hindu community.Addressing a gathering of radicals in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir , he told his followers their goals and independence would never be achieved through ""begging"" but by ""slitting the throats of Hindus"", a statement that underscores the barbaric ideology fueling these dying outfits. Musa said he had informed the Wazir-e-Azam (Pakistani PM) the Kashmir issue can be resolved only through jihad and terrorism ""Azaadi bheek se nahi... Hinduon ki gardanein kaatne se milegi,"" he said in a rally near LoC in Rawalakot's Hajira Tehsil.Given the experience of such bellicose jehadi rhetoric turning out to be precursors to terror attacks, Musa's remarks have captured the attention of the intelligence establishment. He had engaged in similar rhetoric before the Pahalgam attack, during which Lashkar terrorists massacred tourists after marking them out on the basis of faith.Musa's speech comes at a time when visuals of another gathering have surfaced, showing top LeT commanders in Bahawalpur, a JeM stronghold. The timing of these outbursts is significant as they mirror the narrative being pushed by Pakistan Army chief, sources noted.",LeT commander Abu Musa Kashmiri has been captured on video spewing genocidal venom against India and the Hindu community.

Why cut-offs for NEET-PG seats keep falling repeatedly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-cut-offs-for-neet-pg-seats-keep-falling-repeatedly/articleshow/126536411.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The repeated lowering of NEET-PG cut-offs has reignited concerns over the quality of postgraduate medical training, with critics warning that successive relaxations risk diluting standards at a time when patient care is already under strain.Health ministry officials acknowledge these concerns but argue that the policy reflects a difficult trade-off between preserving academic standards, addressing acute doctor shortages and utilising public investment. Each postgraduate medical seat costs govt several crores of rupees to create, officials said, and unfilled seats cannot be carried forward to next year.""Final competence is not tested at entry but at the exit stage,"" a senior official said, noting that all PG students undergo three years of supervised training and must clear final university exams where no relaxation is permitted.The immediate trigger for the latest cut-off reduction is the scale of vacancies. Around 9,000 PG seats are lying vacant under the All India Quota, officials said. When state quotas are included, the total number of unfilled postgraduate seats nationwide is estimated at around 18,000 - despite 1.5-2.2 lakh candidates appearing for NEET-PG each year.While 70-80% of PG seats are in clinical disciplines, a disproportionate share of vacant seats lie in pre- and para-clinical subjects such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, microbiology and pharmacology.Some clinical seats also remain unfilled, particularly in peripheral govt hospitals, district hospitals and DNB institutions.Officials said the problem becomes evident after Round 1 and Round 2 of counselling, when seats in less developed institutions are repeatedly skipped. Candidates cite poor infrastructure, limited clinical exposure, low stipends, difficult locations and weak career prospects, often preferring to wait for another exam cycle or opt selectively for private colleges. To prevent seats from going to waste, the authorities lower the qualifying percentile before Round 3 of counselling, widening eligibility and avoiding automatic category conversions.Officials stressed this does not alter exam scores or ranks. NEET-PG, they said, is not a licensing exam but a ranking test to allocate seats among already qualified doctors.Dr Naval K Vikram, AIIMS professor from medicine department, clarified the percentile system works on a relative basis. ""If 100 candidates appear and the top scorer gets 76 marks, that candidate is assigned the 100th percentile. Percentile does not mean percentage marks,"" he said.Because of negative marking, candidates can score zero or even negative marks. ""A zero percentile only means the candidate is at the bottom of the ranking. It does not mean zero medical knowledge,"" he said.The reduction in NEET-PG qualifying percentiles is not new and has been used repeatedly in the past few years to address large numbers of vacant PG seats. In 2023, the qualifying percentile was lowered to zero across all categories. In 2024, it was reduced to the 5th percentile for all categories.In 2025, the qualifying criteria were relaxed further in a graded manner: the cut-off was brought down to the 7th percentile for General/EWS candidates, 5th percentile for General PwBD candidates, and 0 percentile for SC/ST/OBC candidates, including PwBD, reflecting continuing efforts to widen eligibility and fill unoccupied PG seats.Experts said in most exams, cut-offs are meant to preserve quality and lowering them too much risks diluting standards - a concern that remains central to the debate.A PG student, who cleared the exam, said that the system is often misunderstood. ""Seats remain vacant because many colleges and subjects are unattractive, not because there are no candidates,"" the student said.Officials admitted that the debate on quality cannot be ignored. According to them, the core problem is the uneven development of medical institutions. Well-equipped govt colleges and metro hospitals fill their seats early, while under-resourced centres struggle year after year.Critics warned that lowering cut-offs shifts focus away from improving institutions. ""Lowering cut-offs fills seats, but unless hospitals and training quality improve, it risks diluting postgraduate standards,"" said an official familiar with counselling data.IMA junior doctors' network spokesperson Dr Dhruv Chauhan said the move would disproportionately benefit private colleges. ""Money and class will decide healthcare outcomes instead of merit. Seats will again be sold for crores,"" he said.But officials maintained that until infrastructure improves and peripheral institutions become viable training centres, lowering cut-offs remains a temporary but necessary measure.","Health ministry officials acknowledge these concerns but argue that the policy reflects a difficult trade-off between preserving academic standards and addressing acute doctor shortages.

NEW DELHI: To prevent thousands of postgraduate medical seats from going to waste, the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) has again allowed NEET-PG 2025 candidates to apply for conversion of nationality status from Indian to Non-Resident Indian (NRI) ahead of the third and final round of counselling.Conversion from Indian to NRI status is tightly regulated. Only blood relatives up to second-degree relations can sponsor a candidate, with mandatory affidavits, proof of relationship and evidence of financial capacity through NRI bank accounts. Applications are vetted by third-party agencies, and officials said most are rejected due to incomplete or invalid documentation. Even after eligibility expansion, many NRI seats remain vacant. Unfilled seats are eventually converted back to non-NRI seats and offered to general candidates, ensuring they are not wasted.Officials stressed the move does not create new seats, expand quotas or alter merit lists. ""This is only about widening eligibility to fill seats that already exist,"" an official said.

70% of 41 crore vehicles fail to meet statutory compliances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70-of-41-crore-vehicles-fail-to-meet-statutory-compliances/articleshow/126536151.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Over 70% of 40.7 crore vehicles, mostly two-wheelers, in the country do not comply with some or other norm, such as those related to pollution under control (PUC) certificate, fitness certificate or insurance, according to road transport ministry data.The data, shared with states and UTs in a meeting last week, showed over two-thirds of these non-compliant vehicles - approximately 23.5 crore - are two-wheelers.Flagging this to states, the ministry has proposed a framework to ensure vehicle owners adhere to statutory compliances within a given period - else, gradually, non-compliant vehicles will be automatically de-registered. Officials said since a large number of vehicles in the Vahan database are legally or operationally not fit to ply, the overall count remains inflated.""Govt wants to clean the database. States have been urged to give feedback and also plan for sanitisation of the database,"" said an official. As per details, a little over 8.2 crore vehicles are active and fully compliant while over 30 crore have some compliance gaps. Another 2.2 crore are archived.The vehicles have been put in four categories - active-compliant (all valid), active non-compliant (some invalid), temporary archived (prolonged or repeated non-compliance) and permanent archived (scrapped, registration certificate cancelled, deregistered or surrendered).Among big states, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar have over 40% registered vehicles that are active but non-compliant. Telangana is the only state where their share is less than 20%. In the temporary archived vehicles category, Rajasthan, Odisha, Bihar, MP and Karnataka have more than 40%.According to the proposed framework, owners of active non-compliant vehicles would have to renew fitness, PUC certificate and insurance within a year. If they fail to do so, they would be put in the temporary archive category. Failing renewal of fitness, insurance and PUC certificate within two years would result in such vehicles falling in the permanent archive segment.Officials said this reclassification will happen automatically based on renewal of compliance checks. Permanent archive is final by default. Recovery is allowed in exceptional cases such as data errors, court orders or issue relating to migration legacy data. The transport commissioner's approval would be mandatory for this. All recoveries will be digitally logged, auditable and reported to ensure transparency,"" said an official.","Over 70% of 40.7 crore vehicles, mostly two-wheelers, in the country do not comply with some or other norm.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Railways has told the Central Information Commission (CIC) that the classification and methodology of fixing fares of different classes in passenger train falls in the domain of ""trade secret/intellectual property rights"", and therefore, cannot be disclosed under the Right to Information Act.This was disclosed while the CIC dismissed an application seeking detailed information on the base fare calculation mechanism for train tickets, including dynamic pricing and the impact of Tatkal bookings, with specific reference to Paschim Superfast Express.The online application filed on Jan 25, 2024, had asked railways to specify the components, parameters, dynamic pricing mechanisms, seasonal variations or other relevant factors influencing base fare calculation for tickets.In its reply, the central public information officer (CPIO) of the Railway Board stated that fares were charged based on class and the difference of fares in various classes was based on facilities provided. ""In so far as classification and methodology of fare fixation of different classes is concerned, the policy mechanism falls in the domain of trade secret/intellectual property rights and, as such its disclosure is not considered appropriate in public interest,"" the CPIO stated.The CPIO said that such information need not be shared under terms of Section 8(i)(d) of the RTl Act and added that this position had been upheld and reiterated by the Central Information Commission (CIC) in earlier orders.Section 8 of the RTI Act lists exemptions for information that does not have to be disclosed, protecting sensitive data like national security, trade secrets and personal privacy.""It is a known fact that the Indian Railways are run as a commercial utility and at the same time it being an instrumentality of state are required to discharge various social obligations in national interest,"" the railways said.The commission noted that the public information officer had already provided all disclosable information and general principles of railway rating policies, and was not required to create or interpret data beyond available records.Finding no infirmity in the reply and noting the appellant's absence during the hearing, information commissioner Swagat Das said no further intervention was required and disposed of the appeal.","The Indian Railways has told the Central Information Commission that the classification and methodology of fixing fares of different classes in passenger train falls in the domain of ""trade secret/intellectual property rights"" The CIC dismissed an application seeking detailed information on the base fare calculation mechanism.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126536138,imgsize-794308,width-400,resizemode-4/railways-indian_ians.jpg"

On this occasion, the Union Minister of State and the Chief Minister interacted with young innovators, teachers, investors and startup founders from universities, colleges and technical institutions, and reviewed the exhibition of student-led innovations.Jayant Chaudhary and Rekha Gupta visited the startup exhibition and observed various innovations, prototypes and business models on display, appreciating the creativity, problem-solving abilities and technological outlook of young entrepreneurs. They held detailed discussions with several student teams on their startup ideas, market strategies, and social impact, and assured them of continued guidance and support to help turn innovations into real-world solutions. Delhi Government Cabinet Minister Ashish Sood and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion.Union Minister of State Jayant Chaudhary said that India is a young nation with immense youth power, which gives the country tremendous working capacity.However, the true benefit of this demographic advantage will be realised only when young people are given opportunities to move forward, their talent is recognised, and their skills are refined.He said that earlier, the education system was such that students who did not fit into the traditional academic framework found the doors of schools and colleges almost closed. Even universities focus largely on textbook-based learning.The minister said that the prevailing mindset across the system was that only formal education mattered. However, he said that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision and the National Education Policy, this thinking is being transformed.The minister said that today, the focus should be not merely on degrees but on capabilities. This is possible only through skill-based education, experiential learning opportunities and exposure to the real world.Chief minister Rekha Gupta said that today's youth is no longer merely a 'job seeker', but is emerging as a 'job creator'. She noted that student startups in Delhi are demonstrating exceptional creativity and innovation, offering practical solutions to contemporary social, environmental and technological challenges.She said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a strong startup and innovation ecosystem has been developed across the country, providing young people with the platforms, policies and support needed to journey from idea to enterprise.The Delhi CM said her Government is also working rapidly in this direction by integrating education, skills and entrepreneurship to position the capital as the Startup Capital of India. The Chief Minister urged the youth to adopt a solutions-driven mindset for the nation, so that Delhi and India can lead global innovation.Delhi's education minister Ashish Sood said that startups had existed in Delhi earlier, but they were scattered. There was neither a clear startup policy nor a structured mechanism to connect students with industry, mentors and investors. Initiatives related to education and startups were largely limited to announcements. This mindset has now completely changed.The Delhi minister said that the state Government is building an ecosystem from school education to higher and technical education, placing skill development, entrepreneurship and innovation at the core, with public and private institutions working together.He said the Startup Yuva Festival exemplifies this transformation. For the first time, 11 universities, 12 colleges and 19 ITIs have been brought together on a single platform. The 'Campus to Market' approach has now been implemented in a structured manner, providing students with access to mentorship, funding and markets.At present, more than 75,000 students and young people are engaged in entrepreneurship programmes, and over 470 startups are in incubation. These student startups have generated Rs 500-600 crore in revenue, with each startup creating an average of 4-5 jobs.The education minister said that at the school level, under the NEEEV curriculum, 5,000 student teams have been provided assistance of Rs 20,000 per team. In addition, at the Startup Yuva Festival, the top six startups are awarded equity-free grants of Rs 10 lakh each, while the top 100 startups receive Rs 1 lakh each. He further stated that the Delhi Government will soon implement the Delhi Startup Policy, with a provision of Rs 325 crore over the next five years and a target to develop 5,000 startups by 2035.The Startup Yuva Festival 2026 is the Delhi Government's flagship programme, aimed at establishing Delhi as the Startup Capital of India. Organised by the Delhi Government, the festival is a significant initiative to take student-led startups from campus to market. Its objective is to convert innovations developed within educational institutions into commercially viable and sustainable enterprises.Under the 'Campus to Market' initiative, students had the opportunity to present their ideas to investors, mentors, and industry experts. The programme also featured knowledge sessions, policy roundtables and an award ceremony. Out of more than 700 applications, over 60 startups participated in the Startup Expo, of which the top 20 were selected for live pitching.

Shaksgam Valley Row Deepens As China Rejects India’s Claim And Defends CPEC Infra Project With Pak





China on Monday reaffirmed its territorial claims over Jammu and Kashmir Shaksgam Valley and defended its infrastructure projects in the region, rejecting India’s objections and insisting the construction is “beyond reproach”.Responding to India’s objections last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the area belongs to China and that Beijing is well within its rights to carry out development activities there.“The territory you mentioned belongs to China,” Mao told reporters. “It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory. China and Pakistan in the 1960s signed a boundary agreement and delimited the boundary between the two countries, which is the right of China and Pakistan as sovereign countries,” she said.India, however, has firmly rejected China’s claims and the legality of the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement under which Pakistan ceded around 5,180 sq km of territory in the Shaksgam Valley to China from areas under its illegal occupation. New Delhi maintains that the region is part of Indian territory.“Shaksgam Valley is Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan ‘boundary agreement’ signed in 1963.We have consistently maintained that the agreement is illegal and invalid,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said on Friday.He further said the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are “an integral and inalienable part of India”, adding that this stance has been “clearly conveyed to Pakistani and Chinese authorities several times”.China, however, rejected India’s objections to CPEC as well, reiterating its long-held position that the project is an economic cooperation initiative. Mao said the corridor is aimed at promoting local socio-economic development and improving people’s livelihoods.“The China-Pakistan boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue and the position remains unchanged,” she said, adding that Beijing believes the “Jammu and Kashmir dispute is left over from history, and should be properly and peacefully resolved in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements”.The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a multi-billion-dollar network of roads, railways and energy projects linking China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port. India opposes it because key segments pass through Indian territory.","China on Monday reaffirmed its territorial claims over Jammu and Kashmir Shaksgam Valley.

Stock market holiday: Why BSE and NSE are closed on January 15; what investors should know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-holiday-bse-nse-shut-on-january-15-due-to-maharashtra-civic-polls-fo-expiry-preponed/articleshow/126525563.cms,"Market holidays calendar for 2026



Indian stock markets will remain closed for trading on January 15 after both the BSE and NSE revised their calendars in view of municipal corporation elections in Maharashtra, turning what was earlier marked as a settlement holiday into a full-fledged trading holiday.The Bombay Stock Exchange said trading will be suspended across equities, equity derivatives, commodity derivatives and electronic gold receipts on the day. It also clarified that equity derivatives contracts scheduled to expire on January 15 will now mature on January 14, with the revisions reflected in the end-of-day contract master files.The National Stock Exchange has issued a similar revision, declaring January 15 a trading holiday in the capital market as well as the futures and options segments. This replaces an earlier circular issued last week that had indicated markets would reopen for trading despite settlement restrictions.The exchanges cited disruption to banking and clearing operations as the reason for the change. Settlement holidays are typically announced during elections or major public events, and since January 15 is a public holiday in Maharashtra, most banks are expected to remain shut, making normal settlement processes unviable.With January 15 added, Indian stock exchanges will now observe 16 trading holidays in 2026, excluding weekends. January 26 will be the second market holiday this month.In the first half of the year, markets will remain closed on Holi (March 3), Ram Navami (March 26), Mahavir Jayanti (March 31), Good Friday (April 3), Ambedkar Jayanti (April 14), Maharashtra Day (May 1) and Bakri Id (May 28).During the second half, trading will be suspended on Muharram (June 26), Ganesh Chaturthi (September 14), Gandhi Jayanti (October 2), Dussehra (October 20), Diwali Balipratipada (November 10) and Guru Nanak Jayanti (November 24). The final market holiday of the year will be Christmas on December 25.Independence Day on August 15 falls on a weekend, and therefore will not lead to an additional market closure.","Indian stock markets will remain closed for trading on January 15. Both the BSE and NSE revised their calendars in view of municipal corporation elections in Maharashtra. The Bombay Stock Exchange said trading will be suspended across equities, equity derivatives, commodity derivatives and electronic gold receipts on the day.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126525661,imgsize-736062,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Budget 2026: Will tax provisions ease for crypto assets?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-will-tax-provisions-ease-for-crypto-assets/articleshow/126525033.cms,"Losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.

Key concerns flagged:

Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities.

Use of offshore exchanges, private wallets, and decentralised platforms complicates enforcement and obscures transaction trails, hindering accurate tax assessment and recovery.

Jurisdictional limitations add to the challenge, as many transactions occur outside India’s regulatory reach, making compliance and enforcement “virtually impossible.”

A tax framework that bites:

Non-residents and the unresolved ‘situs’ question:

Reporting income from VDAs:

Suggestions for

Budget 2026

:

Allowing set-off of losses between different VDAs, even if not against other income

Providing statutory guidance on the situs of VDAs, especially for non-residents

Reviewing the impact of 1% TDS on market liquidity

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has raised fresh concerns about the risks posed by virtual digital assets (VDAs) such as cryptocurrencies, aligning its stance with that of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The tax department’s warning presented recently to a Parliamentary Standing Committee of Finance underscores regulatory agencies' growing scepticism about cryptocurrencies fit within India’s financial and taxation framework. It highlights revenue risks, enforcement gaps and potential misuse for evasion or illicit finance.The tax regime in India, for VDAs can be considered as one of the most stringent in the world.The Finance Act, 2022, ushered in a bespoke tax regime for VDAs by inserting section 115-BBH into the Income-tax Act, 1961 (I-T Act). Income from the transfer of VDAs is taxed at a flat 30%, plus surcharge and cess, regardless of the holding period. The law allows only the cost of acquisition as a deduction, barring transaction fees, exchange charges or other expenses.More critically, losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.Losses also cannot be carried forward. A parallel provision mandates 1% tax deduction at source (TDS) on transfers beyond specified thresholds, further tightening liquidity. To illustrate: For a salaried individual, a 1% TDS is applicable on transfer of the VDAs if the transaction amount exceeds ­10,000.Various associations have in their pre budget submissions, argued that disallowing set-off of losses between VDAs is economically distortive and ultimately counterproductive for tax revenues.The argument is simple: when losses are ring-fenced, but gains are fully taxed, risk-taking is penalised asymmetrically. This has reportedly contributed to trading volumes migrating offshore, exchanges shifting operations overseas and Indian investors being pushed into cross-border structures that raise FEMA and compliance complexities.The result is a tax structure that treats crypto trading far more harshly than equities, real estate or even speculative assets, despite its growing mainstream adoption.While section 115-BBH of the I-T Act, applies equally to residents and non-residents, tax provisions are not clear on a crucial issue: where is a VDA located? For non-residents, taxability hinges on whether income accrues or arises in India (the provisions of sections 5 and 9 of the I-T Act and the relevant tax treaty provisions come into play).Unlike shares or immovable property, VDAs lack a clearly identifiable physical or legal location. In the absence of legislative clarity on the situs of crypto assets, non-resident taxation risks becoming a fertile ground for disputes particularly where trading occurs on global exchanges, assets are held in offshore wallets and sale proceeds are received outside India.Experts point out that clarity is essential to avoid avoidable litigation. Jurisdictions such as the UK offer guidance by linking the situs of crypto assets to the residential status of the beneficial owner, an approach India could adapt.Individuals dealing in cryptocurrencies are required to disclose income from virtual digital assets in Schedule VDA of their annual income tax returns — typically ITR-2 or ITR-3, depending on their income profile. The schedule seeks granular information, including the date of acquisition and transfer, cost of acquisition and sale consideration. Accurate reporting is crucial, as any under-reporting or misreporting of VDA income can attract penalties, apart from interest on unpaid tax.Possible reforms being discussed in policy circles include:","Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities. Use of offshore exchanges, private wallets, and decentralised platforms complicates enforcement and obscures transaction trails.

"Budget 2026: Industry flags customs litigation, compliance bottlenecks as key pain points",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-industry-flags-customs-litigation-compliance-bottlenecks-as-key-pain-points/articleshow/126537363.cms,"A key industry demand relates to strengthening the Customs Authority for Advance Rulings (CAAR). (AI image)

Mitigate litigation, strengthen Customs Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR):

Extend AEO benefits to newly incorporated group companies:

Facilitation measures for importers and exporters:

Digitalisation of the customs litigation process:

Operationalise Section 11(3) for true single-window compliance:

Summing up:

As the Centre readies the Union Budget 2026-27, industry and tax experts have flagged mounting customs litigation, uneven trade facilitation and gaps in digitalisation as areas needing urgent policy attention. In its pre-Budget memorandum, FICCI has outlined a series of indirect tax proposals aimed at reducing disputes, improving certainty and aligning customs administration with the government’s ease-of-doing-business agenda.Tax professionals echo these concerns, warning that without structural fixes, litigation and compliance friction could blunt India’s manufacturing and export ambitions.A key industry demand relates to strengthening the Customs Authority for Advance Rulings (CAAR), which has emerged as a crucial tool for trade certainty after its revamp in 2018. FICCI has pointed out that CAAR benches currently operate only from Delhi and Mumbai, even as a significant volume of imports and exports flow through southern and eastern ports such as Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata.The industry body has urged the government to establish additional CAAR offices in the south and east, arguing that wider regional access would reduce litigation and compliance costs for businesses operating far from existing benches.FICCI has also sought a mechanism for extending the validity of advance rulings—currently limited to three years—on a self-declaration basis where there is no change in law or facts, to avoid repetitive filings.Tax experts say the scope of advance rulings itself needs to widen. Mahesh Jaising, Partner at Deloitte India, has noted that non-tariff measures often create uncertainty because their language is not aligned with global nomenclature standards. He has recommended empowering CAAR to rule on the applicability of specific non-tariff measures, on a particular importer/ exporter, after seeking the written opinion of the concerned departmental authority, beginning with agencies already integrated into the single-window customs platform. He has also backed expanding the number of CAAR benches to improve speed and predictability.From a dispute-resolution perspective, Smita Singh, Partner (Indirect Tax) at S&A Law Offices, has flagged prolonged customs litigation as a major business risk. She has suggested a one-time settlement scheme under the Customs Act—on the lines of the Sabka Vishwas scheme—to unlock revenue stuck in disputes and reduce legacy litigation.FICCI has also highlighted structural gaps in the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) framework, particularly for newly incorporated entities within established corporate groups. Under current rules, applicants must typically demonstrate a three-year operational and financial track record. This is a criteria that newly formed subsidiaries or restructured entities are unable to meet, even if their parent group is AEO-certified.The industry body has recommended that new companies within AEO-accredited groups be allowed to apply for certification, subject to standard checks. It has also suggested continuity of AEO status in merger situations involving entities that already enjoy AEO Tier-2 status, through a simple intimation rather than a fresh application.According to Deloitte’s Mahesh Jaising, the AEO programme—now approaching its tenth year needs a broader reset. He has argued that delays and inconsistent interpretations have diluted the scheme’s core objective of trade facilitation.Among the suggestions are strict timelines for processing applications, provisional approvals where delays are attributable to the department, and clearer guidance on how past litigation affects eligibility. He has also called for expanding AEO benefits to exporters, including integration with mutual recognition agreements under free trade agreements.On the operational front, FICCI has drawn attention to fragmented communication in customs administration. At present, trade notices are issued independently by different customs commissionerates, forcing businesses to track multiple websites or make physical visits to customs houses.To address this, FICCI has proposed a centralised, real-time digital repository of all trade notices accessible to importers and exporters nationwide. The industry body believes such a database would improve transparency, ensure uniform assessment practices across ports and reduce avoidable procedural friction.Despite broader government pushes under the Digital India programme, customs adjudication and litigation remain heavily paper-driven. Businesses are still required to file physical replies to show cause notices, appeals and supporting documents, all with manual signatures.Mahesh Jaising of Deloitte has argued that this hybrid system undermines efficiency gains from virtual hearings already permitted under customs law. He has recommended enabling provisions in the Customs Act to allow fully digital filing of appeals, submissions and correspondence, broadly aligned with the GST framework, to ease compliance burdens and speed up dispute resolution.Another recurring pain point for trade is the proliferation of non-tariff regulations issued by multiple ministries and regulators, often without a single, harmonised compliance interface. Section 11(3) of the Customs Act, inserted in 2018, was intended to address this by requiring that import-export restrictions under other laws become operational only when notified under the Customs Act.Experts say this provision remains under-utilised. Jaising has recommended issuing a comprehensive notification under Section 11(3) to route all cross-regulatory obligations through a single customs-linked database. Such a move, he argues, would significantly reduce interpretational disputes for both trade and field officers and move India closer to a genuine single-window customs regime.Custom reform must move beyond rate tweaks to focus on litigation management, certainty, and system-level facilitation. With manufacturing, exports and supply-chain resilience central to India’s growth strategy, stakeholders argue that sharper indirect tax reforms could yield outsized gains in competitiveness and investor confidence.","As the Centre readies the Union Budget 2026-27, industry and tax experts have flagged mounting customs litigation, uneven trade facilitation and gaps in digitalisation as areas needing urgent policy attention.

Beginning in 2026, the world faces economic insecurity, record inflation, and a cost-of-living crisis. But for the affluent few, it all appears far less significant than their bank accounts. Today, the total fortune of the world's 14 richest men exceeds $3 trillion in technology, luxury, fashion, AI, and investments. Elon Musk leads the league for the fifth year in a row, with a staggering $717.9 billion wealth that has nearly doubled in the last several years. In contrast, newcomers have joined this league as a result of AI and semiconductor storms, as well as anticipated investments. The symbolic wealth levels of this important few contrast with the growing disparity between the issues of the globe and the super-rich.As of 2026, the world’s wealthiest men continue to amass staggering fortunes despite global economic challenges. According to Forbes, the top 10 richest men, led by Elon Musk, now hold combined wealth exceeding $3 trillion, dominating sectors from technology and AI to luxury, fashion, and global investments, reshaping markets, influencing policy, driving innovation, and redefining modern economic power.Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.The value of Musk's net worth escalated from 2021’s $300 billion to 2026's $717.9 billion because of the phenomenal performance of electric cars, space exploration, and social media reach. Musk's entry and eventual support or endorsement of Donald Trump in politics made news but made no tangible contribution to or subtraction from his net worth. Tesla is leading in global electric cars, while SpaceX is working towards making rocket technology reusable. Musk's projects also cover energy storage, AI, and neural tech, providing him with multiple income streams. Musk's increases in net worth despite controversies, disagreements with authorities, or unpleasant encounters with influential persons in social media like Twitter make him the richest person in planet Earth.Co-founder of Google, Larry Page, has leaped to the second position in the worldwide list. There has been a remarkable increase in his wealth from 133.1 billion to 258.3 billion dollars in one year alone. Though Larry has kept himself away from the limelight, he has been pursuing long-term ventures such as the “moonshot” projects of Alphabet, which comprises self-driving automobiles and AI-based health care. Though he is no longer actively involved with Google, his impact on the company’s planning has ensured an increase in his wealth. He is the epitome of success for innovators who firmly believe that innovations related to the tech infrastructure of data enterprises will result in massive returns.Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who holds 98% ownership of Lāna‘i in Hawaii, has moved up to the third position for 2026. This follows his net worth rising from $199.5 billion. He has also served as a technology advisor for Artificial Intelligence policy and strategy with expertise gleaned from his years at Oracle. He has diversified his portfolio, including involvement with ‘real estate, sailing, and life sciences. Ellison has demonstrated his capacity to engage with entrepreneurship and diversify his reach globally, keeping him relevant as one of the most significant stakeholders among the wealthy across the world.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has slipped to the fourth position, down from $248.1 billion last year. Bezos is a visibly successful person due to his dominance in online e-commerce, cloud computing through AWS, and media ventures like Prime Video. Bezos has had enormous success due to decades of expansion, acquisitions, and reach, but he still invests in space technology through Blue Origin, along with philanthropic work in climate change and healthcare.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, is at number five with a net worth of $238.4 billion. The position is an improvement from last year, when he ranked fifth with a net worth of $155.4 billion. Sergey Brin's net worth has been strengthened by Alphabet’s success in AI, cloud computing technology, and autonomous driving technology. Sergey Brin is still engaged in innovation and is a major beneficiary of Alphabet's long-term initiatives.Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has also minutely slid out from the top five richest people, with a wealth ranking of $223 billion from the previous year’s assessment of $219.9 billion. Mark Zuckerberg keeps pushing the initiatives for the “metaverse,” AI, and social networking. Zuckerberg’s presence in shaping technology policies and trends around the world has not changed, even though there are certain fluctuations.France's luxury leader, Bernard Arnault, has fallen to the sixth spot from the first position in 2024, but the value of his net worth, which is sourced from the success of LVMH as well as brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora, is still a remarkable $192.4 billion, slightly lower from the previous year's $195.1 billion, thus symbolizing the timeless use value of exclusive luxury products.A Taiwanese national, Nvidia's co-founder, Jensen Huang, has experienced tremendous growth because of the AI and silicon revolution. His net worth increased from 128.4 billion to 163.9 billion dollars. Huang's vision to develop chips for the gaming, AI, and data center markets has made him one of the leading tech billionaires globally.The 95-year-old investment guru and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has an estimated net worth of $146.8 billion, a marginal improvement from $143.4 billion. The key to Mr. Buffett’s achievement is his long period of value investing and his knack for investing in businesses during favorable times and diversifying his investment portfolios across various sectors.Amancio Ortega, the Spanish fashion tycoon behind Zara, is still a giant in the industry with an estimated wealth of 145 billion dollars. His success in the fast-fashion industry has been fueled by expansion and supply chain management. Amancio Ortega proves that the success in the affordable fashion industry translates to the accumulation of unimaginable wealth.","Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.

NEW DELHI: Delhi govt has cleared the construction of the South West district mini secretariat in Sector 10 of Dwarka at an estimated Rs 212.91 crore.The secretariat is part of a push to strengthen district-level governance and public service delivery.The proposal was approved by the expenditure finance committee (EFC). The chief minister directed that such mini secretariats should be made in all 13 revenue districts to focus on public interface and citizen-centric service delivery. The revenue department was asked to assess land availability, financial implications and requirements and submit a detailed proposal for completing all 13 buildings in two years.To decentralise administration, the mini secretariats will house most local govt departments, such as MCD zonal offices, under one roof. Chief minister Rekha Gupta said this would end the inconvenience of having to run to multiple offices. It is expected to improve inter-department coordination and make monitoring and review by district officials more efficient.The revenue department has identified the making of mini secretariats as one of 11 critical action areas in its strategy map for 2025–26.""The project is part of a broader administrative reform.... The need for district mini secretariats has grown as the role of district authorities has expanded beyond traditional functions such as land administration,"" an official said.The proposal was placed before the EFC after a presentation by the divisional commissioner recently. The proposed building will have a total covered area of 35,535 sq metres, including 21,737 sq metres of building space and 13,798 sq metres of basement parking.The project is expected to be completed in phases over three financial years — Rs 1 crore in 2025–26, Rs 110.74 crore in 2026–27, and Rs 101.91 crore in 2027–28. While the initial proposal provided a completion timeline of 25 months, officials were directed that the executing agency has to complete the project in 18 months.""The EFC stressed the need to adhere to timelines and warned against cost overruns. It directed that stringent penalty and performance clauses should be built into tender documents and that quality control mechanisms, including third-party inspections, be put in place. A project monitoring committee will be formed to track progress and submit periodic reports to the administrative secretary,"" an official said.Officials said the mini secretariats will be developed as zero-waste facilities, equipped with solar power systems, sewage treatment plants and water or mist sprinklers.

NEW DELHI: A thick layer of fog enveloped the national capital on Thursday morning, reducing visibility across several areas, including Moti Bagh and Dwarka. Foggy conditions also led to delays in a few flights at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert, warning of cold wave conditions at isolated places. Some relief is expected from Friday as cold wave conditions are likely to weaken with the approach of a feeble western disturbance, which may push up night temperatures.IMD has forecast the minimum temperature to hover between 3 and 5 degrees Celsius on Thursday, rising to 6–8 degrees on Friday. By Sunday, the minimum temperature is expected to climb further to between 8 and 10 degrees Celsius.According to IMD norms, a cold wave is declared when the minimum temperature falls below 10 degrees Celsius and is 4.5 degrees or more below normal, or when the actual minimum temperature touches 4 degrees Celsius or lower. “Multiple stations reported cold wave conditions on Wednesday,” an IMD official said.A western disturbance is expected to begin affecting the Himalayan region from January 15, with fresh snowfall likely on January 16.The wind direction is also expected to shift to easterly, bringing more moisture but relatively milder conditions. “A second, more active western disturbance is, meanwhile, expected to bring possible rain across the plains on Jan 22 or 23,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president at Skymet.Daytime temperatures provided some respite on Wednesday, with the maximum temperature recorded at 20 degrees Celsius, close to the seasonal normal. On Tuesday, the maximum had reached 21.6 degrees Celsius.Delhi’s air quality remained at the higher end of the very poor category on Wednesday, with the 24-hour average air quality index recorded at 353, slightly lower than Tuesday’s 360.

America in decline?

Share of the world economy: stability where others have slipped

Productivity and competitiveness: the transatlantic gap

Wealth concentration and capital formation

Billionaire Census 2025

Why others have struggled to keep up

A different kind of imbalance





For more than a decade, the idea of American decline has hardened into a familiar refrain. Polarised politics, institutional strain and a relentless cycle of domestic crises have made it easy to assume that US power is ebbing, particularly when measured against a supposedly rising China and a cohort of wealthy democratic allies. Yet when the economic data are examined alongside comparable figures from the G7 and other advanced economies, the picture looks far less straightforward.The United States remains an outlier among rich nations: not free of problems, but unusually resilient in output, productivity and wealth creation. That resilience becomes most visible when America is viewed not in isolation, but relative to its peers.In 1990, the United States accounted for roughly 26 percent of global gross domestic product. More than three decades later, and after repeated predictions of China’s inevitable overtaking, the US share remains virtually unchanged at about 25.9 percent, assuming Beijing’s own growth figures are accurate. That consistency matters because the global economy is far larger today than it was at the end of the Cold War, with US output alone reaching an estimated $30.62 trillion in 2025.The contrast with America’s closest allies is stark. When the Cold War ended, Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Canada together represented around 32 percent of global GDP.Today, that combined share has fallen to below 14 percent. This relative contraction reflects weaker productivity growth, demographic pressure and prolonged underinvestment, particularly in Europe and Japan.At a more granular level, per-capita comparisons underline the divergence. Using data from the International Monetary Fund , the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Census Bureau, Mississippi, the poorest US state by GDP per capita, now outperforms four G7 countries on the same measure, while West Virginia with the second-lowest per capita GDP surpasses all six non-US G7 members. Since 2020, US GDP per capita has risen by roughly $20,000, a gain no other G7 economy has matched even over much longer periods.Productivity has been a decisive factor in this widening gap. The United States has outpaced the rest of the G7 in productivity growth, both nationally and at state level, driven by technology adoption, capital depth and labour mobility. Europe’s struggle to keep up has been formally acknowledged at the highest levels. Mario Draghi’s 2024 report on European competitiveness , commissioned by the European Commission, warned that Europe is losing ground to the US and China in productivity, innovation and technological scale. Without EU-wide industrial policy, deeper capital-market integration, large-scale joint investment in digital and green technologies, and a break from what Draghi called a “small-state mentality”, he argued the continent faces a “slow agony”: weaker growth, declining industrial capacity, falling global influence and a shrinking ability to fund social and strategic priorities over time.The resilience of the US economy is also reflected in the accumulation of private wealth. According to Altrata’s World Ultra Wealth Report 2025 , the United States now houses 38 percent of the world’s ultra-high-net-worth population, individuals worth more than $30 million, a larger share than the next ten countries combined. In absolute terms, 192,470 Americans control approximately $22.3 trillion in private wealth.Also read: Why America keeps winning the billionaire game The pace of accumulation has accelerated rather than slowed. Altrata reports that the number of ultra-wealthy Americans rose by 21 percent in the past year alone. China, the nearest competitor, holds about $5.9 trillion across 54,020 individuals, a fraction of the US total. Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, France, Italy and India all trail at a considerable distance.This concentration is not confined to inherited fortunes. The United States continues to generate new wealth through entrepreneurship at a scale unmatched elsewhere. Of the world’s five richest individuals, Elon Musk , Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg , Jeff Bezos and Larry Page , all are American and all built fortunes rooted in technology platforms that reshaped entire industries. Their companies function as capital-generating ecosystems, reinforcing US dominance in finance, innovation and market depth.Altrata’sadds another layer. North America’s billionaire population rose by 7.8 percent last year to 1,198 individuals, of whom 1,135 are American. Their combined wealth now exceeds $13 trillion, more than the market capitalisation of Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA combined.By comparison, wealth creation elsewhere has faced structural constraints. China’s ultra-wealth population has continued to grow, but at a slowing pace, as tighter state control and trade restrictions weigh on its technology sector. Europe crossed the symbolic threshold of 1,000 billionaires for the first time, yet its growth remains more cautious and institutional, with less tolerance for the volatility that characterises US capitalism.That volatility, often criticised by regulators abroad, has proved central to American dynamism. The same conditions that unsettle other economies, rapid technological change, market swings, aggressive capital reallocation, have allowed the US to adapt quickly and continue generating new entrants at the top end of the wealth spectrum. In 2024 alone, Altrata found that 10 percent of individuals globally worth between $1 billion and $2 billion dropped below that threshold, yet in the US new billionaires replaced them almost immediately.None of this negates America’s challenges. Income inequality remains the highest in the G7, infrastructure investment has lagged, and healthcare costs remain structurally high. Public finances are under sustained strain: the US closed fiscal year 2025 with a federal deficit of roughly $1.8 trillion, only marginally lower than the previous year, adding to an already elevated debt burden. The economy also relies heavily on buoyant equity markets and continued investment in artificial intelligence, both of which remain vulnerable to shifts in sentiment and capital flows.But measured against its peers, the United States has not drifted into economic marginality. Instead, it has pulled further ahead at a time when many allies have struggled to adapt. Strong allies once amplified American power. Today, the imbalance runs the other way.Predictions of American decline tend to focus inward, drawing conclusions from political dysfunction alone. A comparative view, grounded in output, productivity and wealth, suggests something more complex: a country whose internal problems coexist with an economic position that remains, by global standards, unusually strong.","In 1990, the United States accounted for roughly 26 percent of global gross domestic product.

US freezes immigrant visas for 75 countries: 5 key questions answered for Indians,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-freezes-immigrant-visas-for-75-countries-5-key-questions-answered-for-indians/articleshow/126532220.cms,"1. Is India on the list of affected countries?

US Issues Blunt Warning To Indian Students: Breaking Laws May Cost Visas, Careers And Future Dreams

2. Does the pause affect non-immigrant visas?

3. Why was India excluded while some neighbours are included?

4. Could this policy be expanded to include India later?

5. What should affected applicants do now?





The United States has announced an indefinite suspension of immigrant visa processing for citizens of 75 countries beginning January 21, 2026, in one of the most sweeping visa actions in recent years under the Trump administration.Regarding the freeze, there were questions that confused applicants, especially those from India, who wanted to know their status following the crackdown. India was not mentioned in the list, but here are some clear answers, based on official reports and government statements, to some of the most asked questions.No. India is not included among the 75 countries whose immigrant visa processing will be paused, meaning Indian nationals applying for green cards or other permanent residency categories will not be directly affected by this specific suspension. The list does include many of India's neighbours, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal.No. The suspension applies specifically to immigrant visas (permanent residency). Non-immigrant visa categories such as B1/B2 tourist visas, H-1B work visas and F-1 student visas are not part of this pause, although normal processing delays and visa interview backlogs could still affect applicants.According to US State Department data, India continues to be the largest source country for H-1B approvals and one of the top contributors of international students to US universities along with China.Officials have not publicly explained why some nations are on the list and others are not. However, immigration lawyers and experts do agree with the fact that exclusions may relate to differences in documentation systems, greater compliance with US immigration standards, economic ties, and lower public charge concerns. India’s dominant position in high-skilled visa categories like H-1B and its longstanding cooperation with US consular services are likely factors in its exclusion. Indian-origin people make up a huge amount of high-skilled labours in crucial sectors like tech and defence, and that too for a lower price than the average American working in the same field. This factor has been called out by MAGA experts as unfair and the main reason that Americans are getting ""replaced"" in their own country,There is concern among many applicants that the pause could broaden in the future. Immigration experts note that policy shifts under the same “public charge” or national security rationale could lead to changes in eligibility criteria or an expansion of the country list. While no such move has been announced, applicants are advised to closely monitor updates from the US State Department and American consulates.These concerns come amid growing 'anti-Indian' rhetoric around immigration in the US and other developed countries, which has contributed to stricter rules for foreign nationals. Indian applicants have already faced challenges such as long processing delays, higher government filing fees, and backlogs in employment-based visas like the H-1B. According to official US data, wait times for certain green card categories for Indians already stretch into decades.Those from the 75 countries should be prepared for delays in immigrant visa interviews and approvals. If possible, applicants can consult immigration attorneys for case-specific advice and stay updated through official State Department channels. Applicants from unaffected countries, including India, can continue processing their visas as usual, but should continue to meet all legal requirements so as to not get flagged or falsely noticed by authorities and prepare for potential future policy changes.","The United States has announced an indefinite suspension of immigrant visa processing for citizens of 75 countries beginning January 21, 2026.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has revealed he has no plans to step down from his position at the company anytime soon. He noted that he will remain in charge for now. During a question-and-answer session at CES, 62-year-old Huang said this in response to shareholders' questions about his future at the chipmaker. Huang has led Nvidia since he started the company in 1993. He said he currently has no plans to leave his role, while the company has yet to announce who may replace him in the coming days.Huang attributed his long tenure to his continued interest in the company’s operations and his ability to meet performance expectations.

At CES, Huang announced Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin superchip, which will begin shipping later this year. The company also announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to develop self-driving technology that will compete with Tesla's Autopilot.The Vera Rubin platform, which is named after American astronomer Vera Rubin, who changed how scientists understand galaxy motion, was one of the biggest highlights. It promises to train AI 10 times more efficiently than its previous version, Blackwell. According to Huang, a 10 trillion-parameter model can now be trained in one month using one-quarter of the chips.Huang noted.Huang has been Nvidia's CEO since 1993. He took the company from a stock price of just pennies per share between 1999 and 2016 to more than $187 today, making it the most valuable company in the world.His tenure has been much longer than that of most other tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook (14 years), Meta's Mark Zuckerberg (22 years), and Tesla's Elon Musk (who founded SpaceX in 2002).Born in Taipei in 1963, Huang moved to the US at age nine after his parents sent him to study there.

Microsoft makes 5 promises to everyone in America: We will ensure your electricity bill does not increase and 4 more,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-makes-5-promises-to-everyone-in-america-we-will-ensure-your-electricity-bill-does-not-increase-and-4-more/articleshow/126517590.cms,"Microsoft has stepped up with an ambitious five-step framework aimed at alleviating public unease surrounding AI data centers. The company's commitments include covering electricity expenses in full, ensuring water replenishment, supporting local job creation, honoring property taxes, and facilitating free AI education. These actions are crafted to heal community rifts and safeguard residents against potential spikes in utility bills.

Microsoft will ask utilities to charge it more for electricity

Data centers will replenish more water than they consume

Construction and operations jobs go to local residents first

No asking for property tax breaks from local governments

Free AI training for schools, libraries, and small businesses





Microsoft has unveiled a five-point plan to address growing public anger over AI data centers, promising Americans that its massive infrastructure buildout won't jack up their power bills or drain their water supplies.The announcement came Tuesday after the US President Donald Trump called out the tech giant on Truth Social, saying Microsoft would be ""first up"" among Big Tech companies to commit to keeping utility costs down for everyday households. ""I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,"" Trump wrote Monday night.Microsoft President Brad Smith acknowledged the backlash head-on. ""When I visit communities around the country, people have questions—pointed questions,"" Smith said at an event in Great Falls, Virginia. ""We are at a moment of time when we need to listen.""The company's first commitment is perhaps its boldest. Microsoft says it will work with utility companies and state commissions to set electricity rates high enough to cover the full cost of powering its data centers. The goal is to prevent those costs from trickling down to residential customers who never asked for an AI revolution in their backyard.Water usage has been a flashpoint for data center opponents.Microsoft is promising to return more water to local communities than its facilities withdraw. In Phoenix, for instance, the company has partnered with municipalities to find and fix leaks in aging pipe systems.Microsoft is teaming up with North America's Building Trades Unions to train workers in regions where data centers are being built. The company also plans to expand its Datacenter Academy program through local community colleges for ongoing operations roles.Most big corporations haggle for tax breaks when they roll into town. Microsoft says it won't. The company is committing to pay full property taxes wherever it builds. In Quincy, Washington — a small agricultural community where Microsoft opened its first data center back in 2008 — county tax revenues have jumped from $60 million to over $180 million. That money helped the town open a new 54,000-square-foot medical center last year while rural hospitals elsewhere were shutting down.Microsoft is pledging to partner with K-12 schools, community colleges, and local libraries to provide AI literacy training. Small businesses will also get access to AI tools and workforce development resources.The promises come after Microsoft scrapped a data center project in Caledonia, Wisconsin last October following intense community opposition. Hundreds of residents in Michigan also turned out Monday night to protest another proposed Microsoft facility.","Microsoft has unveiled a five-point plan to address growing public anger over AI data centers.

Authorities allege OnePlus operated a clandestine recruitment scheme through an unapproved Hong Kong shell company, violating laws governing mainland Chinese business operations in Taiwan.

OnePlus required Taiwan's approval to hire local workers, which it didn't

Taiwan cracking down hard on Chinese firms eyeing its chip talent





Taiwanese prosecutors want to arrest Pete Lau. The OnePlus CEO allegedly ran an illegal hiring operation that quietly scooped up more than 70 engineers from the island over the past decade. The Shilin District Prosecutors Office dropped the warrant, charging Lau under Taiwan's Cross-Strait Act. This law governs how businesses from mainland China can operate in Taiwan. Two Taiwanese nationals who reportedly helped Lau have also been indicted, according to Bloomberg.Here's what prosecutors say happened. OnePlus allegedly created a shell company in Hong Kong with a completely different name. Then in 2015, it opened a branch in Taiwan without bothering to get government approval. The team there worked on smartphone software, running tests and verification for OnePlus devices.That's the catch. Under the Cross-Strait Act, any mainland Chinese company needs explicit permission from Taiwanese authorities to recruit local talent. Prosecutors claim OnePlus skipped this step entirely while quietly building its engineering bench.Lau isn't some obscure executive either. He co-founded OnePlus and turned it into a brand that smartphone enthusiasts actually care about.These days, he also runs the product division at Oppo, which made OnePlus an independent sub-brand back in 2021.This warrant fits into a bigger pattern. Taiwan has been aggressively going after what it sees as talent poaching by Chinese tech companies. The island's semiconductor engineers are basically a national treasure at this point.Last August, authorities opened investigations into 16 Chinese companies for allegedly targeting high-tech workers. And in 2025, prosecutors issued a similar warrant for Grace Wang, the chair of Apple supplier Luxshare Precision Industry.OnePlus says business continues as usual despite the probe.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ However, he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

Facebook parent company Meta has begun restructuring of its Reality Labs division, initiating job cuts that are expected to impact more than 1,000 employees, a report has said. According to Bloomberg, affected employees were notified starting Tuesday morning (January 13 US time) following an internal memo from Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Andrew Bosworth.The report claims that in the post, Bosworth called the cuts as a necessary step to create a “more sustainable” business model for the division. It also signals a strategic backstep from the company’s focus on the “metaverse” in favour of opportunities in Artificial Intelligence (AI) wearables and mobile integration.“With the larger potential user base and the fastest growth rate today, we are shifting teams and resources almost exclusively to mobile to continue to accelerate adoption there,” Bosworth wrote, according to Bloomberg report.Reality Labs has been the primary focus for Meta’s virtual and augmented reality ambitions but the unit has bled billions since its inception. The division reportedly employs roughly 15,000 workers. While the company has not officially confirmed the total number of departures, the report suggest the reduction will hit approximately 10% of the division's workforce.A Meta spokesperson confirmed the shift in strategy, noting that the company had previously signaled a shift from purely virtual environments toward wearable technology, like Ray-Ban Meta Glasses.“We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from metaverse toward wearables. This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year,” the spokesperson told Bloomberg.Meanwhile, a separate report claims that Meta and EssilorLuxottica are considering doubling the production capacity of smart glasses to 20 million units annually by the end of this year.
