India to raise delay in S-400 missile systems & spares during Rajnath's visit to Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-raise-delay-in-s-400-missile-systems-spares-during-rajnaths-visit-to-russia/articleshow/116062183.cms,"INS Tushil

NEW DELHI: India is expected to raise the major delay in delivery of the two remaining squadrons of S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems as well as supply of spares for several crucial weapon platforms during defence minister Rajnath Singh’s three-day visit to Russia next week, which will also see him commission the first of the two guided-missile stealth frigates being built there.Measures to strengthen the already expansive defence collaboration will be discussed during the India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) meeting, which will be co-chaired by Singh and his counterpart Andrey Belousov in Moscow on December 10.The two sides will review ongoing military-technical projects as well as collaboration in areas of strategic interest in the run-up to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India in early-2025 after a gap of three years.With the IRIGC-M&MTC also not having met after 2021, India wants to press Russia to ensure proper maintenance support and timely supply of spares for weapon systems ranging from S-400 missile systems to Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets and T-90S main-battle tanks.“Supply of spares has become a major problem for the Indian armed forces with the entire Russian defence industry diverted for the ongoing war with Ukraine,” a source told TOI.India has its own strategic imperatives in striking a balance between Russia and the US, despite a pronounced tilt towards Washington in recent years. The tightening Moscow-Beijing clinch, for one, remains a major concern for New Delhi.Though India has cranked up indigenous defence production, while increasingly turning to western countries for military hardware and software over the last decade, Russia still remains its main weapons supplier, accounting for over 36% of its arms imports.Singh will travel to Kaliningrad first on December 9 to commission India’s latest 3,900-tonne multi-role frigate as INS Tushil (the protector shield), which is packed with sensors and weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles. The second frigate, in turn, will be commissioned as INS Tamal early next year.TOI had last month reported that the delivery of two S-400 squadrons is likely to be delayed till 2026 and the lease of a nuclear-powered attack submarine (called SSN) till 2028 due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine.Under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in 2018, IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, missiles and drones at a range of 380-km, in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan. The over $3 billion (Rs 21,000 crore) deal to lease the SSN for 10 years, in turn, was inked in 2019.The 125-metre long INS Tushil has undergone extensive trials, during which the warship clocked a speed of over 30 knots. “The frigate will reach India in a near combat-ready condition ready to deliver from the word go,” an officer said.India in October 2018 had inked the umbrella agreement with Russia for four upgraded Krivak-III class frigates, with the first two to be imported from Russia for around Rs 8,000 crore.The other two are being built at Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore, with the first being “launched” as Triput in July this year. These four warships will add to the six such Russian frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted in the Navy from 2003-2004 onwards.",India is expected to raise the major delay in delivery of two remaining squadrons of S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems during defence minister Rajnath Singh’s three-day visit to Russia next week.

Ayodhya verdict did not uphold secularism: Ex- SC judge RF Nariman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ayodhya-verdict-did-not-uphold-secularism-ex-sc-judge-rf-nariman/articleshow/116061807.cms,"EX-SC judge RF Nariman (File photo from SC website)

NEW DELHI: Former Supreme Court judge and noted jurist Justice R F Nariman has expressed disappointment over the top court’s verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case and said it did not do justice to the principle of secularism. He also said the Places of Worship Act , which was upheld in the 2019 Ayodhya verdict , should be strictly enforced to scotch disputes over religious places which are “popping up every day” across the country and causing communal tension.Delivering the inaugural lecture of Ahmadi Foundation established in the memory of former CJI A M Ahmadi, Justice Nariman pointed out how a special CBI judge, Surendra Yadav, who acquitted all accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, got a post-retirement job as depu ty Lokayukta in Uttar Pradesh. “This is the state of affairs in this country,” he said while speaking on ‘Secularism and Indian Constitution ’.“In my humble opinion, a great travesty of justice was that secularism was not given its due by these judgments,” he said while referring to various orders passed by the apex court relating to the decades-old dispute on which final verdict was passed on Nov 9, 2019, by a five-judge bench. He disagreed with the reasoning given by the court to grant the disputed land for Ram Mandir despite holding that demolition of the mosque was illegal.Referring to the 2019 verdict, Justice Nariman said there was a silver lining in it as it upheld the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which was dealt with in five pages of the order. Expressing anguish over the multiple suits being filed across the country raising disputes over religious structures, he said the 1991 law should be enforced and it should be read in every trial court where suits are filed to claim religious places of other communities.“Today, we find hydra heads popping up all over the country. Suit after suit is being filed all over the place concerning not only mosques but also against dargahs. All this, according to me, could lead to communal tension and disharmony, and is contrary to what is envisaged in the Constitution and the Places of Worship Act. The only way to scorch and cauterise all these hydra heads is by applying these five pages in this very judgment and having it read out in every district court and high court. Because these five pages are a declaration by the Supreme Court which binds each of them,” he said.",Ex-SC judge RF Nariman expressed disappointment over the top court’s verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case. He said it did not do justice to the principle of secularism. He also said the Places of Worship Act should be strictly enforced.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116061805,imgsize-432883,width-400,resizemode-4/116061805.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India on Friday asked Pakistan to take strong action against wanted terrorist Masood Azhar , who is also the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief infamous for plotting and promoting terrorist activities on behalf of Pakistan's intelligence wing Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Masood Azhar, a long-time terrorist proxy of the Pakistan military and orchestrator of the 2019 Pulwama attack , was designated a "" global terrorist "" by the United Nations in the same year.New Delhi has consistently maintained Azhar's presence in Pakistan, which Islamabad has always disputed, however, the JeM chief's recent speech in a public gathering reportedly at Bahawalpur in Pakistan's Punjab province has again laid bare ISI's backing to Azhar.Responding to reports on Azhar's speech, ministry of external affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Friday said, ""If the report is correct, then it has exposed Pakistan's 'duplicity' in containing terrorist activities.""""We demand that strong action be taken against him (Azhar) and he should be brought to justice. There has been denial that he is not there in Pakistan,"" Jaiswal said.Azhar, who Pakistan claims is in hiding in Afghanistan, is also among India’s most wanted and has – in the recent past – hit India hard.In December 2001, members of his terrorist group, Jaish-e-Mohammed (literally, army of the Prophet) – JeM – attacked the Indian Parliament. After the audacious attack, the then-Atal Bihari Vajpayee government amassed an army at the border in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation that lasted several months.In February 2019, the Narendra Modi government redrew its security response and conducted air strikes into Pakistani territory in Balakot. The response was an answer to Jaish’s suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama that killed 40 soldiers.Azhar was born to a poultry farmer in Bahawalpur. He studied at the Jamia Islamia at the Binori mosque in Karachi. There, he met students who were under the influence of leaders of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM), a terrorist organisation active in Afghanistan and Kashmir. Deeply influenced by the HuM, Azhar was 21, when he crossed over into Afghanistan to train as a terrorist.","Masood Azhar is a long-time terrorist proxy of the Pakistan military and orchestrator of the 2019 Pulwama attack.

"Embrace the yins, not just the yangs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/embrace-the-yins-not-just-the-yangs/articleshow/116045322.cms,"Thirukkural

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Paradise Lost

An age of recklessness is always countered by one of stringent discipline in history . This duality is echoed in the Sangam literature , where Purananuru — a collection of valorous poems — sheds light on the violent conflicts of kings. These rulers ruthlessly vanquished their enemies and waged wars against fellow Tamil kings. Conversely, the tender verses of Akananuru offer delicate expressions of love, so subtle that one might easily overlook the profundity.Many poets contributed to both genres, illustrating the perennial duality of human nature which transcends cultures. Japanese artists employ Suminagashi, or 'ink floating,' to create ethereal works in colours that appear to shimmer with light. The subtlety and tenderness employed is reflective of Japanese character, but the country’s history reveals that cruelty was also a part of the psyche -- the atrocities committed by the Imperial Army were unspeakable during World War II.In Milton’s, a beautiful exchange occurs between God and Adam. As Adam revels in the beauty of light in his new universe, God urges him to welcome the darkness of night as well. Initially, Adam hides, but as the evening unfolds, night flowers bloom, the stars and the moon emerge, and the tender evening breeze envelops him. Grateful, Adam thanks God for the beauty of the night.Life teaches us to recognise duality. To deny either the positive or the negative is to forsake half of existence. Focusing solely on the positive blinds us to life's complexities; fixating on the negative obscures fleeting moments of beauty.Every time I visit the Murugan temple at Palani, the ‘kavadi’ or balance carried by devotees as they climb the hill fascinates me. Whenever I go through difficult times, I picture myself walking a path with two pots balanced on my shoulders. One is a pot of gratitude, relief and positive emotions. In the other, I carry all the grief, anger and negative emotions. I tell myself that in order to keep walking, I have to carry both for balance.Likewise, we have to acknowledge the competing forces within us. We are fierce yet compassionate, driven yet weary, forgiving yet tempted towards vengeance. This internal conflict is perfectly normal. As leading scientists affirm, even the matter in our universe exists in a state of duality — wave and particle.Valluvar , too, contemplated this duality of existence ultimately declaring that the wise hold the perfect balance. They know that pain and pleasure can only co-exist. Hence, they do not seek pleasure and are not affected by pain.Inbaththul Inbam Vizhayaadhaan ThunbaththulThunbam Urudhal Ilan“He who never exulted in joy , will not beDepressed by sorrow”Understanding and embracing this duality allows us to navigate the complexities of our ever-evolving lives. By recognising that joy and sorrow coexist, we glean invaluable insights into our shared human experience. The duality emerges from the very fabric of life itself—a dance of opposites, interwoven with yin and yang. Without balance, yang devolves into aggression, while yin can lead to complacency. Great masters remind us to embrace both sides — two faces of the same coin. Darkness enhances our appreciation of light.Through the lens of duality, we uncover the richness of existence, wherein light dances with darkness, crafting a harmonious narrative that defines our journey.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/47529300.jpg"

HYDERABAD: Legal and behavioural experts have raised red flags over a purported ""bonding"" session under surveillance between around 15 ""rescued"" children and couples accused of paying child traffickers in Delhi and Pune Rs 5-8 lakh each to facilitate their adoption. Based on the interaction, these couples could be allowed to take home the kids they were separated from six months ago.The children, who are between seven months and four years old, have been in state-run shelters since a crackdown on the racket led police to their adoptive parents' doorsteps in Hyderabad.Medchal-Malkajgiri child welfare committee (CWC) decided to organise the bonding session after Telangana high court gave it the responsibility of deciding the 15 kids' future. ""The children and the couples will be put in a room. If we see an emotional connection, we will send them home together,"" said the committee's chairperson, A M Raja Reddy.The exercise is scheduled for the weekend in a govt office at Alwal, a Hyderabad suburb.""The decision is based on humanitarian grounds. These children have already stayed with the adoptive families, a few for as long as three years. But we need to evaluate the parents' behaviour before taking a call.""According to lawyers, the move is fraught with legal risks given the fact that the police investigation revealed money changing hands between traffickers and the adoptive parents.""We understand the need for these children to grow up in a family environment, but are we setting the right precedent by rewarding those who were on the wrong side of law in the first place? This could be misused in the future,"" said a district magistrate.Akshay Mehra of the Commission for Child Protection and Rights said the legal complexities were hard to ignore.""To a layperson, this (letting the kids reunite with those who illegally adopted them) might seem like the best solution. CWC's role is to ensure what's good for the children, but courts need to step in to address the broader legal implications and set clear guidelines for future cases,"" he said.""Will they treat future cases of child trafficking in a similar manner?""CWC officials said the adoptive parents were being charged only for failing to adhere to adoption procedures, not for trafficking.When TOI reached out to some of the couples, they claimed to have acted in accordance with the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA).""These children were handed to us by their biological parents because they couldn't care for them. We followed all legal formalities under HAMA. My daughter is four years old, and we have raised her as our own. The last six months without her have been unbearable,"" one of the adoptive parents said.They jointly filed a petition in the high court recently, seeking custody of the kids that were separated from them.Behavioural expert Shazia Gilani said determining the bond between parents and children in such cases could be challenging.""Attachment in children is formed through consistent caregiving, comfort, and security. However, this bond can be influenced by various factors, such as the length of separation, changes in their environment, and the emotional state of both the child and caregiver,"" she said.""Children might also show some confusion or distress when reunited with parents they haven't seen in months. These nuances make it difficult to assess the true nature of the bond, based on a brief interaction. Ideally, such evaluations should be done over a longer period in a supportive and controlled environment.""","Couples accused of paying child traffickers in Delhi and Pune Rs 5-8 lakh each to facilitate their adoption.

He was questioned by ED all night and was shown as arrested at 4am,"" court said in its order.Appearing for Tuteja, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi said SC had previously quashed the prosecution complaint filed by ED in ECIR on April 8. He said ED, three days later, registered a new ECIR based on the same set of facts and material and told the court that Tuteja's arrest was illegal as there was no need or necessity to take him into custody.Additional solicitor general S V Raju, appearing for the agency, agreed that the officers went overboard in the case and told the court that remedial measures had been taken to ensure that such incidents were not repeated and the agency had issued an internal circular to its officers. As per the circular, statements of accused and witnesses are to be recorded during office hours, while late-night interrogations are to be avoided, except in exceptional circumstances.On the previous hearing, the bench had raised concern over the way PMLA was being implemented and made it clear that high-handedness in action against accused in violation of fundamental rights will not be allowed.","Supreme Court calls conduct of investigators in Chhattisgarh liquor scam ""terrible"" Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih said improper conduct would not be grounds to quash the arrest.

""In fact, in 2017, it was the first year of Trump administration when Quad started at a vice minister's level. Then in 2019, it was again under Trump administration that it moved from vice minister's level to foreign minister's level,"" he said.""In 2020, when there was almost a global lockdown, one of the few physical diplomatic meetings which took place in 2020 was actually a Quad meeting in Tokyo.

The special representatives on boundary question, Ajit Doval and Wang Yi, are expected to meet later this month.""Our entire relationship with China was predicated on the fact that border areas would remain peaceful and stable and we had agreements to ensure that. In 2020, the Chinese chose to bring a lot of forces to the border areas and obviously, we responded with counter-deployments,"" the minister said, adding, ""We still have challenges left with us.

In the Old Tesen village of Nagaland, unlike any village the evenings are not for relaxing. For the residents, the time is mostly utilised to check their farm produce, restock their inventory and refresh their phones to check for the next online orders for their world-famous Naga King Chillies . A village once disconnected from the outer world and unknown to outstation markets, is now selling their chillies to 250+ international and national buyers digitally.This tale of transformation is not only restricted to the Old Tesen village but is palpable in every corner of the North-Eastern region of India. For a region which was once languished in obscurity and crippled by the inability of previous regimes is today becoming a key enabler for the new Viksit Bharat vision . At its core is a comprehensive development and social unity approach, headed by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi who has challenged the status quo and taken the uncharted route to make the North-East the 'Growth Engine of India'.He addressed the challenges of the region on two crucial fronts - one, maximize investment and implement high-impact capital projects, thus ensuring economic proliferation; second, through building the cultural power of the region. The 'Look East' Policy was modified to 'Act East' and is now changed to 'Act East, Act Fast and Act First'. As a matter of fact, in 2014-15, the budgetary allocation by the Centre to the region was Rs 27,359 crore, which has now increased by more than 275% to Rs 1,02,749 crore. Number of airports has nearly doubled in the region from 9 to 17; the region has 16,125 kilometers of National Highways today, 147% more than what it had before 2014. This growth is being supported by digital connectivity - ensuring that 4G connectivity reaches 4,525 villages of NE and about 5,600 villages are being covered under the Digital Bharat Nidhi with a budget of Rs 3,715 crore. This surge in connectivity creates a web on the map of the region, ensuring that the map not only represents cities but also underserved and unserved regions, boost local economies and corroborates North-East as a window to the South East Asian region. Northeast's unique culture and art is also taking the global stage. Recently, Assamese was recognised as a classical language, Moidams - The Mound-Burial System of Ahom Dynasty got inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List, the 2024 Padma Awards was illuminated with Northeast's cultural brilliance with a record 11 trailblazers getting awarded.The Ministry of Development of the North Eastern Region is similarly driven by the idea of ""unity in diversity"" and through a 'whole of government' approach, we have successfully obtained the prestigious Oeko-Tex certification for its Eri Silk, directly from Germany. The platform North East Region Agri Commodity E-Connect (NERACE) which has empowered the residents of the Old Tesen village is now available to every farmer of the region; out of the 3579 sanctioned projects we have completed 2438 - a success rate of more than 68%.It is with this resolve that we are delighted to host the maiden edition of Ashtalakshmi Mahotsav in Delhi - a celebration of North-east's vibrant textile sector, tourism opportunities, and traditional craftsmanship. This three-day festival embraces cultural diversity and heritage with 8 State Pavilions, a North East Haat that will house 320 stalls and give a platform to more than 500 artisans to showcase their talent. PM Modi believes that the dawn of development will rise from the East, from Eastern India and this festival aims to power his belief. As we begin the festival in the esteem presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Bharat Mandapam, I urge all of you to come and be part of this celebration. As North East rises to become the biggest reservoirs of India's growth, let's traverse it with optimism and determination to build a Viksit Uttar Purv.To register: https://www.ashtalakshmimahotsav.com/","Jyotiraditya Scindia is Union minister for communications, development of Northeastern region.

NEW DELHI: Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. He urged Muhammad Yunus , the head of Bangladesh 's interim government, to take immediate action against these injustices.In a letter, Bukhari stressed the close ties between India and Bangladesh. “Since the establishment of Bangladesh, our national leadership, media, civil society, and influential circles have maintained close relations with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajid, and their party, the Awami League. In diplomacy, regional matters, international affairs, and issues concerning the Muslim world, Bangladesh has always stood by us as a close ally,” he said, according to an ANI report.Bukhari expressed concern over the unrest following Sheikh Hasina's departure to India, which has affected both Muslim and non-Muslim supporters of the Awami League. He specifically condemned the violence targeting the Hindu minority.“Until now, this remained an internal matter of Bangladesh. However, the ongoing injustices, assaults, and unilateral actions against the Hindu minority are condemnable and must stop immediately. There is no justification for such actions. The government must always acknowledge the role we have played in their establishment and development process, as well as our unparalleled history of supporting and caring for millions of refugees. We were the first to stand by them during every natural disaster,” he wrote.Bukhari also referred to the UN's declaration on minority rights, calling on Yunus to intervene. “As a credible neighbour, a close ally of Bangladesh, and a custodian of shared cultural heritage, I expect the current head of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate, to take immediate steps to address the injustices against the Hindu minority. He should ensure that his international reputation remains untarnished. As a Muslim-majority country, Islam and Islamic jurisprudence inherently leave no room for any form of prejudice or injustice against minorities in Bangladesh,” Bukhari added.Over the weekend, more than 60 monks were reportedly stopped from entering India at the Benapole land port in Bangladesh, according to an ANI report citing an ISKCON Kolkata spokesperson. Additionally, a Bangladesh court has set January 2, 2025, as the hearing date for Hindu spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das , who was arrested on sedition charges. Das is currently in custody in Bangladesh.","Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. He urged Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh's interim government, to take immediate action against these injustices.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115942823,imgsize-688125,width-400,resizemode-4/115942823.jpg"

Deshaun Watson will not face any suspension or fine from the NFL

The NFL has finished investigating sexual assault allegations against Deshaun Watson , the quarterback for the Cleveland Browns , and said that it did not suffice with evidence that it violated any part of the personal conduct policy. Watson is accused in a new lawsuit, filed after the season opener, of having committed sexual assault and battery. The attorneys for both parties confirmed that the case was resolved in October, and a confidential settlement was announced by attorney Tony Buzbee.Deshaun Watson, the Cleveland Browns quarterback, will not face any suspension or fine from the NFL for a sexual assault accusation made against him in September. ""The matter is closed,"" an NFL spokesperson told Cleveland.com's Mary Kay Cabot on Friday. ""There was insufficient evidence to support a finding of a violation of the personal conduct policy.”The lawsuit was filed in Harris County , Texas, in which claims were made, that is, Watson and Jane Doe, whom he is said to have sexually misbehaved with in October 2020 earlier, just prior to the converged dinner at Watson's apartment. Watson denied the allegations in a statement by his lawyer Rusty Hardin. The NFL has assessed the complaint under its personal conduct policy, but did not place Watson on the commissioner exempt list because of the absence of formal charges and the review just started.Watson was suspended for a period of 11 games in 2022 after more than two dozen women alleged that he had sexually assaulted and acted inappropriately during massage therapy sessions. Following a settlement with the NFL and the Players Association, Watson was fined $5 million and required to undergo an examination by behavior specialists before being reinstated by the league. Watson settled most of the lawsuits against him, claiming 23 out of the 24 he faced during the summer of 2022.The lawsuit, which was instituted in September, is in no way connected to the two live lawsuits, one of which was instituted in the summer of 2022 and the other one initiated in October 2022, by women who have accused Watson of a sexual offense during massage sessions. Watson began seven games this season before suffering a right Achilles tendon tear in Week 7 that would sideline him for the remainder of the season. He has recorded the lowest total QBR in the entire league.Also Read: The NFL has revealed 32 nominees for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award 2024 Having traded three first-round picks to Houston for Watson and backed up their trade with a backfired $230 million contract, the Browns will still have to pay Watson $46 million in each of the following two seasons. So far, in a span of three seasons, Watson has only played 19 games owing to suspension and injuries. But even with all these, part of the huge implications of their contract with him and his salary are heavy chains for the Browns as they're looking to improve their team.","Deshaun Watson will not face any suspension or fine from the NFL for a sexual assault accusation made against him in September.

How Taylor Swift’s Spotify Dominance Reflects Her Influence On Travis Kelce and The NFL,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/how-taylor-swifts-spotify-dominance-reflects-her-influence-on-travis-kelce-and-the-nfl/articleshow/116013775.cms,"Image via Fox News

Tayvoodoo In Action? What Taylor Swift’s New Spotify Win Could Mean For Travis Kelce and the NFL



Spotify 2024 Wrapped - Taylor Swift Global Top Artist of the Year

The Spotify Wrapped 2024 is here, and is it any wonder that Taylor Swift has ranked as the No. 1 most-streamed artist globally in 2024 on Spotify, for the second year in a row? With over 26.6 billion streams, Swift’s latest album, The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology, also became the most-streamed album worldwide. The album broke some major records with over 300 million streams on its first day and 1 billion in its first week!“That’s right, it’s Taylor Swift!” Sulinna Ong, Spotify’s Global Head of Editorial, announced in a virtual press briefing. “With more than 26.6 billion streams globally this year, Taylor is our Global Top Artist for the second year in a row.”There’s no doubt that 2024 has been a milestone year for Taylor; besides the record-breaking sales of her music, her Eras Tour also became the highest-grossing concert tour of all time, as per a Pollstar data. The data also says that the tour is the first ever to gross $1 billion. On the personal front too, 2024 has been kind to Taylor as she has managed to cement her romance with Kansas City Chief’s Travis Kelce.In fact, just a day after Thanksgiving, Taylor, donning an ""87"" necklace in honor of Travis' number, joined Travis's mom Donna Kelce at the Kansas City Chiefs' game against the Las Vegas Raiders on November 29. Taylor’s dad Scott Swift also joined the happy gathering. It’s safe to say things are moving fast for the Swift-Kelce romance and fans have come up with several theories on Taylor’s influence on Travis Kelce and NFL.Fans have coined the term ‘Tayvoodoo’ to describe the Grammy winner’s influence on Travis’s games. Travis and Jason Kelce referred to the phenomenon on December 4, during the episode of their “New Heights” podcast. “Rookie of the Year, there’s so many good ones. Angels in the Outfield. I’d love to f—-ing feel what it’s like,” Travis referred to the 1994 film, which follows an underdog basketball team.Jason said, “I feel like you guys [the Kansas City Chiefs] are the Angels in the Outfield. There’s some unknown like …”“Here you go with this f–ing Tayvoodoo s–t again,” Travis said. “This dude is such a d–khead.” The tight end has had a slow season this year; Kelce has only managed 569 yards through 11 games, and his touchdown count is stuck at just two, which is unusual for someone like Kelce who is known for his consistency. However, Taylor’s influence has introduced millions of fans to the world of the NFL, which has also helped Travis’s profile, despite an underwhelming year. The Chiefs vs. Jets game featuring Taylor in the stands hit 27 million viewers—the highest number of non-Super Bowl Sunday viewers.It’s important to remember that the NFL is a league that thrives on ratings, advertisements and commercial popularity. Whether Taylor’s cheering for him in the stands or the couple is spotted her shows, Taylor’s star power has definitely helped the NFL player and his league. Earlier this year, he signed a two-year extension worth $34 million. His jersey sales reportedly spiked by 400% after the couple started dating. The league clearly approves of Taylor’s influence on Travis’ popularity, which doesn’t just draw in more crowd but also translates to commercial gains for the league.The NFL enjoyed a record-breaking holiday period, the Chiefs-Raiders Thanksgiving showdown saw a significant jump in viewership compared to last year's Miami Dolphins-New York Jets game. As per some reports, the ‘Swift bump’ has led to a 20 per cent increase in sponsorships for the NFL and viewership has increased by 53 per cent among teenage female viewers.Now that Taylor is Spotify’s most streamed artist, chances are influence will also translate into enhanced global popularity for the NFL. By catering to the Swifties, the NFL is tapping into a new market, exploring avenues for growth through pop culture intersections. Collaborations or promotions that include Taylor’s music could create unique experiences for fans.Following Taylor’s Spotify win, ror the first time, Spotify is adding a Wrapped badge to Taylor Swift’s Spotify profile. Moreover, Spotify is launching an Easter egg experience for Swifties as listeners can now see custom mini-animations tailored to the eras of Taylor’s discography on the app’s play button, while listening to her songs. Moreover, following a new partnership with Snapchat, Swifties can now go for 2024 Wrapped bracelets featuring a Global Top Artist Badge charm through an AR lens in the Snapchat app.Also read: What Taylor Swift’s Spotify Wrapped 2024 Win Means for the NFL and Travis Kelce","Taylor Swift has ranked as the No. 1 most-streamed artist globally in 2024 on Spotify, for the second year in a row.

Elon Musk has sued OpenAI and its close ally Microsoft

Why Sam Altman says he is not worried

""I don’t think Elon would do it,"" Altman said, emphasizing that the public would not tolerate any misuse of political power for business gain.

ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed confidence that Tesla CEO Elon Musk would not use his influence with President-elect Donald Trump to undermine business rivals, calling such actions ""profoundly un-American."" Speaking at the New York Times DealBook conference, on November 4, Altman addressed concerns surrounding Musk's new role as head of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in Trump administration. There are worries in some quarters that Musk might leverage the position to benefit his own companies.Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been quite open about his 'dislike' for OpenAI CEO Altman.He added that, despite Musk’s polarizing persona, using political power for personal gain would go against values Musk holds dear.Altman said.Musk, who co-founded OpenAI before departing from the organization, is currently suing OpenAI and Microsoft. Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI accuses the organization of abandoning its founding commitment to serve the public good. He has also sought a federal court order to block OpenAI's transition to a more profit-driven model.Musk claims that they have strayed from the nonprofit mission originally envisioned for the company. Musk has also launched xAI, which, according to the Wall Street Journal, is now valued at $50 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable startups.Altman called the ongoing legal dispute with Musk ""tremendously sad,"" reflecting on a time when he viewed Musk as a ""mega hero.""Musk, who has become a close ally of Trump, was heavily involved in the 2016 presidential campaign, spending over $100 million to support Trump's bid and attending rallies. He has remained a prominent figure in the Trump administration’s transition, reportedly even joining a call when Google CEO Sundar Pichai congratulated Trump on his election victory.Musk's businesses, including SpaceX and Tesla, maintain significant ties with both U.S. and foreign governments. His potential new role has sparked concerns about conflicts of interest. Despite these concerns, Altman expressed that he isn't overly worried about Musk's influence within the incoming administration.",Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been quite open about his 'dislike' for OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

TikTok ban looms in US: What it means for users and creators,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tiktok-ban-looms-in-us-what-it-means-for-users-and-creators/articleshow/116062083.cms,"What the ruling argues

What TikTok said in statement

's commitment

What happens next in the case

Is TikTok up for sale

What it means if TikTok were banned

Tik Tok's US operations faced uncertainty after a federal appeals court dismissed a legal challenge to legislation requiring the social media platform to separate from its Chinese parent company or face a ban by mid-January, on Friday.The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's three-judge panel unanimously upheld the law's constitutional validity, dismissing claims from both companies that the statute infringed upon their rights and those of US-based TikTok users.The government has called for ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its stakes in the platform.If ByteDance fails to comply and TikTok is banned, it could have a profound impact on content creators who rely on the app for their livelihood and users who turn to it for entertainment and social connection.TikTok and ByteDance, the plaintiffs in the case, argued that the law violated the First Amendment and constituted an unconstitutional bill of attainder by unfairly targeting the two companies.The Justice Department remarked that TikTok presents national security risks due to its Chinese connections, suggesting Chinese authorities could demand ByteDance share US user data or manipulate platform content.However, no public evidence of such occurrences has been presented.Judge Douglas Ginsburg authored the appeals court decision, stating that the law was ""carefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary"".The court dismissed claims that the law constituted an unlawful bill of attainder or violated the Fifth Amendment's protections against property seizure.Ginsburg ruled that the law did not infringe on the First Amendment, as it does not aim to ""suppress content or mandate a specific mix of content"" on TikTok.""Content on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,"" Ginsburg said.""The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,"" TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement.""Unfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,"" Hughes continued, according to The Associated Press.The statute ""will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025,"" he added.President-elect Donald Trump 's position adds complexity, having shifted from his previous stance of banning TikTok to now opposing such measures.Whilst his transition team hasn't detailed specific plans, spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt confirmed Trump's commitment to ""save TikTok"".After Trump assumes office on January 20, his Justice Department would be responsible for enforcing the law and addressing any violations. Penalties would target app stores that defy a TikTok ban and internet hosting services that continue to support the platform.After 20 January, his Justice Department would oversee law enforcement, including penalties for non-compliant app stores and hosting services. Trump could potentially determine whether a sale removes ""foreign adversary"" control or advocate for legislative repeal, though this would require Republican support.ByteDance and TikTok are likely to challenge the ruling in the Supreme Court, though it remains unclear if the court will take up the case.The companies confirmed their intentions to take their case to high court, saying the Supreme Court has ""an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech"".""We expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,"" a company spokesperson said.Professor Alan Morrison of The George Washington University Law School anticipates the Supreme Court will consider the case due to its unique legal questions. He notes that the companies must secure an emergency stay to prevent enforcement of the 19 January divestiture deadline, potentially extending the proceedings.ByteDance has firmly stated its position against selling TikTok. Additionally, due to Chinese export regulations implemented in 2020, any potential sale of TikTok's core algorithmic technology would likely face regulatory obstacles.Any acquisition without the underlying algorithm would essentially result in purchasing a basic platform structure, devoid of the technical innovations that transformed TikTok into a significant cultural influence.Nevertheless, certain investors have shown interest in acquiring TikTok, including former US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and businessman Frank McCourt .Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, expressed optimism that former President Trump could enable an American acquisition of TikTok, ensuring its continued operation in the USIf TikTok were banned, advertisers would likely shift their focus to other social media platforms. Following the ruling, shares of Meta Platforms, a major competitor in the online ad space, surged to an intraday record high, closing up 2.4 per cent .Alphabet, the parent company of YouTube—a rival to TikTok—also saw its stock rise, ending the day 1.25 per cent higher.","The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's three-judge panel unanimously upheld the law's constitutional validity.

Will run INDIA bloc from West Bengal if asked: CM Mamata Banerjee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/will-run-india-bloc-from-west-bengal-if-asked-cm-mamata-banerjee/articleshow/116063267.cms,"‘Not one-person party’

KOLKATA: Speaking of the INDIA bloc in an interview on Friday, CM Mamata Banerjee indicated that while she would never leave Bengal, she was ready to lead the opposition bloc from Bengal if asked to do so.The CM said “I formed the INDI alliance. Those who don’t like me will always find faults. They may not like me... But if I were given the responsibility. However, I don’t want it. I don’t want to leave Bengal. I was born here, and I will take my last breath here because I love Bengal so much. But I believe that I can manage this even from here.”Asked why the alliance wasn’t coming together, she said, “What can I do if they can’t keep it together? I am not leading that front. Those who are leaders should look into it. However, I maintain the best relations with all regional and national parties.”Asked about succession in the party and the senior-junior debate, Mamata Banerjee on Friday said that Trinamool seniors would collectively decide on her successor and it was not about what she believed, but “what the party collectively believed”. Speaking about the RG Kar issue, the CM said the protests were political and people realised it later.In an interview to TV channel News 18 Bangla, Banerjee said: “The party will decide the successor. TMC does not belong to one person. No party can survive without its workers.”“I don’t believe in egoism. We have to move forward together. If I say I’ll make decisions alone that would be arrogance,” she added and said one needs both seniors andjuniors in a political party.","Mamata Banerjee indicated that while she would never leave Bengal, she was ready to lead the opposition bloc from Bengal if asked to do so.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
