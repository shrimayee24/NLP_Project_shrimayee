"'Creamy layer' not snatching pie, signals unfilled SC/ST posts data",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/creamy-layer-not-snatching-pie-signals-unfilled-sc/st-posts-data/articleshow/112256269.cms,"NEW DELHI: While it is true that some sub-castes within scheduled castes and some tribes within scheduled tribes miss out on the benefits of reservation , a significant part of SC/ST quotas in government jobs goes unfilled every year, raising the question of whether the 'dominant' sub-castes and tribes are really keeping the more deprived ones out. Data also shows that the proportion of unfilled posts increases as we move up the chain towards more senior posts.According to a 2023 report of the parliamentary committee on the welfare of scheduled castes (SCs) and scheduled tribes (STs), the only category of jobs in ministries and departments of the central government where SCs and STs have a share larger than their quota of 15 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively are the Group C jobs excluding safai karamcharis and an even larger share among safai karamcharis or sanitation workers. More than one third (37 per cent) of the safai karamcharis employed in central government ministries are from scheduled castes and 7.4 per cent are tribals.In comparison, in Group A jobs just 13 per cent are SCs and 5.5 per cent are STs. Due to the high representation of SCs and STs in lower categories of jobs, it looks like they more than fill their quota overall 18.4 per cent SCs and 7.4 per cent STs in posts and services under the central government. According to the Parliamentary report, in spite of special drives, relaxation in qualifying criteria and pre-promotional training, ministries or departments were unable to fill the thousands of backlog reserved vacancies.Thus, even with some 'dominant' scheduled castes or tribes taking advantage of the quotas, they remain unfilled year after year. Data available on 45 central universities also shows a similar pattern. SCs constituted under 11 per cent of teaching posts and STs less than 5 per cent . In non-teaching posts, SCs had a share of under 10 per cent and STs just a bit over 5 per cent .Once again, the shares are lowest in the senior most positions. ""This fact is obfuscated by only talking of the overall representation of dalits and tribals in government jobs. There are thousands of unfilled posts in government because the quotas are not being filled. Clearly, despite having a small section of relatively better off SCs, the government is unable to fill the quota. It is estimated that barely 1.9 per cent of SCs earn above 50,000. Most of these would be in government service as historically SCs have no assets, neither land nor businesses,"" pointed out M S Nethrapal, an Indian Revenue Service officer who researches issues of Bahujan representation in jobs and education. He added that there was not enough data on the various sub-categories within SC, as data is only collected at a broad level for all SCs as a single category.The lack of sub-classification leading to the more deprived among SCs or STs missing out would hold true only if the quota was being filled.If the quota was not being filled, then nobody could be said to be missing out because someone else was getting. However, unlike in jobs/posts, the quotas usually get filled when it comes to seats in educational institutions run by the government, like medical colleges, engineering colleges anduniversities.",Some sub-castes within scheduled castes and some tribes within scheduled tribes miss out on the benefits of reservation. A significant part of SC/ST quotas in government jobs goes unfilled every year. Data also shows that the proportion of unfilled posts increases as we move up the chain towards more senior posts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112256497,imgsize-889591,width-400,resizemode-4/112256497.jpg"
"India, China run risk of falling into 'middle income trap': World Bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-china-run-risk-of-falling-into-middle-income-trap-world-bank/articleshow/112253855.cms,"NEW DELHI: At current trends, it will take India 75 years to reach a quarter of US per capita income while China will take over 10 years, a World Bank report has said as it cautioned countries from falling into what is known as ' middle income trap '. The alert comes amidst India setting a target of being a developed nation by 2047.China, Vietnam and several other middle-income countries have also set plans for raising their per capita incomes to match those of developed nations.The report says, more than 100 countries - including China, India, Brazil and South Africa - face serious obstacles that could hinder their efforts to become high-income countries in the next few decades.The 'World Development Report 2024: The Middle-Income Trap' finds that as countries grow wealthier, they usually hit a ""trap"" at about 10% of annual US GDP per person - the equivalent of $8,000 today. That's in the middle of the range of what World Bank classifies as 'middle-income' countries.Since 1990, only 34 middle-income economies managed to shift to high-income status - more than a third of them were either beneficiaries of integration into European Union or of previously undiscovered oil.In 2007, World Bank published a report that coined the phrase 'middle-income trap'. This was during a decade of growth and poverty reduction in developing countries. ""Yet it was clear that many economies - particularly in Latin America and Middle East - had remained stuck for decades, despite their efforts to rise to high-income status,"" says the report.The agency provides a growth framework for developing countries to escape 'middle-income trap'. The report proposes a '3i strategy' for countries to reach high-income status. Depending on their stage of development, countries need to adopt a sequenced and progressively sophisticated mix of policies. Low-income countries can focus on policies designed to increase investment - the '1i' phase. Once they attain lower-middle-income status, they need to shift gears and expand the policy mix to the '2i' phase - investment and infusion, which consists of adopting technologies from abroad and spreading them across the economy.""At upper-middle-income level, countries should shift gears again to the final 3i phase: investment, infusion, and innovation. In the innovation phase, countries no longer merely borrow ideas from global frontiers, they push the frontier,"" according to the World Bank report.","At current trends, it will take India 75 years to reach a quarter of US per capita income while China will take over 10 years.

"After Wayanad landslides, Centre issues 6th draft notification proposing over 56k sq km of Western Ghats eco sensitive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-wayanad-landslides-centre-issues-6th-draft-notification-proposing-over-56k-sq-km-of-western-ghats-eco-sensitive/articleshow/112231199.cms,"NEW DELHI: Three days after the massive landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district, the Centre on Friday released a sixth draft notification proposing earmarking of 56,825 sq km as ecologically sensitive area ( ESA ) to prohibit/regulate environmentally hazardous human activities within the fragile Western Ghats , spread over six states.The draft for the first time proposed a provision where the final ESA notification can be taken up “in a phased manner either state-wise or through a combined single notification” - a move which may speed up the process without waiting for all six states to be on board at the same time.The proposed ESA includes Kerala’s 9,993 sq km which includes 13 villages in two talukas of Wayanad district including Noolpuzha that was hit by landslides on July 30. The ESA issue has been pending since August 2011 when a central panel, headed by ecologist Madhav Gadgil, recommended the govt to take it up on priority to save the fragile terrain in six states.The environment ministry that notified the sixth draft in official gazette a day after the tragedy on Wednesday said the proposal would be “taken into consideration” for publishing final notification of ESA on or after the expiry of a period of sixty days from the date on which copies of the gazette are made available to the public.The ministry, meanwhile, sought “objections or suggestions” on the proposals contained in the draft. Except for the provision of notification in a “phased manner”, the sixth draft broadly replicates the fifth one, issued in July 2022, whose validity expired on June 30.Accordingly, it proposed the ESA of 20,668 sq km in Karnataka; 17,340 sq km in Maharashtra; 6,914 sq km in Tamil Nadu; 1,461 sq km in Goa and 449 sq km in Gujarat, and recommended prohibiting or regulating certain human activities in those areas.The draft proposed complete ban on mining, quarrying, sand mining and high polluting (Red category) industries. It said all existing mines will be phased out within five years from the date of issue of the final notification or on the expiry of the existing mining lease (whichever is earlier).Besides, it also prohibited setting up any new thermal power projects and expansion of existing power plants within the ESA. Construction of projects of 20,000 sq m and above; and all new and expansion of townships, and development projects with an area of 50 hectares and above or with built up area of 1.5 lakh sq m and above will also be prohibited after final notification.On the other hand, it proposed regulation of hydro-power projects, essential services and low-polluting (Orange & White categories) industries.The need for a sixth draft arose as states failed to come on board for earmarking ESA within their respective jurisdiction in the Western Ghats. The first draft notification to earmark ESA was issued in March, 2014 but the proposal remains on paper since then. In the meantime, the ministry had issued four more drafts in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2022.The central govt and an expert committee had discussed the fifth draft with states - Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu - nine times during July, 2022-March, 2024 but it could not finalise the ESA notification due to objection from states - initially from Kerala, Maharashtra and Goa and later mainly from Karnataka.The then Karnataka govt even requested the Centre to withdraw the draft notification in 2022, arguing that ESA, covering 20,668 sq km of area within the state, would adversely affect the livelihood of people due to ban on certain activities.The draft, however, clearly specifies that agriculture, plantation and less polluting activities will not be affected due to the ESA provisions and the actual area will be finalised based on the recommendation of the states.","The proposed ESA includes Kerala’s 9,993 sq km which includes 13 villages in two talukas of Wayanad district including Noolpuzha that was hit by landslides on July 30.

Government set to bring bill to curb waqf board powers on assets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-set-to-bring-bill-to-curb-waqf-board-powers-on-assets/articleshow/112253430.cms,"Bill also eyes changes in compositions of waqf boards

NEW DELHI: In a major step, government wants to curb the ""unfettered"" powers of Waqf Boards to declare any property a 'waqf asset' and take control of it.Sources said the Cabinet on Friday evening discussed 40-odd amendments in the Wakf Act (known as Waqf Act before 2013), including ones to check the jurisdiction, considered arbitrary in many quarters, of Waqf Boards which now control assets running into lakhs of crores of rupees across the country.Under the proposed amendments, Waqf Boards' claims, which were previously unrestricted, will be subject to mandatory verification. A similar mechanism of mandatory verification has been proposed also for properties for which Waqf Boards and individual owners have made claims and counter-claims.Though an official briefing on Friday evening on Cabinet decisions did not mention this move, sources indicated that a Bill to amend the Wakf Act is likely to be introduced in Parliament next week.Sources also said that the two provisions of mandatory verification of properties, which would check arbitrary powers of Waqf Boards, are the major amendments proposed to the Act. At present, these entities have powers to tag any property as waqf asset. More than 8.7 lakh properties across the country, totalling around 9.4 lakh acres, are under the jurisdiction of Waqf Boards.The need for such legislation arose as there were several representations from Muslim intellectuals, women and different sects such as Shia and Bohras, among others, seeking changes in the existing law, sources said, underlining that the preparation to bring amendments had started much before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. They also added that preliminary perusal of the laws across Islamic nations such as Oman, Saudi Arabia and others show that none of these countries have given such sweeping powers to one entity.More sweeping powers were conferred on Waqf Boards by bringing amendments to the original Act during the UPA govt in 2013, which have been a major bone of contention among waqf authorities, individual property owners, and several state entities, including the Archaeological Survey of India.TOI has learned that the Bill also proposes changes in the composition of Waqf Boards and also seeks to repeal some provisions of the current law.The Wakf Act, 1995 was enacted to regulate ‘auqaf’ (assets donated and notified as waqf) by a wakif — the person who dedicates a property for any purpose recognised by the Muslim law as pious, religious or charitable.Earlier, govt had taken note of sweeping powers of state Waqf Boards to stake claim on any property and also delay in conducting a survey of such property in most states. Government had also considered the possibility of involving district magistrates in monitoring of waqf properties to prevent misuse of the assets. Sources said the flaws in the appeal process were also under scrutiny.","Cabinet discussed 40-odd amendments in the Wakf Act (known as Waqf Act before 2013) Bill also eyes changes in compositions of waqf boards.

‘Now, a mammoth rock sits where our house stood’

MEPPADI (WAYANAD): Fate can't be much crueller than this. Eleven members of Kalathingal Nousheeba's family have been swept away by the Mundakkai landslide - her father, mother, elder brother, two sisters-in-law and six nieces and nephews - all of whom were staying at her ancestral house at Mundakkai that fateful night. As if this immense loss was not enough, Nousheeba has also lost five members of her husband's family - her mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law, and their two children.Grief-stricken Nousheeba (40) has been standing before the Meppadi family health centre for the last three days with swollen eyes.She walks up to the makeshift pandal each time a new body dug out of the landslide ravaged villages of Chooralmala and Meppadi is brought in for identification.On Saturday, a new body wrapped in white cloth with ""Number 168-Female child"" written on it in blue ink was brought. The volunteer asked out loud if there was anyone to identify the body. Nousheeba walked up to check, thinking it could be her niece, but found it wasn't her. She's been repeating this traumatic routine for the last three days.When Nousheeba walked up to the body along with her daughters Nahla and Thafseena, the volunteer showed them the leg of the body, saying the face cannot be shown as it is badly disfigured. The mehendi on the fingers brought a flicker of recognition and Nousheeba contemplated the possibility of the body being of her niece, Shahla. But Thafseena spotted an anklet on the leg and said it wasn’t her cousin as she didn’t wear anklets. So the family walked back.“I have lost all my family. I have to stand here waiting (to see) if at all they are brought in. All of them were staying in my father’s house just in front of the Mundakkai mosque. My elder brother and his five-member family, who were staying in the estate quarters, had come to be with my father in view of the heavy rains. There were 11 family members in the house, and all went missing after the landslide swept away the entire house without a trace,” said Nousheeba.She said the bodies of her father Kunhammed, mother Ayisha, and her two nieces — Ayisha Amana and Nafla — have been found, but all the others, including brother Mansoor, his wife Muhsina, their two children Shahla and Shafna, and her sister-in-law Sajna (younger brother Noufal’s wife) and the couple’s two children, Nihal and Isha Mehrin, are missing.“I was staying in my house, which is close by, as my husband had come on leave a month ago. Otherwise I, too, would have been swept away with all of them. On hearing the loud thunderous sound, we ran up the woods and stayed there the entire night. It was when dawn broke that I saw that my ancestral house and all my dear ones who stayed there were gone,” said Nousheeba.“At the place where our house stood now sits a mammoth rock,” she said, adding that her niece Shahla’s wedding had been fixed for Sept 22.Nousheeba has also lost her mother-in-law Pathuma, sisters-in-law Sumayya and Nazeera, and Nazeera’s children Munaveer and Rinsha Fathima. The bodies of Sumayya, Nazeera and Munaveer have been recovered.","Eleven members of Kalathingal Nousheeba's family have been swept away by the Mundakkai landslide.

She also served as 'Asthana Narthaki' at Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams.For her contribution to the enrichment of Bharatanatyam, she received the Sangeet Natak Akademi award in 1977.Yamini began her dance journey at the tender age of five, when she embarked on Bharatanatyam training at Kalakshetra in Chennai (then Madras) under the legendary Rukmini Devi Arundale. She also trained under the late Vidwan Ellappa Pillai of Kancheepuram.Under the tutelage of renowned gurus, she mastered the intricacies of this dance form, later expanding her repertoire to include Kuchipudi and Odissi.Her debut performance in 1957 marked the beginning of a stellar career characterised by the innovation and the artistry.Yamini's unique approach to rhythm and her ability to infuse traditional forms with contemporary interpretations revolutionised Bharatanatyam.Her interests and influence extended beyond dance, as she excelled in classical singing, veena playing, and the study of Hindu scriptures. She also founded a Bharatanatyam dance school in Delhi, where she trained countless dancers.She also contributed articles on various aspects of dance traditions to leading journals of the country, and authored a book titled 'A Passion For Dance: My Autobiography'.Through her artistry and mentorship, she inspired generations of dancers and continued to be a beacon of excellence in the world of classical dance.Her body will be brought to her dance school in Delhi on Sunday. A decision on the final rites is yet to be taken.","Yamini Krishnamurti passed away on Saturday while undergoing treatment at Apollo Hospital in New Delhi.

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday experienced nature's wrath in its full fury as heavy rainfall lashed several regions, leaving a trail of destruction . The Gangetic West Bengal and Jharkhand faced the brunt of the disruption caused by a deep depression.The IMD has issued warnings, predicting record rainfall in several regions on Sunday. Meteorologists attribute the extreme weather to the warming of the Indian Ocean, which has created ""flying rivers"" influencing monsoon rains between June and September.Himachal Pradesh experienced severe flash floods and landslides triggered by cloudbursts and heavy downpours. The state saw the closure of 114 roads, and the state road transport corporation suspended bus services on 82 routes. The weather department warned that heavy showers would persist until August 7.The death toll due to flash floods in the state has risen to nine, with one body recovered from Rajban village in Mandi. About 45 people remain missing after a series of cloudbursts struck Kullu's Nirmand, Sainj, and Malana; Mandi's Padhar; and Shimla's Rampur subdivision on the night of July 31. A total of 410 rescuers from various agencies are involved in the search operations, using drones.Continuous rains over the past two days have led to flooding, road washouts, uprooted trees, damaged houses, and a collapsed bridge in Jharkhand. The state government ordered the closure of all schools on Saturday. While no deaths have been reported, NDRF teams were deployed in Ranchi on Friday to rescue people from low-lying areas.In Tamil Nadu, Namakkal district remained inundated as the Cauvery River surpassed the danger mark, flooding low-lying areas. Chief minister Stalin announced that 11 relief camps had been set up in the district, accommodating approximately 1,086 people.In Kerala, the death toll from the Wayanad landslides has surpassed 350. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan stated that search and rescue operations , which began on July 30, are nearing completion, although 206 people remain unaccounted for. Over 1,300 rescuers, heavy machinery, and advanced equipment have been deployed, but large boulders and logs in the residential areas of Mundakkai and Chooralmala are hindering efforts.In Madhya Pradesh's Narsinghpur district, relentless rains led to the collapse of a house in a village. This tragic incident resulted in the deaths of two children and injuries to five other family members.The IMD has issued warnings of extremely heavy rainfall in Maharashtra's Palghar, Pune, and Satara districts for Sunday. An orange alert has been issued for Thane, Mumbai, Raigad, Sindhudurg, and Nashik, forecasting heavy rains.Rajasthan also received heavy rainfall, with Kolai Magra in Bikaner district receiving the maximum rainfall of 195 mm.

Waterlogging was reported in several parts of Kolkata, including the airport, but flight services remained unaffected. The southern districts of Howrah, Paschim Bardhaman, Birbhum, Purba Bardhaman, Hooghly, Nadia, and North and South 24 Parganas are expected to experience showers over the next 12 hours.An irrigation department official reported that 36,000 cusecs of water were discharged from Panchet Dam and 70,000 cusecs from Durgapur Barrage following heavy rains.

5 cops among 6 J&K employees dismissed over narco-terror ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-cops-among-6-jk-employees-dismissed-over-narco-terror-ties/articleshow/112252685.cms,"NEW DELHI: Taking forward its drive to dismantle the terror ecosystem, the Jammu and Kashmir administration has terminated six more employees, including five J&K police personnel found to be involved in funding terror with sale proceeds of narcotics trade originating across the border.According to sources in the Union territory government, J&K LG Manoj Sinha invoked 311 (2) (c) of the Constitution of India to sack the six staffers after painstaking investigation clearly established that they were part of the narco-terror network run by Pakistan ISI and terror outfits operating from its soil.Sources said the inquiry by J&K criminal investigation department (CID) revealed that the dismissed police constables Farooq Ahmad Sheikh, Khalid Hussain Shah, Rahmat Shah, Irshad Ahmad Chalkoo and Saif Din, instead of helping the force to fight the narco-terror sponsored by Pakistan ISI and terror outfits, chose to be collaborators and moles.Constables Farooq Ahmad Sheikh, Khalid Hussain Shah and Rehmat Shah, all from Kupwara, were part of an infamous trio that carefully created a drug syndicate in collaboration with narcotics traders based in Pakistan. Farooq used his cover as a police personnel to act as a conduit for supplying smuggled narcotics from across the border to Srinagar, Budgam and its peripheral satellite areas. He was exposed when Rahmat Shah was arrested with around 806 grams of brown sugar on the way to Kupwara from Karnah. On investigation, Rahmat spilled the beans on associates Farooq and Khalid.Khalid, recruited as a constable in 2009, would facilitate the smooth transportation and sale of drugs. Constable Irshad Ahmad Chalkoo, also dismissed on Saturday, was deployed as personal security officer (PSO) of a senior government officer in Baramulla. Over a period of time he developed a close relationship with the terrorist associates of the area and started working as an over ground worker for Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).Sources said Irshad got exposed in 2020 when Handwara police apprehended two terrorists from the house of one Abdul Razzaq Bhat. Search of the two terrorists yielded a huge cache of illegal arms and ammunition. On disclosures by the two terrorists, Irshad was arrested along with four more LeT terror associates. It was found that Irshad was in close contact with two Kashmir-origin terrorists based in PoJK and had received arms/ammunition, which he was supposed to deliver to the terrorists of LeT, for a payment of Rs 1 lakh.Dismissed teacher Nazam Din from Poonch, despite being a govt employee,joined and promoted a few organisations and crypto-currency applications. ""Nazam Din and his associate Qamar Din, an OGW for Hizbul Mujahideen, used to meet very frequently and during one such meeting, Nazam received Rs 10 lakh from Qamar Din, all derived from these illegal proceeds of narco-terror.

In September 2022 Mohd Bashir and Mohd Latief (both J&K origin terrorists based in PoJK) sent a huge consignment of narcotics consisting of 15 kg of heroin from across the LoC. Of these about 5 kg was received by Nazam Din and was to be delivered to some Punjab-based drug peddlers in Poonch for a commission of Rs 2 lakh. He was about to deliver the consignment when he was arrested by the Punjab Police.Constable Saif Din, a resident of Jammu, was a notorious drug peddler, a habitual offender and a mastermind who manipulated the very system that was meant to curb his kind.",J&K LG Manoj Sinha invoked 311 (2) (c) of the Constitution of India to sack the six staffers.

10% of organ transplant recipients in India are foreigners: Government data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10-of-organ-transplant-recipients-in-india-are-foreigners-government-data/articleshow/112253615.cms,"‘Foreigners mostly go for living donor transplants’

NEW DELHI: Foreigners account for nearly one in every 10 persons undergoing organ transplant in India, govt data shows. In 2023, data shared by National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation reveals, India recorded 18,378 organ transplants with 42 recipients getting more than one organ. So, there were a total 18,336 organ recipients in the country of which 1,851 (10%) were foreign nationals .Transplants involving foreign nationals were carried out in Delhi (1,445), Rajasthan (116), West Bengal (88), UP (76), Telangana (61), Maharashtra (35), Karnataka (15), Gujarat (11), Tamil Nadu (3) and Manipur (1).Doctors say a majority of such patients come from neighbouring nations where transplant facilities are not available or still in nascent stages, including Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar.While the majority of foreigners receiving organ transplants in India come from neighbouring nations, some also come from developed nations like the US and UK for living donor transplants because the cost of the procedure is barely a tenth here compared with medical costs in their countries, Dr Subhash Gupta, liver transplant surgeon and chairman of Max Centre for Liver and Biliary Sciences, said. ""Nearly 30% of patients undergoing liver transplant at our centre are foreigners,"" he added.An organ transplant involves removing an organ from a donor - living or deceased - and transplanting it into a needy patient.The person who gives the organ is called the donor. The person who receives the organ is called the recipient. A living donor can donate kidney (as one kidney is capable of maintaining the body functions), a portion of pancreas (as half of the pancreas is adequate for sustaining pancreatic functions) and part of the liver (as the few segments that are donated will regenerate after a period of time). On the other hand, a deceased donor or person who is declared brain dead can donate multiple organs and tissues including the heart, lungs, liver, kidney, intestines and corneas.Pallavi Kumar of Mohan Foundation, an NGO working in the field of organ donation, said deceased donations are rare in India and preference is given to Indians for receiving organs retrieved from such donors. ""Most transplants involving foreigners are living donor transplants,"" she said.The NOTTO data also reflects this trend. It shows that of the 1,851 foreigner transplants that took place in India in 2023, only nine involved organ donation from a deceased donor.""For living donor organ transplants involving foreigners, there are strict protocols and vetting is done at multiple levels to ascertain that the donor is a blood relative of the patient before allowing transplant,"" Dr A S Soin, liver transplant surgeon and chairman of the Institute of Liver Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Medanta-The Medicity, said.Recently, there were reports of commercial dealings in organ transplants involving foreign citizens after which the Centre issued a directive asking states/UTs to create a NOTTO (National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation)-ID of all organ recipients, both for living and deceased donor-related organ transplants.","In 2023, India recorded 18,378 organ transplants with 42 recipients getting more than one organ.

He said agriculture is the core of the country's economic policy and small farmers are the biggest strength of India's food security.Addressing the 32nd International Conference of Agricultural Economists (ICAE), Modi said India, being a food surplus country today, is committed to global welfare as a 'Vishwa Bandhu', noting that the country's vision for global welfare was put forward on various fora including 'One Earth, One Family and One Future' (at G20), 'Mission LiFE', and 'One Earth, One Health'.The theme for this year's ICAE is ""Transformation Towards Sustainable Agri-Food Systems"" to promote sustainable agriculture in the face of global challenges such as climate change, natural resource degradation, rising production costs and conflicts.

He also noted the priority given to science and logic in Indian agriculture tradition.Modi also highlighted government's emphasis on research and development related to climate-resilient crops , saying nearly 1,900 new climate-resilient varieties have been handed to the farmers in the last 10 years.He gave examples of rice varieties in India that require 25 per cent less water than traditional varieties and the emergence of black rice as a superfood.""Black rice from Manipur, Assam and Meghalaya is preferred choice due to its medicinal value"", he said, adding that India is eager to share its related experiences with the world community.","Modi said agriculture is the core of the country's economic policy.

He was 98.A 1950 batch IFS officer, Dutta was instrumental in establishing the state’s protected area network. As the first Wildlife Warden of Madhya Pradesh, he laid the foundation for the state’s rich wildlife heritage . His visionary leadership and unwavering commitment to conservation have left an enduring legacy.Dutta, a gold medallist in Zoology from Nagpur Science College and an alumnus of FRI Dehradun, retired as PCCF in 1984. Known for his exceptional knowledge and passion, he was a mentor to countless forest officers.Chief minister Dr Mohan Yadav expressed deep sorrow over Dutta’s demise, calling him a stalwart of Indian forestry . The government of Madhya Pradesh conferred him the Lifetime Achievement Award for his extraordinary contribution to the conservation of wildlife in the state and the country.For his vision and perseverance in building a strong wildlife wing with a dedicated and trained workforce and creating a network of rich and diverse protected areas in various biogeographical zones of the state, and for his scientific temper that led to the establishment of the State Forest Research Institute at Jabalpur, Dutta’s contributions are unparalleled.His strategy, which called for a change of role for the wildlife manager from a conservation introvert to a friend of the people, was circulated by the Government of India for adoption by other states. He became a radiant centre of expertise while serving on the Faculty Selection Committee of the Wildlife Institute of India for over a decade, first as a member and finally as its chairman. Even after his retirement, he continued to be a source of guidance and inspiration to the younger generation of foresters.“Owing to his untiring efforts to secure and nurture wildlife, Madhya Pradesh virtually became the ‘ Tiger State ’ of India by claiming 450 out of a total census of about 1800 in the first countrywide tiger estimation,” wrote Ghanshaym Saxena and Suhas Kumar, retired IFS officers.“His ability to train and influence the young foresters and field personnel resulted in a cadre of an extremely adept and dedicated workforce that led Madhya Pradesh to become a leader in wildlife management in the entire country. Some of the reserves developed under his guidance in MP had brought international recognition to the state and the country. His protégé Padam Bhushan H S Pawar headed Project Tiger in the early 1980s and later as the director of Wildlife Institute of India, a prestigious institution of the Government of India. Shri J.J Dutta fully deserves the highest Civilian recognition offered by the Government of India,” they added.Retired IFS R Sreenivasa Murty said he was lucky to have lived with a forestry legend and to have interacted with J J Dutta . “I admire the old-time forest officers for without the modern tools they were able to steer through laying strong foundations of forestry and wildlife management in the State with zeal and dedication. Dutta Sir was a pioneer on this count. He established 9 National Parks and 22 Wildlife Sanctuaries as the first Chief Wildlife Warden of the State. My salutes to J.J.

The Hemavathi River also flooded several villages and towns in the Hassan district, disrupting daily life and transport.

High alert as 1.7L cusecs of water flows out of Mettur dam

The discharge from Mettur dam was increased to 1.7 lakh cusecs due to heavy inflow from Karnataka.

The project is now nearly complete, with 98% of the work finished and the total cost rising to Rs 37,276 crore. The funding for this project is provided by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

Operations and maintenance: The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) will operate and maintain the Aqua Line for the next ten years. Their responsibilities include managing control centres, stations, trains, and overall infrastructure to ensure passenger safety.

Mumbai Aqua Line timings

Operational hours: The Aqua Line will run from 6:30 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., with trains available for passengers every few minutes. Trains will have a maximum speed of up to 90 km/h.

Travel time: An estimated 35 km of the route will be covered in 50 minutes. In comparison, travelling the same distance by car in Mumbai typically takes over two hours.

Mumbai's new underground metro line, the Aqua Line, is set to commence operations shortly. This project represents a significant advancement in the city's transportation infrastructure. The new metro line is anticipated to simplify travel across Mumbai, alleviate traffic congestion, and enhance the overall commuting experience. The underground Metro Line represents a significant advancement in Mumbai’s public transportation network, aimed at alleviating traffic congestion and improving urban mobility.This ambitious project, part of the city's broader metro expansion plan, introduces efficient, high-speed train services that connect key areas, reducing travel time and enhancing connectivity across the bustling metropolis.With its modern infrastructure and state-of-the-art technology, the Mumbai Underground Metro Line is set to transform the city’s transit landscape, providing a cleaner and more reliable alternative to traditional road transport. The first phase of the Mumbai Metro 3 line will soon be operational, connecting SEEPZ (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone) to BKC (Bandra Kurla Complex). Mumbai's Aqua Line will cover a distance of 33.5 kilometres, stretching from Aarey Colony to Cuffe Parade, and will include 27 stations. Out of these, 26 stations will be situated underground, while one will be at ground level.","Mumbai's new underground metro line, the Aqua Line, is set to commence operations shortly.

IOC's response

Here are more reactions on the controversy

NEW DELHI: Paris Olympics has been hit by another major controversy as Algerian boxer Imane Khelif , alleged to be a 'biological male,' defeated Italian boxer Angela Carini in a women's boxing bout within 46 seconds on Thursday. The incident has led to a heated debate on social media, drawing in comments from high-profile personalities like Elon Musk and JK Rowling .Following Khelif's victory, social media platforms erupted with outrage.Users described the event as a ""travesty of justice"" and ""daylight mugging.""British author JK Rowling and billionaire Elon Musk also joined the discussion, questioning the decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Khelif to compete.""Could any picture sum up our new men's rights movement better? The smirk of a male who knows he's protected by a misogynist sporting establishment enjoying the distress of a woman he's just punched in the head, and whose life's ambition he's just shattered,"" Rowling wrote on X.Elon Musk responded to a post by sports host Riley Gaines, who stated, ""Men don't belong in women's sports IStandWithAngelaCarini Let's get it trending."" Musk replied, ""Absolutely.""Khelif's past disqualification at the 2023 World Championships for failing the International Boxing Association (IBA) eligibility rules, which prevent athletes with male XY chromosomes from competing in women's events, has added fuel to the fire.Despite this, Khelif and Taiwan's double world champion Lin Yu-ting were cleared to compete in the Olympics after the IBA was stripped of its recognition by the IOC last year.In response to the uproar, the IOC issued a statement backing Khelif's participation: ""All athletes participating in the boxing tournament of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 comply with the competition's eligibility and entry regulations, as well as all applicable medical regulations set by the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit (PBU).""The IOC explained that the decision to disqualify the athletes last year by the IBA was arbitrary and lacked due process. The IOC also highlighted that these athletes have been competing in top-level competitions for years and criticized the IBA's governance.""We have seen in reports misleading information about two female athletes competing at the Olympic Games Paris 2024. The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure,"" the IOC added.The controversy has sparked a broader discussion on the inclusion and eligibility criteria in women's sports. While the IOC emphasized its commitment to protecting the human rights of all athletes, the incident has highlighted the ongoing tensions and challenges in ensuring fair competition in sports.","Imane Khelif, alleged to be a 'biological male,' defeated Italian boxer Angela Carini in a women's boxing bout within 46 seconds on Thursday.

Explained: What 'high levels of testosterone' means amid gender row in boxing at Paris Olympics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/explained-what-high-levels-of-testosterone-means-amid-gender-row-in-boxing-at-paris-olympics/articleshow/112205038.cms,"(With inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: Algerian boxer Imane Khelif 's shock 46-second win over her Italian opponent at the Paris Olympics on Thursday sparked a row, as she was previously disqualified due to reportedly high testosterone levels.Far-right Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was among the critics, questioning Khelif's participation in the Games.The controversy has highlighted broader discussions about the role of testosterone in sports.Testosterone is a sex hormone produced by both men and women. However men produce up to 20 times more testosterone -- primarily in the testicles.Women make far less, in the ovaries and adrenal glands.A normal level of testosterone for men is estimated to be 10 to 35 nanomoles per litre in blood, according to the US Mount Sinai hospital.For women, it is between 0.5 to 2.4 nmol per litre.Testosterone levels can also vary widely by age and time of year.When people naturally produce an excess of sex hormones such as testosterone, it is called hyperandrogenism.The condition affects an estimated five percent of women, with around 70 percent of cases caused by polycystic ovary syndrome, research has found.Symptoms include acne, body hair growth and scalp hair loss.Testosterone can promote bone and muscle mass -- deliberately boosting levels is a common form of doping and is banned.Research has suggested that people with an excess of testosterone are over-represented in elite sport.But just how much the hormone boosts performance remains a matter of debate.The International Olympic Committee's head of human rights Magali Martowicz said in 2021 that there no was no ""scientific consensus"" on how testosterone affects athletic performance.At the 2021 Tokyo Games, New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard became the first openly transgender woman to take part in an Olympic event.To qualify, she had to keep her testosterone levels below 10 nmol per litre for at least 12 months.In spite of meeting the requirements, Hubbard's participation was widely criticised.At the end of 2021, the IOC gave up on establishing uniform guidelines for this kind of participation criteria, leaving it to the separate international sport federations.Khelif was disqualified during the boxing world championships last year after ""elevated levels of testosterone failed to meet the eligibility criteria,"" according to the IOC's website.Khelif and boxer Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting were both disqualified from the New Delhi event by the International Boxing Association (IBA) under Russian oligarch Umar Kremlev.However because of governance, financial and ethical issues at the IBA, it was effectively expelled from the Olympic movement last year. The IOC has taken responsibility for organising the boxing at the Paris Games.In a statement on Wednesday, the IBA said the two boxers ""did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test, whereby the specifics remain confidential"".IOC spokesman Mark Adams said everyone taking part in the women's event was ""complying with competition eligibility rules"".""These athletes have competed many times before for many years, they haven't just arrived, they competed in Tokyo,"" he said.""Testosterone is not a perfect test. Many women can have testosterone which is in what would be called 'male levels' and still be women, still compete as women,"" he said.""This idea that suddenly you do one test for testosterone and that sorts everything out -- not the case, I'm afraid,"" he added.""I hope we're all agreed that we're not calling for people to go back to the bad old days of sex testing, which was a terrible thing to do.""",Algerian boxer Imane Khelif's shock 46-second win over her Italian opponent sparks row.

ICC's contingency plan in place if Team India refuses to travel to Pakistan for Champions Trophy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/iccs-contingency-plan-in-place-if-team-india-refuses-to-travel-to-pakistan-for-champions-trophy/articleshow/112250897.cms,"NEW DELHI: There may not be an official announcement from ICC yet, but they are covering all bases if Team India refuses to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy next year, Cricbuzz reported.The ICC has reportedly sanctioned a budget of around $65 million during its recent Annual General Meeting (AGM) held in Colombo. The approved budget covers expenses related to hosting several matches in locations other than Pakistan.According to the report, the contentious topic of India's potential involvement or absence was not addressed during various discussions at the ICC AGM.However, a contingency has been made, just in case.The Chief Executives Committee (CEC) approval note states that ""PCB has signed Host Agreement and has worked with management to draft an event budget which is submitted F&CA for approval. Management has also approved an estimate of the increase in the cost of staging the event if it is necessary to play some matches outside Pakistan."" The ICC, however, did not discuss what will be the venue/venues 'outside Pakistan.'The CEC note further says, ""A planning meeting and inspection of proposed match venues took place in Pakistan in March 2024. A significant amount of renovation work is underway in all three venues to upgrade facilities."" Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi are the earmarked venues and it is learnt that the PCB has undertaken work on refurbishing those three centres.Regarding the budget, around $35 million has been allocated for the competition itself, with an additional $20 million earmarked for participation and prize money. Another $10 million has been approved to cover the production costs of televising the 15-match, 20-day tournament, Cricbuzz report claimed.As previously reported by Cricbuzz, the budget estimate was determined after Ankur Khanna, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the ICC, spent three days in Lahore in June collaborating with Javed Murtuza, the CFO of the PCB, to address the matter.The ICC has reportedly circulated a tentative schedule to all relevant parties, such as broadcasters and participating teams. The proposed schedule is said to be mostly in line with what was anticipated. Notably, all of India's games are planned to take place in Lahore, including the eagerly awaited India-Pakistan encounter, which is slated for Saturday, March 1.The tournament features two groups, with India and Pakistan being joined by Bangladesh and New Zealand in Group A. Meanwhile, Group B comprises Australia, England, Afghanistan, and South Africa.India's other matches are scheduled as follows: February 20 against Bangladesh and February 23 against New Zealand. The competition will kick off with hosts Pakistan facing New Zealand on February 19 in Karachi. The two semifinals are planned for Karachi on March 5 and Pindi on March 6, with the final set to take place in Lahore on March 9. However, these venues may change based on decisions from the Indian team and the Government of India. An ICC team will visit Pakistan next month to inspect the three venues.The ICC has allocated a week-long duration, spanning from February 12th to 18th, which will serve as a 'support period' for the participating teams. This designated timeframe will allow the teams to participate in practice matches, helping them prepare for the upcoming tournament.Additionally, the teams will be involved in various media and promotional events, adhering to the predetermined guidelines set by the organizing committee. In case of any unforeseen circumstances affecting the final match, March 10th has been set aside as a reserve day.","The ICC has reportedly sanctioned a budget of around $65 million during its recent Annual General Meeting.

Appeal for relief package

Chief minister Siddaramaiah expressed his displeasure on Saturday over the ""unscientific"" road construction by the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) that led to a landslide on the Shiradi Ghat stretch.Accompanied by chief secretary Shalini Rajneesh , he visited Shiradi Ghat to assess the damage.The CM criticised the vertical cutting of hills at a 90-degree angle, advocating for a 45-degree slant to minimise destruction.He also reprimanded NHAI officials for such unsafe construction practices. Rajneesh briefed him on the progress, noting that while 35km of the 45km highway project has been completed, no safety measures based on soil quality tests were implemented.He held discussions with the State Disaster Response Force team engaged in mud clearance operation. He directed Shalini Rajneesh to write to Union minister Nitin Gadkari regarding the situation.Energy minister KJ George has formally requested Siddaramaiah to provide a special relief package for Chikkamagaluru district , in addition to the National Disaster Relief Fund ( NDRF ) grant, to address extensive damage caused by heavy rain and strong winds.During a meeting with the CM and revenue minister Krishna Byre Gowda, George, who is also in charge for Chikkamagaluru district, emphasized the severe impact of recent weather events.""During my recent visit to rain-affected areas in Chikkamagaluru, it was evident many houses have collapsed, roads have been significantly damaged, and road connectivity has been disrupted. There have been landslides in many areas, with potential for more. Fallen trees, damaged power poles, wires, and transformers are widespread. The CM understands the gravity of the situation and recognises the need for additional funding,"" the minister said.""A temporary compensation of Rs 1.2 lakh has been provided to those whose houses were destroyed. Additionally, authorities have been instructed to build new homes under Rajiv Gandhi housing scheme at a cost of Rs 3.8 lakh. Damaged roads should be temporarily repaired to restore vehicular traffic. Officials have been directed to prepare and submit an action plan for a comprehensive solution,"" he said. ""We also need a permanent solution for the landslide issue.

""This is a great demonstration of the extent to which this technology is not transformative at all,"" Merritt said.""It's stealing.""Merritt, who is a long time artists' rights advocate, isn't the only musician sounding alarms. In April, she joined Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj, Stevie Wonder and dozens of other artists in an open letter warning that AI-generated music trained on their recordings could ""sabotage creativity"" and sideline human artists. The big record labels are worried too. Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Music sued Udio and another music AI company called Suno in June, marking the music industry's entrance into high-stakes copyright battles over AI-generated content that are just starting to make their way through the courts.Suno and Udio filed their initial responses on Thursday, denying copyright violations.The labels' claims echo allegations by novelists, news outlets, music publishers and others in high-profile copyright lawsuits over chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude that use generative AI to create text. Those lawsuits are in their early stages. Both sets of cases pose novel questions for the courts, including whether the law should make exceptions for AI's use of copyrighted material to create something new.The record labels' cases, which could take years to play out, also raise questions unique to their subject matter - music. The interplay of melody, harmony, rhythm and other elements can make it harder to determine when parts of a copyrighted song have been infringed compared to works like written text, said Brian McBrearty, a musicologist who specializes in copyright analysis. ""Music has more factors than just the stream of words,"" Mc Brearty said. ""It has pitch, and it has rhythm, and it has harmonic context. It's a richer mix of different elements that make it a little bit less straight forward.""Some claims in the AI copyright cases could hinge on comparisons between an AI system's output and the material allegedly misused to train it, requiring the kind of analysis that has challenged courts in cases about music. In a 2018 decision that a dissenting judge called ""a dangerous precedent,"" Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams lost a case brought by Marvin Gaye's estate over the semblance of their hit ""Blurred Lines"" to Gaye's ""Got to Give It Up.""

MUMBAI: It was a rainy Saturday for Mumbai as the city and its adjoining areas such as Thane and Navi Mumbai recorded significant monsoon activity throughout the day. In the nine hours ended at 5:30pm on Saturday, India Meteorological Department 's ( IMD ) Colaba and Santacruz observatories recorded 43.2mm and 65mm rainfall , respectively.IMD upgraded its forecast for the weekend from the earlier yellow alert issued on Friday for Aug 3-4 to orange for both days following the downpour the city began to receive from Saturday morning.An orange alert indicates heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places. Meanwhile, for Palghar, a red alert has been issued for Sunday. A red alert indicates heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places with very likely extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places.The heavy rain activity all over the region, said IMD, was due to a deep depression over southwest Bihar and the adjoining northwest Jharkhand and a low-pressure area over southwest Rajasthan and its neighbourhood, and strong westerly winds currently prevailing over the western coast . ""So heavy rainfall activity is expected over parts of Maharashtra during the next two to three days. Widespread rainfall activity with heavy (64.5-115.5mm) to very heavy (115.6-204.4mm) rainfall and isolated extremely heavy rainfall (204.5mm) is expected over Konkan and adjoining Ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra during the above period,"" said the weather bureau A fisherman warning has also been issued for the next five days.

THANE: The presence of warehouses in Bhiwandi and 'uncontrolled' heavy vehicle traffic using the stretch within Thane limits are primarily accountable for potholes and colossal traffic congestion on the route reveals a survey of Mumbai-Nashik highway, officials said.The findings were derived after an inspection of the Thane and Vadape stretch until late Friday - a day after deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar issued directives to ease the commuting experience for those using the highway.A team of high-ranking officials from state road development body, MSRDC , Thane traffic department, and a few elected representatives conducted an on-site assessment of the stretch on Friday and devised a resolution to be executed in the forthcoming days.""One paramount factor contributing to congestion on the highway is existence of numerous warehouses in the interior regions frequently accessed by heavy vehicles that often traverse at a sluggish pace and in an unregulated fashion over internal roads that are in a dilapidated state. This often leads to heavy truck traffic overflowing onto the Nashik highway , impacting other traffic and interfering with outbound traffic at Rajnoli and Mankoli junctions, leading to bottlenecks,"" said an official who was present during the survey.The 23km Thane-Wadape segment of the highway that links Mumbai, Gujarat, Navi Mumbai and Nashik, north Maharashtra, sees at least around 1.5 lakh vehicles daily, including freight, private, and public transport buses.""We are deploying more traffic wardens at Rajnoli and Mankoli junctions to regulate traffic to and from the warehouses...

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

His initial reaction was confusion, as there was no apparent panic among the passengers.In a subsequent interview with the People, Judelson described the scene, noting that the woman’s rush seemed overly dramatic for the situation. He and another passenger wondered why she was so frantic, since everyone would be deplaning together.Judelson recounted, “I look around, no one’s on the ground, no one’s freaking out. I’m like, ‘it can’t be that dire.'” Upon landing, the situation became more peculiar. “As soon as we land, this woman across the aisle from me shoots up and rushes to the front of the plane,” he ewas quoted as explaing, noting that it seemed like an exaggerated urgency to be the first off the aircraft.The situation grew even stranger when passengers were told they would face a 12-hour delay and were given hotel vouchers. Judelson’s confusion deepened as he questioned whether they were stuck in Phoenix indefinitely.American Airlines confirmed in a statement that the flight was diverted due to a medical emergency. However, the specifics remained unclear until Judelson learned through word of mouth that the real cause was a lice outbreak. He overheard other passengers discussing how bugs had been spotted in the woman's hair, prompting the emergency landing.Despite the unusual interruption, passengers eventually continued their journey to New York, albeit with an unexpected detour.","A flight from Los Angeles to New York was forced to make an emergency landing in Phoenix.

Our planet is home to billions of people, each navigating the complexities of daily life through work, thought, play, and planning. In the midst of this chaos, some individuals manage to stay focused and disciplined, creating entirely new perspectives on life, the universe, and its meaning. Among these exceptional individuals are those who receive Nobel Prizes.The Nobel Prizes are far from ordinary awards.Established in 1895 by Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel, they honour significant contributions in six fields: literature, peace, economics, chemistry, physics, and medicine. Laureates receive a diploma, a gold medal, and a monetary award, which usually exceeds $1 million. While most prizes are awarded to individuals, the Peace Prize can also go to organisations. Occasionally, multiple recipients share a prize, but no more than three people can share one award.Since their inception in 1901, Nobel Prizes have been awarded 573 times to 900 recipients and organisations. Some have won more than once. Although prizes are generally awarded annually, there may be years when no prize is given if no achievement meets the high standards set.The significance of these awards lies not just in the accolades themselves but in the groundbreaking work they recognize. Nobel laureates are trailblazers who dedicate their lives to uncovering the mysteries of our existence, thereby advancing human knowledge and understanding. This article highlights ten such transformative figures who have made a profound impact on our world.Marie Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, made significant contributions to science with her research on radioactivity. Born in 1867, Curie and her husband Pierre, along with Henri Becquerel, were awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics for their studies on radiation. She later won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for her discoveries of radium and polonium, becoming the first individual to receive Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. During World War I, Curie applied her knowledge to develop mobile X-ray units, enhancing battlefield medical care. Her groundbreaking work continues to impact medicine and technology, and her daughter, Irene Joliot-Curie, also won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935.Albert Einstein transformed our understanding of physics and the universe. Awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, which showed that light consists of particles, Einstein’s work laid the foundation for technologies such as television and motion pictures. His theories of relativity further revolutionised physics, reshaping our perception of time, space, and the fundamental nature of reality. Einstein's contributions advanced both quantum theory and technological innovations.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times: in 1917, 1944, and 1963. Founded in Geneva in 1863, the ICRC is committed to providing aid to the wounded and sick in wartime, regardless of nationality. It plays a vital role in upholding the Geneva Conventions, documenting violations, and assisting prisoners of war and civilians. The ICRC’s efforts exemplify humanitarian principles amidst global conflicts.Alexander Fleming, Ernst Chain, and Howard Florey were honoured with the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of penicillin. Fleming discovered that mould (Penicillium notatum) produced an antibacterial substance, leading to the development of penicillin-based antibiotics. These antibiotics revolutionised medicine by effectively treating diseases such as tuberculosis, gangrene, and syphilis, thereby saving countless lives.Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her extensive charitable work. In 1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Catholic organisation dedicated to helping the poor, sick, and orphaned in India. The organisation expanded its mission to assist those affected by AIDS, war, and famine. Mother Teresa’s lifelong commitment to humanitarian work continues through her organisation, which operates in over 130 countries and supports thousands of people in need.Ivan Pavlov, awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physiology, is renowned for his research on conditioned reflexes. His experiments with dogs demonstrated that they could be conditioned to salivate in response to a stimulus, such as a bell, when it was repeatedly associated with feeding. Pavlov’s work had a profound impact on psychology and behaviourism, shaping our understanding of learned behaviours. His influential research also led to significant advancements in behavioural science.Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his leadership in the American civil rights movement. King advocated for racial equality and freedom through non-violent protests and activism, notably leading the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955. His extensive efforts to combat racial discrimination and his influential speeches made a lasting impact on American society. Despite his assassination in 1968, his legacy endures as a symbol of non-violent resistance and social justice.James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the molecular structure of DNA. Their discovery of the double-helix structure was crucial in understanding genetic information transmission within organisms. Their achievements were greatly aided by Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray photographs of DNA, though her contributions were overshadowed by her male counterparts. Franklin passed away before the Nobel committee could consider her for the prize, as posthumous awards are not allowed.Hermann Muller received the 1946 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research on the effects of X-rays, demonstrating that they cause genetic mutations. His studies in the 1920s showed that X-rays caused genetic damage in Drosophila flies, leading him to conclude similar effects in humans. Although he struggled to publicise his findings, the atomic bombings of Japan during World War II highlighted the dangers of radiation, leading to the recognition of his work. Muller’s discoveries and his anti-nuclear stance provided a crucial counterbalance to technological advancements of the Atomic Age.Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 but1, but was unable to accept it until 2012 due to her detention by Myanmar’s oppressive military regime. Her advocacy for democracy and human rights led to her house arrest starting in 1990, which lasted intermittently until 2010. After her release, Suu Kyi led her party, the National League for Democracy, to a major electoral victory in 2015. Although she was barred from the presidency due to her sons' foreign citizenship, she served as state counsellor. However, her reputation has been marred by criticism over her handling of the Rohingya crisis, with some arguing that her power was limited by the military’s control.","The Nobel Prizes honour significant contributions in six fields: literature, peace, economics, chemistry, physics, and medicine.

Her predictions span a broad spectrum, addressing both imminent conflicts and the far-reaching future of humanity. While some may dismiss her predictions, others find them intriguing and worthy of discussion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112198636,imgsize-31798,width-400,resizemode-4/112198636.jpg"
"In a win for Mexico, US will expand areas for migrants to apply online for entry at southern border",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-a-win-for-mexico-us-will-expand-areas-for-migrants-to-apply-online-for-entry-at-southern-border/articleshow/112257150.cms,"MEXICO CITY: The Biden administration will expand areas where migrants can apply online for appointments to enter the United States to a large swath of southern Mexico, officials said Saturday, potentially easing strains on the Mexican government and lessening dangers for people trying to reach the US border to claim asylum .Migrants will be able to schedule appointments on the CBP One app from the states of Chiapas and Tabasco , extending the zone from northern and central Mexico, US Customs and Border Protection said.The move satisfies a request of Mexico, an increasingly close partner of the US in efforts to control extraordinary migration flows.The change will spare migrants from traveling north through Mexico to get one of 1,450 appointments made available daily, CBP said. The agency said it will happen soon but did not give a date.""We consistently engage with our partners in the Government of Mexico and work together to adjust policies and practices in response to the latest migration trends and security needs,"" CBP said in a statement.The statement confirmed remarks a day earlier by Mexico's foreign affairs secretary Alicia Barcena , who said closer relations with the United States cut migration sharply from late last year.US officials have said increased Mexican enforcement is largely responsible for a sharp drop in US arrests for illegal border crossings during the first half of this year. Mexican officials have stepped up their presence at highway checkpoints and on railroads leading to the US border, returning most to southern Mexico.In June, the US temporarily suspended asylum processing for those who enter the country illegally, making CBP One of the only avenues for migrants to enter the US to seek asylum and further driving down illegal entries. US officials said arrests for illegal crossings plunged 30% in July from the previous month to the lowest level of Joe Biden 's presidency and the lowest since September 2020.""We have managed to decompress our (northern) border in a very meaningful way and that has helped ... our relationship with the United States be very, very dynamic and very positive,"" Barcena said Friday.More than 680,000 people scheduled CBP One appointments at eight Mexican land crossings with the US from its introduction in January 2023 through June. The top nationalities are Venezuelan, Cuban and Haitian. US authorities recently limited slots for Mexicans due to the high number of applicants from the country.The perils of traveling through Mexico to be kidnapped or robbed has prompted many migrants to fly to northern border cities like Tijuana for their CBP One appointments once they reach the southernmost point from which they can apply until now, Mexico City.Migrants generally enter Mexico in Chiapas or Tabasco from Guatemala. Mexico City may offer more job opportunities and relative safety but the cost of living is higher, prompting some to live in informal camps in the nation's capital.","Migrants will be able to schedule appointments on the CBP One app from the states of Chiapas and Tabasco.
