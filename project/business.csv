"We have EdTech, but is it the right one?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-have-edtech-but-is-it-the-right-one/articleshow/124009353.cms,"To prepare for the future, investing in human capital is key, and early childhood education can offer the highest returns. Betting on this, non- profits across India are decentralising education using tech & innovation

The writer is founder-CEO of The Convergence Foundation, and founder chairperson of Central Square Foundation

Indian children born today will enter the workforce as young adults by 2047. At this point, India has largely won the battle for universal school enrolment. The one that beckons is universal school learning — imparting highquality education that will create opportunity for all and provide the human capital for a developed India by 2047.Economics Nobel Laureate James Heckman’s work on human capital emphasises the high return on investment in early childhood education (ECE), as early interventions enhance cognitive and non-cognitive skills critical to long-term success. The well-known Heckman curve shows that for all stages of education, the highest economic returns come from the earliest investments in children. To raise the collective intelligence of the nation there is a strong case for investing heavily in ECE, raising its share of the Samagra Shiksha budget to 5% (up from around 2% currently).The ubiquity of smartphones in India today — a recent survey reported a smartphone ownership of 1.5 per household in urban India and 1.3 in rural India — offers a never-before-seen opportunity to rapidly scale up high-quality educational inputs to children across the country regardless of their socio-economic status.This is a simple idea with great power. Educational non-profits have begun work on precisely this, and these efforts will only expand in future.For instance, Rocket Learning, a non-profit launched in 2020, has developed interactive and highly engaging educational content that can be delivered over WhatsApp to teachers, parents and children. Every day on these micro-WhatsApp groups, it sends low-income teachers and parents contextualised content in the local language that they can use for play-based activities with children in the classroom or at home. These activities take less than 20 minutes and involve readily available materials.Research shows that greater parental involvement in children’s education leads to improved academic performance. That sense of participation is reinforced by encouraging parents and educators to share images and videos back to the WhatsApp groups, creating a sense of a shared learning community.Chimple is an android app developed in India, that uses games to instil foundational literacy and numeracy through a teacher-directed, at-home learning model. Using the app, a teacher can remotely assign content for children to practise, based on the teaching plan for the week. In a pilot study involving Class 1 and 2 students in Haryana, the treatment group saw a 50% improvement in test scores over the year with 10 minutes of usage of Chimple in a day. Similar improvements were recorded in English as well, and the low performing learners at the baseline benefited even more.Going up to higher grades of schooling, new learning opportunities can be reinforced by generative AI — a powerful use case for which is Personalised Adaptive Learning (PAL). Instead of the rigid, one-size-fits-all mode of learning that conventional classrooms offer, students can learn at their own pace and in their own space with PAL — making engaging, immersive and interactive learning available at even the remotest of locales. If children of the elite have an edge because they have access to individual high-quality coaches to quickly resolve their problems, such access can be universalised with the help of PAL.Educational non-profit Central Square Foundation (CSF) is working with Khan Academy to contextualise Khanmigo, India’s AI-powered personal tutor for low-income contexts. State govts are beginning to leverage PAL for their school systems. Andhra Pradesh has been a pioneer here as it has made PAL part of its World Bank-aided Supporting Andhra’s Learning Transformation (SALT) programme. Use of PAL to heal educational divides can only grow in future.PAL, however, is not the only AI use case in education. AI can generate the learning content itself — scripts, rhymes, worksheets and illustrations are created using LLMs, saving time and boosting creativity. AI can translate and dub across languages, simplify animation and personalise audio with voice cloning. AI can also drive data analysis at the back-end, using incoming messages to draw nuanced insights into how well specific educational programmes are working.CSF has entered into partnerships to build an AI-powered Teacher Coach for govt school teachers, which can provide actionable feedback to teachers and identify effective levers for measurable improvements in classroom practice. AI tools can also grade large volumes of student work, reducing five minutes of paper checking time to 20 seconds. They can provide nuanced understanding of a student’s performance and actionable insights based on it, thus reducing teachers’ workload and enabling them to engage more students.India’s EdTech sector is already large and bound to grow further. But what parts of it are relevant and useful, and go from being a handmaiden for the rich to being universally enabling? In order to evaluate the many available EdTech solutions, CSF has developed — jointly with IIT Bombay and IIT Delhi — an evaluation index that enables govts and other users to make quality-led, evidence-informed choices regarding EdTech procurement for schools, especially those catering to low-income students.The index is called EdTech Tulna, and helps define quality standards for what good EdTech looks like. It creates exhaustive tool-kits and training for decision-makers to apply these standards to evaluate EdTech products, and publishes reviews of products to drive demand and shape supply.Apart from EdTech innovations, there are innovations at the level of school governance and regulation that can dramatically uplift quality. At present, regulation of schools is heavily input-focused. This priority must now shift to measurement of outcomes, which should be reported transparently, publicly and regularly. Such data will allow parents to choose the best school for their children and vote with their feet, building pressure to improve school quality. It will also allow the best schools to emerge as exemplars whose best practices can be replicated at others too.Other countries have followed this transparency model to effectively improve school quality — including the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted, UK), Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA, Dubai) and Sistema de Medición de la Calidad de la Educación (SIMCE, Chile).The National Education Policy (NEP 2020) talks about a school regulator called the State School Standards Authority (SSSA) to set standards and publicise the level of each school in the state, based on those standards. To be effective, SSSAs need to function independently of the department of education and other govt bodies, and assess the quality of all schools — whether public or private — impartially. As NEP 2020 recommends, they should shift regulation from being overly restrictive (especially for private schools) to being “light but tight”. SSSAs should regularly report on the quality of schools and put these out in the public domain.Every child in India deserves a chance to reach their full potential. With new technologies as well as enabling reforms, we will be well on our way towards fulfilling that dream.","Indian children born today will enter the workforce as young adults by 2047.

Kept inside airport for five days, taken to emergency room

'We are lost,' says Paramjit's brother





Paramjit Singh, an Indian who immigrated to the United States more than 30 years ago, has been detained by the ICE and kept in custody for over a month now. Paramjit is a green card holder and has been doing business in Fort Wayne, Indiana, for the last three decades. He was detained at Chicago O'Hare Airport on July 30 as he was returning from a trip to India, as he makes trips to India several times a year.Singh's attorney Luis Angeles toldthat his detention was absolutely illegal and that the government is increasing his health risks as Singh has a brain tumor and heart issues.But why was Singh arrested in the first place? His attorney and family members said that the government cited an incident from the past when Singh used a pay phone without paying. It was a ""minor infraction for which he has already taken full accountability, served his time, and paid his debt to society,"" Angeles said.Also read: EB-5 investment visa cap reached for 2025, green card route paused till September 30 Narrating the harrowing details of what happened since Singh was detained, his family members revealed that he was kept inside the airport for five days.

His family was not notified about his health and they only came to know when the ER bill was sent to them.""As a lawful permanent resident (green card holder), Mr Singh should never have been detained in the first place, as he has always followed the rules to the letter. We often hear the mantra of ""follow the rules"" to achieve legal status in this country. Well, that's exactly what he did: he entered the United States lawfully, adjusted his status properly, built his American dream through hard work, and has been a significant contributor to his community,"" his attorney said.Paramjit’s brother Charanjit Singh told WPTA that they were trying to post the bond after he won the bond hearing, but alleged that the DHS was using delaying tactics to keep him in detention.

JAMMU: A special NIA court in Jammu has extended by 45 days the custodial remand of two accused arrested on charges of harbouring Pakistani terrorists involved in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.Special judge Sandeep Gandotra on Thursday extended the remand of Pahalgam locals Bashir Ahmad Jothat and Parvaiz Ahmad, who hail from Baisaran and Batkote, respectively, beyond the stipulated 90-day period to allow the NIA more time to complete its probe into the massacre of 26 people, after public prosecutor Chandan Kumar Singh submitted that the investigation was at a crucial stage, and several witness statements yet to be recorded.The investigating agency also stated that crucial evidence was still awaited, including analysis of mobile phone data linked to Pakistani numbers, forensic reports from CFSL Chandigarh and NFSU Gandhinagar, and DNA profiling of seized blankets, shawls and bedsheets to establish links with the slain terrorists. Arms and ammunition recovered in a July 28 encounter were also under forensic analysis, the prosecution said.The two accused were arrested on June 22, and have been in judicial custody at Amphalla district jail in Jammu. Their 90-day remand was set to expire on Sept 19.Opposing NIA’s application for extension of remand, defence counsel Ashwani Kumar countered that the accused had already been in custody for two months without conclusive evidence, and the agency had failed to complete investigation within the time granted.Rejecting the defence plea, the court noted that the allegations were grave and directly linked to national security, and granted 45 days’ extension while directing the investigating officer to complete the probe expeditiously.In another case, the same court dismissed the bail application of Tanveer Ahmed Wani, former chief of the LoC Traders Association, who is accused of channelising funds from Pakistan to strengthen the network of the Hizbul Mujahideen.Wani, a resident of Pulwama, was arrested in Feb 2020. According to the NIA, he had strong links with Pakistan-based Hizbul leadership and personally handed over cash to terrorists. He also facilitated meetings and maintained an over-ground worker network to route money for terror activities.After hearing the prosecution and the petitioner’s counsel, judge Gandotra noted that the accusations were serious and directly linked to national security. The gravity of charges under IPC and UAPA barred bail at this stage, he ruled.","Bashir Ahmad Jothat and Parvaiz Ahmad are accused of harbouring Pakistani terrorists involved in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.

He sought liberty to withdraw the civil revision, with the right to revive it if a compromise application is not filed before trial court within 90 days. The request was not opposed by counsels representing Jyotiraditya Scindia and other respondents.The dispute stems from a 2010 suit filed by the three aunts seeking their share in the family's vast fortune.They argued that daughters have equal rights in their father's property under succession laws. Jyotiraditya Scindia later filed a counter-suit. Both matters have been pending in various courts, with the civil revision reaching the high court in 2017.","The decades-old property dispute within the Scindia royal family has inched closer to resolution.

Pakistan's 'Lies' Shredded By Own; Lashkar Man Reveals Muridke Bombing 'Truth' I Details

Elimination of nine terror infrastructure in Pakistan during Operation Sindoor has led major Pakistan-sponsored terrorist groups, particularly Jaish-e-Muhammed and Hizbul Mujahideen, to move deep inside Pakistan, closer to the Afghanistan border. The intelligence establishment has received credible visual confirmation that the two outfits are shifting their bases to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK).JeM has been aggressively expanding its training facility - Markaz Shohada-e-Islam - at Mansehra in the Khyber region. Photographs have confirmed construction activity and an increase in logistical inflows at the site.On the other hand, Hizb, under the command of ex-SSG commando Khalid Khan, is constructing a new training facility named ""HM-313"" in Bandai, KPK. While the land was purchased in Aug 2024, construction there started only in mid-May. Boundary walls and initial training infrastructure have been completed, photographs show. The ""313"" nomenclature is a symbolic tribute to the Badr Ghazwa (a historic Islamic battle) and al-Qaida 's Brigade 313, reflecting Hizb's intent to attract global jihadi legitimacy.On Sept 25, JeM is planning a recruitment drive in Peshawar's Markaz Shaheed Maksudabad to commemorate Yusuf Azhar - Masood Azhar's brother who was killed in Operation Sindoor. It is there that a new alias for the outfit - al-Murabitun (defenders of land of Islam) similar to an al-Qaida group of Western Africa - will be announced.The decision to relocate reflects a significant tactical adaptation by the groups, which now view traditional locations as vulnerable to Indian precision strikes.KPK offers greater depth due to its geography, proximity to Afghan frontier, and existing jihadi safe havens dating back to the Afghan war, an intelligence note reads. This movement is being conducted with full knowledge and direct facilitation of Pakistan's state structures, as evidenced by overt JeM gatherings held under police protection and the tacit involvement of political-religious outfits like Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), the note added.KPK is now being repositioned as a rear command zone for JeM, while PoK continues to serve as a forward operating platform for infiltration.The intelligence establishment has flagged the Jaish-led event at Garhi Habibullah in Mansehra, where a public recruitment drive kicked off barely seven hours before the start of the India-Pakistan cricket match on Sept 14. The event, ostensibly organised as part of a Deobandi religious gathering, was in fact a coordinated mobilisation effort led jointly by JeM and JUI in the presence of Mulana Mufti Masood Ilyas Kashmiri alias Abu Mohammad, JeM's chief for KPK and Kashmir.""His presence at a public rally guarded by both JeM cadre armed with M4 rifles and local police officers, including inspector Liaqat Shah of Garhi Habibullah police station, reflects both state complicity and the boldness of JeM's revivalist strategy,"" an intelligence officer said. For over 30 minutes, Kashmiri glorified Osama bin Laden, calling him the Shohada-e-Islam and ""Prince of Arab"", directly linking JeM's ideological line with al-Qaida's legacy.","Hizbul Mujahideen is building a new facility named ‘HM-313’ in Bandai, KPK, photographs show.

Dehradun On Red Alert As Heavy Rainfall Triggers Cloudburst, Tamsa River Swells Up

NEW DELHI: Reckless development activities may well have exacerbated weather-related devastation in north India this monsoon, but the sheer amount of rain the region received almost without a break was unprecedented in recent decades. Total rainfall across north India since June 1 crossed 740mm on Friday, making it the wettest monsoon in the region in 37 years, and the third wettest since 1950.Uncharacteristically for north India, it rained without a major break through the season. It's for the first time since 1978 that all four monsoon months - June to Sept - saw surplus rainfall in the region. Only on three other years, including 1978, have these four months receive above-normal rainfall in north India, as per IMD records since 1950.While the region recorded 42.2% more-than-normal rain in June, mainly on account of bountiful pre-monsoon showers, the surplus was 13.2% in July, 34.4% in Aug and 62.3% so far this month (till Sept 19).Overall, 741.4mm of rain has been recorded across north India since June 1 against a normal of 563.6mm, which translates to a surplus of 31.5%. This is the highest monsoon rainfall in the region since 1988, when 813.5mm was logged.","Total rainfall across north India since June 1 crossed 740mm on Friday.

In April 2016, he was granted divorce by an Australian court.As a classic example of misuse of IPC Section 498A by women, flagged many a time by the Supreme Court , Tina in May 2016 lodged a complaint with SSP, SAS Nagar, alleging dowry demands and physical and mental torture. Nitin moved Punjab and Haryana HC seeking quashing of the FIR, but his plea was rejected. He moved SC, which in Dec 2017 stayed proceedings on the FIR.Nearly a decade after the FIR was lodged, a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Prashant Kumar Mishra has quashed the FIR and criticised the woman's conduct.Writing the judgment and regretting the failure of mediation attempts between the parties, Justice Karol said, ""We are disappointed in the lack of foresight shown by both parties, particularly when it comes to the well-acknowledged ill-effects of continued, strained and hostile relationship between the parents on a young child."" ""In this case, the child was born in Sept 2012, and the parents have been in litigation from the time when she was not even a year old to the day this judgment is delivered,"" he said.Tina's counsel argued that as India was not a signatory to The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, 1980, the decree passed by the courts in Austria need not be considered by the SC.The bench took note that Tina had filed the FIR a month after the Australian court granted divorce on Nitin's petition as the couple were separated for three years. It said the FIR appears to be a counterblast as Nitin had two orders in his favour -- courts in Austria ordering Tina to bring the child back to Australia and the other by the courts in Australia accepting Nitin's plea for divorce.SC said although Tina argued before Austrian courts better education facilities were the reason she shifted her daughter to Austria from Australia, it was found she had been living in India in the past years and did not comply with directive to return the daughter to Australia. Assessing that FIR painted a picture that was far from truth, SC said period of dowry and cruelty allegation period noted in FIR was beyond date of divorce granted by the Australian court.","An Indian-origin Austrian citizen, Tina Khanna, separated from her husband Nitin Ahluwalia, an Australian citizen.

Kapoor directed Yes Bank to invest in ADA Group companies despite warnings, and funds were allegedly siphoned out.

MUMBAI: The CBI Thursday filed a chargesheet against Anil Ambani, chairman of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, along with Rana Kapoor, co-founder of Yes Bank, and the latter's wife, Bindu, and daughters, Radha Kapoor & Roshni, for fraudulent loan transactions that resulted in a loss of Rs 2,797 crore to the bank.The chargesheet says the bank under Kapoor's directions invested in debentures and commercial debt paper issued by ADA's commercial finance (RCFL) and home finance (RHFL) companies despite a credit ratings agency placing them ""under watch"" for poor performance. It says the funds were subsequently siphoned out and, in a ""quid pro quo"", the Yes Bank promoter's family-run firms received massive loans from ADA companies.CBI has previously investigated several others for defrauding Yes Bank, including DHFL's erstwhile promoters Kapil Wadhawan and his brother Dheeraj Wadhawan.In a press release issued on Thursday, the CBI said it had filed a chargesheet pertaining to two cases related to fraudulent transactions between Anil Ambani's group companies, Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd (RCFL) and Reliance Home Finance Limited (RHFL), and Rana Kapoor, his wife Bindu Kapoor, and their daughters Radha Kapoor and Roshni Kapoor and companies owned by them.The chargesheet named Anil Ambani, Rana Kapoor, Bindu Kapoor, Radha Kapoor, Roshni Kapoor, RCFL, RHFL (now Authum Investment & Infrastructure Ltd), RAB Enterprises Pvt Ltd, Imagine Estate Pvt Ltd, Bliss House Pvt Ltd, Imagine Habitat Pvt Ltd, Imagine Residence Pvt Ltd, and Morgan Credits Pvt Ltd. The chief vigilance officer of Yes Bank had lodged complaints with the CBI in 2022 against the Anil Ambani-led companies and Rana Kapoor.According to the CBI, Yes Bank invested approximately Rs 2,045 crore in non-convertible debentures and commercial debt paper issued by RCFL and Rs 2,965 crore in non-convertible debentures and commercial papers of RHFL. These investments were made with the approval of Kapoor, despite Care Ratings placing ADA Group's financial companies ""under watch"" due to deteriorating financial standing and adverse market assessment. The CBI said Anil Ambani was the chairman of ADA Group and also served as a director of Reliance Capital Ltd, the holding company of RCFL and RHFL.The CBI stated that ""funds invested in RCFL and RHFL by Yes Bank were subsequently siphoned through multiple layers, demonstrating a systematic diversion of public money."" The investigation revealed a ""conspiracy between Rana Kapoor and Anil Ambani"" and that ""as quid pro quo, Anil Ambani, the then Chairman of ADA Group, obtained credit facilities from RCFL and RHFL at concessional rates for Rana Kapoor's loss-making family entities, i.e. , companies owned by Bindu Kapoor, Radha Kapoor and Roshni Kapoor.""The CBI further stated that the ""fraudulent arrangement resulted in a massive wrongful loss to Yes Bank amounting to Rs 2,797 crore and corresponding unlawful gain to RCFL, RHFL and other companies of ADA Group, as well as companies owned by Rana Kapoor's family members.""Additionally, Reliance Nippon Mutual Funds (RNMF), another subsidiary of Reliance Capital Ltd, on instructions from Anil Ambani, invested Rs 1,160 crore during 2017-18 in non-convertible debentures of Morgan Credits Pvt Ltd, an entity owned by Rana Kapoor's family.","CBI files chargesheet against Anil Ambani, Rana Kapoor, and Kapoor's family for fraudulent loan transactions.

ESPN planned a transition before Molly Qerim’s contract expired

Salary expectations and ESPN’s financial focus played a key role

Molly Qerim’s sudden exit from ESPN’s First Take left many fans surprised, given her strong presence and years of consistency as co-host alongside Stephen A. Smith. But new details have shed light on the decision, showing that it was less about controversy and more about timing, business priorities, and financial realities at the network.Burke Magnus, ESPN’s head of content, recently addressed the matter, clarifying that Qerim’s contract was already set to expire by the end of the year. According to him, the company had long been considering a shift. “She was going to come off First Take either way and that was something [where] we had already crossed that bridge,” Magnus explained.He emphasized that the network wanted to expand Qerim’s versatility by getting her involved in other projects, rather than tying her exclusively to one show. Importantly, he praised her character and work ethic, stating, “She’s an awesome person,” while noting, “You know, it’s business.”Behind the scenes, salary dynamics also influenced the decision. With Stephen A. Smith recently signing a $105 million deal averaging $21 million per year, ESPN executives were reluctant to commit major dollars to Qerim’s role. While respected, her co-hosting duties were seen as replaceable by someone who could perform the same function at a lower cost.Reports indicate ESPN is now preparing for a 30- to 45-day casting process to find Qerim’s successor, though no replacement names have been officially revealed.Also Read: ""Early next year"": Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s wedding could arrive sooner than fans expecte For loyal viewers, Qerim’s departure marks the end of an era. She provided balance and professionalism on a show often dominated by fiery debates, helping cement First Take as a staple of morning sports programming. For ESPN, however, the move reflects the constant adjustments networks make to stay competitive in a shifting media landscape.","Molly Qerim's sudden exit from ESPN’s First Take left many fans surprised, given her strong presence and years of consistency.

Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’



New Yorkers too busy to notice Richard Branson with a mic



Billionaire’s rejections spark laughter and praise online

British billionaire Richard Branson, best known as the adventurous founder of the Virgin Group, recently experienced an unusual moment on the bustling streets of New York City. While promoting his latest initiative, Doorbell of Dreams, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews, only to be repeatedly ignored. Despite his global fame and media presence, New Yorkers brushed past him as though he were just another man with a microphone or a street performer. The incident, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly went viral on Instagram, sparking amusement, admiration, and lighthearted commentary online. What began as a fun campaign to encourage everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas turned into an unexpected lesson in humility, showing that even billionaires are not immune to everyday rejection.During a lighthearted promotional event, Branson attempted to stop pedestrians for quick interviews. Despite his global reputation, most passersby ignored him, hurrying along as though he were just another stranger with a microphone.The unusual moment, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly gained traction on Instagram, showing the tycoon facing rejection after rejection.This unexpected moment wasn’t just a publicity stunt; it was part of a campaign to promote “Doorbell of Dreams.” The initiative, launched by Branson in partnership with Squibb’s startup HelpBnk, invites everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas in under 60 seconds.What makes the concept unique is its accessibility. Through a specially designed video doorbell, aspiring entrepreneurs can present their ideas, with the hope of receiving mentorship, guidance, or even investment. Originally launched in the UK, the project recently expanded to New York, where Virgin Hotels partnered as a venue for participants. The street interviews were meant to spark curiosity among locals and draw attention to the campaign.The video shows Branson politely approaching strangers with the question, “Can I ask you a question?” But instead of engaging, people brushed him off. One woman walked by without so much as a glance, while another looked briefly at him before rushing away, clearly preoccupied with her own thoughts and errands.For a man who has conquered industries from airlines to space travel, being ignored on the sidewalk was a rare and humbling experience. Squibb, amused by the scene, remarked, “A bit of rejection is healthy.” Branson laughed at himself and replied, “I’m not doing too well, am I?” Eventually, a passerby did agree to share his dream, stating his goal was to achieve financial independence, help others, and contribute positively to the world in meaningful ways.Once uploaded, the clip drew widespread attention on social media. Many users were stunned that a man of Branson’s stature could blend so seamlessly into the crowd. One viewer commented, “Richard Branson getting rejected? Unbelievable!” Another wrote, “Imagine ignoring one of the world’s most inspirational entrepreneurs who’s just asking you a simple question.”The rejections, however, were not seen as embarrassing but rather refreshing. Viewers praised Branson’s good-natured attitude and willingness to step into unfamiliar situations despite his status. A popular comment read, “This is what humility looks like. Sir Richard Branson has every reason to stay in his comfort zone, but he still pushes himself.”","Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’ While promoting his latest initiative, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews.

Big change for H-1Bs: Donald Trump signs proclamation imposing $100k annual fee on visa application; aim to protect US tech jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/big-change-for-h-1bs-donald-trump-signs-order-to-increase-visa-application-fee-to-100000-aim-to-protect-us-tech-jobs/articleshow/124006406.cms,"Trump sings order to increase H1-B visa application fees

Donald Trump’s $100K H-1B Visa Fee Shocker Sparks Fears Among Indian Tech Workers And US Firms

Significance of the new rule





US President Donald Trump has signed a new proclamation on Friday (US time) introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications, along with other changes to the skilled foreign worker programme, which has been under scrutiny for years.Originally designed to attract exceptional foreign talent for specialised technical roles, the H-1B programme has evolved into a channel for workers accepting salaries around $60,000 annually—well below the $100,000-plus compensation typical for American technology professionals, according to AP reports.""I think they're going to be very happy,"" Trump said, anticipating the tech industry’s response to the changes.Additionally, White House staff secretary Will Scharf said, ""One of the most abused visa systems is the H1-B non-immigrant visa programme. This is supposed to allow highly skilled labourers who work in fields that Americans don't work in to come into the United States of America. What this proclamation will do is raise the fee that companies pay to sponsor H-1B applicants to $100,000. This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers.It is noteworthy that First Lady Melania Trump, formerly Melania Knauss, received an H-1B visa in October 1996 for modelling work; she hails from Slovenia.Established in 1990, the H-1B programme targets individuals with bachelor's degrees or higher in difficult-to-fill positions, particularly in STEM fields. Critics argue the system enables lower wages and limited worker protections. The annual quota of 85,000 visas has traditionally been distributed through a lottery.Lottery applications fell nearly 40 per cent in 2024, following measures to prevent multiple entries that skewed selection odds. Major tech companies had requested reforms after surging applications reduced individual chances, prompting USCIS (US Citizenship and Immigration Services) to limit candidates to a single lottery entry, regardless of multiple job offers.Amazon currently leads in approvals with over 10,000, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple, and Google, with California hosting the largest H-1B workforce.Detractors note that many H-1B positions are junior-level roles rather than senior specialist jobs. Companies can reportedly reduce costs by classifying roles at lower skill levels while employing experienced workers. This has led to outsourcing of basic technical operations to consultancies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Tata, IBM, and Cognizant, which employ foreign workers—mostly from India—contracted to American firms seeking cost savings.While critics welcome these changes, they are calling for further reforms. The AFL-CIO said the measures are ""some steps in the right direction"" but advocated for visas to be allocated based on highest wage offers rather than random selection—a proposal previously floated during Trump’s first term.The increased fees could affect hiring foreign workers as it'll cost more for companies. Currently, companies pay $215 to register for the lottery and $780 for a Form I-129, the employer-sponsored petition for a non-immigrant worker.The move is expected to discourage mass applications for H-1B visas, particularly affecting startups and small businesses that may struggle to absorb the higher upfront cost. Companies hiring foreign workers will now face significantly higher expenses, potentially shifting focus back to American tech workers.The change also aims to curb abuse of the H-1B system, where companies hire foreigners at lower wages for entry-level roles, while paying Americans significantly more for the same jobs. With the $100,000 fee, hiring foreign talent becomes equally costly, likely reducing opportunities for H-1B-dependent workers.The overhaul comes amid discussions to reform or end the lottery system and raise wage requirements, prioritizing high-wage, high-skill foreign workers and opening more entry-level jobs for US graduates. The administration’s broader goal is to protect American employment in the technology sector.","US President Donald Trump has signed a new proclamation introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications.

0% returns: Why Sensex has been flat for over a year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-the-sensex-is-flat-over-a-year/articleshow/124004747.cms,"Representative image

Earnings-valuation mismatch

Foreign investor flight

What next?





MUMBAI: The sensex has delivered 0% returns over the past 12 months, underperforming most global markets, despite several positive factors like I-T and GST relief, interest rate cuts and steady domestic fund flows.What explains this weak performance? According to analysts, weak fundamentals are a major drag on Dalal Street’s gains.“The weak performance of the Indian market over the past year may seem surprising, given the euphoria among retail investors, several narratives that drove certain sectors and themes periodically, large fiscal and monetary support, and weak rupee (positive for earnings). However, it is less surprising when viewed against earnings and valuations,” a report by Kotak Institutional Equities said.The broader market has performed worse than the 30-share sensex over a year. BSE’s midcap and smallcap indices are both down more than 4% over the past 12 months.According to the report, valuations have remained elevated despite several stocks being flat or down over this period due to constant earnings downgrades.“Corporate earnings have been lacklustre with Nifty 50 companies delivering 8% growth, below market expectations, as delayed urban demand recovery and persistent input cost inflation weighed on performance,” Devarsh Vakil, head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, said.How did valuations surge in the first place? The post-Covid pent-up consumption demand is partly to blame. “The growth rate in earnings shot up between 2022-24. This led to markets commanding higher valuation premiums,” said Siddarth Bhamre, institutional research head at Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates.The broader market has performed worse than the 30-share sensex over a year. BSE’s midcap and smallcap indices are both down more than 4% over the past 12 months.Trade tensions with the US have created policy uncertainty — this, in turn, has heightened foreign investor caution and accelerated portfolio shifts toward cheaper emerging markets, Vakil said.While foreign funds (FPIs) have pulled out around $20 billion in 2025, domestic institutional investors have pumped in around $62 billion in the same period. However, this hasn’t led to sizable year-to-date gains — the sensex is up 5.5% year-to-date. The underperformance “disproves the market’s belief in ‘flows’ as a driver” of Dalal Street, the Kotak report said.To be sure, the steady mutual fund flows have cushioned the impact from FPI selling. “Without mutual fund flows, FPI selling would have had a large negative impact on the markets,” Bhamre said.According to market players, such flat growth periods are opportunities for long-term mutual fund investors to accumulate units in their portfolios. While mutual fund industry body data showed that equity MF flows saw a sharp decline, the drop in SIP flows was modest. “Healthy SIP inflows reflect the confidence that retail investors have in the markets,” Ankur Punj, MD & business head at Equirus Wealth, said.According to Vakil, the return of foreign investors and a recovery in earnings will lift Dalal Street sentiment. “A mutually acceptable resolution to US trade negotiations would eliminate policy uncertainty and restore FPI confidence. Stronger Q2 earnings would signal economic recovery and drive stock-specific rallies. Global interest rate easing will also make India more attractive to yield-seeking investors, potentially triggering renewed capital inflows,” he said.Capital expenditure announcements by govt and the private sector will be a bigger trigger for the revival of the consumption cycle, which will eventually lead to earnings recovery, Bhamre said. “Reduction of interest rates and taxes are supportive factors but not a deciding variable in decision making to spend,” he said.Analysts at Kotak expect a gradual earnings improvement over the next few quarters and strong earnings growth in FY27. “However, valuations are rich, despite our strong expected earnings recovery,” the report cautioned.",The broader market has performed worse than the 30-share sensex over a year. BSE’s midcap and smallcap indices are both down more than 4% over the past 12 months. The post-Covid pent-up consumption demand is partly to blame.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124006393,imgsize-1292298,width-400,resizemode-4/article-70.jpg"

Intel's $20 billion mistake now becomes survival strategy

XElectron Techno Review: Turn Any Wall Into a 200-Inch Screen





Twenty years after Intel rejected buying Nvidia for $20 billion, the roles have completely flipped: Nvidia is investing $5 billion in its struggling former takeover target and rescue Intel through a strategic chip partnership. The deal announced Thursday sees Nvidia purchasing Intel stock at $23.28 per share—a 6.5% discount—while the companies collaborate on PC and data center processors. Intel will embed Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics into consumer chips and manufacture specialized processors for Nvidia's AI systems.The partnership crystallises one of tech's most dramatic power shifts. Intel, once Silicon Valley's undisputed chip king with double Nvidia's revenue as recently as 2022, now has a market value under $100 billion. Nvidia has exploded to over $4 trillion, making it the world's second-most valuable company.Back in 2005, then-Intel CEO Paul Otellini pitched acquiring Nvidia to his board, recognizing that graphics chips might revolutionise data centers. Directors balked at the unprecedented price tag and Intel's poor acquisition track record, instead backing an internal project called Larrabee that burned hundreds of millions before collapsing in 2009.Nvidia seized the moment Intel missed. While Intel clung to traditional processors, Nvidia anticipated the AI revolution, developing specialised chips perfect for machine learning before ChatGPT made headlines. When tech giants raced to build AI infrastructure, they turned to Nvidia's ready-made solutions.Today, Nvidia approaches $200 billion in annual revenue—soon earning more each quarter than Intel generates yearly. Its data center business alone dwarfs entire chip companies.Intel has desperately chased the AI wave through acquisitions like Nervana Systems ($400 million) and Habana Labs ($2 billion), but gained little ground against Nvidia's dominance. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who replaced the ousted Pat Gelsinger this year, admits Intel won't compete with Nvidia's high-end systems ""anytime soon.""The Nvidia partnership represents pragmatic surrender disguised as collaboration. Intel acknowledges it needs the company it once could have owned to remain relevant in computing's AI-driven future.""This historic collaboration tightly couples Nvidia's AI stack with Intel's x86 ecosystem,"" said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, diplomatic language for Intel's dependence on its former potential acquisition target.The investment follows recent lifelines, including government backing and SoftBank's $2 billion injection as Intel struggles to fund its manufacturing ambitions.Intel shares jumped 22% after Nvidia announced $5 billion investment in the chipmaker.",Intel rejected a $20 billion bid for Nvidia in 2005.

"Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison have one thing in common: All were adopted – the unknown lives of billionaires",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steve-jobs-jeff-bezos-and-larry-ellison-have-one-thing-in-common-all-were-adopted-the-unknown-lives-of-billionaires/articleshow/123967862.cms,"Steve Jobs: Parents who adopted him nurtured his creativity



Jeff Bezos: From Jeffrey Jorgensen to Amazon founder

Larry Ellison: Adopted by his aunt and uncle, shaping a self-reliant tech titan



Dave Thomas: Overcoming early hardships to create Wendy’s





The world’s most successful entrepreneurs often captivate us with their business acumen, vision, and relentless drive, but there’s one factor in the early lives of Steve Jobs Jeff Bezos , and Larry Ellison that many people overlook: they were all adopted. Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon , and Larry Ellison, the Oracle co-founder, each grew up in adoptive families that provided stability, guidance, and emotional support. While adoption is not the sole reason for their extraordinary achievements, it may have shaped their resilience, ambition, creativity, and determination to succeed against the odds. These inspiring stories offer a glimpse into the unknown early lives of billionaires and highlight how early life experiences can influence lifelong success.Steve Jobs was born to Abdulfattah Jandali, a Syrian student pursuing a PhD, and Joanne Schieble, an American Catholic of Swiss-German descent. Because Joanne’s parents opposed the relationship and pregnancy, she opted for a closed adoption. The couple originally selected to adopt Jobs backed out after learning the baby was a boy. He was eventually adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, a working-class couple who promised to save for his college education. Jobs was fiercely loyal to his adoptive parents, viewing them as his true family. Throughout his life, he often referred to his biological parents as “my sperm and egg bank.”The nurturing environment provided by Paul and Clara helped cultivate his creativity, curiosity, and relentless pursuit of innovation, which later defined his career at Apple and Pixar.Born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen, Jeff Bezos experienced early family instability. His teenage mother, Jacklyn, divorced his biological father when Jeff was just 17 months old, leaving her to raise him alone under difficult circumstances. At age four, Jacklyn married Miguel “Mike” Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who adopted Jeff and gave him the surname Bezos. Mike Bezos became a guiding force in Jeff’s life, instilling discipline, a strong work ethic, and a love for learning. Jeff has often credited Mike for providing the stability and support that allowed him to explore his interests in science, technology, and entrepreneurship. The adoption offered him a second chance at a stable family environment, which may have contributed to the resilience and strategic thinking that later fueled the creation of Amazon.Larry Ellison’s early life was marked by health and family challenges. Born in New York City to a 19-year-old single mother, he contracted pneumonia as an infant. His mother made the difficult decision to give him up for adoption, and he was taken in by his mother’s aunt and uncle, Lillian and Louis Ellison, in Chicago. Larry was aware of being adopted but fully grasped the reality at age 12. Lillian provided warmth and nurturing, while Louis was often stern and distant, creating a complex family dynamic. Growing up in modest circumstances on Chicago’s South Side, Ellison developed a sense of independence, ambition, and self-reliance that would later drive his success at Oracle. He only met his biological mother at age 48, which reinforced the sense of self-made achievement that characterizes his public persona.Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy’s, also had an adoption story that shaped his values and vision. Born Rex David Thomas, he was adopted as an infant by Rex and Auleva Thomas in New Jersey. Despite losing his adoptive mother at age five and facing further family losses, he developed resilience and empathy. His early experiences inspired him to advocate for adoption later in life, leading to the creation of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, which helps children in foster care find permanent homes. Dave’s story demonstrates how adoption, combined with love and support, can nurture determination, compassion, and a lifelong commitment to giving back.","Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and Larry Ellison all grew up in adoptive families.

Microsoft announces second Xbox price hike this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-announces-second-xbox-price-hike-this-year/articleshow/124009791.cms,"



Microsoft will increase Xbox Series console prices in the United States starting October 3, marking the second price hike this year as the company blames ""changes in the macroeconomic environment"" — widely interpreted as impacts from tariffs on imported goods.The Xbox Series X will jump $50 to $649.99, while the entry-level Xbox Series S increases $20 to $399.99. The premium 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition faces the steepest increase at $70, bringing its price to $799.99. Digital versions of the consoles will also see price bumps ranging from $20 to $50.These latest increases compound May's price hikes, resulting in dramatic cumulative increases over six months. The standard Xbox Series X has risen $150 from its original $499.99 launch price, while the Galaxy Black Special Edition has jumped $200 in just one year since its debut.The timing follows similar moves by competitors Sony and Nintendo, who raised PlayStation 5 and Switch console prices respectively in recent months. Industry analysts point to President Trump's tariffs on goods manufactured in China, Vietnam, and India as the primary driver behind these widespread price increases across gaming hardware.Microsoft's price adjustments now position some Xbox models unfavorably against competitors.The $599.99 Xbox Series X Digital costs $50 more than Sony's PS5 Digital Edition, while the $799.99 Galaxy Special Edition exceeds the price of Sony's new PS5 Pro at $749.99, despite offering less performance.The company emphasized that controller and headset pricing will remain unchanged, and international markets won't see price adjustments. However, Xbox pricing outside the US had already increased in previous rounds of global price hikes.Consumers looking to avoid the increases have until October 3 to purchase consoles at current prices from retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. With ongoing economic uncertainties and potential for additional tariff impacts, industry experts suggest this may not be the final price adjustment for gaming hardware this year.","Microsoft will increase Xbox Series console prices in the United States starting October 3.

KOLKATA: In the vibrant tapestry of Kolkata's cultural heritage, few symbols resonate as deeply as the yellow Ambassador taxi and the annual Durga Puja celebrations. This year, Ambassador cabs that are on the way to being phased out have been intertwined with Durga Puja in a project titled ""Cholte Cholte 40"" that marks 40 years of an initiative that played a pivotal role in the promotion of themes and transformation of the Durga Puja into veritable citywide art exhbition.The yellow Ambassador taxi, once a ubiquitous presence on Kolkata's bustling streets, has long been a symbol of the city's unique charm. These taxis have ferried countless families, artisans, and visitors through the city's narrow lanes, especially during the festive season of Durga Puja. Recognizing the taxi's cultural significance, the project has transformed these vehicles into moving canvases that encapsulate four decades of Durga Puja artistry.Each taxi in this project is a tribute to a specific decade, with its exterior and interior meticulously designed to reflect the artistic and cultural nuances of that era. The taxis serve as mobile galleries, showcasing the evolution of Durga Puja from a traditional religious festival to a grand celebration of creativity and community spirit. The interiors, adorned with wallpapers, fabrics, and textures, create immersive environments that transport passengers back in time.This initiative by Asian Paints Sharad Shamman that had started in 1985 inspired puja organisers to improve the aesthetics and the manner in which Durga Puja is celebrated. Though there are scores of awards now, organisers still compete for the coveted award. The ""Cholte Cholte 40"" project not only honors the legacy of the yellow taxi but also pays homage to the artisans and communities that have shaped the Durga Puja festival over the years.""This initiative celebrates Kolkata's creative spirit and its enduring relationship with the city. Turning everyday emblems like the yellow taxi into living archives ensures that the stories of Kolkata's creativity continue to inspire and resonate with future generations,"" said Durga Puja theme artist Anirban Das who has won the coveted Sharad Samman multiple times.

The individual becomes inadmissible or violates visa conditions





US President Donald Trump has unveiled the “Trump Gold Card”, a new immigration initiative aimed at wealthy individuals and corporations seeking fast-tracked lawful permanent residency in the United States. The program was signed into effect on Friday, with the aim to generate billions in revenue and reform parts of the current legal immigration system.“It’s going to raise billions of dollars, billions and billions of dollars, which is going to go to reduce taxes, pay off debt and for other good things,” Trump said during the Oval Office announcement.The announcement also marks a significant difference in Trump’s immigration stance - offering high-net-worth individuals a pathway to residency through financial contribution, while simultaneously proposing stricter rules for skilled worker visas like the H-1B.The Trump Gold Card is a visa residency program priced at $1 million for individuals and $2 million for corporations per employee. It promises accelerated processing and lawful permanent residency under existing EB-1 or EB-2 visa categories after vetting.The card itself features a gold background with Trump’s portrait, the Statue of Liberty, and the American flag, marked with “Trump Gold Card” on the left.“It is beyond time that the American People, and American Taxpayers, are benefitting from our LEGAL Immigration System,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Individuals interested in obtaining US residency through the Trump Gold Card program must follow these key steps, as per gold card site:Pay the nonrefundable Processing FeeBegin your application by visiting the official website - trumpcard.gov.You’ll be required to pay a nonrefundable processing fee, which initiates the application process.Submit supporting documentsAfter the fee is paid, applicants must submit additional documents as requested. These may include personal identification, financial records, and other materials needed for background checks and eligibility verification.Undergo immigration vettingUS citizenship and immigration services (USCIS) and the department of homeland security (DHS) will conduct a thorough background check and vetting process to assess the applicant’s profile and intent.Make the $1 Million financial giftIf the application is approved, the individual must then make a $1 million gift to the US government. This contribution is legally considered evidence that the applicant will substantially benefit the United States, a key requirement for residency under this program.: Receive lawful permanent residencyOnce all steps are completed and verified, the applicant will be granted lawful permanent resident status under either the EB-1 or EB-2 visa category, and issued the Trump Gold Card for use across all US states and territories.The Trump Corporate Gold Card allows companies to pay $2 million per employee to obtain US residency. The program includes the flexibility to transfer residency benefits from one employee to another, subject to a transfer fee and fresh vetting.A small annual maintenance fee will also apply, with other vetting and application processes similar to gold cards. Corporations can apply for multiple cards at once.To qualify for the Trump Gold Card, applicants must meet the following key requirements:Additional financial and documentary requirements, such as making a $1 million qualifying gift and providing proof of identity and source of funds, also apply.Only those who meet both the legal and financial criteria will be considered for approval.The Trump administration also plans to introduce a Trump Platinum Card, which will cost $5 million. This version offers up to 270 days of US residency per year, while exempting holders from US taxation on non-US income - a feature aimed at attracting ultra-high-net-worth individuals.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who joined Trump at the White House announcement, projected that the program could raise over $100 billion in the short term.However, immigration experts note that congressional approval may be required for parts of the program to be fully enacted.Despite that, Trump remains optimistic: “The main thing is we’re going to have great people coming in, and they’re going to be paying,” he said.The Trump Gold Card functions as a US visa, and like all visas, it can be revoked under certain conditions.Revocation may occur if:While the program offers fast-tracked residency, it is still subject to standard US immigration enforcement rules and oversight by the department of homeland security.","US President Donald Trump has unveiled the ‘Trump Gold Card’, a new immigration initiative aimed at wealthy individuals and corporations.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public. Musk has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-96413764,imgsize-26192,width-400,resizemode-4/96413764.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Bill Gates on AI-helping cut global child mortality by half: ‘The story’s not over yet’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-on-ai-helping-cut-global-child-mortality-by-half-the-storys-not-over-yet/articleshow/124006392.cms,"""stunning achievement""

""the story's not over yet,""

Read what Bill Gates wrote about global child mortality being reduced by half



“One of humanity’s most stunning achievements is something most people don’t even realise happened.

In 2000, more than 10 million children died before they reached their fifth birthday. Today, it’s less than 5 million. The world cut child mortality in half in just 25 years.

It’s an amazing success story. But the story’s not over yet. In fact, right now, the next chapter is being written as governments around the world set their budgets. And global leaders have a once-in-a-generation chance to do something extraordinary.

Countries around the world have the expertise to solve major health problems—but they need the tools, medicines, and vaccines to make it happen. That’s what global health institutions like the

Global Fund

and Gavi were designed to do: help countries make smarter and more cost-effective decisions.

I believe that opportunity shouldn’t be an accident of birth, and where you live shouldn’t determine if you live. I’ve announced that I’m giving away virtually all my wealth to support this effort over the next 20 years, because this is a critical moment for progress. But the fact remains: we won’t get there without rich countries giving a small fraction of their budgets to help the world’s poorest people and save millions of lives.

That’s where government decisions come in. Of course, budget deliberations are difficult. Many of the countries that have given the most health aid in the past face high debt levels, aging populations, and domestic challenges.

I’m not naive. I don’t expect most governments to suddenly restore foreign aid to historic levels.

But I am an optimist.

Because while things may seem dire right now, two things can be true at once: what’s happening to the health of the world’s children is worse than most people realise, and our long-term prospects are better than most people can imagine.

That’s the paradox of this moment: funding for global health is shrinking. But science is accelerating—and people are determined to make sure innovations reach children who need them, no matter where they happen to be born.

The choices we make today will determine what the world looks like for the next generation. I’m a grandfather now, so this hits even closer to home. I want my grandkids to grow up in a world where kids know what diseases like HIV, polio, and sickle cell anaemia were, but don’t know anyone who has them.

A world where malaria wards are empty—because no child is at risk of the disease.

A world where everyone survives childbirth—and childhood.

That’s the future every child deserves. And we can all play a part in building it.

I’m talking to leaders about how to do more with less. That includes focusing on core lifesaving programs, doubling down on innovations that can eradicate and cure diseases, not just manage them, and laying a pathway out of our outdated, donor-recipient model of global aid toward a sustainable model where countries are self-sufficient.

But none of that can happen if donor countries don’t invest in the health of all people, especially children. Take the Global Fund. It’s probably the most effective lifesaving initiative of the 21st century: since 2002, it’s saved 70 million lives from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.

At the Global Fund replenishment in November, we’ll see just how high of a priority this is for countries. Our foundation will announce our contribution next week, and I’ll be interested to see what governments bring to the table.

Low-income countries can also do more to prioritise the health of their citizens. Many poorer countries spend less than 3% of their domestic budgets on health. In many cases, it is not because they don’t want to spend more—it’s because they face crippling debt burdens and interest repayments. Global financial institutions must relieve the burden of debt so that low-income countries can free up resources to invest more in the health of their people.

Yes, humanity is at a crossroads. But I’m betting on humanity because no challenge is greater than the power of people working together to solve it.

Every day, I’m inspired by people I meet, like Dr

Opeyemi Akinajo

, who is working on AI-aided sensors that can help more moms and babies survive childbirth. Or Indonesia’s health minister,

Budi Sadikin

, who’s working tirelessly to ensure children have access to the health care they need to get the best possible start at life.

I’m inspired by stories closer to home, too—like

Maddie

and

Emile Leeflang

, teenagers from Utah who were moved by their volunteer work in Kenya to advocate for health aid.

In every corner of the world, there are good people dedicated to making a difference.

Will we be there for them? Will countries ensure their budgets support the health of the world’s children? Will we ensure new breakthroughs reach the people who need them most?

The answers are entirely within our control.”

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes that a combination of global investment and technological breakthroughs, including AI, has the potential to save millions of children's lives. In a blog post, Gates highlighted that global child mortality has already been cut in half over the past 25 years, a, he says most people don't realise happened. However, Gates warns thatas funding for global health is currently shrinking despite the acceleration of new scientific innovations. He has also urged governments to invest in global health to ensure that discoveries, like AI-aided sensors that help mothers and babies survive childbirth to reach the people who need them most.In a statement shared on The Time magazine, Gates wrote:","In 2000, more than 10 million children died before they reached their fifth birthday. Today, it’s less than 5 million. The world cut child mortality in half in just 25 years.

A rare 5-day weekend for UAE National Day is possible! Here’s why: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/a-rare-5-day-weekend-for-uae-national-day-is-possible-heres-why-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/124006129.cms,"UAE National Day holidays in 2025 are officially December 2 and 3, with possible shifts to extend the weekend/ Image: Dubai Media Office





National Day 2025 – The possibility of a very long weekend

Commemoration Day is officially recognized on November 30, but is typically observed on December 1.



If December 1 (Monday) is also declared a holiday, either in addition to or replacing December 3, residents would get a 4-day or even 5-day weekend when combined with the Saturday-Sunday weekend before it.



Key dates to know:





Saturday, November 29, 2025 – Regular weekend

– Regular weekend Sunday, November 30, 2025 – Official date of UAE Commemoration Day(not typically a day off)

– Official date of UAE Commemoration Day(not typically a day off) Monday, December 1, 2025 – Observed Commemoration Day(could potentially be declared a public holiday)

– Observed Commemoration Day(could potentially be declared a public holiday) Tuesday, December 2, 2025 – UAE National Day (official public holiday)

– UAE National Day (official public holiday) Wednesday, December 3, 2025 – Second official day off for National Day (may be shifted to Monday, December 1, under the public holiday law)

The law that could give UAE National Day weekend a 5-day break





Key points of the law:





The law applies to non-Eid holidays, including New Year’s Day, Islamic New Year, Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), and National Day

The two major religious holidays, Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha, are excluded from this flexibility. If they fall on a weekend, they cannot be moved.





Commemoration Day – Its role in the holiday equation

If December 1 (Monday) is officially added as a public holiday in 2025, and paired with December 2 and 3, residents would get three consecutive weekdays off.



Combine this with the standard Saturday-Sunday weekend (November 29–30), and the result is a 5-day break.



Alternatively, a more probable scenario is that the Cabinet moves the December 3 holiday to Monday, December 1, effectively offering a 4-day weekend instead.





How the UAE celebrates National Day

Final word





A midweek National Day, a flexible holiday law, and a calendar quirk might just align to give UAE residents one of the longest weekends of the year.The UAE will celebrate its 54th National Day on Tuesday, December 2, 2025, marking more than half a century since the unification of the Emirates. National Day, also called Eid Al Etihad, commemorates the 1971 federation of six emirates, with Ras Al Khaimah joining in 1972, and symbolizes the country’s independence from British treaties and the start of nationhood under Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.By law, December 2 and 3 are official National Day holidays across the UAE. In 2025, these dates fall on Tuesday and Wednesday, placing the celebration midweek. However, due to updates in the UAE’s public holiday law, there's potential for this to turn into a much longer break.Here’s how it could play out:Nothing has been officially confirmed yet, but similar decisions in past years, and the UAE’s ongoing focus on improving work-life balance, make this scenario increasingly likely.In 2024, the UAE introduced a key revision to its public holiday law aimed at enhancing work-life balance.This legal amendment, announced in the summer of 2024, allows non-Eid public holidays to be moved to the beginning or end of the week if they happen to fall midweek or on weekends. The intent is to help residents benefit more from their holidays through longer, uninterrupted breaks.The official wording states:“With the exception of Eid holidays, the Cabinet may – pursuant to a resolution it issues – transfer any of the public holidays referred to in Article (1) of this Resolution to the beginning or end of the week.”Previously, if a holiday like the Islamic New Year fell on a Sunday, already part of the weekend, workers in the private sector didn’t get an extra day off. For instance, in 2024, Muharram 1 fell on Sunday, July 7, rendering the paid holiday ineffective for many. Under the new rule, that holiday could now be shifted to a Friday or Monday, ensuring residents still benefit.In short: the National Day holiday falling midweek in 2025, combined with Commemoration Day on Monday, sets the stage for either a 4-day or 5-day holiday, depending on how the government chooses to apply this flexibility.UAE Commemoration Day honors the memory of Emiratis who have given their lives in service to the nation. While officially designated as November 30, but usually not with a public holiday, it has been observed on December 1 in recent years, especially when aligning with National Day schedules.Here’s why Commemoration Day matters in this scenario:The UAE's local governments also have discretion to declare additional public holidays not explicitly listed in federal resolutions. This means that emirates such as Dubai or Abu Dhabi could theoretically extend the break by adding Commemoration Day to the public holiday calendar as part of the National Day celebrations.UAE National Day on December 2 is always a big deal, and 2025 is set to be no different. Expect the skies to light up with fireworks and laser shows across landmarks like Burj Khalifa, Dubai Festival City, and the Abu Dhabi Corniche.Streets and buildings will be draped in the national colors, red, green, white, and black, and everyone from kids to grandparents gets into the spirit with festive outfits and flag displays.Traditional dances like Al Ayallah and Al Harbiya, along with poetry and music, bring the country’s heritage to life. In Dubai, the Rashid Boulevard parade steals the spotlight with marching bands, eye-catching floats, and surprise characters. The highlight, though, is the official celebration attended by the rulers of all seven emirates, a powerful show of unity and national pride.While the official announcement is still pending, the calendar setup, holiday law, and past practice suggest there’s a good chance of an extended 5-day UAE National Day weekend. Whether it ends up being four or five days, UAE residents can likely expect a meaningful and festive holiday period this winter.Stay tuned for the official word, but maybe don’t book your December 1 meetings just yet.","UAE will celebrate its 54th National Day on Tuesday, December 2, 2025.
