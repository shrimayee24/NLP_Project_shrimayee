Window opens for a reset with Canada as new Liberal govt takes over; PM Modi seeks to unlock opportunities with Carney,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/window-opens-for-a-reset-with-canada-as-new-liberal-govt-takes-over-pm-modi-seeks-to-unlock-opportunities-with-carney/articleshow/120742734.cms,"Canada’s Liberal Party headed by PM Mark Carney returned to power Tuesday riding a wave of strong anti-Donald Trump sentiment. PM Narendra Modi was among the first to congratulate Carney and express willingness to unlock greater opportunities in ties, while underlining that India and Canada are bound by shared democratic values, a steadfast commitment to the rule of law, and vibrant people-to-people ties.For India and Canada, there’s an opportunity now to wipe the slate clean after 20 months of bitterness in ties as Carney talks of rebuilding what he sees as “incredibly important” ties with India. Aware of the dramatic turnaround in Liberal fortunes because of Trump’s policies, and given it held Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau alone accountable for destroying the relationship, India had already been looking to rest ties with Canada under the Canadian PM since he assumed office in March but based on “mutual respect and sensitivity”.However, unchecked activities of Khalistan separatists will continue to act as a redline in the relationship for India. Of immediate interest will also be whether Canada invites Modi for the G7 summit it will host in June. Canada has so far not announced the name of any guest country for the event.“I look forward to working with you (Carney) to strengthen our partnership and unlock greater opportunities for our people,’’ said Modi in a post on X. Modi’s message followed Carney’s declaration of victory even though he failed to get a majority that he had said would allow him to deal with Trump, who has unleashed a trade war on Canada and apparently even sought to annex the US’ northern neighbour, from a position of strength. A record 22 Punjabis were elected to the House of Commons but, importantly for India, pro-Khalistan leader Jagmeet Singh, a thorn in India’s side for years, lost from his own constituency and resigned from his position as the leader of the New Democratic Party.India’s ties with Canada took a body blow last year in October when the 2 countries expelled each other’s high commissioner, following the diplomatic row over the killing of Khalistan leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in 2023. Even before that, with Canada accusing the Indian government of having masterminded the murder without apparently backing up the claim with evidence, India had expelled dozens of Canadian diplomats to ensure parity in diplomatic presence.As things look up, both sides are expected to negotiate the return of diplomats, particularly the high commissioners. Both sides have already identified senior diplomats for the top job, but India would want to make sure that the redlines it has drawn are adhered to by Carney’s government. These include a mature and responsible handling of the Nijjar issue as the case goes to trial - avoiding Trudeau’s sensationalism - foolproof security for Indian diplomats and a crackdown on extremists and secessionists indulging in anti-India activities. India continues to hold Trudeau and his indulgence towards Khalistan extremists responsible for the downturn in ties with a country where over 4 lakh Indian students are studying, and which is home to one of the largest Indian diasporas abroad - 1.8 million Indo-Canadians and another 1 million non-resident Indians. However, while India blames Trudeau, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which has investigated the Nijjar case, maintains he only acted based on the information provided by the agency. If India and Canada indeed take steps to normalise the relationship, they will have to see that the process is ring-fenced from the fallout of any damning revelations made during the trial.Carney, who has visited BAPS temple and Gurudwara as PM, has so far not explicitly spoken on the Khalistan or Nijjar issue but he was quoted as saying ahead of the elections there are strains on the relationship that “we didn’t cause to be clear, but there is a path forward to address those with mutual respect and to build out.” An economist by profession, he has identified trade as one of the areas the 2 sides can work on to rebuild the relationship. It is important for Canada to diversify its trade partnerships with other partners in the face of the Trump offensive and Carney, soon after his victory, said Canada stands ready to build a coalition of like-minded countries who share common values.",PM Narendra Modi was among the first to congratulate Carney and express willingness to unlock greater opportunities in ties.

'What's wrong in use of spyware to track terrorists?' asks SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-wrong-in-use-of-spyware-to-track-terrorists-asks-sc/articleshow/120742802.cms,"NEW DELHI: ""What is wrong in govt having spyware to track terrorists and enemies of the country?"" Supreme Court on Tuesday put this question to petitioners clamouring for making public the court-appointed committee's report on Pegasus spyware and alleging that it was used to ""snoop on citizens"".""The kind of situation we are facing now, wemust be very careful. We cannot compromise on security and safety of country,"" a bench of justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said in what appeared to be a reference to the Pahalgam atrocity.Senior advocates Kapil Sibal, Shyam Divan and Dinesh Dwivedi flagged a US district court order to claim that WhatsApp had admitted about its system being hacked by Pegasus in India and other countries and repeatedly requested the bench to make public the Justice R V Raveendran committee report and seek Centre's response on whether it had bought the military-grade Israeli spyware.When the Pegasus controversy broke out in 2021, SC had set up a committee under Justice Raveendran to examine the allegation of use of the spyware to surveil on politicians, including a couple from the ruling party, journalists and others.The committee, which was appointed on Oct 27, 2021, had informed the court that only a few people who had claimed that their phones were hacked using Pegasus had submitted their mobile phones for verification by the committee. It found no conclusive evidence of the misuse of Pegasus, though it found signs of suspected interception of conversations and messages in a few cases.For petitioners, who included N Ram, John Brittas and Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, the advocates said the Centre had not denied using the spyware.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, stuck to the Centre's consistent stand and said, ""Government of India does not answer questions concerning sovereignty and security of the country in motivated petitions.""The bench said the US district court order was of little use as SC had passed a detailed judgment and a report had been submitted by the high-powered committee. ""You tell us the name of the petitioner who suspects his phone was hacked. We will check in the report and then tell you whether the apprehension is true. But we cannot make the report public as we do not want it to be a document for discussion on the street,"" it said.When Divan said the spyware was used by the govt to ""snoop on its citizens"", Mehta reiterated that sovereignty and security of the country could not be the subject of debate in the court and alleged that the petitioners were using the forum for some purpose other than the cause they had publicly espoused. ""Terrorists and those who want to cause disturbance in the country cannot claim the right to privacy,"" the SG said. The petitioners said the court could redact sensitive information from the report and then give it to them to understand the process of scientific examination and the findings.","Supreme Court asks petitioners for making public committee's report on Pegasus spyware.

"Pakistan military dismisses India’s accusations, tensions soar over Pahalgam attack",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-military-dismisses-indias-accusations-tensions-soar-over-pahalgam-attack/articleshow/120741609.cms,"Islamabad: Pakistan’s military rejected on Tuesday India’s accusations linking it to the deadly Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 people, mostly tourists.Addressing a press conference in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) head Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan , particularly Balochistan, while presenting limited evidence. The sharp exchange of allegations has deepened the India-Pakistan rift, raising concerns about a broader confrontation.Chaudhry revealed the arrest of Abdul Majeed near Jhelum on April 25, alleging he was trained in India to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan. Authorities recovered a drone, an IED, and Rs 25,000 (approximately $90) in cash from Majeed, which Chaudhry claimed was proof of India’s covert operations. “India is actively supporting terrorist networks on Pakistani soil,” he alleged, challenging New Delhi to substantiate its claims about Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack. “Seven days have passed, and India has failed to provide a single shred of evidence,” he added.However, Pakistan’s evidence lacks detailed substantiation, raising questions about its weight.India, too, has accused Pakistan of orchestrating the Pahalgam attack without publicly disclosing evidence. In response, India announced the suspension of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, closed the Attari and Wagah borders, and recalled its defence attachés from Islamabad. Pakistan rejected India’s treaty suspension, closed its airspace to Indian flights, and warned that disrupting its water rights would be an “act of war”.Analysts warn that the current standoff risks spiralinginto a broader conflict. The Indus Waters Treaty, a rare success in India-Pakistan diplomacy, has survived previous tensions, and its suspension could have catastrophic consequences for Pakistan, a lower riparian state dependent on the Indus river system.Pakistan’s allegations of Indian-sponsored terrorism, while serious, also demand scrutiny. The evidence presented – centered on Majeed’s arrest – lacks granular detail, and Islamabad’s narrative risks being dismissed as tit-for-tat rhetoric. Both nations’ reliance on public accusations over backchannel diplomacy underscores the erosion of trust.","Pakistan rejects India’s accusations linking it to the deadly Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 people, mostly tourists.

Pakistan a rogue state fuelling global terror: India at UN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-a-rogue-state-fuelling-global-terror-india-at-un/articleshow/120743855.cms,"India cites Pak def min’s ‘dirty work’ remark to bolster case



India slammed Pakistan at UN on Monday, calling it a ""rogue state fuelling global terrorism"". Yojna Patel, India's deputy permanent representative to UN, said in New York, ""The whole world has heard Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif admitting and confessing its history of supporting, training and funding terrorist organisations in a recent interview. This open confession surprises no one and exposes Pakistan as (the one) destabilising the region. The world can no longer turn a blind eye.""It is unfortunate that one particular delegation (Pakistan) has chosen to misuse and undermine this forum to indulge in propaganda and make baseless allegations against India,” Patel said as she delivered a strong ‘right of reply’ at a hybrid launch event for ‘Victims of Terrorism Association Network’ (VoTAN) of UN Office of Counter-Terrorism in New York.Pakistan’s delegate not only made a reference to the Pahalgam terror attack, but also reportedly said that it had credible evidence about the Jaffar Express train attack in Balochistan in March being sponsored by “its regional adversaries”.Patel referred to a recent interview of the Pakistan defence minister to buttress her point. Asif had said, “Well, we have been doing this dirty work for the United States for about three decades, you know, and West, including Britain” to a comment that he admits that Pakistan has had a long history of backing, supporting, training and funding these terrorist organisations.Patel said that the “strong, unequivocal” support and solidarity extended by global leaders in the wake of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam is a testimony to the international community’s “zero tolerance” for terrorism.“The Pahalgam terrorist attack represents the largest number of civilian casualties since the horrific 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008,” Patel said. “Having been a victim of cross-border terrorism for decades, India understands the long-lasting impact such acts have on victims and their families ,” she added.India also termed the establishment of VoTAN as a significant step, saying it will create a structured, safe space for victims to be heard and supported.","India slammed Pakistan at UN on Monday, calling it a ""rogue state fuelling global terrorism"" Yojna Patel, India's deputy permanent representative to UN, said in New York, ""The whole world has heard Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif admitting and confessing its history of supporting, training and funding terrorist organisations""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120743897,imgsize-775919,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

The heavy agenda for the members of the Union Cabinet for Wednesday also appeared to be putting across a “business-as-usual” reassurance.","PM Narendra Modi has given complete operational freedom to the armed forces to decide on the mode, targets and timing of response to Pakistan.

"On May 29, group captain Shubhanshu Shukla will be first Indian astronaut to fly to ISS",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-may-29-group-captain-shubhanshu-shukla-will-be-first-indian-astronaut-to-fly-to-iss/articleshow/120742705.cms,"(Drop cap) India’s dream of sending its first astronaut to the world’s biggest space station will soon be realised as IAF Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla will fly to the International Space Station on May 29 at 1.03 pm Eastern Time Zone (10.33pm IST), Axiom Space announced on Tuesday.According to Nasa, Group Capt Shukla, who was trained for the space mission in Russia as well as in the US, will pilot Axiom Mission-4 , a private astronaut mission launching aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. The mission, which is jointly being undertaken by Nasa and Isro, will be launched from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida.Group Capt Shukla will be accompanied by Peggy Whitson, a former Nasa astronaut, mission commander Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary. Once docked, the astronauts are scheduled to spend up to 14 days aboard the orbiting laboratory, conducting a mission comprising science, outreach and commercial activities. Shukla's trip to space comes four decades after Rakesh Sharma’s iconic spaceflight onboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft in April 1984.“Private astronaut missions are an important component of Nasa’s strategy for enabling a robust and competitive commercial economy in low Earth orbit. Private astronaut missions also serve as pathfinders in demonstrating the demand for future commercial space stations,” the US space agency said on X while confirming the launch date.Isro has shortlisted seven microgravity research experiments proposed by Indian principal investigators from various national R&D labs or academic institutions for implementation on the ISS by the Indian astronaut. These include studying 'water bears' — microscopic organisations — to understand how living things adapt to microgravity. According to Isro, the experience will nurture a microgravity research ecosystem back home, leading to the induction of advanced experiments that make up India's space programme.Space minister Jitendra Singh said Shukla will focus on 'space technology, space bio-manufacturing, and bio-astronautics' during his ISS mission.“We have a sprouting experiment which tries to sprout green gram or moong and methi or fenugreek seeds, which are believed to have medicinal properties,” Tushar Phadnis, group head for microgravity platforms and research, said at the virtual press conference organised by Axiom. “The idea is not just to stop sprouting it there. The idea is also to see how these India-specific sprouts behave when they come back. They will undergo a lot of analysis in the labs of the respective PIs (principal investigators),” Phadnis said.Overall, Axiom-4 has a research complement of around 60 scientific studies, including the seven from India. Lucie Low, chief scientist, Axiom Space, reiterated that this will be the most research and science-related activities conducted on an Axiom Space mission aboard the ISS to date.Experience from the ISS mission will give momentum to India’s first human spaceflight programme ‘Gaganyaan’ and also future manned missions to space.Director of international govt business at Axiom Space, Pearly Pandya, who is an Indian-American and was born in Ahmedabad, informed the media in Delhi recently that Shukla and his backup, Group Captain Prashanth Nair, are being trained to operate payloads and conduct scientific research in microgravity. The ISS project is an end-to-end commercial mission for Axiom, which will take care of astronaut training, medical operations and help conduct space experiments, she added.The Ax-4 mission is a significant collaboration between India and the US, announced by PM Narendra Modi during his visit to the US last year.","IAF Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla will fly to the International Space Station on May 29.

NEW DELHI: Amid growing signs of an imminent retaliation against Pakistan over the Pahalgam terror attack , Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged all govt employees to contribute towards strengthening national security.“It is now your duty to strengthen the nation’s economy; it is your duty to strengthen the country’s internal security; it is your duty to develop modern infrastructure; and it is your duty to bring about fundamental improvements in the lives of workers,” he said on Saturday while distributing employment letters to little over 51,000 new recruits at a virtual event.The exhortation came days after the PM publicly declared his determination to avenge the terror attack by “tracking and pursuing” the perpetrators and the masterminds of the plot until the “end of earth” to hand them a punishment they could not have imagined. It was being seen as an attempt to rally people for any eventuality.The PM said he was confident of the new recruits discharging their responsibilities with utmost devotion.In his address, Modi said govt is taking several steps to create new opportunities for employment and self-employment. He added that it’s time for unprecedented opportunities for youngsters while mentioning that the International Monetary Fund has said India will remain the fastest-growing major economy.The PM said in recent times, the production and exports have achieved new milestones, particularly in the automobile and footwear industries, sectors that provide substantial employment to young people. Highlighting the achievement in transportation of cargo through inland waterways, Modi said goods transport through inland water transport has surged to 145 million tonnes (MTs) from 18 MTs before 2014.On women taking the lead in every field, Modi cited the recent UPSC results where the top two positions were secured by female candidates, and three out of the top five toppers were women. “Women are reaching new heights in fields ranging from bureaucracy to space and science. Our govt is focused on empowering rural women through initiatives like self-help groups, Bima Sakhis, Bank Sakhis, and Krishi Sakhis, which have created new opportunities,” he said.Earlier, personnel minister Jitendra Singh said that nearly 28% of the new recruits (14,796) are women.","PM Narendra Modi urged all govt employees to contribute towards strengthening national security.

Elon Musk dodges $2.37 billion in penalties while his firm crashes, senate report finds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/saving-tesla-not-taxpayers-elon-musk-dodges-2-37-billion-in-penalties-while-his-firm-crashes-senate-report-finds/articleshow/120717011.cms,"DOGE in, investigations out

Tesla's turbulent road ahead

When Elon Musk launched the so-called Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE , a humorous reference to his flirtation with cryptocurrency, he asserted he would save taxpayers $2 trillion by cutting bureaucracy. Then it was $1 trillion. Now, it's $150 billion.But a recent Senate probe indicates that whatever cost savings Musk hasn't uncovered for the government, he may have secretly pocketed for himself, reported Rolling Stone.In a report issued on Monday, Democrats on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), chaired by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, put the estimated number of liabilities for Musk's businesses as of President Donald Trump 's 2025 inauguration at least $2.37 billion stemming from 65 actual or threatened enforcement actions by 11 federal agencies.Senate Democrats reportedly said that, whereas the $2.37 billion estimate is a plausible, low-end estimate, it grossly undervalues the actual benefit Musk can receive from mere avoidance of legal risk through his role in government.All these cases span EEOC inquiry into racial harassment at Tesla to SEC examination of Neuralink disclosures and most spectacularly, DOJ criminal investigation of the way in which Tesla pitched its 'Autopilot' and 'Full Self-Driving' (FSD) software — now revised to ""Full Self-Driving (Supervised)"" — on terms critics had complained were downright dangerous to make.Under a Trump administration that has embraced DOGE into federal agencies, most of these investigations have simply disappeared. The report cites a dramatic example. In February, the Department of Justice dropped quietly a discrimination case against SpaceX, which potentially could have resulted in $46 million in civil penalties.Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have long cautioned that DOGE was created to break up the very regulatory agencies probing Musk's empire.""By design, the stunning breadth and magnitude of gains Musk is accruing from his current role may never be known, and that is by design. The silence is strategic, and it is dangerous,"" the Senate report concludes.While regulators have fallen silent, Tesla's problems are growing louder.In 2022, the DOJ's probe of FSD broadened to investigate whether Tesla and Musk defrauded the public and investors regarding the capabilities of its software since 2016. As FSD subscriptions earned $596 million in 2024 alone, possible fraud penalties could double that amount to $1.19 billion, if charges were ever brought.That’s increasingly unlikely. Rolling Stone reported that under Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump’s DOJ appears more interested in chasing those accused of damaging Tesla property, labelling them “domestic terrorists,” than pursuing Musk himself.Meanwhile, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) continues probing Tesla for steering failures, brake issues, unintended acceleration, and whether a recall to fix Autopilot flaws actually worked.Even if Musk has avoided legal expenses, Tesla's balance sheet paints a darker picture.The firm reported a 71% decline in quarterly profits from last year and only managed to stay afloat by selling carbon credits to other carmakers. Market share is dwindling, competitors such as Waymo are introducing robotaxis in urban centers, and liberal consumers are shunning the brand because of Musk's political controversies.On Tesla's most recent earnings call, Musk said he would dial back his work with DOGE to focus on the struggling automaker. He also hinted at a pilot robotaxi operation in Austin this June with upgraded Model Y vehicles, even though he previously announced a special ""Cybercab"" last fall.As is typical, he promised huge: ""There will be millions of Teslas driving autonomously — fully autonomously — in the second half of next year.""""Tesla will take 90-something percent of the rideshare market.""","Elon Musk launched the so-called Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE to save taxpayers $2 trillion by cutting bureaucracy.

Nanoless accuses Sinder and REDACTED about slandering other creators, exclusivity & blacklisting other creators



“I will start with screenshots showing them speaking ill of other creators & spreading rumors while manipulating me that it’s all in our best interest. In addition to spreading ill rumors they also complain and accuse

Bao

of giving “their” editor too much work, resulting in the editor not having any time for new clients which will be important later on. The screenshots below show them showing their affection & appreciation immediately followed by spreading rumors & lies to make other clients appear problematic to manipulate any future decisions regarding commissions.”

""They mentioned wanting an exclusivity contract, but they didn’t want to pay for exclusivity, but rather when a creator from their blacklist comes asking for a commission, they would guarantee me model work for Sinder only and if anyone asked me for commissions, they’d commission me instead to compensate for not working with other creators. This felt very strange given that one of the accusations they made was overworking their editor yet their “solution” to me working with other creators was for them to essentially overwork me to keep me from working on other projects.""

“The messages below show that their primary concern is that the more non Sinder models I make, the less “valuable” my existing models become. It’s hard to say how much this messed with my mind as an artist that by working with other people I’m somehow making my existing models less special.”

Vampeaches reveals that REDACTED is Sinder’s boyfriend



""I remember playing Phasmophobia with you and hearing RED chat away next to you before you first debuted like 4 years ago. You told me he was your boyfriend. Then before we met for Twitchcon you switched up and said 'just so you know my manager is coming with me on this trip' as if I didn't know who he was. It's even ickier to read this tweet knowing he is your significant other and that you're probably going to try and avoid taking responsibility for hurting people who trusted you as friends by nuking the RED side of this duo.""

Sinder’s official apology



“Redacted has been my co-content creator since I began making content, managing all aspects of what I do, and being a major part of why I’m here. We have also been in a relationship since the start of my endeavors. It’s no secret that many vtubers choose to keep their public and personal lives separate, and I’m no different. As of yesterday he is no longer working with me, and I have not extensively discussed any of this with him. Where our personal situation goes from here will be figured out between us privately. I never intended to mention us publicly, but given that the claims are out there, I want everyone to know I’m taking this seriously. After years of working on everything together, his hyper business oriented outlook warped my view of what it is I should be doing, and what should be important to me as I navigate this career path. I have a terrible work life balance as it is, and being around projects and streams all day every day made me lose sight of the point. It took all of this happening for me to realize this behavior isn’t normal or healthy, and it’s not an outlook I want to have. This doesn’t absolve me of the things I’ve willingly done wrong and went along with, or the way I’ve treated people who were fully undeserving.”

“In regards to Nanoless, for the majority of the time working with her, Red was the one almost solely doing the communication about new plans and negotiations through his private DMs. Nano had a project server we were all a part of where the actual art and models were worked on, but the conversations were focused around the work itself. I was not fully aware of the extent of Red’s manipulation over Nano’s commission decisions, and I should’ve been more diligent in my oversight.”

The popular Twitch VTuber Sinder has come under negative limelight following accusations from the Vtuber artist Nanoless, who issued a Google document about the termination of work. Within the same, Nanoless accused Sinder and her manager REDCATED about “manipulating, using, and dragging them into drama, while sabotaging, slandering & spreading lies about people they thought were the VTuber’s closest friends.The document was posted on Nanoless’ X handle on April 26, 2025, and the controversy has spread like wildfire since then. Here we take a detailed look at all the accusations aimed at VTuber Sinder and REDCATED.Nanoless’ document consists of several allegations, the first one being about Sinder and REDACTED slandering other creators. As part of the same, the VTuber artist shared several Discord screenshots with that of REDACTED. Nanoless claimed that the two spoke ill and spread rumors about other streamers.Nanoless exactly stated:Added to this, Nanoless’ document also mentions about REDACTED speaking ill about Vtubers like Shylily, who is another popular name.Coming to the exclusivity, Sinder and REDACTED essentially wanted to issue an exclusivity contract but didn’t want to pay about the same. Nanoless additionally mentioned that they would compensate for not working with content creators that they had blacklisted. The document mentions:She also added:The screenshots related to the same are on the document itself. You can find the same by heading over to Nanoless’ X account (@Nanoless_)Following the official post by Nanoless, Sinder announced that REDACTED will no longer manager her VTuber activities, and completely cut ties with her manager. Vampeaches responded to this post by revealing that REDACTED is Sinder’s boyfriend. She mentioned the following:Finally, Sinder posted a document titled “My Apology” on April 28, 2025. The same officially confirmed REDACTED as her partner, and the duo were together since she began her journey as VTuber. She said:Coming to Nanoless’ allegations, she added the following:You can check out Sinder’s complete apology by heading to her X handle (@SinderVTuber).","Nanoless accuses Sinder and REDACTED of slandering other creators, exclusivity & blacklisting other creators.

NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday withheld Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif's X account, amid rising tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad after the Pahalgam terror attack . The move comes five days after the government had suspended Pakistan government's account.On Monday, the government had banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels for spreading provocative, communally sensitive content and misinformation targeting India. Acting on the recommendation of the ministry of home affairs, the ban applies to prominent outlets such as Dawn News, ARY News, Geo News, Samaa TV, and individual creators including former cricketer Shoaib Akhtar.Last week, India had blocked access to the official X (formerly Twitter) account of the Pakistan government, @GovtofPakistan, following a legal request.This move follows a series of diplomatic measures taken by India after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack, including expelling Pakistani officials, suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, and halting visas for Pakistani nationals. All Pakistani nationals have been asked to leave by 27 April, with medical visas valid until 29 April.Last week, the Pakistan’s defence minister sparked widespread controversy when in a viral video clip in he admitted that Islamabad has historically funded and supported terrorist groups.""We have been doing this dirty work for the United States for about 3 decades... and the west, including Britain...That was a mistake, and we suffered for that, and that is why you are saying this to me. If we had not joined the war against the Soviet Union and later on the war after 9/11, Pakistan's track record was unimpeachable,"" he had said.Asif further said that any attack by India could lead to an “all-out war” between the two nuclear-armed nations, Dawn reported.“If there is an all-out attack or something like that, then obviously there will be an all-out war,” Asif told Sky News, adding the world should be “worried” about the risk of full-scale conflict.Rejecting allegations of Pakistani involvement, Asif said, “The reaction that came from Delhi was not surprising... this whole thing was staged to create some sort of crisis.”He also questioned the credibility of The Resistance Front (TRF), the group allegedly behind the attack, saying, “Never heard of that organisation.”","The government on Tuesday withheld Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif's X account.

Read Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan full letter to employees

Team,

Today we reported our Q1 2025 results. It was a step in the right direction as we delivered revenue, gross margin and EPS (earnings per share) above our guidance, driven by Dave and Michelle’s leadership. I want to thank them both, and all of you, for the good execution.

We need to build on this progress — and it won’t be easy. We are navigating an increasingly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment, which is reflected in our Q2 outlook. On top of that, there are many areas where we must improve. We need to confront our challenges head-on and take swift actions to get back on track.

As I have said, this starts by revamping our culture. The feedback I have received from our customers and many of you has been consistent. We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways — and we need to change.

Our flatter Executive Team (ET) structure that I shared last week was a first step. The next step is to drive greater simplicity, speed and collaboration across the entire company. To achieve these objectives, today I am announcing some important changes.

Becoming an Engineering-Focused Company

We need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers. That’s why I elevated our core engineering functions to the ET. And many of the changes we will be driving are designed to make engineers more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation.

To make necessary investments in our engineering talent and technology roadmaps, we need to find new ways to reduce our costs. While we have taken significant actions in the last year, our current cost structure is still well above competitive benchmarks. With that in mind, we have reduced our operating expense and capital spending targets going forward, which I will discuss during our investor call this afternoon.

Flattening the Organization

As we refocus on engineering, we will also remove organizational complexity. Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down. I have asked the ET to take a fresh look at their respective orgs, with a focus on removing layers, increasing spans of control and empowering top performers. Our competitors are lean, fast and agile — and that’s what we must become to improve our execution.

I’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people. We will embrace this mindset across the company, which will include empowering our top talent to make decisions and take greater ownership of key priorities.

There is no way around the fact that these critical changes will reduce the size of our workforce. As I said when I joined, we need to make some very hard decisions to put our company on a solid footing for the future. This will begin in Q2 and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months.

We are going to be very intentional about where we focus these efforts and how we stack up against the best in the industry. We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities. These decisions will not be made lightly, and we will keep you regularly informed.

Streamlining Our Processes

It has been eye-opening for me to see how much time and energy is spent on internal administrative work that does not move our business forward. We need to radically simplify this to maximize the time spent focusing on our customers.

I am instructing our leaders to eliminate unnecessary meetings and significantly reduce the number of meeting attendees. Too much valuable time is being wasted. We will also modernize processes with a focus on live dashboards and better data to ensure we have the real-time insights we need to make better and faster decisions.

In addition, I have decided to make our formal Insights and OKR requirements optional. While it’s crucial for us to stay accountable for our results and receive feedback on our performance, I believe we can achieve this in a simpler and more flexible way. Along the same lines, we will cut back on time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation.

Returning to the Office

Our existing policy is that our hybrid employees should spend approximately three days per week on site. Adherence to this policy has been uneven at best. I strongly believe that our sites need to be vibrant hubs of collaboration that reflect our culture in action.

When we spend time together in person, it fosters more engaging and productive discussion and debate. It drives better and faster decision-making. And it strengthens our connection with colleagues.

With that in mind, we will be updating our policy to require four days per week on site by Sept. 1. I wanted to tell you well in advance so that you have time to make any adjustments to your daily routines. We are going to work hard in the meantime to ensure sites are ready to operate at full capacity. Your local leadership will share site-specific details and seek your input on how to create the best possible on-site experience.

Building a New Intel

I realize this is a lot to take in, but we are playing from behind and we need to rally as a team to put ourselves in the best possible position to win.

This requires us to be laser-focused on developing the best products. We need to delight our customers and earn their trust by delivering the performance, quality and reliability they need to succeed. We must demonstrate predictable execution and ensure on-time delivery. And we need to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders.

There are two ways teams can respond at make-or-break moments like this: They can look at the gap they need to close and give up — or they can look inside themselves and fight like never before.

I made my choice last month when I decided to join you all, and there is no place I would rather be right now. I came on board knowing full well this would be the most challenging job of my career, but also the most motivating and fulfilling — because we have opportunities ahead that most people don’t get in their careers.

I’m talking about the opportunity to fundamentally reinvent an industry icon. To pull off a comeback that will be studied in business schools for generations to come. To create new technologies and deploy them at scale to change the world for the better.

Intel was once widely seen as the world’s most innovative company. There’s no reason we can’t get back there, so long as we drive the changes needed to improve.

It’s going to be hard. It will require painful decisions. But we will make them knowing it’s what we must do to serve our customers better as we build a new Intel for the future – and I have great confidence in the power of our team and our people to make it happen.

Thank you for everything you did in Q1. I look forward to talking more tomorrow during our All Company Meeting.

Lip-Bu Tan

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has announced sweeping restructuring measures including layoffs, management cuts, and an expanded return-to-office mandate as the struggling chipmaker attempts to regain its competitive edge. The changes aim to eliminate ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" and streamline operations to foster innovation, and Tan notes that “this starts by revamping our [company’s] culture.""""I've been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I'm a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The company didn’t specify the exact number of job cuts, but with around 108,900 employees at the end of last year, reports suggest up to 20% of the workforce could be impacted.""Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The new CEO, who has been at the helm for only five weeks, is targeting $1.5 billion in operating expense reductions over the next two years.The flattening will begin in Q2, and Tan says will be continuing into the next few months.These cuts follow a previous round of layoffs just eight months ago when Intel eliminated 15,000 positions.The restructuring prioritizes engineering talent and aims to make engineers ""more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation."" Tan is shifting focus away from measuring management success by team size toward a leaner structure emphasizing execution.The announcement followed Intel's underwhelming first-quarter earnings, highlighting the company's ongoing challenges in adapting to the industry's pivot toward artificial intelligence—a priority CEO Tan emphasized for the future.Intel also recently announced that starting September 1, it will require four in-office days weekly from its employees. This change replaced the company's two-day remote policy to boost collaboration. Tan made this announcement as a part of a strategic roadmap during the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call.","CEO Lip-Bu Tan: ""We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways"" ""We need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers,"" Tan says.

The tech billionaire was responding to a 60 Minutes report on Japan’s population decline, where birth rates have dropped to 1.3 children per woman. This declining population has resulted in a net loss of nearly a million people annually, as reported by CBS News on April 27, 2025.

This move positions Amazon as a direct competitor to SpaceX’s Starlink, which dominates the satellite internet market with over 7,000 operational satellites.

Project Kuiper aims to offer fast, affordable internet, particularly in underserved regions, leveraging Amazon’s expertise in cloud computing and consumer products.The launch, initially delayed due to bad weather, represents the first operational deployment of Kuiper satellites. Amazon plans to meet the FCC deadline to deploy half of its satellite network by mid-2026, despite the challenges posed by its late start in the market.Amazon Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos has voiced confidence that Kuiper can compete with Starlink, telling Reuters in a January interview ""there's insatiable demand"" for internet.""There's room for lots of winners there. I predict Starlink will continue to be successful, and I predict Kuiper will be successful as well,"" he said.""It will be a primarily commercial system, but there will be defense uses for these LEO constellations, no doubt,"" he added, referring to low-Earth orbit.Amazon has invested over $10 billion in Project Kuiper and secured multiple launch contracts with providers like Blue Origin and Arianespace.

Towers to house 400 units

HYDERABAD: US President Donald Trump might have lost some love with NRIs and Indian students in his second term, courtesy his revised immigration policies. But businessman Donald Trump's desi footprint is only growing. And a slice of that is all set to come up in Hyderabad's backyard, Kokapet, this year.Come Aug-Sept, work on the 63 floors-plus Trump Towers will begin at Golden Mile - one of the most expensive real estate locations in the city - making it among the tallest Trump projects in India, once completed. Spread over four acres, the project is being jointly executed by Tribeca Developers (Trump Organisation's India realty partner) and local construction firm Ira Realty at an estimated cost of Rs 3,500 crore.Currently, India has four Trump Towers with the one in Mumbai's Worli area standing tall at 78 floors. The other three are in Pune, Kolkata and Gurgaon.In Nov 2024, the Trump Organisation had announced plans to build six new projects in India - Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Noida and Pune, making it the only country outside the US with such a high number of Trump Towers.""We are in the final stages of clearances which we hope will come in the next two weeks. We are planning to launch the project by Aug-Sept,"" said Narsi Reddy, founder and managing director of Ira Realty that has residential and commercial ventures across Kokapet, Kollur and Financial District.According to him, the project has been designed in line with the philosophy of Trump Towers the world over, complete with high-end glass and chrome finish.A well-known architect from India has been roped in to oversee the execution, but the company is unwilling to share the name at moment.""In every Trump project, the amenities are designed in the middle of the project and Hyderabad will be no exception. So, just like a ship, the 48-feet-high amenities complex - with squash courts, clubhouse etc - will run between the residential towers connecting each other,"" Reddy said. The project is likely to take four to four-and-half years to be completed.Reddy said that the twin towers will house over 400 units, each priced at roughly Rs 15,000 per square feet (sft). ""Unlike many other Trump Towers, we have decided to cap the size of flats at 5,000 sft (maximum).

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Poll Do you believe the Liberal Party's proposed immigration caps will benefit Canada? No, not at all Yes, definitely

A chance at resetting ties

What about international students?



The government has a responsibility to those who come here to ensure that they have access to jobs, social services, and housing. If we cannot meet those responsibilities, we need to adjust the numbers until we get back on track. What the Liberal manifesto said

India-Canada ties under Trudeau

Mark Carney ’s Liberal Party is set to form a minority government in Canada after a dramatic election that saw a sharp shift in momentum following tensions with the United States. The Liberals, once heading for defeat, rallied to outperform Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives, helped by a wave of nationalist sentiment triggered by US President Donald Trump's hostile rhetoric towards Canada.Also read: How Trump won Canada for Mark Carney While Carney’s victory offers him the prime ministership, the Liberals have fallen short of a parliamentary majority and may need the support of smaller parties like the Bloc Québécois to govern. For India, however, this leadership change could signal an important opportunity to reset relations after years of strain under Justin Trudeau.Diplomatic ties between India and Canada soured significantly during Justin Trudeau’s tenure, particularly following his allegations in September 2023 regarding Indian involvement in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia. This led to a major diplomatic rift, with expulsions of diplomats and widespread mistrust.Carney, however, has indicated a willingness to rebuild the relationship. In a recent media interaction in Calgary, he described India as a ""key opportunity"" for expanding Canada’s trade partnerships. ""There needs to be a shared sense of values around that commercial relationship, and if I am Prime Minister, I look forward to the opportunity to build that,"" Carney said.One area of particular interest for India will be the future of Indian students in Canada, who form a significant part of the 427,000-strong international student community. Carney’s Liberals have proposed a more measured approach to immigration and international student intake as part of their broader strategy to tackle Canada’s housing and infrastructure crisis.According to the 2025 Liberal manifesto, immigration numbers including international students and temporary workers will be capped to ensure they represent less than 5% of Canada’s population by the end of 2027, down from a previous high of 7.3%. Permanent resident admissions will be stabilised at below 1% annually beyond 2027. While the plan acknowledges the economic and cultural contributions of newcomers, it stresses the need to align immigration with Canada's capacity to provide housing, jobs, and healthcare.For Indian students, this means that while opportunities will continue, competition could tighten. The manifesto also outlines plans to streamline the recognition of foreign credentials and speed up immigration processing times, potentially benefiting those who do secure entry. However, the overall trend points to a more restrained and carefully managed intake.Carney during has campaign trail has also voiced support for prioritising the transition of temporary residents to permanent status before significantly increasing overall immigration levels. He has earlied argued that Canada should focus on better integrating the more than four million newcomers who have arrived in recent years before expanding the system further.This approach aligns with the latest Immigration Levels Plan from IRCC, which includes a new “In-Canada Focus” stream, reserving 82,980 permanent residency spots in 2025 for those already living in Canada as temporary residents. Carney has also called for a reduction in temporary foreign workers (TFWs), noting that while reliance on them rose during the Covid-19 pandemic, the system has since become unmanageable.Under new IRCC caps, TFW permits will be limited to 82,000 annually from 2025–2027, while International Mobility Program permits will drop sharply.Under Trudeau, India-Canada relations reached their lowest point in recent times. Tensions flared after Trudeau’s public remarks linking India to Nijjar’s death, and the fallout was swift with diplomatic expulsions, visa restrictions, and a chill in bilateral engagement.The breakdown in trust also had economic implications. Although bilateral services trade touched CAD 13.49 billion in 2023, deeper economic cooperation was hampered by political tensions. The Indian government increasingly viewed Canada as an unreliable partner, while Indo-Canadian ties became entangled in domestic political debates within Canada itself.Carney’s ascension offers a chance to move beyond this period of suspicion. His focus on trade diversification, strengthening ties with like-minded nations, and rebuilding trust with India suggests that the coming years could see a more pragmatic and mutually beneficial relationship between Ottawa and New Delhi.","Mark Carney ’s Liberal Party is set to form a minority government in Canada.

China’s manufacturing activity declined in April after showing signs of recovery in March, according to government data released on Wednesday. The slump comes amid rising trade tensions with the United States, which recently imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese goods.The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) — an important indicator of factory activity — dropped to 49 in April, down from 50.5 in March, which had been the highest reading in 12 months. The April figure was also lower than the 49.7 expected by a Bloomberg survey.According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the drop was linked to both a strong performance the previous month and increased trade pressure. “In April, affected by factors such as a high base from earlier rapid manufacturing growth and a sharp shift in the external environment, the manufacturing PMI fell,” said NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe, as quoted by AFP.This fall in manufacturing comes just weeks after the United States imposed tariffs of up to 145% on many Chinese products. Beijing responded with 125% tariffs on several US imports.Although Chinese exports had jumped by over 12% in March as firms rushed to ship goods before the new tariffs kicked in, domestic issues remain. The country is still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, struggling with low consumer demand and a long-running property sector crisis.To address these challenges, Chinese authorities have introduced stimulus measures, including rate cuts and relaxed home-buying rules. They’ve also set a goal to create 12 million new urban jobs this year and maintain 5% economic growth, matching last year’s target.","The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) — an important indicator of factory activity — dropped to 49 in April, down from 50.5 in March.
