India set to renew engagement with Taliban in Moscow Format talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-set-to-renew-engagement-with-taliban-in-moscow-format-talks/articleshow/113922386.cms,"India will participate in the 6th round of Moscow Format talks on Afghanistan on Friday, looking to renew its engagement with the Taliban whose acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi will also attend the meeting. While the world’s attention has been focused on the Ukraine and Gaza conflicts, India’s own regional security priority remains the need to ensure that Afghanistan doesn’t again turn into a haven for terrorists, especially those working for UN proscribed groups like JeM and LeT.Apart from special envoys of all Central Asian countries, representatives of Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran and India are expected to participate in the Moscow Format dialogue, which was launched in 2017 to address issues related to Afghanistan.Addressing the humanitarian situation, formation of an inclusive and representative government, concerted efforts to counter terrorism and regional security remain high on India’s agenda for Afghanistan.Ahead of the talks on Friday, the head of the political office of the ‘Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan’, Suhail Shaheen, told TOI that the Format should not be an instrument of pressure but a vehicle leading to positive communication and engagement between Afghanistan and the world. Under pressure to restore women rights and ensure inclusive government, the Taliban have maintained that they don’t want others to impose on them ``external models of governance’’.``Moscow Format has made efforts to resolve Afghan issues in the past and it can play an important role in solving the current issues facing Afghanistan like removal of sanctions, reduction in poverty, creation of job opportunities, paving the way for engagement between Afghanistan and the international community in various areas,’’ said Shaheen.Indian representative, MEA joint secretary JP Singh, is also expected to have a bilateral meeting with Muttaqi and other Taliban officials on the sidelines of the meeting. While India has not officially recognised the Taliban, it has surprised many by establishing a working relationship with the regime in Kabul, owing mainly to its humanitarian support to the people of Afghanistan. An Indian “technical team’’ has kept the embassy in Kabul running to oversee distribution of Indian aid, overriding the initial fear and trepidation at the return of the Taliban.Interestingly, while a UN report recently warned of serious threat from terrorist groups active in Afghanistan, the Taliban have blamed Pakistan for shielding key members of the Islamic State-Khorasan group. A Taliban spokesperson said earlier this week that from bases in Pakistan, the group was orchestrating attacks, both within Afghanistan and in other countries. India sees the remarks as a vindication of its position on Pakistan’s support to cross-border terrorism.","India will participate in the 6th round of Moscow Format talks on Afghanistan on Friday.

KANPUR: A deception game with eerie echoes of the UP-set 'Bunty Aur Babli' has unspooled in Kanpur, where a pair allegedly bilked Rs 35 crore from over two dozen couples with promises of an ""Israel-made time machine to turn them into 25-year-olds"".Rajeev Dubey and wife Rashmi lured clients with the elixir of "" oxygen therapy "" once they were inside the ""time machine"".The magical ""time machine"" never landed but airports have been alerted to ensure the duo don't fly out after the cops filed an FIR on a complaint from three of the couples allegedly duped.According to police, Rajeev and Rashmi opened a therapy centre, Revival World, in Kidwai Nagar, promising prospective clients their near-divine assortment of potions to regain youth.

Zakir Naik Welcomed in Pakistan: Is Islamabad Risking Conflict with India?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-rolls-out-red-carpet-for-zakir-naik-is-islamabad-igniting-new-conflict-with-india/articleshow/113903850.cms,"Zakir Naik (right) with Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif

Naik's Pakistan visit to fuel tension?

Why NIA and ED are after him

NEW DELHI: Zakir Naik , a controversial Islamic evangelist who is wanted in India on terror-linked charges , landed in Islamabad on October 1 with Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcoming the fugitive with wide arms and cosy hugs.Pakistan's move to roll out the red carpet for Naik, who is there for a month-long visit, reek of mischief by the Sharif dispensation with the objective of opening up a new front of confrontation with India, which has virtually suspended its bilateral relations with Islamabad since the 2017 Uri and 2019 Pulwama terror attacks.India had carried out surgical strikes and Balakot air strikes in response to these terror attacks.The tension between India and Pakistan was palpable at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting last week, when external affairs minister S Jaishankar tore into Islamabad and warned that its ""cross-border terrorism policy can and will never succeed"".In a strong-worded reply to Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif 's UNGA speech where he accused New Delhi of ""escalating tensions"" in Kashmir, Jaishankar warned that Islamabad's ""actions will most certainly have consequences"".In the backdrop of such strained relations, Pakistan's invitation to Zakir Naik has raised eyebrows, with some experts of the view that the fugitive's visit is likely planned to fuel tension between the two nations.""As a purveyor of hate speech, Zakir Naik has been banned from several countries including India. In giving him a royal reception, Pakistan is announcing that it is committed to embracing fundamentalism and is willing to set aside global opinion,"" social activist Pervez Hoodbhoy told Deutsche Welle.Amit Ranjan, a research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore, said: ""As Pakistan is already facing violence related to social and political problems, giving space to Naik is nothing but an addition to the existing tensions.""In Naik's Pakistan visit, the only silver lining perhaps is that it provides New Delhi with a fresh opportunity to justify its claims that the neighbouring country continues to welcome and facilitate ""anti-India"" elements.""There is a lesson in this invitation to Zakir Naik for those who advocate some diplomatic opening towards Pakistan, be it in sports, trade etc. Even reviving SAARC. The NC and PDP in Kashmir want India to talk to Pakistan. Shehbaz Sharif’s speech at the UN was intemperate. Linked Kashmir to Palestine, talked of India’s colonial settlement project in Kashmir and the Islamophobic Hindu supremacist agenda in India. Not a discourse intended to lower tensions with India. Shehbaz may get “shabash” domestically but won’t improve Pakistan's condition. Jaishankar gave a befitting reply in the UNGA to Sharif,"" Kanwal Sibal, former Indian foreign secretary, wrote on X.The controversial ""televangelist"" has been living in Malaysia since India's anti-terror agency launched an investigation against him in 2016.Naik has been accused of promoting radical views similar to those of groups like the Islamic State and the Taliban, leading to bans on his speeches in India, Bangladesh, Canada and the United Kingdom.Naik has delivered over 1,500 public lectures since 1994, often asserting that Islam is the only true religion and criticising other faiths, as well as non-Wahhabi Islamic sects such as Shias, Sufis, and Barelvis.Naik is the founder of Peace TV , a channel on comparative religion with a reported audience of over 100 million. It faces a ban in India in connection with alleged money laundering and hate speeches.India also banned IRF in 2016, accusing it of encouraging followers to promote enmity and hatred. He fled India in July 2016 after Bangladeshi authorities claimed that one of the attackers on a cafe in Dhaka was inspired by Zakir Naik. The incident had left 22 people dead.The NIA filed a charge sheet under Section 10 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code, which has been replaced by Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. The investigation revealed that Naik is the founding trustee and a member of an ""unlawful association"" – IRF.",Zakir Naik is a controversial Islamic evangelist who is wanted in India on terror-linked charges. Pakistan's move to roll out the red carpet for Naik reek of mischief by the Sharif dispensation. India has virtually suspended its bilateral relations with Islamabad since the 2017 Uri and 2019 Pulwama terror attacks.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113907003,imgsize-964137,width-400,resizemode-4/113907003.jpg"
'Excessively harsh': Centre opposes marital rape criminalisation in Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/excessively-harsh-centre-opposes-marital-rape-criminalisation-in-supreme-court/articleshow/113911358.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: The central government on Thursday opposed the criminalisation of marital rape in the Supreme Court , stating that matter relating to marital rape needs ""a comprehensive approach"" rather than a ""strict legal approach"" as it can have very far-reaching socio-legal implications in the country.If sexual acts by a man with his own wife is made punishable as ""rape"", it may severely impact the conjugal relationship and lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage, the Centre told the Supreme Court, according to news agency PTI.In its preliminary counter affidavit in the top court on the martial rape issue, the Centre further said that ""while exercising such judicial review on such subjects (marital rape), it is to be appreciated that the present question is not only a constitutional question, but essentially a social question on which Parliament , after being apprised and being aware of all sides of the opinion on the present issue, has taken a position.""Centre informed the court that Parliament has decided to retain Exception 2 to Section 375 of IPC in 2013 while amending the said section in the year 2013.""Furthermore, it is submitted that striking down Exception 2 of Section 375 of IPC on the ground of its constitutional validity will have a far-reaching effect on the institution of marriage if sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife is made punishable as 'rape',"" the Centre said in its affidavit, according to news agency PTI.""It is submitted that the act colloquially referred to as 'marital rape' ought to be illegal and criminalised. The central government asserts that a woman's consent is not obliterated by marriage and its violation should result in penal consequences. However, the consequences of such violations within marriage differ from those outside it,"" the affidavit said.It said Parliament has provided different remedies, including criminal law provisions, to protect consent within marriage.""Given the nature of the marital institution in our socio-legal milieu, if the legislature is of the view that, for preservation of the marital institution, the impugned exception should be retained, it is submitted that it would not be appropriate for this court to strike down the exception,"" the central government told the Supreme Court.""It may severely impact the conjugal relationship and may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage,"" the government said.""This is more so since the issues involved have a direct bearing on the society in general and is a part of Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India,"" the Centre said.The affidavit said a husband certainly does not have any fundamental right to violate the consent of the wife, however, attracting the crime in the nature of ""rape"" as recognised in India to the institution of marriage can be arguably considered to be excessively harsh and therefore, disproportionate.""Therefore, it is respectfully submitted that if the legislature decides to exempt, from the rigour of such a charge, and such a label, husbands, vis-a-vis their wives, given the intelligible differentia that exists in a marital relationship vis-a-vis other relationships, the said decision and discretion should be respected and not interfered with especially when a separate suitably tailored penal remedy is provided by the Legislature,"" it said.In 2022, in an important verdict reinforcing bodily and decisional autonomy of the pregnant woman, the Supreme Court for the first time recognised marital rape for the purpose of unwanted pregnancy for abortion and held that rape under Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act includes a husband's act of sexual assault or rape committed on his wife.","The central government on Thursday opposed the criminalisation of marital rape in the Supreme Court. It said matter relating to marital rape needs ""a comprehensive approach"" rather than a ""strict legal approach"" If sexual acts by a man with his own wife is made punishable as ""rape"", it may severely impact the conjugal relationship, the Centre said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113914874,imgsize-904715,width-400,resizemode-4/113914874.jpg"

The language must have an independent and distinguished literary heritage, not derived from another language. Additionally, there may be a discontinuity between the classical language and its modern forms or offshoots, as the classical language and literature remain distinct from their later evolutions.""The inclusion of languages as Classical Language will create significant employment opportunities, particularly in academic and research fields. Additionally, the preservation, documentation, and digitization of ancient texts of these languages will generate jobs in archiving, translation, publishing, and digital media,"" said the cabinet in a statement.Soon after the announcement, PM Modi said, "" Our Government cherishes and celebrates India's rich history and culture. We have also been unwavering in our commitment to popularising regional languages.

Even when I was the Chief Minister and even now, the Maharashtra Government, under the leadership of Chief Minister Shinde Ji, continuously followed up on this issue and made efforts and also gave a lot of evidence in this regard and today all those evidence has been accepted and the Marathi language has now become a classical language. On behalf of the 12 crore people of Maharashtra and Marathi people living across the world, I express my whole-hearted gratitude to Prime Minister Modi.""Once a language is designated as a Classical language, the government offers several benefits to promote its study. These include two annual international awards for scholars excelling in classical Indian languages. Additionally, a Centre of Excellence is established for studies in the Classical Language, and the University Grants Commission is encouraged to create Professional Chairs in Central Universities to support and advance research and education in these languages.","The Union Cabinet gave its approval to grant classical language status to five Indian languages: Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese and Bengali.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricket captain and Congress leader Mohammad Azharuddin skipped summons from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday in connection with a money laundering case related to alleged financial irregularities in the Hyderabad Cricket Association ( HCA ), according to official sources quoted by PTI.The 61-year-old former MP was summoned to record his statement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) at the ED office in Hyderabad.However, he requested more time and has been issued a fresh summons for October 8.The investigation pertains to alleged financial irregularities in the HCA. In November last year, the ED conducted searches related to the case, raiding the premises of former HCA office bearers, including ex-vice president and Indian cricketer Shivlal Yadav, Congress MLA and ex-president Gaddam Vinod, former HCA secretary Arshad Ayub, and the office of S S Consultants Pvt. Ltd. and the residence of its MD Satyanarayana.The money laundering case originates from three FIRs and charge sheets filed by the Telangana Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) for alleged criminal misappropriation of HCA funds amounting to Rs 20 crore. One of the FIRs was registered based on a complaint by HCA CEO Suneel Kante Bose after an interim forensic audit report found certain transactions with third-party vendors to be ""not genuine"" and detrimental to the association's interest.The police charge sheets allege serious irregularities in the procurement of DG sets, firefighting systems, and canopies for the Rajiv Gandhi Cricket Stadium in Uppal, Hyderabad. Despite deadlines, several works were delayed, leading to increased costs, budget enhancements, and corresponding losses to the HCA. The office bearers of the HCA, including its then secretary, president, and vice-president, allegedly colluded with private parties to allot tenders and works to preferred vendors at inflated prices without following proper tender processes and even before receiving quotations.The ED's raids last year resulted in the seizure of digital devices, ""incriminating"" documents, and ""unaccounted"" cash of Rs 10.39 lakh. The forensic report noted that ""Mohammad Azharuddin, the then president of the association in the 9th Apex Council meeting held on March 3, 2021 had sought to take up discussions regarding firefighting equipment. However, subsequently, without assigning any reasons, the tender was not allotted to any of the bidders. Thereafter, HCA had floated a second tender for the same work"".Azharuddin, a recipient of the Padma Shri and Arjuna Award, began his political career by winning the Moradabad Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh in 2009.

Keep marital rape out of IPC to protect institution of marriage: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/keep-marital-rape-out-of-ipc-to-protect-institution-of-marriage-government/articleshow/113919622.cms,"Govt: Committed to 'fully' protecting

NEW DELHI: Opposing criminalisation of marital rape, the Centre on Thursday told Supreme Court that a husband and wife share a unique multifaceted relationship which is not exclusively centred on sex and stressed if Parliament has thoughtfully carved out an exception for marital rape in the penal provisions (in Sec 375 of IPC), it should not be struck down by the court.Responding to a clutch of PILs seeking criminalisation of marital rape, the Union home ministry in an affidavit said, ""Given the nature of the marital institution in our socio-legal milieu, if the legislature is of the view that, for preservation of the marital institution, the impugned exception should be retained, it is submitted that it would not be appropriate for the SC to strike down the exception.""A husband certainly does not have any fundamental right to violate the consent of the wife, the Centre said, but to equate marital intercourse with rape, would be excessively harsh and disproportionate.The Centre clarified it is committed to ""fully and meaningfully"" protect liberty, dignity and rights of every woman. ""Govt attaches highest importance to ending all kinds of violence and offences causing physical, sexual, verbal, emotional and economic abuse including domestic violence against women The central govt asserts that a woman's consent is not obliterated by marriage, and its violation should result in penal consequences. However, the consequences of such violations within marriage differ from those outside it,"" it said.""Parliament has provided different remedies, including criminal law provisions, to protect consent within marriage. Sections 354, 354A, 354B, 498A IPC, and Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, ensure serious penal consequences for such violations,"" it added.Govt said, ""Consent of the woman is not evaporated rather breach of consent results in different penal consequences. It cannot be a fundamental right under Article 21 that breach of consent in all eventualities would necessarily entail the consequences of Section 375/376 of IPC. If breach of consent results in altered penal consequences thereby creating a sufficient deterrence, the said provision and exception to Section 375 cannot be faulted.""The Centre said marriage is an institution with social aspects and implications. ""Between a husband and wife, who spend their days and nights together, living in a house which, by the dint of their joint effort, they make a home, there exists a bond which defies, and indeed transcends, all known and identifiable parameters. In our country, it is submitted, marital vows are still regarded as inviolable,"" it said.""Considering the social impact involved, the intimate familial relations being the subject matter and ground realities prevailing in different parts of society of this large, populous and diverse country, taking a decision merely based upon the arguments of PIL petitioners, may not serve the ends of justice,"" govt added.It contended that since marriage is an institution which creates reciprocal conjugal rights, it therefore renders it incomparable to the concept of ""consent"" in any other situation outside the marriage. ""Parliament, after appreciating this subtlety and variation in the concept of 'consent' within a marital relationship, has approved the exception while providing for other suitable remedies recognising the constitutional right of the parties to the marriage,"" it said.It said since marital rape issue relates to marriage, which is in the Concurrent list, views of states and UTs were sought. It said of the 19 states and UTs which responded to its query, only Delhi, Karnataka, Tripura were opposed to the exception to marital rape under Section 375 of IPC. Those which supported the exception included UP, MP, Gujarat, Assam, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Goa and Manipur.","The Centre said a husband and wife share a unique multifaceted relationship which is not exclusively centred on sex. A husband certainly does not have any fundamental right to violate the consent of the wife, the Centre said. To equate marital intercourse with rape, would be excessively harsh and disproportionate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113919704,imgsize-660480,width-400,resizemode-4/113919704.jpg"
Fake SBI branch scams Chhattisgarh villagers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fake-sbi-branch-scams-chhattisgarh-villagers/articleshow/113919271.cms,"On Sept 18, a small village in Chhattisgarh 's Sakti woke up to find that a 'SBI' branch had sprung up overnight. It sported the logo, and cashiers and a manager who looked busy and business-like. Chhapora village felt like it had arrived.The trusting villagers had no way of knowing it was an elaborate fraud. Even the house owner, who gave it on rent to 'SBI' had no clue it was fake.The villagers were, in fact, overjoyed that the bank was recruiting, and the 'shortlisted candidates' from nearby districts readily gave Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh each for the jobs. The fake bank even held training sessions for them. It took around a week for the 'employees' to sense something was wrong - they sat twiddling their thumbs all day. The fraud was exposed in around 10 days but by then, the kingpins of the racket - who called themselves Rekha Sahu, Mandir Das and Pankaj - had vanished. Pankaj had posed as the branch manager. Police in Sakti have registered a case and are looking for the suspects. ""All transactions (for the jobs) were made through UPI. We are tracing them. Their phone numbers are untraceable and the addresses they gave were fake,"" said an officer. The fraudsters seem to have chosen Chhapora because of its remote location, around 250km from Raipur . Six people were 'hired' through walk-in interviews, and told to get more employees. tnnBy then, word had reached the manager of the nearby Dabhra SBI branch about the new 'Chhapora branch'. He suspected it was fake and decided to visit incognito. He saw the business-like setup and furniture but noticed that the computers didn't have any software, weren't linked to any server, there was nothing much on the ledgers and the 'newly hired staff' looked confused.""The Dabhra manager approached Malkharauda police station with his suspicions. He said he had no information of another branch opening in the region and his initial investigation suggests it's fake,"" said Kunwar.A police team immediately went to the 'branch'. ""When they saw the police, the 'employees' had a look on their face that said their fears had come true. They said Rekha Sahu, Mandir Das and Pankaj had recruited them on payments of Rs 5 lakh, Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh,"" said Sakti subdivisional police officer Manish Kunwar. told TOI .This fake branch had issued offer letters with job titles of 'manager', 'marketing and sales representative', 'cashiers' and 'computer operators'.Police have set up multiple teams to nab the accused. The house owner was so overawed by the 'bank babus' that he hadn't asked for any documents, police said. Kunwar suspects a network of fraudsters is behind this elaborate fraud.","Villagers in Chhattisgarh's Sakti woke up to find a 'SBI' branch had sprung up overnight.

The other pipeline will be laid inside Nepal for pushing products upcountry from Amlekhgunj across Bihar’s Raxaul town to Lothar in Chitwan area, 62 kms away. Building two terminals are also part of the agreement.India currently meets Nepal’s fuel needs, estimated at about 1.5 million tonnes per annum. IndianOil supplies products to Amlekhganj through a pipeline from its Motihari depot in Bihar. Extension of this pipeline to Lothar will reduce the cost of transporting fuel across the country and the resultant pollution from tankers. The pipeline from Siliguri will open a second supply route and improve availability in eastern Nepal.The agreement follows a 2023 MoU between India’s oil ministry and Nepal’s ministry of industry, commerce and supplies. Both the pipelines have been under discussion since 2019, when peeved by India’s economic blockade a year earlier, Kathmandu had signed a trade and fuel supply pact with China. But the Himalayan logistics involved in carting fuel from China has made the option economically unviable.The pipelines and terminals will bind the two countries tighter by making Indian fuel more attractive for Nepal.

""The pilot's announcement was detailed and matter of fact. It said we need to return due to a situation that was beyond their control and for our safety.

'No effort being made to implement directions': SC slams CAQM over air pollution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-effort-being-made-to-implement-directions-sc-slams-caqm-over-air-pollution/articleshow/113898001.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed its dissatisfaction with the Commission for Air Quality Management ( CAQM ) for failing to take effective action in curbing stubble burning , stating that the panel had made no effort to implement its own directions.A bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and A G Masih said that, ""no prosecutions had been initiated under CAQM's guidelines and the panel's last meeting was held on August 29.""""From the affidavit of compliance, we find that no effort is being made by CAQM for implementation of its own directions, not a single prosecution has been initiated, and the last meeting was only held on August 29,"" the court said.The court directed Punjab and Haryana to ensure compliance with CAQM's directives and file affidavits on their progress within a week, with the next hearing scheduled for October 16.During the hearing, the court also turned its attention to Punjab, questioning the state's use of lenient penal provisions to address stubble burning cases. Justice Oka criticised the state for registering First Information Reports (FIRs) under Section 223 of the BNS Act , one of the mildest penal provisions, in 129 cases of stubble burning. ""You have found the mildest penal provision and registered FIRs,"" Justice Oka remarked.Punjab's Advocate General (AG) responded by outlining the challenges faced by small-scale farmers, who make up about 70% of the state's farming community. He explained that while stubble-burning mitigation machines were provided free of cost, marginal farmers—those with less than 10 acres of land—struggled with operational costs, such as hiring drivers and purchasing diesel.Punjab AG proposed a financial grant system to cover these costs, suggesting a burden-sharing model involving both the Central and state governments. ""We can make the machines compulsory if we provide financial grants for the cost of running these machines,"" he said, proposing that the Centre contribute Rs 1,200 crores while Punjab and Delhi would each contribute Rs 375 crores. ""The entire burden is about Rs 2,000 crores. Delhi was favourable to consider it subject to the Centre giving Rs 1,200 crores, but they are saying they are giving Rs 1,000 crores,"" he added.The court also asked clarification on how many prosecutions had been initiated under Section 15 of the BNS Act, to which the AG said that financial assistance was crucial for encouraging widespread use of the machinery among marginal farmers.Last week, the bench had also raised concerns about CAQM's efforts, questioning whether pollution levels had decreased over time and urging more robust enforcement. ""The issue of serious pollution. Is it coming down?"" the court asked.The court asked CAQM to file a more detailed compliance report and stressed the need for grassroots-level implementation of stubble-burning alternatives.",The Supreme Court expressed its dissatisfaction with the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM ) for failing to take effective action in curbing stubble burning.

The platform combines credit health assessment (ki score), middleware rails, risk management dashboards (ki view), and debt capital markets structuring capabilities (ki credit) to unlock finance from banks and other capital sources.➤ Ki score, an AI/ML based credit health scoring model, uses extensive data sources such as credit history, demand and repayment patterns, demographic details, savings data, and alternative data sources to predict future probability of default for a customer applying for a loan. The score helps lending institutions decide whether to offer a loan, what maximum loan amount to disburse, what interest rate to charge, and decide on which customers to graduate from a group loan to an individually underwritten small business loan.➤ Sucharita started her career with Deutsche Bank’s global markets team, but soon realised that generating wealth for large financial institutions was unfulfilling. Inspired by Nachiket Mor’s vision for financial inclusion, she joined Mor’s IFMR Capital as founder & CEO. Puneet, a key leader in ICICI Bank’s microfinance division, had worked with Mor to launch IFMR Trust.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

'You bear responsibility of ...': Houthis issue warning to shipowners in new phase of escalating Red Sea attacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/you-bear-responsibility-of-houthis-warn-shipowners-in-new-phase-of-escalating-red-sea-attacks/articleshow/113924664.cms,"An unusual email landed in the personal inbox of a senior executive at a prominent Greek shipping company just before midnight. What appeared to be a routine correspondence quickly spiraled into a significant concern, as the email cautioned that one of the company's ships traversing the Red Sea was at risk of being targeted by Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi militia .This particular ship had breached a Houthi-imposed transit ban by docking at an Israeli port, prompting the warning that it would be ""directly targeted by the Yemeni Armed Forces in any area they deem appropriate."" The email, accessed by news agency Reuters, said, ""You bear the responsibility and consequences of including the vessel in the ban list.""This was not an isolated incident. The communication marked the beginning of a series of increasingly alarming emails sent to at least six Greek shipping companies since late May, amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.Reuters quoting sources within the industry reported that this was just the tip of the iceberg in a broader campaign by the Houthis, who have launched nearly 100 attacks on vessels in the Red Sea since November, striking in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel's ongoing conflict in Gaza.The warnings escalated in severity, with one email threatening “sanctions” against entire fleets if vessels continued to disregard the Houthi transit ban. In one particularly stark communication sent from a Yemeni government domain, the message stated, “Your ships breached the decision of Yemen Armed Forces ... Therefore, punishments will be imposed on all vessels of your company.”This expansion of threats to entire shipping fleets marked a new phase in the Houthis’ tactics. Since last year, the group has ramped up its military operations, firing missiles and deploying drones against commercial ships connected to Israeli, US, and UK interests. The recent email campaign highlights the Houthis’ determination to cast a wider net, targeting Greek merchant ships even if they have little to no connection to Israel.The ramifications of these threats are profound. Greek-owned vessels account for approximately 30% of Houthi attacks on shipping, according to Lloyd’s List Intelligence data. The situation has prompted many shipping companies to reevaluate their routes. The traffic through the Suez Canal has dropped significantly, falling from around 2,000 transits per month before November 2023 to just 800 in August, as cargo vessels opt for longer, safer paths around Africa to avoid the Red Sea.Adding to the tensions, the European Union’s naval force, Aspides, confirmed in a recent closed-door meeting that the Houthis had shifted their strategy to include broader threats. They advised ship owners to disable their Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders to avoid detection, highlighting a chilling reality: the Houthis’ missile strikes have shown a staggering 75% accuracy against vessels with AIS on, compared to only 4% accuracy against those that turned it off.An executive from a shipping firm that received the Houthi threat emphasised the difficult balancing act between contractual obligations and the safety of their crews. ""If safe transit through the Red Sea cannot be guaranteed, companies have a duty to act – even if that means delaying their delivery windows,"" said Stephen Cotton, General Secretary of the International Transport Workers' Federation.The ongoing threats and attacks have significantly impacted insurance rates for Western ship owners, with some insurers suspending coverage altogether. Conbulk Shipmanagement Corporation, a Greece-based firm, halted all Red Sea voyages following multiple attacks on its vessel, citing crew safety as a top priority. CEO Dimitris Dalakouras remarked at a recent shipping conference, “Once the crew is in danger, all discussion stops.”The Houthis have not completely halted traffic, offering reassurances to Chinese and Russian-owned vessels, which they do not associate with Israel.While some companies have opted to avoid the Red Sea entirely, others continue their operations, driven by binding long-term agreements or the pressing need to transfer goods in this vital region. The Red Sea remains the fastest route for delivering goods to consumers in Europe and Asia, but the increasing danger is reshaping the landscape of international shipping.","Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi militia has launched nearly 100 attacks on vessels in the Red Sea since November. The group has ramped up its military operations, firing missiles and deploying drones against commercial ships connected to Israeli, US, and UK interests.

"Longshore Workers: US dock workers end strike after 3 days, reach agreement to boost wages by 62%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-dock-workers-end-strike-after-3-days-reach-agreement-to-boost-wages-by-62/articleshow/113922168.cms,"Representative Image (Picture credit: AP)

Longshore workers in the United States have reached an agreement to end the work stoppage that halted shipping on the East Coast and Gulf Coast. The agreement includes a wage increase of approximately 62 percent over six years, with average wages rising from $39 per hour to around $63 per hour during the contract period, according to Reuters sources close to the situation.This marks the resolution of one of the most significant work stoppages in nearly 50 years, which disrupted the unloading of container ships from Maine to Texas. The ILA started the strike involving 45,000 port workers on Tuesday after negotiations for a new six-year contract failed.The International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) had initially sought a 77 per cent raise, while the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) proposed almost a 50 per cent raise.Both parties announced that they would extend their master contract until January 15, 2025, to address the remaining issues at the bargaining table. ""Effective immediately, all current job actions will cease and all work covered by the Master Contract will resume,"" they stated.Due to the strike, there were shortages of items such as bananas and auto parts and a backlog of ships anchored outside major ports. By Wednesday, at least 45 container vessels were unable to unload and anchored outside affected ports, up from just three before the strike began on Sunday.""After the first week, we can expect some impact on perishable products like bananas, other fruits, seafood, and coffee, meaning fewer goods are reaching consumers, potentially driving up prices,"" said Tony Pelli, global practice director for security and resilience at BSI Americas.The strike impacted 36 ports, including New York, Baltimore, and Houston, which handle a variety of containerised goods. Economists suggested that the port closures would not immediately raise consumer prices due to accelerated shipments of key goods in recent months. However, a prolonged stoppage could eventually lead to higher food prices.President Joe Biden's administration has supported the union, urging port employers to improve their offer and noting the shipping industry 's profits since the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The tentative deal represents critical progress towards a strong contract,"" Biden said on Thursday.The administration resisted calls from business groups and Republican lawmakers to use federal powers to end the strike, aiming to maintain union support ahead of the November 5 presidential election.","Longshore workers in the United States have reached an agreement to end the work stoppage that halted shipping on the East Coast and Gulf Coast.

India’s growing role in global oil consumption trends



Also Read |

Oil remains a vital component of the global economy, impacting geopolitical relations and national revenues. Recent tensions in the Middle East, especially the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, have led to fluctuations in international crude oil prices, underscoring the sector's ongoing volatility and potential supply disruptions.The IEA’s 2024 oil report anticipates a slowdown in global oil consumption growth in the coming years, influenced by rising electric vehicle sales, improved efficiency, reduced reliance on oil for electricity in the Middle East, and broader economic shifts.Global oil demand is projected to increase by 3.2 million barrels per day by 2030 unless stronger policy measures are taken or consumer behaviours change. According to the IEA, advanced economies are expected to see a long-term decline in oil consumption, with usage dropping from 46 million barrels per day in 2023 to below 43 million by 2030. Conversely, Asia's rapidly developing economies, particularly in transportation (India) and petrochemicals (China), will significantly drive global oil consumption.As the region's growth continues, supported by a relatively stable global economy, the IEA slightly raised its growth forecast for 2024 to 5.0%, with a steady prediction of 4.9% for 2025. To accommodate this anticipated demand, non-OPEC+ producers are expected to play a crucial role, contributing three-quarters of the global production increase by 2030. The United States alone is projected to add 2.1 million barrels per day to non-OPEC+ growth, while Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and Guyana will collectively contribute an additional 2.7 million barrels per day. In contrast, OPEC+ is set to increase its production capacity by 1.4 million barrels per day between 2023 and 2030, with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Iraq leading this expansion. However, the alliance’s share of global oil production is expected to fall below 50% starting this year as non-OPEC+ nations take the lead in capacity growth.As of April 11, 2024, total world oil production reached 101.81 million barrels per day, with the top ten producing countries accounting for approximately 74.59 million barrels per day, or about 73% of global output.As of April 11, 2024, global oil consumption reached 99.95 million barrels per day, with the top ten consuming countries accounting for about 61.08 million barrels per day, or 61% of global consumption.India ranks as the world’s third-largest oil consumer, utilising approximately 5.05 million barrels per day, which accounts for 5% of global consumption. The country is expected to increase its oil demand by nearly 1.2 million barrels per day by 2030, contributing over a third of the anticipated global demand growth of 3.2 million barrels per day, according to the IEA.The report states that ""India will emerge as the largest contributor to global oil demand growth between now and 2030,"" while growth in developed economies and China is projected to slow and eventually decline. This growth is primarily driven by urbanisation, industrialization, a rising middle class eager for mobility and travel, and efforts to enhance access to clean cooking, which will collectively support the expansion of oil demand.","As of April 11, 2024, total world oil production reached 101.81 million barrels per day, with the top ten producing countries accounting for 74.59 million per day. The top ten consuming countries account for about 61.08 million barrels a day, or about 5% of global consumption.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113896427,imgsize-34082,width-400,resizemode-4/113896427.jpg"

Malcolm Gladwell , the best-selling author ofone of the most important non-fiction books of the 21st century, is back with its dark sequelWhile discussing the new book with the Guardian, Gladwell calls out what he calls Harvard’s admission officers’ “bias towards affluent white students”.Pointing out the disparity between Harvard and an institution with a merit-based admissions process like Caltech compared to Harvard, he writes: “My suspicion is that for many people it’s unconscious, but there must be a point at which [Harvard admissions tutors] are confronting the fact that they have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their campus hasn’t become dominated by Asians and Indians.”In the book, Gladwell notes that Caltech, a highly competitive university with a merit-based admissions system, saw the proportion of Asian American students rise from 25% to 43% between 1992 and 2013.In contrast, at Harvard, where the admissions process is influenced by factors such as legacy, donor contributions, and athletic scholarships, the percentage of Asian American students has remained consistently between 15-20% during the same period. Indian applicants are even more likely to be excluded by Harvard’s application process.Gladwell goes on to argue: ""Meritocracy is one of the most beautiful inventions of the 20th century – it is a foundation of a free society.""Here are 10 other key points aboutand Malcolm Gladwell:Malcolm Gladwell was initially reluctant to revisit his debut work but ultimately chose to create an entirely new version, one that reflects today's more anxious world rather than simply updating the original.The foundational idea that social trends behave like epidemics, initially growing slowly before suddenly taking off, still holds true. However, some of Gladwell's original examples have not aged well.Gladwell now finds his earlier chapter on crime ""embarrassing,"" as he once credited New York City's crime reduction to 'broken windows' policing. He has since acknowledged that this approach led to over-policing in minority neighbourhoods and wasn't actually responsible for the drop in crime rates.Gladwell values the process of learning from errors, a trait he respects in his father. He proposes that authors should periodically reassess their original works every 25 years to stay aligned with new insights.The new book is darker and more nuanced than the original. It delves into how a small number of individuals can disproportionately influence significant events, such as the opioid crisis, where a minority of doctors were responsible for nearly half of all prescriptions.While The Tipping Point became a cultural phenomenon, Gladwell’s latest book explores how individuals with substantial influence can shape societal changes, both positively and negatively.Gladwell reflects on how male leadership failures over the past eight years make a strong case for female leaders, particularly in the current political climate.Gladwell has expressed his support for Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election, noting a personal connection through his mother, who shares Jamaican heritage with Harris's father.He argues that recent examples of male leadership failures have made it increasingly difficult to justify misogynistic attitudes and believes that America is ready for a female president.Now living with his partner and two young daughters, Gladwell views parenting as a journey of intellectual humility. He continuously adapts his understanding of his children as they grow and sees this phase of his life as a ""productivity mechanism"" that shapes his evolving perspective.","Malcolm Gladwell's new book, ""Revenge of the Tipping Point,"" is darker and more nuanced than the original.

The timing of his trip is crucial. Sharif's govt stands accused of denying political space to the opposition. The judiciary seems as politically polarised and divided as the rest of society.On Thursday, the Supreme Court revoked its earlier decision to bar lawmakers from defecting against their party's policy line in parliament. It has paved the way for the govt to garner the required support to make a set of amendments to the constitution, several of which pertain to the judiciary.

He also faces cases pertaining to financial crime.Many in Pakistan warn that Naik could inflame extremist sentiments in an already restive country.

Islamabad, In an effort to minimise administrative expenditures, cash-strapped Pakistan on Sunday announced to abolish about 150,000 government posts , close six ministries, and merge two others, as part of reforms agreed upon with the IMF under USD 7 billion loan deal . The International Monetary Fund on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to cut expenditures, increase tax-to GDP ratio, tax non-traditional sectors like agriculture and real estate, limit subsidies and transfer some fiscal responsibilities to provinces.Addressing the media on his return from the US, Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb said that a programme had been finalised with the IMF, which would be the last programme for Pakistan.""We need to implement our policies to prove that it will be the last programme,"" he said, and emphasised that in order to join the G20, the economy must be formalised.The minister said right-sizing within ministries was going on and the decision to close six ministries is set to be implemented, while two ministries will be merged. ""Additionally, 150,000 posts across various ministries will be eliminated,"" Aurangzeb said.He dwelt at length on increasing tax revenues, noting that there were approximately 300,000 new taxpayers last year, and so far this year, 732,000 new taxpayers have registered, increasing the total number of taxpayers in the country from 1.6 million to 3.2 million.Aurangzeb also said that the non-filers category will be abolished and those not paying taxes will no longer be able to purchase property or vehicles.The minister claimed that the economy was moving in the right direction and the country's foreign exchange reserves had increased, reaching their highest level. He highlighted significant growth in both national exports and IT exports, and stated that investor confidence regarding the strength of the economy is a major success.Aurangzeb stated that the policy rate has been reduced by 4.5 per cent by the government after coming to power, and expressed optimism that the exchange rate and policy rate will remain as expected.""Our claim that the economy is improving is not a hollow claim because inflation has decreased due to government policies. Inflation has dropped to single digits,"" he said.Pakistan has been struggling to fix its economy for the last many years and it was close to default in 2023 but a timely loan of USD 3 billion by the IMF saved the situation.Pakistan has negotiated a long-term loan with the global lender with the hope and commitment that it would be the last loan. However, many doubt this claim as the country has already secured about two dozen loans from the Fund but failed to address the economy on a permanent basis.","Pakistan to abolish about 150,000 government posts, close six ministries, and merge two others.
