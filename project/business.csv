NEW DELHI: Millions of citizens going online will have guaranteed control over their digital data while social media companies such as Facebook and Instagram will need verifiable parental consent before onboarding children, or those under 18 years, with the govt finally notifying rules to operationalise the digital personal data protection (DPDP) law that was originally passed by Parliament in Aug 2023.The much-awaited rules promise a consent-based regime to safeguard the data of users who go online for social media, ecommerce, gaming, banking, payments, and for availing govt services.Companies and organisations violating the rules will face penalties, up to Rs 250cr for serious failures to protect data and breaches.The rules also require companies to quickly inform users and the new data protection board about any data breach. However, these rules will be implemented gradually.The govt has given an 18-month window to companies for transition, considering the big backend changes they will need to undertake. Any breach must be promptly informed in “plain language, explaining the nature and possible consequences of the breach, the steps taken to address it and contact details for assistance”, the govt said.It also said the law is guided by “seven core principles” -- consent and transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, security safeguards, and accountability.Regarding online data of children, where Big Tech and other major companies had been lobbying for a “liberal” approach, the new law mandates that companies must obtain verifiable consent before processing their personal data, with limited exemptions for essential purposes such as healthcare, education and real-time safety. “For persons with disabilities who cannot make legal decisions even with support, consent must come from a lawful guardian verified under applicable laws. ”To obtain verifiable parental consent for onboarding and processing a child’s personal data, companies must adopt appropriate technical and organisational measures to prevent children from accessing services by faking their age or guardians. The rules state that companies need to “observe due diligence, for checking that the individual identifying herself as the parent is an adult who is identifiable if required in connection with compliance with any law”.The new rules also have provisions that allow the govt to restrict transfer of certain data outside the country, which is likely to be a worry for tech giants such as Meta, Google, and Amazon.“A Significant Data Fiduciary shall undertake measures to ensure that personal data specified by the central govt, on the basis of the recommendations of a committee constituted by it, is processed subject to the restriction that the personal data and the traffic data pertaining to its flow is not transferred outside the territory of India,” the rules say, without giving any further details. The committee will be constituted by the central govt and will include officials from the Ministry of Electronics and Technology, apart from other departments and ministries.And, to strengthen the rights of online users, the new law gives the right to individuals to “access, correct, update or erase their personal data” and even nominate another person to exercise these rights on their behalf. “Data Fiduciaries must respond to all such requests within a maximum of 90 days.”For transparency and accountability, companies will need to display contact information — such as that of a designated officer or Data Protection Officer — to let individuals raise queries about personal data processing. Also, companies with a large number of users will have enhanced obligations, including independent audits, impact assessments and stronger due diligence for deployed technologies. “They must also comply with govt-specified restrictions on certain categories of data, including localisation where required. ”The law now paves the way for formation of a Data Protection Board that will function as a fully digital institution, enabling citizens to file and track complaints online through a dedicated platform and mobile app. “Appeals against its decisions will lie with the Appellate Tribunal, TDSAT.”","The much-awaited rules promise a consent-based regime to safeguard the data of users who go online for social media, ecommerce, gaming, banking, payments, and for availing govt services.

"With inflation at record low of 0.3%, food ministry proposes lifting of export ban on wheat products",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-inflation-at-record-low-of-0-3-food-min-proposes-lifting-of-export-ban-on-wheat-products/articleshow/125340683.cms,"Representative AI image

NEW DELHI: With inflation at a record low of 0.3%, the food ministry has proposed lifting of export restrictions on wheat products such as aata, maida and sooji after a gap of nearly three-and-a-half years. In a letter to the commerce department, it has suggested considering allowing such exports of up to one million tonne (MT).Referring to the representation of Roller Flour Millers’ Federation of India to allow export of wheat products based on the “prevailing surplus and strong production outlook”, the ministry has sought “necessary action”.Sources said the Food Corporation of India (FCI) commenced the open market sale scheme (OMSS) of wheat for bulk buyers such as flour millers and this got a lukewarm response with around 70,000 tonne sold through e-action against the offer 2 lakh tonnes at Rs 2,550 per quintal. They added that this indicates enough wheat availability in the market and even the wholesale prices have dropped by around 12% compared to last year.At present, FCI has around 30.5 MT of wheat stock against the buffer requirement of 20.5 MT for Jan 1, 2026.Navneet Chitlangia, president of Roller Flour Millers’ Federation, said India has witnessed a bumper wheat harvest this season, and with a favourable monsoon, they anticipate yet another excellent harvest in the coming season.“In view of the robust domestic production, we have requested govt to lift the restrictions on wheat product exports so that India may reclaim its traditional markets across the globe,” he said.Before the export ban of wheat products, India used to send shipments of flour, maida and sooji and other products to Africa, Gulf and south Asian countries. In May, a ban was imposed on exports of wheat and its products due to concerns over domestic food security, drop in production, and rising inflation.","With inflation at a record low of 0.3%, the food ministry has proposed lifting of export restrictions on wheat products.

What trends in Bihar show

What did the exit polls say?

As trends in the Bihar assembly election results emerge, NDA alliance has taken decisive leads across the state with Mahagathbandhan trailing. However, one name that is notably absent from the numbers is Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj. Despite promises to reshape Bihar’s political landscape, the results so far show no significant traction for the party.According to latest trends, the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) sweeping elections with Mahagathbandhan lagging behind.The early picture is dominated by the two major blocs:NDA has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the BJP and JD(U) registering strong performances.Mahagathbandhan (MGB) trails behind, with RJD performing significantly better than alliance partner Congress — but still not matching the NDA’s spread.RJD, despite MGB trailing overall, is showing up as one of the top individual parties in several seats.Jan Suraaj, however, does not appear in the early seat charts, and its vote share — where visible — is marginal, rarely impacting the margins in competitive constituencies.The Jan Suraaj Party contested its maiden elections this month with more than 200 candidates in the fray. The party, formed by poll strategist Prashant Kishore, initially announced plans to contest all 243 seats in the Bihar Assembly.The number dipped slightly after Jan Suraaj faced defections, ‘forced’ withdrawals, and other setbacks during the nomination process.Prashant Kishor, the election strategist turned politician, set an ambitious victory target for his party in the state assembly elections. He had also stated that if his party fails to achieve this, he will consider it a personal defeat.However, all exit polls predicted a dismal performance for Prashant Kishore’s Jan Suraaj Party in the Bihar assembly elections . The maximum number of seats any pollster is willing to give to the party is five. While Kishore himself did not contest the polls, his party’s vote share numbers will determine whether they have been able to make any significant dent in the votes of either the NDA or the Mahagathbandhan.","NDA has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the BJP and JD(U) registering strong performances.

Six Ways Nitish Kumar Proved 'Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai' As NDA Registers Big Win in Bihar Assembly Polls

NEW DELHI/PATNA: When Nitish appeared vulnerable, Didis rallied around.That women voters in Bihar are partial to Nitish Kumar-led NDA govt for its pro-women policies since 2005 is well known. What acted as a turbo-boost this time was the cash transfer of Rs 10,000 to over 1.5 crore women in poll season. As if Rakhi after Diwali, the 'das-hazariya' beneficiaries and Jeevika Didis turned out to be the catalyst in NDA's massive win.Women whose lives have changed on the back of govt policies are in substantial numbers - and they cut across caste lines.Some 71.6% women, nearly 9 percentage points more than men (62.8%), turned up to vote this time - up from 59.7% in 2020. It was seen as an endorsement of NDA govt and a 'no' to MGB's return bid. An entire generation of women has benefitted from welfare programmes of the JDU-BJP govt, starting with the free cycle scheme for schoolgoing girls in its first term (2005-10). The sight of smiling girls cycling to school was the defining picture of Nitish's win in 2010, when the RJD-led opposition's decimation was as total as it is now.Even prohibition, with its flaws, draws strong support from women, especially the poor.Journalists travelling through Bihar often came cross the contrasting picture of men trashing the govt for its ""ineffective"" ban on liquor and their wives praising its benefits despite issues with implementation.Then there have been pioneering policies like 35% reservation for women in govt jobs and 50% in local bodies.Jeevika Didis, women members registered with more than 11 lakh self-help groups, also emerged as loyal supporters of Nitish govt.When TOI sought to gauge the mood of Jeevika Didis and other women across the state, a majority of them had expressed support for Nitish and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Also, the relative safety under NDA govt has its share of admirers among women. Hooliganism was part of citizens' everyday experience under RJD govt ftom 1990 and 2005, and kept women in an almost permanent state of apprehension.The Nitish administration earned credit for making Bihar a safer place.Crime does occur, but not many citizens believe that the govt is deliberately soft on criminals - a charge that has stuck with the RJD so strongly that it cannot shake it off despite two decades out of office.Add to these the welfare schemes of Modi govt, especially free ration that ensures women running the kitchen of poor households don't have to worry about their families getting two meals a day. Despite his recent goof-ups in public, Nitish continues to be seen as an avuncular figure who cares for women. And women repay in faith.","Some 71.6% women, nearly 9 percentage points more than men (62.8%), turned up to vote this time - up from 59.7% in 2020.

Flawless seat-sharing formula

Resurrecting 'Jungle Raj' scare

Broadened caste coalition

Massive women voter mobilisation & welfare outreach

Nitish factor & JD(U) resurgence

The National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) seems set to secure a historic win in Bihar with trends showing it is well on its way to secure a whopping 203 seats in the 243-seat assembly, with the BJP posting its best performance since 2010.The 2025 polls unfolded against the backdrop of a meticulously crafted campaign focused on stability, development, and inclusivity, where the NDA's narrative of 'double-engine government' under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar resonated powerfully with the voters.This election saw historic voter participation, with women and young voters emerging as vital pillars of support for the NDA, reflecting a sustained engagement with grassroots welfare schemes and effective mobilisation efforts.At the heart of this electoral juggernaut was not just robust governance but also impeccable political engineering — from flawless seat sharing among alliance partners to resurrecting deep-rooted fears about past lawlessness encapsulated in the widely known 'Jungle Raj' scare. The alliance's success was further amplified by broadening caste coalitions beyond traditional alignments, disrupting longstanding vote banks, and capitalising on the enduring Nitish Kumar factor, which brought JD(U) back to a dominant position within the coalition.The NDA's decisive victory in Bihar in 2025 was strongly supported by a meticulously crafted seat-sharing formula, finalised well before the polls.The alliance comprised BJP, JD(U), LJP (Ram Vilas), HAM(S) and RLM.The BJP and JD(U) evenly contested 101 seats each, a historic power parity indicating maturity within the NDA.Smaller allies like the LJP (Ram Vilas) contested 29 seats, while HAM(S) settled for six seats despite initial demands for 15.This seat sharing was achieved in a ""cordial atmosphere"" with all partners conceding to key demands to avoid intra-alliance friction, a frequent issue in multi-party coalitions.What differentiated the 2025 elections was the emphasis on quality seats rather than sheer numbers, ensuring that each party contested constituencies where they had strong grassroots presence and electoral appeal.This precision in allotment minimised vote-splitting and maximised coalition coherence. Leaders like Jitan Ram Manjhi openly declared unwavering support for PM Modi and the alliance, projecting unity. The arrangement allowed the NDA to mobilise resources and campaign effectively across the caste and regional spectrum.This flawless seat-sharing was a critical structural factor, removing the pitfalls of previous elections where seat disputes diluted NDA's strength. In a hyper-competitive environment like Bihar, the seat sharing formula was a linchpin in translating vote shares into seat tallies, ensuring the NDA's electoral machinery was uninterrupted and optimally functioning to deliver a record majority.Also read: Women, welfare and the ‘phoenix’ CM: How Nitish-led NDA crushed MGB in Bihar elections - 10 key takeaways In its campaign, the BJP-led NDA capitalised heavily on resurrecting the fear of 'Jungle Raj', a term associated with lawlessness during the Lalu-Rabri era (1990-2005).This narrative was revived through incidents like the attack on deputy CM Vijay Kumar Sinha's convoy, which was framed as politically motivated intimidation by ""goons"" aligned with the opposition RJD.This law-and-order scare reminded voters of the chaotic and violent past under RJD's regime, contrasting it with the NDA’s promise of stability and governance.Despite Bihar witnessing its most peaceful elections ever with zero repolls or violent incidents — a dramatic turnaround from previous decades — the Jungle Raj rhetoric struck a chord with many voters wary of instability.The NDA portrayed itself as the only viable safeguard against a return to 'goon raj', appealing to citizens’ desire for security and development.This fear narrative was strategically blended with reminders of the NDA's development agenda, juxtaposing past lawlessness with the promise of infrastructural progress and industrial investment under PM Modi and Nitish Kumar. Consequently, this scare tactic mobilised a wide voter base, particularly those who had lived through or remembered the earlier turbulence, reinforcing voter preference for the NDA coalition.One of the pivotal reasons for the NDA's landslide was its expanded caste coalition that transcended previous rigid caste alignments. Historically, Bihar politics hinged on the Muslim-Yadav (MY) alliance, which benefited the RJD.However, in 2025, a new arithmetic emerged emphasising mahila (women) and EBC (Economically Backward Classes) groups, creating a ‘ME’ factor that substantially boosted NDA’s vote share.NDA consolidated the upper castes through BJP, while Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) secured a strong base among Kurmis and EBCs, which constitute about 36% of Bihar’s population. Additionally, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Rashtriya Lok Morcha, and Hindustani Awam Morcha augmented the NDA’s Dalit and backward caste appeal, creating a broad and diverse coalition that cut across traditional lines.This strategy diluted the RJD’s reliance on a narrow caste bloc by integrating multiple caste groups and regenerating old alliances with renewed welfare outreach targeting EBCs and Dalits. The coalition’s inclusivity paved the way for securing nearly 49% of the vote against the Mahagathbandhan's 38%.Women played a decisive role in the NDA’s electoral sweep, with historic voter turnout gaps revealing women voted 10-20 percentage points higher than men in many districts such as Supaul, Kishanganj, and Madhubani.The Election Commission’s deployment of over 1.8 lakh Jeevika Didis — women volunteers guiding other women voters regarding booth locations and voting processes — significantly improved electoral participation among women and first-time young voters.NDA’s extensive welfare programs targeting women, including schemes for self-help groups, livelihood support, and social security, energised this vital demographic. The Nitish government's efforts to empower women, coupled with BJP’s national outreach, resonated deeply with female voters who perceived the NDA as a champion of their aspirations and safety.This mobilisation was complemented by adding more than 14 lakh new young voters, many women, expanding NDA’s voter base. The enhanced women voter turnout created a crucial margin that decisively contributed to the NDA’s overwhelming victory.Nitish Kumar’s enduring appeal and the resurgence of JD(U) significantly influenced the NDA’s 2025 triumph.Despite concerns over his age and governance challenges, Nitish remains Bihar’s most trusted political figure, often perceived as synonymous with good governance and development.The slogan ""Bihar Ka Matlab Nitish Kumar"" and ""Tiger abhi zinda hai"" resonated widely, cementing his centrality in voter perception.JD(U)'s comeback was marked by its strategic equal seat-sharing with the BJP, signaling strengthened confidence and relevance in Bihar politics despite BJP’s growing national role within the NDA. Nitish’s governance record on infrastructure and welfare, combined with his image as a stable leader capable of balancing Bihar's complex caste equations, reinforced voter trust.The synergy between Nitish’s JD(U) and BJP under the NDA created a unified front that could appeal to diverse electoral groups, blending Nitish's Kurmi and EBC support with BJP’s upper caste and youth outreach.","The National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) seems set to secure a historic win in Bihar with trends showing it is well on its way to secure 203 seats.

‘Bihar’s New MY Formula Is Mahila & Youth’: PM Modi Targets RJD-Congress After NDA’s Landslide Win

With the elections over, Bihar's finance department will have to pull out the spreadsheets to redo the fiscal arithmetic as the government will have to raise resources to not just meet the big promises made in the NDA manifesto, including more money to the 74 lakh farmers, SC students and others in the state, but also to fund capital expenditure (capex) to build two greenfield cities (New Patna and Sitapuram) and create farm infrastructure.In a state with an estimated fiscal deficit of 9.2% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) last year and own-tax revenue budgeted at 5.3% of state GDP this year, there is chatter of a review of prohibition imposed by Nitish Kumar in 2016. Getting the NDA to reverse the ban may not be easy as it has a lot of appeal with women voters who are pro-prohibition.But there is a large revenue potential since the state government was earning over Rs 3,000 crore annually from alcohol sales in 2015-16 - more than enough to cover the Rs 2,200 crore needed for additional direct transfer to farmers. At current prices, the mop-up will only be higher.In any case, the pre-poll announcement of Rs 10,000 for the currently enrolled 1.5 crore women under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana will cost Rs 15,000 crore.Besides, an increase in the monthly pension to Rs 1,100 for 1.1 crore elders, widows and disabled will result in an additional outgo of around Rs 8,500 crore with nearly Rs 4,000 crore likely to be provided for free electricity of up to 125 units.The bill will go beyond the additional Rs 28,000-crore outgo due to the schemes already implemented. After all, the NDA manifesto promises Rs 2,000 assistance to SC students in colleges and support to fisherfolk (see graphic).As a result, Bihar is unlikely to close the financial year with a budgeted fiscal deficit of 3% of state GDP this year, unless it can reduce other expenditure or raise resources from new sources.After all, with 60% of the expenditure already committed to interest payments, salaries and pension and other establishment-related spending, there are few options.",Bihar's finance department will have to pull out the spreadsheets to redo the fiscal arithmetic.

The land deal controversy

Activist’s allegations and demand

Pawar’s defence and political response

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday responded to activist Anjali Damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged Rs 300-crore land deal in Pune, saying he would “use his conscience” before making any decision.A company linked to his son, Parth Pawar is at the centre of the controversy surrounding the purchase of government-owned land in Pune’s Mundhwa area.The state government has since scrapped the deal and ordered an inquiry led by senior IAS officer Vikas Kharge.“I will use my conscience and take a decision,” Pawar told reporters in Pune when asked about Damania’s resignation demand, news agency PTI reported.The controversy involves around 40 acres of government land, reportedly valued at Rs 1,800 crore, which was sold to Amadea Enterprises LLP, a firm in which Parth Pawar holds a 99% partnership for Rs 300 crore. Following allegations of irregularities, the government cancelled the sale deed and suspended several officials.Revenue minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule confirmed that FIRs have been registered against three individuals involved in the transaction but said Parth Pawar’s name was not included, as it did not appear in the sale deed.However, the firm has been issued a notice to pay double stamp duty of Rs 42 crore to complete the cancellation process.Bawankule added that activist Anjali Damania met him on Wednesday and submitted documents related to the case.“I have told her that if she has any proofs, she can submit them to the inquiry committee,” he said, assuring that the probe would be free from interference.Anjali Damania accused Ajit Pawar of shielding his son and said a fair probe cannot happen while he remains in office, news agency United News of India (UNI) reported.“As long as Ajit Pawar is in power, a fair investigation is impossible. He must step down from both posts. Parth Pawar holds a 99% stake in the firm and yet no FIR has been registered against him,” Damania told reporters.She urged the state to register a case against Parth and ensure transparency in the inquiry.The deputy chief minister has denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations “random accusations” raised before local body elections. He maintained that Parth was unaware the land was government-owned.“I still don’t understand how a document can be registered without even a rupee being exchanged. The truth will come out soon,” he said.He also said he had already briefed chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and welcomed the inquiry.“If anyone close to me has done something wrong, I will never support it. I have told the Chief Minister to order a probe,” Pawar said. He added that the issue was “a lesson” for his son to be more cautious in future dealings.Meanwhile, minister Bawankule reiterated that the inquiry would continue independently under ACS Vikas Kharge.Bawankule said the officer heading the inquiry is honest and that there will be no interference in the investigation.","M Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar responds to activist Anjali Damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged Rs 300-crore land deal in Pune.

Indian Air Force Opens Nyoma Airbase In Ladakh, A Strategic Game-Changer Along The China Frontier

Nyoma airbase underwent Rs 230cr upgrade

NEW DELHI: In a major booster shot for military capabilities in eastern Ladakh, India on Wednesday operationalised its new Nyoma airbase close to the frontier with China, even as a large Army exercise called 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' is now under way in Arunachal Pradesh on the eastern front.The developments at the opposite ends of the 3,488-km LAC underscore the high military readiness being maintained along the China frontier. ""There is ongoing reset in bilateral diplomatic ties. Military CBMs are also being progressively strengthened but the trust deficit on the ground remains high,"" a senior officer told TOI. ""With no de-escalation along LAC, troops will continue to be forward deployed for 6th successive winter since multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020,"" he said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself flew a C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi to the Mudh airfield at Nyoma, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, to formally inaugurate the strategically located airbase. He was accompanied by Western Air Command chief Air Marshal Jeetendra Mishra.Located just about 35 km from the LAC, Nyoma has undergone an upgrade worth Rs 230 crore, which included extending the original airstrip into a 2.7-km 'rigid pavement' runway, a new ATC complex, hangars, crash bay and accommodation, as was earlier reported by TOI.The Mudh airfield is now fully capable of handling and sustaining operations by heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. Primarily, it will help quickly rush troops, weapons and supplies to areas such as Pangong Tso, Demchok and Depsang in eastern Ladakh.The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026 though high altitude will be a limiting factor. China has assiduously upgraded all its airbases facing India over the last five years to offset the terrain constraints due to high-altitude and rarefied air, which limits the weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.China now has additional fighters, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters, as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones deployed at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping.

Andrew Tate’s net worth has become one of the most debated topics online. While several platforms estimate his fortune to be around $20-$170 million in 2025, Romanian authorities, however, estimate it closer to $12 million based on seized assets, company records, and digital holdings.

His platform, “Hustler’s University”, reportedly has over 100,000 subscribers paying $49.99 a month. His fame increased after bans on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and earlier on Twitter, which was restored in 2022.Tate is known for his flashy car collection. He owns a Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport, two Ferrari 812 models, a McLaren 720s, two Lamborghinis, a Rolls-Royce Wraith, and more.

Inside H-1B row: How Trump’s sudden U-turns could leave America losing the talent war to foreigners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/inside-h-1b-row-how-trumps-sudden-u-turns-could-leave-america-losing-the-talent-war-to-foreigners/articleshow/125333580.cms,"'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers

What are H1-B visas and who uses them



How are American jobs at risk



Supporters say the programme keeps America competitive



MAGA does not like Trump's U-turn







A heated national row over jobs, immigration and the future of the American workforce has intensified after President Donald Trump suggested that the United States “doesn’t have certain talents” earlier this week, even as the Trump Administation tightens rules around the H1-B visa programme.The GOP leader's latest comments have reignited a long-running political fight over whether foreign workers are helping American innovation or displacing American workers.The H1-B visa allows companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialised fields for up to six years. It is intended for people of “exceptional merit and ability”, typically with at least a bachelor’s degree. The tech sector remains the biggest user of the programme, accounting for up to 70 percent of applications each year. Engineering, consulting, healthcare and university research also rely heavily on the visa.India dominates the applicant pool, making up 73 per cent of all H1-B visa holders, followed by China at 12 per cent, according to Fox News. Universities and non-profit research institutions are exempt from the usual annual cap of 65,000 visas, plus an additional 20,000 for applicants with advanced degrees, which means the total number of approvals is often far higher.Pew Research Center estimates around 400,000 approvals in the last year alone.Opposition to the programme spans both Republicans and Democrats. Critics argue that the system is being abused to import cheaper labour and push aside American workers.In September, Trump issued a presidential proclamation accusing the H1-B system of being “deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labour”. He said this practice “has undermined both our economic and national security”.Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on each new H1-B visa application, effective September 21. His administration is also introducing stricter definitions of “specialty occupation”, expanding compliance inspections, and requiring employers to file applications directly rather than through third-party contractors.Many business leaders warn that harsh restrictions could push talent and investment overseas. The US Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit to block the new $100,000 fee, arguing it violates immigration law and would make the programme “cost-prohibitive” for small and mid-size companies.Elon Musk is among the most vocal defenders of the visa system, noting that many of the engineers who helped build Tesla and SpaceX first arrived in the United States on H1-B visas. He said, “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.”Despite his own sweeping restrictions, Trump stirred a row this week by insisting that the United States still needed foreign workers because “people have to learn”. He added that “the United States doesn’t have certain talents” and warned that some highly technical defence and technology roles cannot simply be filled by “taking people off an unemployment line”.His remarks have frustrated parts of his MAGA base, who view the comment as undercutting his America First message. Others argue it reveals the core tension at the centre of the H1-B debate: the nation wants to protect American jobs, but it also fears falling behind global competitors like China, which recently launched its own talent visa known as the K visa.","The H1-B visa allows companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialised fields for up to six years.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





Vice President JD Vance spoke out on the issue of foreign workers in the US amid the ongoing H-1B row triggered by President Donald Trump's recent statement that US needs 'certain' talents from other countries. As Vance spoke to Sean Hannity, he said the Democrat model was to import more low-wage immigrants which he said hurt the jobs, wages and prosperity.Vance said the choice is between low-wage immigrants and American citizens empowered by technology. The VP said Trump's model is the second one which will pave prosperity for America.As Vance said US should avoid relying on low-wage workers and instead focus on using technology to empower the blue-collar workers, he struck a different chord with the President. Because the president said America lacks certain types of talent and cited the example of the battery plant in Georgia that was raided.“They raided because they wanted illegal immigrants out. They had people from South Korea that made batteries all their lives. You know, making batteries are very complicated. It’s not an easy thing and very dangerous,"" Trump said adding that the South Korean company had “like five or six hundred people, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it.Well, they wanted them to get out of the country. ""You're going to need that,"" Trump said when he was asked whether H-1B visa will be a big priority for his administration.H-1B visa program is for high-skilled individuals, mostly employed in tech and education sectors. But while Trump said US needs foreign workers, Vance said US does not need low-wage foreign workers.“Their (the Democrats) idea was the way that we get more prosperity is that you import more and more low-wage servants and that actually I think reduced prosperity, because it meant that a lot of our blue-collar workers were struggling. But if you use technology and you empower the blue-collar workers rather than replace them with foreign labor, I think they are going to do way better, they are going to make higher wages and the whole country is going to be better off,"" Vance said.""In other words, do you depend on low-wage immigrants or do you depend on American citizens bolstered by technology and innovation? That’s the Trump model,"" Vance added.","Vice President JD Vance spoke out on the issue of foreign workers in the US amid the ongoing H-1B row triggered by President Donald Trump's recent statement that US needs 'certain' talents from other countries.

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well” Facebook-parent Meta made a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup in June.

SEBI’s advisory in digital gold



Read SEBI’s advisory here:



SEBI has enabled investments in gold and gold related instruments through various SEBI regulated gold products. These are exchange traded commodity derivative contracts, Gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) offered by Mutual Funds and Electronic Gold Receipts (EGRs) tradeable on stock exchanges. Investments in these SEBI regulated gold products can be made through SEBI registered intermediaries and are governed by the regulatory framework prescribed by SEBI.

It has come to the notice of SEBI that some digital/online platforms are offering investors to invest in ""Digital Gold/E-Gold Products'. Digital Gold is being marketed as an alternative for investment in physical gold.

In this context, it is informed that such digital gold products are different from SEBI regulated gold products as they are neither notified as securities nor regulated as commodity derivatives. They operate entirely outside the purview of SEBI. Such digital gold products may entail significant risks for investors and may expose investors to counterparty and operational risks.

Investors/ participants are made aware that none of the investor protection mechaims under securities market purview shall be available for investments in such Digital Gold/ E-Gold products.





Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath has now issued a cautionary note for the investors following SEBI’s recent advisory on digital gold. For those unaware, earlier this week SEBI issued a an advisory on digital gold calling it an unregulated and inefficient way to gain exposureto the precious metal. Now Kamath shared a post of social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) advising the users to not to go after digital gold and instead opt for the one of the safest and easiest ways — gold ETFs if they want to inset in gold. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” wrote Kamath.In a post shared on X, Kamath emphasised that digital gold is not regulated by any financial authority, which means that investors have limited recourse if the platforms selling it collapse or default.He noted that most buyers are unaware of this regulatory gap. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” Kamath wrote.Along with this, Kamath also pointed out the high upfront costs associated with digital gold purchases such as a 3% GST, plus 2–3% in spreads, which in tern means that the investors will lose another 6% immediately after buying digital gold, even before the regulatory risks kick in.Kamath also said that with Sovereign Gold Bonds going away, the only safest and easiest way to invest in gold is through gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Now that Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) have stopped, gold ETFs remain one of the safest and easiest ways to get exposure to gold,’ Kamath.The remarks made by Kamath align with the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) recent warning about the risks of investing in digital gold. SEBI cautioned that these products are not covered under its regulatory framework and urged investors to exercise due diligence.","Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath has issued a cautionary note for the investors following SEBI’s recent advisory on digital gold.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai, is not just a figurehead of royalty—he is a man of extraordinary wealth, influence, and interests. With an estimated personal net worth ranging from $1 billion to $2 billion, Sheikh Hamdan is one of the wealthiest and most influential royals in the world. This fortune is drawn from a variety of sources, including luxurious real estate, superyachts, private jets, and rare car collections. However, these estimates often focus only on his personal assets, and his actual wealth is likely far greater when considering his family's assets and the extensive holdings tied to the Al Maktoum family.In fact, some reports estimate that the Al Maktoum family, led by Sheikh Hamdan's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, has a net worth that ranges between $14 billion to $18 billion, a figure that is widely cited but likely underestimates the full scale of their wealth. In reality, due to the private nature of royal assets and the lack of public disclosures, the family's true wealth could be much higher than these estimates.Sheikh Hamdan's personal net worth, estimated between $1 billion and $2 billion, is significant but only scratches the surface of his family's total wealth. His fortune is tied to a combination of private investments, his role as Crown Prince, and assets across various industries. Below is a breakdown of his key wealth sources:Sheikh Hamdan’s love for luxury yachts is well known, and he is the proud owner of several high-end vessels:In addition to his yachts, Sheikh Hamdan has access to private jets and notably, a Boeing 747-400 from the Dubai Royal Air Wing, valued between $100 million to $270 million, offering luxurious interiors for personal and official traveSheikh Hamdan is renowned for his collection of luxury cars, many of which are limited-edition supercars. His garage reportedly includes:Along with his love for high-performance sports cars, Sheikh Hamdan has an affinity for luxury SUVs, particularly the Mercedes AMG G63, which is said to be his favourite vehicle.Sheikh Hamdan’s wealth extends far beyond cars and yachts; he is also deeply invested in real estate. His properties span Dubai and include:Sheikh Hamdan’s wealth is not confined to personal residences; his real estate investments form a substantial part of his overall fortune. Through Zabeel Investments and other holdings, he has acquired a mix of luxury residential towers, commercial developments, mansion compounds, and hospitality assets. These investments reflect both his personal tastes for opulence and his strategic role in shaping Dubai’s urban and economic landscape.This estimate combines his official residences, private estates, high-value real estate projects, and luxury lifestyle assets such as superyachts and jets. While these numbers provide a snapshot of Sheikh Hamdan’s tangible wealth, his actual financial influence and holdings likely extend far beyond these figures, particularly when considering his family’s overall fortune and the value of assets tied to the Al Maktoum dynasty.Sheikh Hamdan’s love for animals is well known, and he maintains an exclusive private zoo separate from Zabeel Palace. Located near Nad Al Sheba and close to the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve, this private zoo houses a diverse collection of exotic animals, including white lions, giraffes, elephants, and tigers. The zoo is meticulously designed with state-of-the-art facilities, including specialized veterinary care and spacious habitats tailored to the needs of the animals.In addition to his exotic collection, Sheikh Hamdan is a passionate falconer, preserving and promoting falconry—a treasured Emirati heritage sport. He owns a private falconry centre equipped with a specialized falcon hospital, providing surgeries, X-rays, and emergency care for his prized birds. The Crown Prince actively participates in falconry competitions such as the Fazza Championship for Falconry and supports international exhibitions, showcasing his commitment to sustaining this centuries-old tradition.Sheikh Hamdan frequently shares glimpses of his animal kingdom and falconry pursuits on Instagram, where his 17 million+ followers see him interacting with elephants, giraffes, lions, and falcons. These posts highlight not only his love for wildlife but also his active role in conservation and cultural preservation.","Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is a key member of Dubai's royal family.

‘Deport Him…’: Team Trump Moves To Strip Mamdani Of US Citizenship After NYC Win

New York will survive, but will get worse before it gets better







Billionaire real estate investor Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai as he pledged to freeze rents because tenants' incomes have stagnated. Sternlicht who has both commercial and residential holdings in NYC said when one neighbor finds out that their neighbor is not paying, they stop paying and thus NYC will turn into Mumbai.“Over $100 million, every project in New York has to go union, and it’s super expensive. It leads to extremely expensive housing. And other developers have tried to cut deals with the unions, but they rule New York, and that’s one of the key reasons the blue states are so expensive and they’re so difficult to add supply of housing to,” Sternlicht said in an interview with CNBC Property Play, reacting to Mamdani's win.“And then the far left gets really nuts and says the tenants don’t have to pay. Well, you can’t kick them out if they don’t pay. So the neighbor finds out the neighbor isn’t paying, and they don’t pay, and the next guy doesn’t pay, and then you’re basically going to turn New York City into Mumbai,"" he said.Sternlicht said his New York team is considering leaving the city as well.“The core issues are not what he’s focusing on. We need to increase housing.That’s not going to happen easily, right? You need serious subsidies from the government if they want us to work with unions. The unions have to be more accommodative on their work laws and the wages and everything else, otherwise you can’t add economically,"" he said. Sternlicht said rent freezing is not the solution but increasing housing is.Sternlicht said he believed New York will survive but will first gets a lot worse before it gets better. “People are working really hard. Just how do we help others to do well and believe in the American dream? That’s probably a better message for a leader in the city than saying, let’s just tax everyone who’s been successful, force them to leave and then have to rely on Washington for handouts to basically keep the city going,” Sternlicht added.","Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai.

Red Sea Global: Driving regenerative development









Saudi Arabia is set to redefine luxury, wellness, and economic impact with the opening of AMAALA Triple Bay. Developed by Red Sea Global, the ultra-luxury coastal destination on the Red Sea is projected to create 50,000 jobs and inject USD 3 billion into the nation’s GDP, marking a landmark step in the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 transformation. Beyond its economic significance, AMAALA promises an unparalleled fusion of regenerative tourism, wellness experiences, and world-class hospitality.AMAALA, derived from the Arabic word for hope, is nestled across three naturally occurring bays where the Hijaz Mountains meet the Red Sea. The destination offers a new approach to coastal luxury, with a focus on wellness, rejuvenation, and connection to nature.Its guiding principle is simple: to help guests and residents “live longer, better,” whether through tranquil retreats or adventure-filled experiences along the sun-drenched coastline.John Pagano, Group CEO of Red Sea Global, underscores the ambition: AMAALA is envisioned as the new home of wellness, drawing inspiration from Saudi Arabia’s long-standing traditions of retreat and renewal. The destination is designed to balance high-end luxury with environmental and cultural stewardship.AMAALA’s launch will introduce six world-class resorts, alongside a yacht club, marine life institute, state-of-the-art marina, and a Marina Village. A 5km linear park, the Wellness Route, will connect the resorts and experiences, allowing visitors to traverse pristine natural surroundings seamlessly.Additional first-phase attractions include Corallium, a three-level marine life institute highlighting the Red Sea’s biodiversity, and the AMAALA Hotel, offering 144 keys and multiple dining options for staff and guests alike.AMAALA is integral to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. Red Sea Global anticipates the project will create 50,000 jobs and contribute SAR 11 billion (USD 3 billion) to the national GDP upon completion. Phase One alone involved an investment of SAR 51.04 billion, encompassing nine resorts and over 1,600 keys. Future openings include the Clinique La Prairie Health Resort, Jayasom Wellness Resort, and The Ritz-Carlton Resort.The destination also promotes sustainable development at a global scale. Designed to host no more than 500,000 visitors annually, AMAALA aims to achieve a 30% net conservation benefit to local ecosystems by 2040.

Jay Palmer, Vallabhaneni's consultant who prepared the lawsuit, said it is a Squid Game for Indian workers in the US job market, as the ultimate goal is to stay in America, surviving the exploitative culture, created by Indian CEOs.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





Tapping into the MAGA base’s disaffection with the job market, rebellious Republican lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG), who is already on a warpath with President Trump on various issues, announced on Thursday she will introduce legislation to aggressively phase out the H-1B visa program, which she brands a ""corrupt"" tool for ""mass replacement"" of American workers.The proposal, unveiled in a viral X post viewed nearly 2 million times, targets Big Tech, AI firms, hospitals, and other industries accused of abusing the system to undercut US “talent” with “cheaper” foreign labor, mainly from India, whose nationals get around 70 percent of H-1B visas. Greene's bill would eliminate the program entirely, stripping its pathway to citizenship and forcing visa holders to return home upon expiration.A narrow exemption allows 10,000 annual visas for medical professionals like doctors and nurses—vital amid US healthcare shortages—but even this cap phases out over 10 years to foster a ""domestic pipeline"" of American physicians. The measure also bars non-citizen medical students from Medicare-funded residencies, citing last year's imbalance where over 9,000 US graduates went unmatched while 5,000 foreign-born doctors secured spots.A staunch ""America First"" proponent, Greene argues the H-1B—intended for temporary, high-skill gaps—has devolved into a decades-long scam displacing innovative Americans in tech, engineering, manufacturing, and beyond, a sketchy allegation lacking factual basis despite stray cases of fraud. ""Big Tech, AI giants, hospitals, and industries across the board have abused the H-1B system to cut out our own people,"" she declared in a video statement, emphasizing faith in US ingenuity: ""Americans are the most talented people in the world. .. If we want the next generation to have the American Dream, we must stop replacing them and start investing in them."" Several studies and surveys challenge such assertions, showing shortcoming in the US education system and a chronic shortage of American workers in specialty professions.Support is coalescing among MAGA hardliners echoing Greene's nativist fervor. Far-right activist Laura Loomer, an MTG critic and Trump loyalist, has also long railed against H-1Bs as ""indentured servitude"" that depresses wages, aligning with Greene's narrative despite their mutual antagonism. Steve Bannon, the ex-Trump strategist, blasted the program on his War Room podcast, calling for it to be ""zeroed-out"" to halt ""foreign worker replacements. "" Bipartisan reformers like Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin, Democrat from Illinois, have long called for H-1B/L-1 visa reform for fraud prevention, though not full elimination.The Trump administration has been walking a tightrope on the issue, with the President appearing to defend the program earlier this week, insisting the US lacks ""certain talents"" for tech and defense roles, and later sending out his surrogates to finesse the issue after a MAGA uproar, with administration officials suggesting Trump wants foreign workers to train Americans and then return to their home country. The President has previously been all-in for H-1B visas.But such is the MAGA fervor that officials and lawmakers who had previously supported the H-1B program are cautiously reeling back. In a notable pivot this week, Florida Congressman Byron Donald, mocked by MAGA as H1Byron, told a conservative host Benny Johnson he'd ""love to see the program go away completely."" Florida governor Ron Desantis recently directed the state's public universities to halt using H-1B hires for “non-elite roles” such as assistant athletic coaches, media relations specialists, public policy professors, psychologists, and graphic designers—positions he argued could and should be filled by qualified Americans or Florida residentsDespite such turnaround, chances of MTG’s proposal succeeding are considered slim given her track record of 70 dud bills in the House, leading critics to call her a ""stunt legislator,"" who thrives on headlines. In recent weeks, she has gone on a rampage against Trump, challenging his claim that prices are dropping, demanding release of the Epstein files, and complaining the President is spending too much time on foreign affairs at the expense of domestic priorities.","Republican lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG) announced on Thursday she will introduce legislation to aggressively phase out the H-1B visa program.

Marjorie Taylor Greene sent thousands of foreign workers into a spit after announcing a plan to phase out the H-1B visa programme. This move deepens internal MAGA divisions over immigration and future of the American workforce.The Republican congresswoman said her goal is to “END the mass replacement of American workers” by shutting down the visa route that allows highly skilled professionals from foreign countries to work in the United States.Her intervention arrives at a time when US President Donald Trump is defending the need for specialised foreign talent, H1-B visas and green cards by saying that America does not have enough domestic talent and needs help from abroad to fill important jobs in sectors like technology and defence. This statement by the GOP leader has been seen as a betrayal by some MAGA hardliners, who argue that Trump has stepped back from his ""America First"" agenda.Greene said on X: “I am introducing a bill to END the mass replacement of American workers by aggressively phasing out the H1B program. Big Tech, AI giants, hospitals, and industries across the board have abused the H-1B system to cut out our own people. Americans are the most talented people in the world, and I have full faith in the American people.I serve Americans only, and I will ALWAYS put Americans first.”She added that her proposal “ELIMINATES the corrupt H-1B program and puts AMERICANS FIRST again in tech, healthcare, engineering, manufacturing, and every industry that keeps this country running!! If we want the next generation to have the American Dream, we must stop replacing them and start investing in them.”The H-1B visa is widely relied upon by American technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon to fill roles in areas requiring advanced technical qualifications, according to Newsweek. Around 400,000 visas were approved in 2024, most of them renewals rather than first-time applications.Greene’s bill includes one temporary exemption. She says 10,000 visas per year could still be issued to medical professionals like doctors and nurses, but this would also be phased out over ten years.Her stance stands in contrast to Trump’s recent comments on Fox News, where he defended maintaining the programme. He argued that the United States does not currently have enough trained workers for certain roles in technology and defence. “No, you don’t. You don’t have certain talents,” he said, adding that “people have to learn!” He also said: “You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say 'I’m gonna put you into a factory where we’re gonna make missiles. ' It doesn't work that way.”In September, Trump introduced a $100,000 annual fee for new applicants and increased oversight of the system.",Marjorie Taylor Greene announced a plan to phase out the H-1B visa programme.

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

Prices surge, tandoors punished

Trade paralysis and a deepening food crisis

Water shortage adds to worries – dams running dry





(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s twin cities are staring at a worsening flour emergency after the Punjab food department halted wheat supplies to mills in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, triggering panic across markets and raising questions over the country’s fragile food security. The sudden suspension has deepened an already tense economic climate, with transport blockades, water shortages and declining dam levels all feeding fears of another nationwide crisis.Dealers say all existing orders for flour, wheat and fine flour were cancelled from Friday night, leaving shops and tandoor owners without stock, PTI reported citing the The Express Tribune.The Rawalpindi Flour Mills Association, which held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, warned that “production will remain paralysed” unless wheat permits are restored immediately. The association described the ban as “ill-considered” and cautioned that shortages could spiral into a humanitarian emergency in the federal capital and adjoining regions.Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers. According to the Pakistan Naanbai Association, the price of a 79-kilogram sack of red flour has doubled to PKR 11,000 since the Shehbaz Sharif–Maryam Nawaz government took office.Fine flour, used widely for bread and bakery items, has risen from PKR 6,200 to PKR 12,600.The association’s president, Shafiq Qureshi, accused authorities of “state oppression”, claiming that dozens of tandoors have been demolished and nearly a hundred sealed for selling roti at higher prices in line with rising flour rates. Many owners have been fined between PKR 25,000 and PKR 50,000. “Instead of fixing the wheat supply, they are taking out their frustration on us,” Qureshi said, warning that families are being pushed to breaking point as bread becomes increasingly unaffordable.While wheat supply chokes Punjab’s food chain, Pakistan’s transport routes are already gridlocked due to deteriorating relations with Afghanistan. Thousands of trucks carrying food items, pharmaceuticals and export consignments for Afghanistan and Central Asia have been stranded at ports and highways.Senior Vice Chairman of the Goods Transport Association Imdad Hussain Naqvi said drivers are stuck without food, water or security. “This is not just a loss for transporters; it's a loss for the entire state,” he said, as quoted by PTI. He further warned that perishable goods are rotting on highways and thousands of workers are on the brink of starvation.The current wheat crisis comes months after India regulated flows from the Chenab following the Pahalgam terror attack. The move had contributed to a sharp drop in water levels at the country’s two key dams, Mangla and Tarbela.Pakistan is among six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use, worsening freshwater losses amid arid conditions, according to the World Bank’s first global water monitoring report, Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future.The study highlights that inefficient irrigation in drying regions—particularly in Pakistan, Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Thailand, Tunisia, and Romania—drives massive water waste, with more than two-thirds linked to water-intensive crops.","Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers.

UK conducts first ever trial for passport-free border control using facial recognition at Manchester Airport,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-conducts-first-ever-trial-for-passport-free-border-control-using-facial-recognition-at-manchester-airport/articleshow/125247799.cms,"The UK trialled facial recognition e-gates at Manchester Airport, allowing British travellers to skip passports/Representative Image

A glimpse of the future at Manchester Airport





Building an “Intelligent” border





Results, reactions and next steps





Britain’s place in a global shift









The United Kingdom has begun trials of a “contactless” border control system, allowing British travellers to re-enter the country without presenting their passports. The technology, which uses facial recognition to verify identity, was tested over three weeks at Manchester Airport and marks a major step towards what officials call an “intelligent, frictionless border. ”Passengers arriving at Manchester Airport in October became the first to pass through Britain’s experimental contactless border. For three weeks, British passport holders were able to clear immigration without scanning their passports. Instead, their faces were matched against existing government databases through AI-driven facial recognition systems integrated into the familiar e-gates.Phil Douglas, director-general of Border Force, confirmed that the trial had “considerably reduced” processing times. He described the new experience succinctly: “People approach the e-gate, it recognises them as already on our database, and they’re checked through.” The system’s success has prompted officials to consider a wider rollout, signalling a potential transformation in how Britain manages its borders.Douglas said the Manchester trial forms part of a broader effort to modernise the UK’s borders. “The border has really changed over the last few years and that work is picking up pace,” he noted.Advances in artificial intelligence, biometrics and digital identity verification are now being combined with traditional checks such as passports and visas.Plans for the contactless border were first disclosed last year, when the Border Force outlined its ambition for an “intelligent border” designed to make crossings smoother while maintaining security. More than 270 e-gates are already in use across Britain’s airports and ports. Under new contracts, the number is set to expand, with Douglas stating: “It’s our intention that almost everybody will go through an e-gate of one description or another. ”While the technology promises faster movement, Douglas stressed the importance of preserving what he termed the “theatre” of the border—the visible sense that every traveller is still subject to scrutiny. “When people are crossing the border, they’re stopped, and it’s a moment they know they’re being checked,” he said. “New technology must not remove that feeling.”According to Douglas, the Manchester pilot demonstrated that the new system can sharply cut transaction times, making Britain’s border performance “compete pretty well with almost any other country.” Some airports, however, have raised an unusual concern: passengers are clearing border control so quickly that baggage reclaim areas risk becoming congested. “It has been said to me by some airports, ‘don’t get too fast, because then you’ll give us a problem at baggage collection’,” Douglas remarked.The contactless system remains limited to British passport holders for now, but the government intends to expand its reach. Over the past decade, e-gates have gradually been opened to arrivals from countries including Australia, Canada, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the United States. The new technology is expected to extend this inclusivity further, aligning the UK with international leaders in biometric border management.The trial places the UK alongside nations such as the United States, Australia and the United Arab Emirates, which have invested heavily in biometric border technology. Dubai, for instance, already permits contactless passage for citizens of 50 nationalities. Britain’s approach aims to meet this “gold standard,” positioning its border as one of the most technologically advanced in the world.Douglas contrasted the UK’s innovations with the European Union’s forthcoming Entry/Exit System, which will soon require British travellers to provide fingerprints and photographs upon each entry and exit. By comparison, the UK’s biometric recognition system seeks to simplify travel rather than add new layers of formality.","The UK has begun trials of a “contactless” border control system, allowing British travellers to re-enter the country without presenting their passports.

Honourable mentions







Turbulent times are ahead for the BBC as the search for the next director general begins following Tim Davie’s resignation, which came after the corporation broadcast a doctored version of Donald Trump’s Jan 6 speech that the White House condemned as misleading.With questions over bias dominating headlines and key funding talks approaching, BBC chair Samir Shah has urged a “smooth transition” as he begins the search for Davie’s successor, according to the Guardian.The BBC is under pressure on several fronts. Its news output is facing backlash and its audience habits are shifting. The next director general will need both a newsroom background and strong commercial experience. This has shaped a developing list of front-runners, some familiar from the last recruitment round and others newly in contention who could replace Davie, now the former director who served for over 20 years in BBC.One of the most talked-about names is former Channel 4 chief executive Alex Mahon, who was previously approached about the job but chose not to take part in the final shortlist. Mahon recently left Channel 4 after nearly eight years in charge, becoming the broadcaster’s first female chief executive and leading it through threats of privatisation, major restructuring and crises including the Russell Brand scandal.She has now become chief executive of Superstruct, a private equity-backed live entertainment company that runs events such as Boardmasters in Cornwall. The question is whether the chance to become the BBC’s first female director general would tempt her to leave her new role.Charlotte Moore, the BBC’s former director of content, was also a finalist last time. She oversaw a budget of £1 billion and helped deliver huge hits such as The Great British Bake Off, Luther and Bodyguard. Moore has recently taken over as chief executive of Left Bank Pictures, the Sony-owned studio behind The Crown. Her return to the BBC is considered possible but not guaranteed, given the timing of her new position.Jay Hunt, currently creative director for worldwide video and Europe at Apple TV Plus, is another strong contender. She has held senior positions at Channel 4, Channel 5 and the BBC, including editing the BBC’s flagship news programmes and later running BBC One. At Channel 4, she orchestrated the high-profile acquisition of The Great British Bake Off from the BBC, and at Apple she has overseen successes including Slow Horses. Her mix of news, entertainment and international streaming experience makes her stand out.ITV boss Carolyn McCall is said to be weighing up her future while exploring a possible sale of ITV’s television business to Comcast. She was approached for the BBC role previously and remains highly regarded, but after almost eight demanding years at ITV she may be reluctant to take on another exhausting challenge.Several names that surfaced in past searches are being discussed again. All3Media chief Jane Turton and former Sky executive Sophie Turner Laing were both approached previously. Turner Laing now leads the National Film and Television School’s board and has not held a major executive post in recent years, which could work against her.The 2020 shortlist also featured Will Lewis, now chief executive of the Washington Post. Allegations linked to the phone-hacking scandal, which he denies, are seen as making him a high-risk option for the BBC. Another former finalist, Doug Gurr, the one-time head of Amazon’s UK operations, currently serves as the interim chair of the Competition and Markets Authority.","The BBC is under pressure on several fronts.

What the DNA findings actually show





Dispelling myths about Hitler’s ancestry

Exploring possible neurodiverse and mental health indicators

How researchers obtained Hitler’s genetic material

What science can illuminate, and what it cannot





A new forensic genetic analysis featured in Channel 4’s documentary Hitler’s DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator is offering unprecedented scientific insight into Adolf Hitler’s biological and medical history. Using DNA recovered from blood-stained cloth taken from the sofa where Hitler died in 1945, researchers suggest he may have had multiple sexual-development abnormalities, including the possibility of a micropenis, an undescended testicle and Kallmann syndrome, a condition that disrupts hormonal development and puberty. The findings challenge long-circulated rumours while shedding fresh light on aspects of his life long shrouded in speculation.The genetic analysis indicates that Hitler likely carried markers associated with Kallmann syndrome, a congenital condition that affects reproductive development. Individuals with the disorder may experience reduced testosterone, lack of puberty, infertility and underdeveloped sexual organs.The researchers note that people with this condition have a one-in-ten chance of having a micropenis. While the DNA cannot confirm this definitively, the new evidence aligns with historical accounts suggesting Hitler may have had genital abnormalities.Stories from the First World War described ridicule from fellow soldiers, and a 1923 medical record discovered in 2015 documented that Hitler had an undescended testicle.Professor Turi King, the geneticist leading the study, said she approached the project with caution but believed it was important to carry out the work with scientific rigour. Her previous work identifying the remains of King Richard III lent credibility to the approach and methodology.The documentary also debunks one of the most persistent myths about Hitler: the rumour that he had Jewish ancestry. Genetic markers associated with that lineage were not found in the analysed sample. Historians have long argued there is no credible evidence for the claim, and the DNA results reinforce that conclusion.For a dictator who built policy around ideas of racial purity, the destruction of this myth is a significant historical clarification.The DNA analysis suggests Hitler showed elevated genetic markers linked to conditions such as autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, experts stress that these findings do not amount to a diagnosis. Genes can indicate predispositions but cannot determine behaviour, personality or moral choices.Dr Alex Tsompanidis, an autism researcher at the University of Cambridge, emphasised that no psychiatric label can be retroactively applied. He noted that environmental, social and personal factors play far larger roles in shaping behaviour than genetics alone.Professor Sir Simon Baron-Cohen warned that associating Hitler’s crimes with neurodiverse traits risks creating stigma. Most people with such conditions are neither violent nor cruel, he stressed, and many are empathetic and peaceful.The DNA sample used for the study originated from a blood-stained fabric cut by a US Army colonel from Hitler’s bunker sofa shortly after his death. Advances in forensic genetics made it possible to extract and sequence fragments of DNA decades later, though the researchers acknowledged the limitations of working with an aged and degraded sample.The scientific team verified the integrity of the material through multiple checks, following standards similar to those used in other historical forensic investigations.The new DNA analysis paints a clearer picture of Hitler’s possible medical conditions and helps separate biological fact from long-standing myth. It supports rumours about his sexual-development abnormalities, dismisses claims about Jewish ancestry and offers clues to potential neurodiverse markers.But the researchers are clear that genetics alone cannot explain the motivations or actions of one of history’s most destructive figures. Biology may influence development, but it does not predetermine cruelty or ideology.","DNA recovered from blood-stained cloth taken from the sofa where Hitler died in 1945.

Ultracheap and still duty-free

Millions of packages from China

Protecting consumers in the EU

EU authorities are not sitting still

EU countries are not sitting still either





When Chinese fast-fashion online retailer Shein opened its first boutique last week, there were both protests and a crowd of shoppers.The brick-and-mortar shop inside the BHV Marais department store in central Paris hit a nerve and not just because it is in the home of haute couture. It was a love-hate response to the company seen in many other areas.Shein, which is often put in the same category as the Temu online platform that allows manufacturers to sell much more than just fashion directly to consumers, has been criticized for things like counterfeits, aggressive marketing, poor working conditions, and unsafe products. Despite that, many are happy with more shopping options and the cheap prices.Though the two companies are different and have different business models, the result is often the same: a flood of cheap Chinese goods and the packaging to go along with it.Besides simply being ultracheap, another factor that played in the companies' favor is the European Union 's exemption from import duties for packages valued under €150 ($174).The US had a similar loophole for packages valued under $800 (€691), but has changed its regulations leading to a reduction in shipments.The EU is in the final stages of passing a similar rule to close its own low-value loophole, though it may not come into force until 2028.In the first half of 2025, Temu had an average of 115 million monthly active users in the EU and Shein had 145 million, according to their own numbers. For both platforms, this is around 12% more than the previous six months.One of the biggest concerns about these Chinese e-commerce platforms is sustainability. A majority of goods bought on their platforms are sent directly to consumers around the world from manufacturers in China. These individually packed goods are flown in for quick delivery and overwhelm customs authorities and often cannot be returned.Environmental groups are concerned about the clothing waste caused by cheap fast fashion, the plastic and cardboard packaging trash, plus the emissions from all those flights to move the goods around the world. And the numbers are indeed huge.In 2024, around 4.6 billion low-value items were imported into the EU, according to a report published in February by the EU executive Commission. That is twice the number in 2023 and more than triple the number in 2022.Of these 12 million packages a day, 91% are from China. Not all of these packages are from Temu or Shein, but together they have a huge share of the pie.""Europe is inundated by a tsunami of small parcels coming from China, and it's not about to stop,"" Agustin Reyna, director general of the Brussels-based European Consumer Organization (BEUC), told DW.Besides sustainability issues, consumer protection watchdogs and the European Commission have repeatedly warned of unsafe products that don't meet EU standards.New test results published on October 30 by Stiftung Warentest, an independent organization based in Berlin that specializes in product testing, reinforce what many fear.The tests, which were conducted with groups from Belgium and Denmark, showed dramatic results. Together, they looked into necklaces, USB chargers and baby toys.Of the 162 items purchased from manufacturers selling through Temu and Shein, 110 were not up to EU standards, and around a quarter were potentially dangerous. Some of the items had high levels of formaldehyde or heavy metals like cadmium. Some of the USB charges simply got too hot.The European Consumer Organisation thinks flouting safety regulations leads to unfair competition since some companies sell products that do not meet European safety standards, while local companies must follow such rules.In May, the EU Commission notified Shein about practices on its platform that infringe EU consumer law. Among the complaints are fake discounts, pressuring consumers to complete purchases, misleading information about consumers' legal rights, deceptive product labels and misleading sustainability claims.In July, the Commission preliminarily found that Temu is in breach of its obligations under the Digital Services Act by not doing enough to stop the sale of illegal products. Further investigations are ongoing and could lead to a large fine.In October, Germany's antitrust authority, the Cartel Office, initiated proceedings against Temu. They want to see if the platform is possibly influencing the pricing on its German online marketplace, including setting the final selling prices.In August, Shein was fined €1 million by Italy's competition authority for using misleading environmental claims.In July, Shein was fined €40 million by France's competition agency for misleading discounts and environmental claims. That brings total French fines for the company this year to €191 million.France has gone a step further and is working on new regulations for fast-fashion companies like Temu and Shein. If approved, it would ban their ads in France, force them to report on the environmental effects of their goods and add a levy of up to €10 for each garment bought.Big fines and more regulations may slow Chinese e-commerce giants but will not stop them.""Europe needs to get its act together and make Temu and Shein accountable,"" said Agustin Reyna. ""We need clear responsibilities and deterrent consequences when the products they sell break our rules.""To make this happen, the EU needs ambitious customs reform and market surveillance. But if the EU allows packages valued under €150 to come in duty-free until 2028, companies will continue to take advantage of the loophole and European customers will likely keep shopping.","In 2024, around 4.6 billion low-value items were imported into the EU, according to a report published in February. Of these 12 million packages a day, 91% are from China.

Fujian Vs Ford: China Unveils Its Most Advanced Carrier, Reshaping Indo-Pacific Power Balance





PARIS: China's CO2 emissions remained flat in the third quarter as power generation from solar energy surged and electric car use continued to grow, a study showed on Tuesday.Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months, said the analysis published by climate news specialist Carbon Brief.""After the first three quarters of the year, China's CO2 emissions in 2025 are now finely balanced between a small fall or rise, depending on what happens in the last quarter,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.""A drop in the full-year total became much more likely after September, which recorded an approximately three percent drop in emissions year-on-year,"" said Myllyvirta, who is also a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute.The new analysis, which is based on official Chinese data, comes as the UN's COP30 climate conference kicked off in Brazil on Monday.""While an emission increase or decrease of one percent or less might not make a huge difference in an objective sense, it has heightened symbolic meaning,"" Myllyvirta said.""China's policymakers have left room for emissions to increase for several more years, leaving the timing of the peak open,"" he added.Emissions from the power sector, China's dominant source of CO2, remained flat in the third quarter despite strong demand for electricity, Myllyvirta said.Electricity generation from solar energy rose 46 percent while wind grew 11 percent compared to the same period last year.Emissions from transport fuel dropped by five percent, with declines also in cement and steel production.Oil demand and emissions grew elsewhere by 10 percent as the production of plastics and other chemicals surged, the analysis found.In September, China issued its first-ever absolute targets for cutting planet-warming gases.Under the new plan, China will reduce economy-wide emissions by seven to 10 percent by 2035 relative to the year of the country's peak emissions, believed to be 2025.China had previously pledged to peak its carbon output before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, without ever previously setting near-term numerical targets for total emissions reductions.","Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months.

SINGAPORE/BEIJING: When bank clerk Ren Yingxiao was looking for a honeymoon destination with her partner, they came across a scenic spot in the Xinjiang region that had it all - including a marriage registration office.""So we thought, why not go there and get our marriage certificate as well?"" the 30-year-old said about secluded Sayram Lake, where authorities are trying to attract young Chinese to tie the knot as part of a nationwide push to boost marriage rates and ease the country's demographic crisis.In May, China started allowing couples to get married anywhere in the country - instead of their place of residence - making the process more convenient and the event more special. Local govts have since started to scramble for marriage tourists, setting up registration offices around scenic spots, at music festivals - and even in subway stations, shopping malls and parks.For now, the effort is working. Marriages, which demographers use as a proxy for the country's birth rate, rose 22.5% from a year earlier to 1.61 million in the third quarter of 2025, putting China on track to halt a downtrend in annual nuptials, which has gone almost uninterrupted for more than a decade.Last year's 20.5% decline in marriages, to 6.1 million, was the biggest on record.In the eastern city of Nanjing, couples can get married at the Confucius Temple, where they can have a Ming Dynasty-themed ceremony. In southwestern Chengdu, authorities set up an office on the picturesque Xiling Snow Mountain at an altitude above 3,000 metres. In eastern Hefei, a marriage booth opened in a subway station whose name, Xingfuba, translates to ""the place of happiness."" And in Shanghai, couples can choose to get their certificate at a nightclub after appearing at a marriage registration office.In Beijing, 31-year-old lawyer Wang Jieyi and 33-year-old Zhan Yongqiang, a bank employee, registered their marriage at the Huguo Guanyin Temple. ""The Huguo Guanyin Temple was originally built to safeguard the peace and tranquility of the nation,"" Wang said. ""And also, in our traditional religious culture, the Guanyin Temple is associated with auspicious events like marriage and giving birth, symbolising happiness and well-being. "" The couple said the new policy didn't necessarily fast-track their plans to get married but it made the process more convenient as they both work in Beijing and no longer need to go back to their native Shandong province. ""It made our lives a little bit easier,"" said Wang.Demographer Yi Fuxian from the University of Wisconsin-Madison said the removal of geographic restrictions is making weddings easier in China, but expects the positive results to be ""short-lived."" With the population declining, Yi expects the number of women aged 20 to 34 to nearly halve to 58 million by 2050. Moreover, he expects young women - and their parents - to give priority to education and economic independence over marriage, in line with global trends.Reuters","In May, China started allowing couples to get married anywhere in the country - instead of their place of residence.

Dubai population growth 2025

Why is everyone moving to Dubai?

Investment Haven: A massive surge in real-estate transactions by multiple nationalities confirms the city's status as a secure place to invest capital.



Ease of Business: Strong, modern infrastructure and a favorable investment climate make establishing and operating new businesses remarkably simple.



The Safe Bet: Consistently ranking among the world's safest cities, Dubai offers unparalleled security and high standards of living, a major draw for families and individuals.



How will Dubai cope with the crowd?

Mass Transit Expansion: The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) is spearheading the launch of the Metro Blue Line, a 30 km line with 14 new stations, designed to support up to 320,000 daily passengers and alleviate congestion on existing routes.



Road Network Overhaul: Major arterial highways like Emirates Road are undergoing expansion to ten lanes, with projects like the Al Shindagha Corridor aiming to reduce commute times between old and new Dubai districts from over an hour to just minutes.



The ""20-Minute City"": A core goal is ensuring that 55% of residents live within 800 meters of a public transit station. This supports the development of ""20-minute cities"" where people can access 80% of their daily needs, work, shops, and schools, within a short walk or ride.



Green Oasis : The plan is focused on quality of life, committing to doubling green and recreational spaces and setting aside 60% of the emirate's total area for nature reserves by 2040.





Dubai is officially breaking records and rewriting the rules of urban growth. According to new real-time data from the emirate's Population Clock, the city saw a stunning influx of residents, jumping by 17,669 people in a single month. This exceptional surge has cemented Dubai’s status as one of the world's fastest-expanding metropolitan areas. As of midday Thursday, November 13, 2025, the emirate’s residential population hit 4,044,273, up from 4,026,604 just thirty days earlier.The recent monthly expansion is a dramatic highlight in a year of unprecedented demographic change. Over the past twelve months, the city has welcomed a staggering 208,030 new people, increasing its population from 3,836,243 in November 2024. This growth trajectory is not just impressive; it represents the highest annual expansion ever recorded in the emirate's history.To put this incredible pace into perspective, the first ten months of 2025 saw Dubai gain 176,683 inhabitants, equivalent to an average daily increase of approximately 567 new people. Every single day, the city is opening its doors to hundreds of global citizens looking to experience its unique blend of security, opportunity, and lifestyle.This explosive growth isn’t accidental; it’s fueled by a strategic environment that has made Dubai irresistible to high-net-worth individuals, skilled professionals, and dynamic entrepreneurs alike. International reports unanimously point to several key drivers making the city the ultimate relocation destination:Essentially, people are choosing Dubai for the unparalleled opportunity to advance their careers, grow their wealth, and enjoy a high-quality, stable lifestyle all at once.To manage this record-breaking pace and prepare for a projected population of 5.8 million by 2040, the city is executing the comprehensive Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan. This plan aims to make Dubai the ""world's best city to live in"" through futuristic infrastructure projects.Dubai is not just witnessing growth; it is masterfully orchestrating its future. With the population surging past the four-million mark at an unprecedented rate, the emirate is responding not with reaction, but with visionary action, driven by the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan.By expanding its Metro, redesigning its highways, and committing to a sustainable ""20-Minute City"" concept, Dubai is ensuring that its physical infrastructure and quality of life evolve faster than its demographics. The message is clear: the city remains the world’s most dynamic hub, a place where record-breaking opportunity and a meticulously planned future seamlessly converge.","Dubai adds 17,000+ residents in just 30 days as global talent flocks to the gulf.

Indian nationals residing in the UAE may be able to file for divorce in India under certain conditions, explains legal expert Ashish Mehta, founder and Managing Partner of Ashish Mehta & Associates.According to Mehta, non-Muslim individuals who marry in the UAE may apply the provisions of UAE Personal Laws for Non-Muslims. This is established under Article 1(1) of Federal Decree Law No. 41 of 2022 on Civil Personal Status. The law states that it applies to non-Muslim UAE citizens and non-Muslim foreigners residing in the UAE unless either party chooses to apply their own personal laws. This covers matters such as marriage, divorce, wills, and proof of affiliation, without prejudice to certain specific articles (12, 13, 15, 16, and 17) of the older Federal Law No.5 of 1985.In India, non-Muslim Indian nationals can opt to apply the personal laws corresponding to their faith when filing for divorce.

This means the parties may formally petition the court to apply the law of their nationality instead of UAE law.The law also states that the personal status and property-related effects of a marriage are generally governed by the husband’s national law at the time the marriage was contracted. However, if the foreign law does not address a particular aspect of the divorce procedure, UAE courts have the discretion to apply UAE law to fill the gaps.Non-Muslim expats can pursue divorce in the UAE and request their own country’s laws to be applied, but if those laws are incomplete, UAE courts will use UAE law to resolve the remaining issues.","Indian expats in the UAE can file for divorce in India if either spouse is domiciled there or the marriage was solemnised in India.

Eligibility and sponsorship requirements



Oman Vision 2040





The Sultanate of Oman has initiated a monumental shift in its immigration policy, positioning itself as a premier destination for the world's creative elite. Announced through Decision No. 156/2025 and officially taking effect on November 10, 2025, the government has introduced a brand-new Cultural Visa and Cultural Residence category, marking a fundamental update to the country’s existing laws on foreign residency.Oman’s new residency scheme is deliberately structured for longevity, encouraging international contributors to establish deep roots rather than planning transient stays. Applicants are offered highly flexible validity choices: both the visa and the subsequent residency are accessible for periods of one year, five years, or a maximum of ten years.This commitment to long-term residency affords scholars the necessary time to pursue multi-year research projects and allows artists to develop lasting ties to the local community and region. Furthermore, the program is exceptionally inclusive: spouses and first-degree relatives are eligible for a Cultural Joining Visa or Residence, supporting professionals who relocate with their families.One of the most attractive elements of the new policy is the remarkably budget-conscious fee structure.The costs are deliberately low to encourage long-term commitment, signaling that Oman views cultural contribution as a high-value investment. The fees are set at an annual rate, regardless of the chosen validity, and are clearly differentiated for the main applicant versus accompanying family members.This structure ensures that the financial burden of the permit itself remains minimal, allowing professionals to dedicate resources to their creative endeavors. The new resident must remember to enter the Sultanate within three months of the visa's issuance to officially validate the document.Eligibility is broad, encompassing individuals across the entire cultural and academic spectrum. The new visa targets professionals who enrich the creative environment, including writers, poets, performers, designers, researchers, musicians, and curators. The primary administrative requirement involves securing a local sponsor: the visa is processed only upon the request of a recognised Omani cultural body. This institutional sponsor, such as a government ministry, a university, a festival organizer, or an established cultural center confirms the legitimate purpose of the applicant's presence.This program transcends immigration reform; it is a critical strategy underpinning Oman Vision 2040, the national blueprint for economic diversification. By directly attracting global intellectual talent, Oman is making a decisive pivot toward establishing itself as a future creative capital. The policy is designed to foster profound knowledge collaboration, boost cultural tourism, and generate new economic value driven by the arts.The initiative sends a clear message: Oman is looking outward, seeking to augment its national heritage by integrating global ideas and providing a dynamic new stage for the world’s most talented creators.","The Sultanate of Oman has initiated a monumental shift in its immigration policy, positioning itself as a premier destination for the world's creative elite.

Dubai Airshow 2025 – The global stage









Dubai Airports, in collaboration with dnata, flydubai, and more than 30 industry partners, is set to debut the aviation world’s first Sustainability Showcase at Dubai Airshow 2025. The initiative highlights how innovation, collaboration, and advanced technology can transform aircraft operations to be faster, safer, and environmentally sustainable.The Dubai Airshow 2025, running from 17–21 November at Dubai World Central (DWC), returns under the theme “The Future is Here.” This year’s edition is positioned as bigger and more innovative than ever, showcasing the UAE’s leadership in aviation, space, defence, and sustainability.The Sustainability Showcase, a first-of-its-kind initiative, brings together some of the industry’s most influential players to demonstrate practical progress in reducing aviation’s environmental impact.
