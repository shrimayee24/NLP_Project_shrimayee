We have to put an end to it,"" Owaisi said during an interaction with prominent personalities in Bahrain.

One Month Since Pahalgam Attack: How India Punished, Isolated Pakistan Since April 22 | Op Sindoor

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor outlined India’s firm but measured response to the Pahalgam terror attack on Saturday in New York. The MP is leading a multi-party delegation to five countries as part of India's global outreach against terrorism amid Operation Sindoor.While speaking at the Indian Consulate in New York, Tharoor said the attack was carried out by militants who identified victims by their religion before killing them, in what he called a clear attempt to provoke communal violence.“It was a bunch of people going around identifying the religions of the people before them and killing them on that basis, which was clearly intended to provoke a backlash in the rest of India, since the victims were overwhelmingly Hindu,” Tharoor said, adding, ""There was an extraordinary amount of togetherness cutting across religious and other divides in India that people have tried to provoke. The message is very clear that there was a malign intent. .. India, sadly, had no reason to doubt where it came from.""Tharoor emphasised that within an hour, the Resistance Front claimed responsibility. He reminded the audience that this group is linked to the proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba and had already been flagged to the UN in 2023 and 2024. “Sadly, Pakistan chose to follow its usual path of denial,” he said, noting that China supported the removal of the Resistance Front’s mention from the UN Security Council’s press statement.Describing India's response, Tharoor said, “The time had come to hit hard and hit smart and I’m pleased to say that’s exactly what India did.” He said strikes were carried out on nine known terror sites, including those linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke and Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur. “India sent a clear message that it was not going to take terror lying down,” he added.Tharoor stressed that the strikes were precise and limited in scope. “It was not meant to be the opening salvo in a protracted war but just an act of retribution,” he explained.Tharoor made it clear that while India responded firmly to terrorism, it does not seek escalation or armed conflict. He said India’s priorities lie elsewhere, focused on growth and development.“We are not interested in warfare with Pakistan. We would much rather be left alone to grow our economy and pull our people into the world they are getting ready for in the 21st century. But, the Pakistanis sadly, we might be a status quo power but they are not...they covet territory India controls, and they want to have it at any price. If they can't get it through conventional means, they are willing to get it through terrorism, and that is not acceptable. ..”Tharoor said the all-party delegation’s first stop was the 9/11 Memorial in New York, symbolising their solidarity with victims of terrorism worldwide.We came both as a reminder that this is a shared problem, but also out of a spirit of solidarity with the victims... It's a global problem, it's a scourge and we must all fight it unitedly,"" he said.The delegation he leads includes members from the BJP, Shiv Sena, Lok Janshakti Party, and others, showcasing India’s political unity against terrorism.The group will meet political leaders, think tanks, and the media across several countries to share India’s perspective on terrorism and push for coordinated international action.",Congress MP Shashi Tharoor outlined India’s firm but measured response to the Pahalgam terror attack on Saturday in New York.

Several parts of neighbouring Haryana, including Jhajjar, also witnessed heavy downpour.The IMD had on Saturday warned of a thunderstorm cell approaching Delhi and adjoining areas from the west and northwest. “Under its influence, severe thunderstorm or dust-raising wind activity accompanied by frequent lightning and gusty winds (speed reaching 40–60 km/h or more) will likely affect parts of the city in the next 1 to 2 hours,” the IMD said in a statement.The warning was part of the agency’s Nowcast alert system, based on immediate weather patterns. Authorities urged people to remain indoors and avoid open areas. “Avoid open spaces and not to take shelter under trees,” the IMD cautioned, also advising people to stay clear of weak walls, unstable structures, and water bodies.The weather event raised concerns over possible impacts, including uprooting of trees, falling branches, and moderate damage to crops like bananas and papayas.Dry limbs could snap and fall due to strong winds, and localised dust storms were also likely, the IMD said.Officials asked residents to remain alert and follow safety instructions as the weather remains volatile across the region.Severe waterlogging was reported in several parts of Delhi after heavy rains and thunderstorm struck the national capital in the early hours of Sunday. Areas affected include Moti Bagh, Minto Road, and near Delhi Airport Terminal 1.Visuals from Delhi's Minto Road show a car submerged due to severe waterlogging caused by the heavy rainfall. The heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms also lashed several parts of Haryana's Jhajjar.This was the second major storm event in less than a week. On Wednesday, strong winds and a dust storm swept through Delhi, with wind speeds reaching 50–60 km/h, and gusts touching 70 km/h. Light rainfall was also reported, along with thunderstorms in parts of Haryana's Karnal district.The mid-week storm had caused widespread power outages across the capital. Neighbourhoods such as Bawana, Narela, Jahangirpuri, Civil Lines, Shakti Nagar, Model Town, Wazirabad, Dhirpur, and Burari faced disruptions in electricity supply. According to Tata Power DDL, power was deliberately suspended in some areas to prevent electrocution, as trees and branches fell on live wires, damaging infrastructure.","Severe waterlogging was reported in several parts of Delhi after heavy rains and thunderstorm struck the national capital in the early hours of Sunday.

Conditions favourable for advance of SW monsoon

.

NEW DELHI: The southwest (summer) monsoon hit Kerala on Saturday, eight days ahead of its normal onset date of June 1, marking the beginning of the four-month-long rainy season in India. This is the earliest date of monsoon onset over Kerala after 2009 when it set in over the state on May 23, said India Meteorological Department (IMD).Besides showers in Kerala and other parts of south peninsula, including Tamil Nadu and parts of Karnataka, the monsoon on Saturday simultaneously arrived in Mizoram (NE) - 12 days before the normal onset date of June 5.Though the monsoon's arrival simultaneously over Kerala and NE is quite an uncommon phenomenon, this time it has happened second year in a row. Before 2024, simultaneous onset happened on May 30, 2017.Normally southwest monsoon sets in over Kerala on June 1 and it advances over most part of northeast India by June 5. Advance of the monsoon to most parts of Tamil Nadu and some parts of Karnataka on the very first day of the onset is significant but not unusual. It, however, signals the possibility of its fast progress in the next few days.""Monsoon arrival in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is not unusual. It invariably happens and the monsoon will now make further progress as per our forecast,"" IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra told TOI. Announcing the monsoon onset, the Met department said the conditions are favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon into entire Goa, some parts of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, some more parts of Karnataka, remaining parts of Tamil Nadu, some more parts of northeastern states, and some parts of sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim during the next 2-3 days.Early monsoon onset and its further advance will pave the way for early start of the kharif (summer crops) sowing operations in the country, specifically in south and central India. Since the IMD predicted 'above normal' monsoon rainfall in most parts of the country this year, the situation may help increase the acreage and production of the summer crops such as paddy, pulses, maize and other coarse cereals and steer the country towards realising its goal of record foodgrains output of 354 million tonne in the 2025-26 crop year.On Saturday, the monsoon advanced into the entire Lakshadweep area, Kerala, Mahe, some parts of Karnataka, remaining parts of Maldives and Comorin area, many parts of Tamil Nadu and some parts of Mizoram. IMD, meanwhile, predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall over west coast (Kerala, Karnataka, coastal Maharashtra & Goa) during the next seven days; coastal and ghat areas of Karnataka till May 27; and ghat areas of Tamil Nadu on May 25-26 due to prevailing weather phenomena.","The southwest (summer) monsoon hit Kerala on Saturday, eight days ahead of its normal onset date of June 1.

His absence has fueled political speculation, especially with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to Bihar ahead of the assembly elections due this year.The high-level meeting, chaired by PM Modi at Bharat Mandapam, focused on the theme ‘Viksit Rajya for Viksit Bharat@2047’ and brought together chief ministers, lieutenant governors, and Union ministers to chart out development strategies.However, Nitish Kumar’s absence stood out, especially since he heads a government aligned with the BJP.Among the states that skipped the meeting were Karnataka, Kerala, West Bengal, Bihar, and Puducherry, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam said, according to PTI.Nitish Kumar's decision to skip the high-level meeting has sparked political speculation, with Congress and RJD leaders calling it ""unfortunate"" and suggesting it may carry a deeper political message.Senior Congress leader Tariq Anwar called the move ""significant,"" noting that ""his decision to skip it sends a major political message,"" especially when the meeting was chaired by the Prime Minister himself, according to IANS.RJD leader Manoj Jha said that Kumar's absence from the meeting suggests that ""others are deciding his priorities these days.""Speaking to PTI, Jha said, ""The NITI Aayog meeting is happening at a critical juncture. We heard that Bihar CM is not attending, his priorities are set by other people these days. The GDP size is a myth if it is not reflected in every home, the development would be hollow.""""We also hope for 'nafrat-mukt' (hatred-free) Bharat... The situation is Bihar is like there is no pilot, and auto-pilot has gone defunct,"" Jha further added.There has been no official explanation for Nitish Kumar's absence, and the exact reason for his missing the meeting remains unclear.This isn’t the first time Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has skipped a Niti Aayog meeting. He was absent from the 2023 Governing Council meeting as well. In 2024, he again chose not to attend, with Bihar being represented instead by deputy chief ministers Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha.The council is the apex body of the Niti Ayog, which includes chief ministers, lieutenant governors of all states and Union territories along with several Union ministers. This was the first major meeting of the PM with chief ministers of all states and lieutenant governors after US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs and Operation Sindoor.Despite the absence of some states, the meeting went ahead with participation from several state heads.PM Modi began the Niti Aayog meeting by advocating for joint development initiatives between the Centre and states. He stressed the importance of developing cities that are prepared for the future, considering India's growing urbanisation.“India is getting rapidly urbanised. We should work towards future-ready cities. Growth, innovation, and sustainability should be the engines of urban development,” the Prime Minister said.Highlighting the theme of “Team India,” PM Modi added, “We have to increase the speed of development. If the Centre and all States come together and work as a team, no goal is impossible.”The Prime Minister encouraged states to enhance tourism, recommending that each state should establish one internationally recognised tourist destination.“One State: One Global Destination should be our mantra. It will not only elevate that location but also lead to the development of surrounding areas,” he added.The Niti Aayog governing council meeting is a platform for the Centre and states/UTs to discuss how to work together to achieve the goal of a developed India by 2047. It focuses on building consensus on how each state can contribute to the country’s overall progress.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar was among several opposition-ruled state leaders who skipped the 10th Niti Aayog governing council meeting.

‘Monitoring situation closely’: Top government officials meet after Covid uptick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monitoring-situation-closely-top-government-officials-meet-after-covid-uptick/articleshow/121383088.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union health secretary chaired a review meeting on Saturday following a recent uptick in Covid cases, news agency PTI reported citing sources.The meeting was attended by officials from the department of health research, the director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and the director general of the National Centre for Disease Control, among others.“Union health ministry remains vigilant and, through its multiple agencies, is proactively monitoring the situation closely,” sources said.They added, “It may be noted that there is a robust pan-India surveillance system for respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) and ICMR’s pan-India respiratory virus sentinel surveillance network. Most of these cases are mild and under home care.”This comes a day after the Delhi government issued a Covid advisory, asking hospitals to ensure the availability of beds, oxygen, medicines, and vaccines. Health institutions have also been directed to send all positive samples for genome sequencing to Lok Nayak Hospital.Although the World Health Organization declared the pandemic over in May 2023, Covid continues to circulate globally. In India, the majority of cases remain mild, with no deaths or ICU admissions linked to the latest rise in infections.Health experts have advised the public—particularly the elderly, pregnant women, and those with underlying health conditions—to resume basic precautions such as wearing masks in enclosed spaces and frequent handwashing.Doctors also recommend influenza vaccination to reduce the risk and severity of co-infections. Indian health authorities are closely monitoring a gradual increase in COVID-19 cases across several states, as regions in Asia—including Hong Kong and Singapore—report a resurgence of infections.Although nationwide case numbers remain low compared to earlier waves, cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, and Ahmedabad have reported a noticeable rise. In Mumbai alone, 95 new COVID-19 cases have been recorded in May—nearly matching the state’s total of 106 cases since January, according to the Maharashtra health department.","Union health secretary chaired a review meeting on Saturday following a recent uptick in Covid cases.

Noting a ""tough life"" for Short Service Commission (SSC) officers, the bench in ""layman's suggestion"" said its ""uncertainty may not be good for the armed forces.""A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh issued notice to the Centre and the IAF on Thursday, seeking their response on Pandey’s plea, news agency PTI reported. She claimed that although she ranked second in the country among expert fighter controllers and had served over 13.5 years, she was being discharged due to a 2019 policy change that denied her a permanent commission.“Our Air Force is one of the best organisations in the world. Officers are very commendable. The quality of coordination they have exhibited - I think it's unparalleled. Therefore, we always salute them. They are a big asset for the nation. They are the nation, in a way. Because of them, we are able to sleep at night,” Justice Kant said.The bench expressed concern over the uncertainty faced by SSC officers, stating that a long tenure without permanent commission needed to be addressed.“That sense of uncertainty may not be good for the armed forces. It's a layman's suggestion, because we are not experts. On minimum benchmarks, there can't be a compromise,” Justice Kant added.Representing Pandey, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy argued that her client was an expert fighter controller, who had played a key role in the Integrated Air Command and Control Systems (IACCS) deployed during Operations Sindoor and Balakot.Pandey’s case, Guruswamy said, was affected by policy shifts that gave her just a month’s notice to end her career despite her stellar service record.Appearing for the government and the IAF, additional solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati said that the officer had been found unfit by the selection board and had approached the apex court directly without first filing a representation. She also confirmed that a second selection board would now review Pandey’s case.Bhati, herself from a military background, acknowledged the difficult position of SSC officers but explained, “There are a limited number of posts. It's a very steep pyramid structure.”She noted that typically, 90–95 per cent of officers considered for permanent commission are found fit, but only a few miss out due to comparative merit.Justice Kant responded, urging a more accommodating approach, “You can have a policy of taking that many SCC officers who can be accommodated in the Permanent Commission, if they are found suitable. If you have 100 SCC officers, you should have the capacity to take 100 of them to the permanent commission.”He also emphasised that women officers have performed exceedingly well and highlighted the need for systemic capacity to retain them.The court directed that Wing Commander Pandey must not be released from service until further orders and posted the matter for hearing on August 6.However, the bench clarified that no equity would be created in the officer’s favour at this stage and that all contentions remain open.","Wing Commander Nikita Pandey alleged discrimination in being denied permanent commission despite her critical role in Operation Balakot and Operation Sindoor.

5 global universities get nod to open campuses in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-global-universities-get-nod-to-open-campuses-in-india/articleshow/121387143.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's push to become a global education hub is gathering momentum, with five foreign universities receiving Letters of Intent (LoIs) to establish campuses in the country. Close to a dozen international institutions by the start of the next academic session are likely to have an Indian campus, according to govt sources.The LoIs - cleared after evaluation by the University Grants Commission - have gone to Victoria University (Australia), University of Liverpool (UK), Western Sydney University (Australia), Illinois Institute of Technology (US) and Istituto Europeo di Design (Italy). In addition, six more are under scrutiny & being evaluated by Liberalized Degree Campuses (LDC) committee.Till now, three foreign universities have established physical campuses in India - Australia's Deakin University and University of Wollongong in Gujarat's GIFT City, and UK's University of Southampton in Gurgaon.""Several universities are in the pipeline. Out of them, five have received LoIs. As per my knowledge, six more are under scrutiny and being evaluated by our LDC committee,"" said union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan in an exclusive conversation.""We've engaged with several top global universities with high QS rankings and strong funding - only such universities will be considered. They must meet all our criteria,"" he added. The upcoming campuses are expected to offer high-quality courses in STEM and management, sectors identified as national priorities.“So far, three foreign universities have come to the country. Two Australian universities are in GIFT City, Gujarat. The University of Southampton is starting its campus in Gurgaon,” said Pradhan in an exclusive conversation, calling the developments “a confirmation of India’s growing global reputation in education.”India’s recent regulatory reforms, driven by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, are transforming the higher education landscape by opening the door to serious foreign investment in a sector long hindered by red tape and restrictive regulations. The NEP envisions India as a global knowledge destination and encourages top-tier foreign universities to establish physical campuses in the country, with a focus on internationalisation, academic excellence, and regulatory liberalisation. Under the University Grants Commission’s new framework, qualified foreign institutions are now allowed to set up campuses independently, design their own curricula, and admit students on their own terms — creating a more flexible and welcoming environment that addresses the earlier concerns of institutions wary of India’s complex legal and administrative systems.Just last week, the Maharashtra government signed an MoU with York University from Canada during the Web Summit, highlighting how state-level initiatives are complementing national policy to attract international collaborations. “The momentum is building. Our intention is not just to allow foreign universities to come, but to bring in the best,” said Pradhan.India’s strategy goes beyond hosting. It includes exporting its educational expertise. IIT Madras has already launched an international campus in Zanzibar, and IIT Delhi in Abu Dhabi. These moves mark a new phase in India’s engagement with global higher education, turning it from a student-sending country into a knowledge-exporting one.The government is also motivated by practical concerns. With lakhs of Indian students spending billions abroad every year, the expansion of globally accredited education within India is seen as a way to retain talent, cut costs for families, and attract international students from neighbouring countries. “This is about making world-class education accessible at home,” Pradhan said.If these initiatives stay on track, India could soon host a vibrant ecosystem of foreign and Indian institutions working side by side — setting a precedent for quality, innovation, and global engagement in higher education.","Close to a dozen international institutions by the start of the next academic session are likely to have an Indian campus.

Rs 3.5 lakh: Cost of a Bengal villager's legal battle to save her husband,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-3-5-lakh-cost-of-a-bengal-villagers-legal-battle-to-save-her-husband/articleshow/121386405.cms,"Case an eye-opener for everyone, shows lacunae in legal system: SC

NEW DELHI: The extent to which the legal system can take the poor and the ignorant for a ride, fleecing and exploiting them in the process, came to light when Supreme Court decided to find out the legal expenses of a woman from a small village in West Bengal in her fight to protect her husband. Shocking details emerged: she paid a tout who promised to secure bail and an additional amount to an advocate 'for winning the case'.The woman, who lives in a ramshackle dwelling with a tarpaulin sheet for a roof and no doors, ended up spending Rs 3.5 lakh from the trial court to the SC, which admitted that the legal system had failed her. The man was sentenced to 20 years by a Pocso court for having a physical relationship with the woman when she was a minor, and she fought to get him released.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan had appointed a committee to interact with the woman and the panel filed a report in a sealed envelope. In its judgment, the bench mentioned the findings of the panel which said she was now in a debt trap.""She had to run from pillar to post... She spent large amounts by way of payment of fees to lawyers for his release. The amount she spent as noted in the final report of the committee are startling,"" it said.At different stages, the woman paid a total of Rs 40,000 to advocates. In addition, she claims to have paid a sum of Rs 10,000 to an advocate 'for winning the case'. She spent a sum of Rs 20,000 to get copies of the chargesheet and Rs 7,000 for getting duplicate copies of court papers, court said.She paid Rs 18,000 to a tout who promised to get bail for her husband. Thus, she ended up spending over Rs 2 lakh (in trial court proceedings) by incurring debt for defending the accused. In fact, the committee records that the indebtedness has become vicious, the court said in its verdict.The woman had to approach high court and had to bear additional expenses of nearly Rs 1.4 lakh. As the apex court appointed two leading senior advocates as amici to assist the bench, she did not have to pay much in the SC.""The figures stated make it obvious that she has been exploited. This is evident from the fact that she had to pay Rs 60,000 for grant of bail, Rs 25,000 for securing acquittal, Rs 15,000 for filing a case in this court and Rs 25,000 towards air fare, to enable her husband's advocate to appear before this court,"" the bench said.The top court said that the family is very poor and staying in a temporary shelter enclosed by brick walls, but the roof is of tarpaulin with no door.It said the facts of this case were an eye-opener for everyone as it highlighted the lacunae in the legal system which failed her. ""In this case, the society, the family of the victim and the legal system have done enough injustice to the victim,"" the bench said.","The woman, who lives in a ramshackle dwelling with a tarpaulin sheet for a roof and no doors, ended up spending Rs 3.5 lakh from the trial court to the SC.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has violated the spirit of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) by inflicting three wars and thousands of terror attacks on India since the treaty came into effect in 1960, India said at the UN to counter what it described as disinformation being carried out by Pakistan over New Delhi's decision to put the IWT in abeyance.India had always acted as a responsible upper riparian state, Indian ambassador P Harish said, adding it was Pakistan that had continued to violate the 1960 treaty. He also highlighted several aspects to expose disinformation and explain why India has finally announced that the treaty will be in abeyance ""until Pakistan, which is a global epicentre of terror, credibly & irrevocably ends its support for cross-border terrorism"". ""In the last four decades, over 20,000 Indian lives have been lost in terror attacks,"" he said.First, Indian ambassador P Harish said, India had entered into the treaty 65-years-ago in good faith and, as the preamble of the treaty says, in spirit of goodwill and friendship. ""Throughout these six-and-a-half decades, Pakistan has violated the spirit of the treaty by inflicting three wars and thousands of terror attacks on India.Thousands of Indians lost lives in terror attacks, ""the most recent of which was the dastardly targeted terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam last month,"" Harish said, adding that Pakistan-sponsored cross-border terrorism in India sought to hold hostage the lives of civilians, religious harmony and economic prosperity.Second, Harish said that in these 65 years, far-reaching fundamental changes had taken place not only in terms of escalating security concerns through cross-border attacks, but also growing requirements for producing clean energy, climate change and demographic change. ""However, Pakistan has continued to consistently block any changes to this infrastructure, and any modifications of the provisions, which is permissible under the treaty. In fact, in 2012, terrorists even attacked the Tulbul navigation project in J&K,"" he said.Third, he cited Pakistan's reluctance to discuss modifications of the treaty on several occasions in past two years. ""Pakistan's obstructionist approach continues to prevent the exercise of full utilisation of legitimate rights by India,"" he added.",India: Pakistan has violated the spirit of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) by inflicting three wars and thousands of terror attacks on India since the treaty came into effect in 1960.

Government should consider suggestion for a sex education policy: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-should-consider-suggestion-for-a-sex-education-policy-supreme-court/articleshow/121386196.cms,"Govt should consider suggestion for a sex education policy: SC

NEW DELHI: To ensure that adolescents don't get sent to jail under the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso) for being in romantic relationships, Supreme Court has directed the Centre to consider decriminalising such consensual relationships and frame a policy for sexual and reproductive health education in the country.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan issued notice to the Centre through the ministry of women and child development to form an expert committee to examine the issue and file a report before it by July 25. The court said it would pass further directions after getting the report.The trigger for the court order was the legal battle of a woman from West Bengal to protect her husband who was sentenced to 20 years in jail under Pocso for having a relationship with her when she was 14.The court had appointed two senior women advocates - Madhavi Divan and Liz Mathew - to assist it on the sensitive issue and they suggested that adolescents in consensual relationships needed to be protected. While Pocso Act served an essential purpose in protecting minors from sexual exploitation, its rigid application in cases of adolescent relationships could lead to outcomes that may not align with the best interests of the prosecutrix and her dependants, they suggested.Accepting the suggestions of the senior advocates, the court impleaded the Centre in the case and issued notice.The advocates also pointed out that various high courts, including Delhi and Madras, have taken a nuanced approach and interpreted the statement of objects and reasons of the Pocso Act as not intending to criminalise consensual romantic relationships. In several cases, Madras high court adopted a legal interpretation that consensual acts did not fulfil the requirement of 'assault' in the offence of 'penetrative sexual assault'.Calcutta HC held that Pocso Act defined 'penetration' as a unilateral act by the accused and, therefore, in cases of consensual intercourse, the act of penetration may not solely be attributed to the accused. Various HCs have also considered the impact such prosecution has on the victim and have proceeded to quash proceedings if pursuing the case would harm the victim.Accepting the suggestions of the senior advocates, the court impleaded Centre in the case and issued notice. ""For carrying forward the suggestion of the learned amici, we propose to implead the Union of India through the ministry of women and child development, so that more effective orders can be passed,"" it said.""The secretary of the ministry shall appoint a committee of experts to deal with the suggestions of the amici curiae. Senior officers of the state shall be part of the committee. If necessary, the committee can also consult the senior counsel appointed as amici curiae. Immediately on service of notice, the secretary shall constitute a committee. The members of the committee constituted by this court (comprising Dr Pekham Basu from TISS; Jayita Saha, clinical psychologist; and Sanjeeb Rakshit, district social welfare officer, South 24 Parganas) shall be permanent invitees to the said committee,"" the bench said.Government should also consider the suggestion to have a policy on comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education because as per a Unesco report, education policies on life skills-based HIV and sexuality education was only at secondary education-level in India, the bench added.Way back in 2001, Madras HC had suggested amending the law not to penalise such relationships. ""An adolescent boy and girl who are in the grips of their hormones and biological changes and whose decision-making ability is yet to fully develop, should essentially receive the support and guidance of their parents and the society at large. These incidents should never be perceived from an adult's point of view and such an understanding will, in fact, lead to lack of empathy. An adolescent boy who is sent to prison in a case of this nature will be persecuted throughout his life. It is high time that the legislature takes into consideration cases of this nature involving adolescents involved in relationships and swiftly bring in necessary amendments under the Act. The legislature has to keep pace with changing societal needs and bring about necessary changes in law and, more particularly, in a stringent law such as Pocso Act,"" it had said.Delhi HC recently in Feb granted relief to a boy and quashed the case against him and had said that the focus of the law should be on preventing exploitation and abuse, rather than punishing love. ""Love is a fundamental human experience, and adolescents have the right to form emotional connections. The law should evolve to acknowledge and respect these relationships, as long as they are consensual and free from coercion,"" HC had said.",Supreme Court orders Centre to consider decriminalising such consensual relationships. Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan issued notice to the Centre through the ministry of women and child development to form an expert committee. The court said it would pass further directions after getting the report.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121386242,imgsize-1044264,width-400,resizemode-4/121386242.jpg"

About Jagadguru Kripalu Parishat (JKP)



PRAYAGRAJ: In the heart of Braj, Kirti Mandir stands as a shining symbol of devotion, architectural brilliance, and humanitarian spirit. Located in Rangeeli Mahal, Barsana Dham, this spiritually resonant temple is the world’s first and only shrine depicting Shri Radha Rani in her divine childhood form, tenderly seated in the lap of her mother Kirti Maiya.Inaugurated on the auspicious day of Basant Panchmi on Feb 10 in 2019, Kirti Mandir was envisioned by Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj and brought to completion through the tireless efforts of his daughters and Jagadguru Kripalu Parishat (JKP) presidents — Vishakha Tripathi, Shyama Tripathi and Krishna Tripathi.Built over 12 years, this 80,000-square-foot temple is a true architectural marvel, integrating elements of both Nagara and Dravidian styles without the use of cement or steel. The exterior features pink sandstone intricately carved by master artisans, while the interior is adorned with Italian Carrara marble inlaid with semi-precious stones.A distinctive spiritual element of the temple is the inclusion of 38 devotional couplets from Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj’s compositions Radha Govind Geet and Shyama Shyam Geet, inlaid in marble, making the sacred text a part of the very structure.The sanctum sanctorum houses the unprecedented deity of baby Radha cradled in Kirti Maiya’s lap — a depiction never seen before. Flanking them are idols of Shri Sita Rama and Shri Radha Krishna, with Ashtamahasakhis, Shri Radha Rani's eight eternal companions, enshrined nearby.The temple’s design and spiritual significance echo the deep vatsalya bhava, the sacred maternal love, experienced by Kirti Maiya for Shri Radha. According to scriptural tradition, Kirti Maiya and Vrishabhanu Ji performed penance for over 4.3 million years to receive the divine blessing of being Radha Rani’s parents.The temple is also a centre of visual devotion, with walls adorned by vivid paintings of Shri Radha’s pastimes with her sakhis and Shri Krishna's divine glance filled with love. The temple’s spires are said to radiate Radha’s divine name across the cosmos, making it a beacon for spiritual seekers worldwide.Adjacent to the temple is the Jagadguru Kripalu Chikitsalaya (JKC), which offers 100% free medical services to the underprivileged. At the time of the temple’s inauguration, over 50,000 villagers were provided with essential items in a large-scale distribution drive. This tradition of selfless seva (service) continues to this day through regular health camps and support initiatives.Founded by Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj in 1970, JKP is a spiritual, educational, and philanthropic non-profit dedicated to spreading devotion to Radha-Krishna and serving humanity through charitable schools, colleges, hospitals, temples and welfare programs.","Kirti Mandir is the world’s first and only shrine depicting Shri Radha Rani in her divine childhood form.

She is part of the first group of 17 women cadets who will graduate from Pune's National Defence Academy (NDA) on May 30, along with around 300 male counterparts.This achievement marks a historic moment for the armed forces, following their decision to allow women to enter the academy in June 2022.""I come from a non-military background. My parents work in the corporate sector, and my brother is an IT professional. I was pursuing a bachelor's degree in economics when NDA announced its entry for women. I didn't think twice before applying,"" Ishita told TOI.The maiden graduating cadets share the common experience of stringent physical training, military routines, and strong bonds formed over three years at the academy. They echoed that a key aspect of their journey has been personal development, reflecting NDA's reputation for transforming young individuals into accomplished military personnel. ""After spending three years here, I can confidently say that my personality underwent a complete transformation,"" Ishita said.Achieving several accomplishments along the way, Ishita earned the honorary appointment of 'Division Cadet Captain' (DCC) for her outstanding performance in all areas of training.""This is how one gets the opportunity to become a leader right from the academy. It develops your leadership character naturally,"" she remarked.Her fellow cadets echoed similar sentiments about their stint at the academy, acknowledging the significant and transformative impact of training on their confidence.""Before joining the academy, I was an introvert. Here, I made several friends for life. In fact, my course mates feel like family now. I would not have imagined it. You form unbreakable bonds that last forever,"" Ishita said.Cadets emphasised that they never had to compete with their male counterparts for opportunities during their training. ""Equal opportunity naturally empowers each individual. That is what makes the academy unique in all aspects,"" Ishita added.All cadets faced challenges during military training in the initial stages. They worked hard on both physical fitness and overcoming mental barriers. ""Once you break that mental barrier, you push your limits to the next level each time. That is what truly matters, not how many push-ups one can do at a time,"" elaborated Ishita.For cadet Shriti Daksh, the initial weeks brought about a stark realisation about the realities of military training. ""At the academy, I actually understood what the real experience of military training feels like,"" said Shriti, the daughter of a retired wing commander. ""I had no other dream or plan than to join the armed forces.""""It was a significant milestone for me. It was a special day for my father and me when he dropped me off at the academy, a mix of nostalgia and pride for him.

Punjab CM urges Centre to help resolve water-sharing issues with Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab-cm-urges-centre-to-help-resolve-water-sharing-issues-with-haryana/articleshow/121385727.cms,"NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Saturday urged the Centre to step in to resolve water related issues between Punjab and Haryana evn as he denounced the Centre over deployment of CISF at the Bhakra Nangal dam. He also sought Rs 2,829 crore grant to check drug trafficking and upscale border security, and install 50 additional jamming systems to counter drones on the 553 km border with Pakistan.Sources said that while participating in the Niti Aayog’s Governing Council meeting Mann suggested that Centre can convene a meeting between him and his Haryana counterpart on the matters relating to water sharing as they “don’t want to politicise” this.Punjab and Haryana have been at loggerheads over the distribution of water with the AAP govt refusing to share water from Bhakra dam, saying the neighbouring state has already used its share of water.As per an official statement issued by Punjab govt, Mann also flagged the water sharing dispute with Haryana and a “biased” approach against Punjab. It added that the CM reiterated that Punjab has no surplus water for any state.“Asserting that in wake of grim situation of water in the state Yamuna-Sutlej-Link (YSL) canal should be considered for construction instead of the Satluj-Yamuna-Link (SYL) canal, Mann said that Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers are already in deficit and water should be diverted from surplus to deficit basins,” the statement said.It added that Punjab has repeatedly requested to be included in negotiations for the allocation of Yamuna waters as a pact for YSL Project was signed between the erstwhile Punjab and Uttar Pradesh on March 12, 1954 which entitled the erstwhile Punjab to two-third of the Yamuna water. The agreement did not specify the area to be irrigated by Yamuna, he said, adding that before the re-organisation, the Yamuna, like the Ravi and Beas flowed through Punjab.Alleging a “biased” approach of Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), Mann claimed Punjab had been liberal in sharing water with the partner states to meet their drinking water and other needs, even as the state relied upon its groundwater reserves to meet its demands, particularly to irrigate the paddy. He added that now with the upgraded canal structure, Punjab is running short of water and even its share from the rivers is not enough to meet its needs.Mann alleged that the BBMB, despite repeated requests, did not advise other partner states to regulate the release of water to Haryana, and as a result, it exhausted its share by March 30.In his address, CM said that on humanitarian grounds, Punjab decided to release 4,000 cusecs of water to Haryana. However, BBMB ignored the state’s interests and decided to release 8,500 cusecs of water to its neighbour despite serious objections. He called this action against the spirit and provisions of the law and sought BBMB be advised to restrain itself and act within the law.","Punjab and Haryana have been at loggerheads over the distribution of water.

The strength of Team India as shown in Operation Sindoor also is going to be the same feature which will enable India to achieve Viksit Bharat. He also said Operation Sindoor is not just the show of the Army's strength, it has to be converted to social strength. Similarly, Viksit Bharat is not the idea of chief ministers or anybody in the system; it has to be converted to a people’s movement,” Niti Aayog CEO B V R Subrahmanyam told reporters while adding that the meeting was most successful.This was PM’s first meeting with CMs and Lieutenant Governors after Operation Sindoor. Leaders lauded the military operation for its precision and impact on terrorist infrastructure, as well as the progress in defence industry’s self-reliance under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.In his address, Modi said the operation must not be viewed as a one-off. “We must adopt a long-term approach,” he said, calling for modernisation of civil preparedness. “Recent mock drills have reignited attention to civil defence. States should institutionalise civil defence preparedness,” he added.The meeting saw participation of CMs of both NDA and opposition-ruled states, including M K Stalin (Tamil Nadu), A Revanth Reddy (Telangana), Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu (Himachal Pradesh), Hemant Soren (Jharkhand), Bhagwant Mann (Punjab), and Lalduhoma (Mizoram). Absent from the meeting were CMs of Karnataka, Kerala, West Bengal, Bihar, and Puducherry. Among NDA leaders present were N Chandrababu Naidu (Andhra Pradesh), Conrad Sangma (Meghalaya), and Neiphiu Rio (Nagaland).Reiterating the Centre-state coordination, Modi said, “If Centre and states work together like Team India, no goal is impossible,” he said. Sources said there was unanimity among states that there should be “no politics over development” and everyone is committed to accelerate growth.While BJP CMs from Delhi, Odisha and Goa echoed the vision of Viksit Bharat, Telangana CM Revanth Reddy proposed forming a national task force, headed by PM and comprising key chief ministers, to fully harness the economic potential of India’s six major metros — Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Chennai, and Hyderabad. Naidu proposed forming three Centre-State sub-groups focused on GDP growth, population management, and artificial intelligence.Though Stalin, Mann and Soren raised state specific issues, officials said there was sign of any face off.

Indigo, Air India Cancel Flights Amid Drone Scare Even After Ceasefire | Is Flying Still Safe?

NEW DELHI: The pilot operating IndiGo ’s Delhi-Srinagar flight on Wednesday had sought Lahore air traffic control (ATC) permission to briefly venture into Pakistan airspace to avoid turbulence after encountering a sudden hailstorm.People in the know say Lahore ATC denied this permission and pilot flying the Airbus A321 with 220 people on board declared emergency to Srinagar ATC. The aircraft with over 220 people on board, including Trinamool Congress MPs, finally landed safely in Srinagar but with its radome or nose cone badly damaged in the hailstorm.A senior Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) official said, “We have sought details from IndiGo” and a probe is on. The aircraft (VT-IMD) is now grounded in Srinagar. The pilots are being widely applauded for handling the situation well and ensuring everyone’s safety.In a statement, the airline said: “IndiGo flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar on May 21, 2025, navigated a sudden hailstorm and landed safely at Srinagar International Airport.

Govt on Waqf Act in SC: Proof of being Muslim in sync with Sharia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-on-waqf-act-in-sc-proof-of-being-muslim-in-sync-with-sharia/articleshow/121348573.cms,"No mention of 'waqf by user' term in 1923 Act: Raj govt to SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order after arguments over three days between the Centre and petitioners for and against the validity of Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. Responding to the petitioners' objection to the provision that only a practising Muslim for five years could dedicate properties for waqf, SG Tushar Mehta said it was in sync with the requirement of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.Given the widespread misuse of waqf properties and their usurpation for personal purposes noted from 1870s, registration of waqf properties, including 'waqf by user', needed to be mandatorily registered under the 1923 and 1995 Waqf Acts, he said. Mehta said a person could be governed by the 1937 Act only if he satisfied the prescribed authority that he was a Muslim and filled a form before that authority declaring that he desired to follow Sharia law and be governed by its provisions - ranging from marriage to waqfs. ""So, what is the problem in the new law asking a person to be mandatorily a Muslim for the purpose of making a waqf?"" he asked.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, supported by A M Singhvi, Rajeev Dhavan and Huzefa Ahmadi, said the way the new waqf law was drafted, it would allow govt to take over 'waqf by user' properties, which were not registered for decades because of fault of state govts, an eventuality which would result in punishing the community for no fault of its.Sibal said waqf was part of zakat, one of the 5 cardinal principles intrinsic to Islam. ""Waqf was purely religious, and no authority could interfere in this as the Constitution guarantees that every religious denomination has the absolute right to manage its religious institutions, which in this case is waqf,"" he added.Appearing for Rajasthan, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said 'waqf by user' was a term evolved by Privy Council and did not find mention in the 1923 Waqf Act. There was no dedication to Allah in case of 'waqf by user', he said. For ST Muslim organisation, Odisha, and a waqf board, senior advocates Ranjit Kumar, Maninder Singh and Gopal Sankaranarayanan supported Centre's stand.An advocate brought to the court's notice that in Tamil Nadu's Tiruchendurai, its 1,500-year-old Chola-era temple and the surrounding area had been declared waqf property by TN waqf board. She said the board's claim was met with resistance from villagers, who were unable to sell their land without the board's approval. She said the new law would curb such practices.","Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order.

Is Walmart firing linked with H-1B?







The H-1B row and India hatred on social media got fresh fuel after Walmart announced that it is set to lay off approximately 1,500 employees. The affected departments will be Walmart's technology unit, e-commerce fulfilment center and the advertising segment named Walmart Connect.US tech workers fuming over H-1B programs linked the firing with the H-1B and said it was strategically done to hire foreign nationals in those posts. ""Oh, guess what? The large layoffs today at Walmart are from its technology team. You know, the kind of US worker who's replaced by H1B,"" one wrote. Another user questioned, ""1500. Wow, that's a bloodbath. How many H-1Bs are they bringing in next year?""Some social media users suggested the move came a few weeks after Walmart was granted 3800 H-1B visas, though there is no evidence for the claim.One viral post shared the photo of Suresh Kumar, the Global Chief Technology Officer of Walmart and said that it's no coincidence that over 40 per cent of Walmart's IT department is H-1B hiring from India.A debate started whether Indians were also laid off as one Indian took to LinkedIn claiming that she had been impacted in the recent Walmart Global Tech restructuring. Social media users claimed that there must be a few Indians among the 1500 losing their jobs.The job cuts at Walmart come at a time when the retail major is locked in a battle with Trump over tariffs. Trump accused Walmart of taking advantage of customers and rebuked the for passing on the tariff to shoppers. ""Eat the tariff,"" Trump told Walmart asking them to absorb the impact of the tariffs.Walmart employs 1.6 million people in the country and more than 2.1 million globally. According to experts, H-1B could be one of the factors but AI is another. Walmart said it is cutting jobs in a bid to reduce expenses and streamline decision making. H-1B allows companies to hire foreign nationals for some skilled roles but they get less wages.","US tech workers claim Walmart is firing 1500 people to accommodate fresh H-1B hirings.

US-China tech tensions 'escalate'



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly praised President Donald Trump while sharply criticising the Biden administration ’s export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, calling the policy 'a failure' that cost US companies billions. Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense.

Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer that had spread to his bones. This serious development raised national conversations about age, transparency, and healthcare in leadership. Biden joins a small but significant list of U.S. presidents who have faced cancer or major health crises. Their stories reflect changing medical practices, evolving attitudes toward privacy, and the personal burdens carried by those in the nation’s highest office. As medical advancements prolong lives and reshape treatment options, the expectations placed on public figures have grown. The health of a president, once guarded, now influences public trust, policy direction, and global stability.Although not formally diagnosed with cancer, George Washington’s final illness in 1799 involved severe throat inflammation and respiratory distress. Some modern medical historians speculate it may have been linked to a tumor, such as lymphoma or epiglottic cancer, though a severe infection is the more widely accepted cause. Aggressive bloodletting and outdated treatments likely accelerated his decline, revealing the limitations of 18th-century medicine.In 1884, Ulysses S. Grant was diagnosed with throat cancer, most likely caused by years of cigar smoking. Despite debilitating pain, he spent his final months writing his memoirs to provide financial support for his family. He completed them just days before his death in 1885. His determination is remembered as an act of courage and dignity in the face of terminal illness.During his second term in 1893, Grover Cleveland secretly underwent surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from the roof of his mouth. Fearing economic panic, the operation was conducted aboard a private yacht. The press was deceived, and the truth remained hidden for years. Cleveland recovered fully, but the episode remains a landmark case of presidential secrecy regarding health.Franklin D. Roosevelt lived with numerous health issues, including congestive heart failure and paralysis from polio. A lesion above his eye, later believed to have been melanoma, was removed during his presidency, although it was not publicly disclosed. His condition was largely concealed, reflecting a time when presidential illness was shielded from public scrutiny to maintain national morale.Ronald Reagan underwent surgery in 1985 to remove a cancerous polyp from his colon. He also received treatment for non-melanoma skin cancers during and after his presidency. Reagan’s relatively transparent approach helped promote awareness about colon cancer screenings and early detection, encouraging many Americans to undergo preventive medical checkups.Though not diagnosed with cancer, George H. W. Bush was treated for Graves' disease, a thyroid autoimmune disorder, while in office. The fact that both he and First Lady Barbara Bush were affected sparked widespread discussion about environmental and genetic factors in autoimmune illnesses and brought public attention to thyroid health.In 2015, more than three decades after his presidency, Jimmy Carter revealed he had melanoma that had spread to his liver and brain. He underwent surgery, radiation, and cutting-edge immunotherapy. Astonishingly, he announced in 2016 that he was cancer-free. His recovery highlighted the potential of immunotherapy and inspired hope for others facing late-stage cancer diagnoses.In May 2025, President Joe Biden was diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer that had spread to his bones. The cancer, a high-grade adenocarcinoma, is hormone-sensitive and may respond to treatment. His last PSA test was in 2014, raising concerns about screening practices and transparency. Biden’s condition renewed national dialogue on aging leadership and medical oversight in the presidency.These accounts reveal that illness does not exempt even the most powerful. From George Washington’s mysterious final hours to Joe Biden’s modern-day diagnosis, the way presidents manage and disclose serious health conditions continues to shape public expectations, medical policy, and the broader human understanding of leadership under strain.","Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer.

iPhone's US manufacturing remains unlikely

A big Wall Street analyst predicts Apple could manufacture up to 65% of its iPhones in India by fall 2025, as the tech giant navigates mounting pressure from President Trump to shift production away from the the country. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who maintains a $270 price target and Outperform rating on Apple stock, called the Trump administration's 90-day tariff pause ""a dream scenario"" for the company. By this fall, Ives believes Apple ""could manufacture 60% to 65% of its smartphones in India,"" citing his ""high level of confidence"" that the iPhone maker is accelerating its manufacturing transfer to the South Asian country.The prediction comes amid escalating tensions between Apple and the Trump administration over the company's India operations. During a business event in Qatar, Trump revealed he confronted Apple CEO Tim Cook, stating: ""I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. I said to him... I don't want you building in India.""Despite presidential pressure, Ives suggests Apple retains strategic options. The company ""could easily pivot back to a China driven iPhone strategy,"" he noted, with actions dependent ""on the tariff situation and deal negotiations.""Apple has reportedly reassured the Indian government there will be ""no change"" in its investment plans, even as Trump publicly urged the company to increase US. production. The tech giant manufactured approximately $22 billion worth of iPhones in India in the year ending March 2025, representing a 60% increase from the previous year.However, Ives dismisses the possibility of significant American iPhone production, stating there is ""no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US. in the near term."" The analyst warns that US.-manufactured iPhones would cost consumers around $3,500 due to supply chain complexities and manufacturing costs.Apple's manufacturing partner Foxconn continues expanding its Indian operations with a $1.5 billion investment, planning to produce 25-30 million iPhones at its India plants in 2025, more than doubling last year's output.","Wall Street analyst predicts Apple could manufacture up to 65% of its iPhones in India by fall 2025.

Severe weather in Delhi-NCR disrupted air travel

Cyclonic system behind the storm

No injuries, but a frightening Experience

In a harrowing mid-air episode on May 21, 2025, IndiGo flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar encountered a violent hailstorm that left the aircraft’s nose visibly damaged. The Airbus A321, carrying 227 passengers, was battered by sudden turbulence that sparked panic in the cabin. A now-viral video from inside the aircraft captured terrified passengers, including children, screaming as the plane shook intensely and lightning flashed outside. The pilot declared an emergency but managed to land the aircraft safely in Srinagar around 6:30 PM. Thankfully, no injuries were reported, and the aircraft has since been grounded for inspection. Experts believe such extreme weather encounters are likely to increase due to climate change. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is expected to review flight route protocols.Although IndiGo did not initially confirm the extent of the damage, viral photos have revealed that the aircraft's nose cone suffered significant structural damage. The damage is consistent with impact from large hailstones during the flight’s traversal of the storm system. The aircraft has since been grounded at Srinagar Airport for thorough inspection and repairs. The nose cone, which houses sensitive radar equipment, is a crucial part of flight navigation. Repairs could take several days, delaying the aircraft’s return to active service.The footage, widely circulated on social media, shows passengers in a state of fear and confusion as the aircraft shudders violently mid-air. Screams and cries from children dominate the audio, while flashes of lightning are visible through the windows. The cabin crew is seen attempting to maintain calm and ensure passenger safety as the aircraft fights through the intense weather. Several passengers have since shared their traumatic experiences online, seeking support. Psychological counselling is being recommended for those who were most affected.According to airline officials, the pilot of flight 6E 2142 reported an emergency to Srinagar Air Traffic Control upon encountering the hailstorm. Despite the hazardous conditions, the flight landed safely at approximately 6:30 PM. IndiGo stated that all protocols were followed and that the airport team attended to passengers' needs upon arrival.The incident coincided with a powerful storm that swept across Delhi-NCR on Wednesday evening, with wind speeds reaching up to 79 kmph. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported 12.2 mm of rainfall at Safdarjung between 5:30 PM and 8:30 PM. The sudden weather shift disrupted flight operations at Delhi Airport, left Metro services stranded, and caused chaos across the region.IMD attributed the turbulent weather to a cyclonic circulation over Haryana, embedded in a larger trough extending from Punjab to Bangladesh. Moisture influx from both the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal intensified the system, resulting in hailstorms and gusty winds across northern India.While there were no physical injuries reported among the 227 passengers, many described the experience as deeply unsettling. Trinamool Congress MPs, who were reportedly on board, later referred to the incident as a ""near-death experience."" IndiGo emphasized that customer well-being was prioritised upon landing. The incident has reignited calls for enhanced in-flight safety education and emergency drills. Passengers expressed gratitude for the crew’s professionalism during the ordeal.This incident serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictability of weather patterns and the challenges faced by pilots and crew during extreme conditions. While no one was harmed, the mental toll and the visible damage to the aircraft highlight the seriousness of such mid-air encounters.","IndiGo flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar encountered a violent hailstorm that left the aircraft’s nose visibly damaged.

MrBeast’s early life and how his career started

YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson , also known as MrBeast, has reportedly joined the ranks of billionaires, with Celebrity Net Worth estimating his net worth at $1 billion. This makes the 27-year-old content creator the eighth youngest billionaire globally, and the only one under 30 who built his wealth without inheritance. MrBeast began his YouTube career as a teenager, posting videos from his North Carolina home. His initial viral success came in 2017 with ""I Counted to 100,000,"" a video that took 44 hours to film and has since accumulated over 31 million views. Since then, he has gained recognition on the platform for his challenges, large-scale giveaways, and philanthropic content.In 2024, MrBeast was identified as a leading creator on the Forbes Top Creators list. While Forbes had previously estimated his net worth at $85 million, court documents from a 2024 lawsuit related to his food brand revealed his earnings were $223 million in 2023 and were projected to reach $700 million in 2024.His business ventures include Beast Burger , a delivery-only fast-food chain launched in 2020 that reportedly earned $2.3 million per month, though he later sued due to quality concerns. MrBeast also founded Feastables , a chocolate bar company that generated over $10 million in its initial months.Additionally, he co-created Juice Funds, a $2 million fund with Creative Juice that invests up to $250,000 in emerging creators. In the crypto and tech space, MrBeast holds Bitcoin and several CryptoPunks NFTs and is involved with platforms like Coinbase, Refinable, and the XCAD Network, which helps creators monetise videos with NFTs.His philanthropic efforts are equally extensive, as he established Beast Philanthropy, a nonprofit supporting large-scale charitable projects. MrBeast has donated over 100 cars, given away $1 million in a single video, and helped raise $20 million to plant trees through Team Trees.In 2023, he faced criticism for funding cataract surgeries for 1,000 blind individuals. In response, MrBeast reiterated his commitment, stating, “I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.”He made a similar pledge in 2019, outlining his life’s goal as ""make a bunch of money, and then give it all away while doing as much good as possible.""MrBeast's achievements have earned him various industry accolades, including a nomination for Vlogger of the Year at the Shorty Awards in 2019 and wins for Breakout Creator and 2020 YouTuber of the Year.His journey from counting to 100,000 on camera to building a multi-billion-dollar empire showcases a blend of creativity and generosity. MrBeast's career trajectory began in 2012 when, at just 13 years old, he started uploading videos under the username ""MrBeast6000.""His early content included gaming videos, often featuring Minecraft and Call of Duty, as well as videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers. He also created reaction videos and funny compilations, showcasing his willingness to experiment with different formats.By mid-2016, his main channel on YouTube had fewer than 30,000 subscribers, but his persistence led him to drop out of college later that year to pursue YouTube full-time.His growth accelerated through diverse real-world formats, including challenges, vlogs, and absurd tasks like watching paint dry for an hour or attempting to break glass with a hundred megaphones. He gained initial popularity with his ""Worst Intros on YouTube"" series.MrBeast is known for reinvesting nearly all his video earnings back into creating new content, allowing for increasingly ambitious productions. In 2021, he was the fastest-growing creator on YouTube, adding 37 million subscribers in one year.He has also expanded his content globally by launching separate channels for dubbed videos in over 10 languages, including Spanish, French, and Arabic, leading to substantial international viewership. His main channel became the most-subscribed on YouTube in June 2024.In related news, MrBeast shared an invitation to Indian cricketer Virat Kohli. Shared on X during the Indian Premier League (IPL), the post rapidly went viral, accumulating nearly 600K views, a testament to Kohli's universal recognition. “@imVkohli Hey!

Tech Layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut across more than 130 companies



Key stats (as of May 2025):

Total layoffs: 61,300+ employees

Companies involved: 130+

Sectors affected: Cloud computing, advertising, HR, devices, software engineering, sales

Microsoft: Streamlining leadership, prioritising engineers

Why Microsoft made the cuts:

Restructuring leadership layers to promote a flatter hierarchy

Investing more in engineering and product development

Optimizing global workforce by reducing duplication of roles

Google: Quiet workforce shifts behind the scenes

Strategic workforce realignment:

Focused layoffs across revenue-generating units

Elimination of redundant roles tied to aging product lines

A shift towards automation and generative AI technologies in advertising and consumer search

Amazon: Scaling back devices and emerging tech divisions

Behind Amazon’s cuts:

A realignment of priorities in consumer devices

Slower growth and usage rates of Alexa and Kindle platforms

Budget reallocation to cloud computing (AWS) and logistics optimization

CrowdStrike: Cutting 5% to focus on profitability

CrowdStrike’s layoff strategy:

Streamlining customer success and non-core support roles

Enhancing operating efficiency with AI-based threat detection tools

Reinvesting in international market expansion and enterprise sales

IBM: AI replaces jobs, but also creates new ones

IBM’s AI-driven workforce transition:

Use of AI automation in HR, reducing the need for traditional roles

Reinvestment in high-growth areas like quantum computing and hybrid cloud

Emphasis on reskilling and upskilling internal employees

Why are these layoffs happening? The 3 core reasons



1. Macroeconomic volatility

Global economic conditions remain unstable. Geopolitical tensions, high interest rates, and inflationary pressures have compelled tech companies to cut costs and bolster margins.

2. Post-pandemic growth corrections

During the COVID-19 pandemic, tech companies saw unprecedented growth and scaled their teams rapidly. As demand normalizes, many are right-sizing their workforces to match slower, more sustainable growth trajectories.

3. The AI revolution

Perhaps the most transformative factor is the rise of artificial intelligence. Tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot have already replaced or reduced the need for certain roles in coding, content creation, customer service, and HR. Companies are now prioritizing automation over expansion, leading to widespread redundancy across job functions that once required large teams.

What it means for the future of tech work

Emerging trends:

Fewer administrative layers, more direct reporting structures

Higher demand for AI literacy, even in non-technical roles

Greater reliance on contractors and fractional talent

Emphasis on remote and flexible work, with fewer full-time hires

Tech layoffs are defining the trajectory of the technology sector in 2025 — not solely due to innovation, but because of the sweeping workforce restructuring taking place across the industry. From global giants like Microsoft , Google , and Amazon to specialized cybersecurity firms such as CrowdStrike , companies are reducing headcounts in significant numbers. As of mid-May, more than 61,000 tech jobs have been cut across over 130 companies, according to data from Layoffs.fyi. Unlike previous downturns driven by financial collapses or market crashes, this wave is propelled by three powerful forces: slowing post-pandemic revenue growth, persistent global economic uncertainty, and, most notably, the rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in core business operations.These layoffs signal a broader transformation in how tech firms are responding to modern pressures. Rather than merely cutting costs, many are strategically reorganizing their internal structures, accelerating AI-driven automation, and reallocating resources toward long-term innovation and profitability.According to the data from Layoffs.fri, as of May 2025, over 61,000 workers have been laid off in the tech industry — a continuation of a trend that began in 2022 and escalated dramatically in 2023. Companies are now more strategic in their announcements, often avoiding large headlines by issuing smaller, staggered job cuts throughout the year. Still, the cumulative effect has created deep uncertainty among tech professionals worldwide.The layoffs are not restricted to startups or mid-size firms; the biggest names in tech — Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike — are among the most significant contributors to this tally. Let’s examine how each is navigating this reshuffling of talent and operations.In one of the largest individual cuts of the year, Microsoft laid off 6,000 employees, with nearly 2,000 roles eliminated in Washington state alone. This marked the company’s most substantial layoff since 2023. The job reductions span several business units, including support, administration, and middle management.According to an internal memo, the company is making these changes to “improve clarity of decision-making and better align teams with strategic priorities.” The layoff announcement also came with news of increased investment in AI-powered enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure.While Google hasn't made a single large-scale layoff announcement in 2025, it has been silently trimming its workforce across multiple departments. In May alone, 200 employees were laid off from its Global Business Organization (GBO) — a team that handles advertising sales and partner engagement. These cuts follow earlier reductions in the Pixel hardware team, Android division, Chrome operations, and Google Cloud.Google’s restructuring is part of a broader initiative to recalibrate its business model in the face of AI-led disruption in search and advertising, two of its most lucrative verticals. Rather than hiring aggressively, the company is being more selective, favoring AI talent over traditional business development roles.Amazon announced in April that it would cut around 100 jobs in its Devices and Services division, which includes Alexa, Kindle, and Zoox — its autonomous vehicle subsidiary.Amazon has long treated its devices division as an innovation lab. However, as pressure mounts to deliver profitability in every business line, the company is scaling back on experimental divisions and concentrating on proven revenue drivers like AWS and Prime logistics.Even high-growth cybersecurity companies aren’t immune. CrowdStrike announced layoffs impacting 5% of its global workforce, citing a shift towards long-term profitability amid rising costs and market volatility.CrowdStrike's decision is especially noteworthy as cybersecurity remains one of the fastest-growing segments of the tech industry. Yet even here, automation and AI are allowing firms to do more with fewer people, reducing the need for large support teams.IBM represents a hybrid approach to workforce management in the age of AI. While the company laid off several hundred employees, mostly from HR and administrative roles, it also announced new hiring plans focused on engineering, programming, and enterprise sales.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has been vocal about the company’s “AI-first” strategy, noting that while automation will eliminate certain roles, it will also create new demand for technical talent, especially in sectors where human insight remains essential.While the specifics vary by company, the underlying causes of the 2025 tech layoffs can be traced to three interwoven trends:The 2025 layoff wave is more than just a cost-cutting exercise — it is a strategic rebalancing of what work looks like in the digital economy. The shift isn’t just about reducing headcount; it’s about reshaping the types of roles that matter most.","Tech layoffs are defining the trajectory of the technology sector in 2025.

Xbox and PlayStation Price Hikes Explained

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the US federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines. Musk quoted a post by DOGE aka the Department of Government Efficiency which revealed that nearly 20% of the phone lines at a federal agency were unused. DOGE shared a post on X that reads “Unused phone lines! Of the 1048 @USOPM phone lines, 198 (19%) were either unused or duplicated.”It further added: “OPM (Office of Personnel Management) cancelled these lines (took 1 hour), resulting in ~$100k/yr in savings. Since OPM is ~0.1% of the federal government, this suggests that ~$100M/yr is wasted on unused lines”.The tech billionaire responded to the post, statingThe revelation could have broader implications for telecom providers supplying services to federal agencies. According to a 2023 Washington Post report, only 2% of U.S. adults use landlines exclusively. As legacy landline usage continues to decline—the cost and necessity of maintaining unused infrastructure is under increasing scrutiny.In 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed regulations that had previously required telecom providers to run copper landline connections to every home. The move marked a significant shift toward modernizing telecommunications infrastructure in favor of wireless and fiber-optic networks.According to a report, Verizon Communications Inc. remains the dominant landline service provider in the Northeastern United States, maintaining a strong regional presence even as overall landline use continues to decline nationwide.In a related news, Musk shared a 15-second clip of the US Vice President in conversation with Joe Rogan, where Vance said “You can say a lot of things about Elon Musk, but you can't say he's a dumb**s”.
