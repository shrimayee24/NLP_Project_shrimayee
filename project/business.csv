"'Tirupati laddu ghee had pig & beef fat, fish oil': Row rages in Andhra Pradesh; TDP, YSRCP lock horns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tirupati-laddu-row-lab-reports-confirm-lard-tallow-in-ghee-supplied-for-tirumala/articleshow/113499408.cms,"TIRUPATI: The TDP govt in Andhra Pradesh on Thursday made public laboratory analysis of the cow ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala temple trust for making its famous Tirupati laddu prasadam during the term of the YSRC govt . It revealed the presence of foreign fats including lard (clarified pig fat), tallow (beef fat) and fish oil.The samples also contained fats from vegetable sources like coconut, linseed, rapeseed and cottonseed.The analysis was conducted on July 23 after the government received complaints of change in taste of the laddu prasadam.Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had sparked a major controversy on Wednesday when he told NDA allies that animal fat had been found in the ghee for the laddus when YSRC was in power. YSRC had reacted angrily, denying the allegations and claiming it to be one of Naidu’s political stunts.The analysis by the Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF) of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), however comes with a caveat - there can be chances of false positive results in certain circumstances. The report lists several conditions where a result could go wrong, including in cases like overfeeding cows with feed rich in vegetable oils, underfeeding cows or the milk being subjected to technological treatments like removal of cholesterol.The report is silent whether the adulterants were deliberately added or crept in through feeding conditions and other factors.Naidu’s allegation and the NDDB’s report have shocked millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe as the Tirupati laddus are considered Maha Prasadam and carry a high sentimental value.The TDP govt had in June appointed senior IAS officer J Syamala Rao as the new executive officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) which manages the temple complex. As part of streamlining measures, an inquiry was ordered into the alleged poor quality, taste and texture of the laddus.TTD constituted an expert committee to look into the quality of the prasadam. The members included Dr B Surendranth, former principal scientist of the National Dairy Research Institute, Vijayawada, Bhaskar Reddy (dairy expert), Prof B Mahadevan (IIM-Bangalore) and Dr G Swarnalatha from the Telangana Veterinary UniversityApart from suggesting several measures to TTD to restore the taste and quality, the committee also sent samples of the ghee to NDDB, Gujarat. The lab reports, issued in July, confirmed the presence of foreign fats. TTD returned the ghee stocks supplied by AR Dairy Foods, Dindigul, in Tamil Nadu and blacklisted the contractor. Then, TTD selected Karnataka Milk Federation to supply the ghee.TTD sources said that while cow ghee was procured from the blacklisted contractor at Rs 320 per kg, the Tirupati trust is now procuring ghee at Rs 475 per kg from the Karnataka federation.TTD prepares and distributes about 3 lakh laddus to the devotees every day at Tirumala.

How first Indian astronaut in 40 years is prepping for space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-first-indian-astronaut-in-40-years-is-prepping-for-space/articleshow/113506596.cms,"In the spring of 2025, Indian astronaut group captain Shubhanshu Shukla is set to make history as the pilot of the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission that will mark India's first human presence on the International Space Station (ISS). The landmark mission, scheduled for launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, US, will be India's second govt-sponsored human spaceflight in over four decades - Wing Commander (retd) Rakesh Sharma had gone to space as part of a Soviet mission in 1984.The Axiom-4 mission is a result of a bilateral initiative between India and US. More than a year ago, PM Narendra Modi, during an official state visit to US, had announced that an Indian astronaut will travel to ISS. Subsequently, Isro signed a space flight agreement with Axiom Space, an American human spaceflight services provider and infrastructure developer.Shukla and his backup - fellow Indian astronaut, group captain Prashanth Nair - are both IAF test pilots and have joined an international crew for this mission. Its commander Peggy Whitson shared exclusive details about Shukla's role, the mission and more with TOI on email.""As the Ax-4 pilot, Shukla will assist me in conducting essential spacecraft operations, such as navigation and docking procedures,"" Whitson said. ""Training will prepare him to handle emergencies and perform critical system checks. Additionally, Shukla will support scientific research by setting up and managing microgravity experiments. This role involves extensive training in both the technical and operational aspects of spacecraft, ensuring he is well-prepared to contribute to the mission's goals and overall success.""In a recent Instagram live programme, Isro chairman S Somanath said that the Indian astronaut will conduct five experiments on ISS as part of the mission. The mission will also help India prepare for its Gaganyaan programme - Isro's first crewed mission - by providing valuable experience in spaceflight operations and international cooperation.Whitson added that Axiom Space has developed thorough training programmes for astronauts, emphasising both technical skills and emergency preparedness.""We work closely with Nasa and other international space agencies to ensure smooth integration with ISS. Additionally, Axiom invests in cutting-edge medical research and technology to monitor and maintain astronaut health during missions. By leveraging these strategies, Axiom Space aims to mitigate risks and ensure the success of our missions,"" she said.Elaborating on the preparations, she said Ax-4 astronauts will undergo rigorous training at Nasa, the Elon Musk-founded SpaceX , European Space Agency (ESA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa), and other partner facilities to prepare for the mission. The training covers safety protocols, health management, and ISS systems operations.""We practise in ISS mockups, reviewing procedures and enacting emergency scenarios to ensure we're ready for any situation. Additionally, we receive specialised training for the research and technology demonstration payloads for the mission,"" she said.The preparation also includes learning about launch site operations. The comprehensive training ensures that astronauts are well-equipped to conduct scientific research and technology demonstrations in the unique environment of ISS.The mission will utilise SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft. The Dragon's automated docking capabilities and state-of-the-art life support systems ensure a secure journey for the crew. This technology, combined with the diverse expertise of the international crew, sets the Ax-4 mission apart from previous space endeavours.Whitson is America's most experienced astronaut with an impressive history of 675 days in space. Her extensive experience, including her role as a two-time ISS commander and former chief of Nasa's Astronaut Office, brings invaluable expertise to the mission. Her current position as director of human spaceflight for Axiom Space further underscores the mission's significance in advancing commercial space ventures.Also part of the Ax-4 mission to ISS are specialists Slawosz Uznanski of Poland and Hungarian Tibor Kapu. Uznanski, a member of ESA's Astronaut Reserve Class of 2022, brings his expertise in radiation testing and electronics systems for space applications.Kapu, selected for the Hungarian to Orbit (Hunor) Astronaut Programme, specialises in space radiation protection and pharmaceutical research.""The Ax-4 crew will spend up to 14 days aboard ISS. This mission will realise the return to human spaceflight for India, Poland, and Hungary, marking each nation's first mission to the space station in history and second govt-sponsored human spaceflight mission in over 40 years. This mission emphasises how Axiom Space is redefining the pathway to low-Earth orbit and elevating national space programs globally,"" Whitson said.The Ax-4 mission aims to support policy frameworks and incentives that boost commercial activities in space.""The mission is normalising access, allowing countries and space agencies with varying capacities to contribute to and benefit from space exploration. Axiom Space missions play a pivotal role in advancing international cooperation in space exploration. By partnering with organisations like ESA, Isro, and Hunor, Axiom fosters collaboration in human spaceflight, research, and technology development.

KOLKATA/BURDWAN/RANCHI: Bengal's battle with floods triggered a face-off with Jharkhand Thursday after CM Mamata Banerjee ordered the sealing of the inter-state border, accusing Damodar Valley Corporation ( DVC ) of swamping 11 south Bengal districts with 5 lakh cusecs of water in three days despite her appeals to the PSU and counterpart and INDIA bloc ally Hemant Soren.Mamata declared her government was ""severing all ties"" with DVC, which operates in both states, for ""flooding Bengal to save Jharkhand"".""It's a hasty and unreasonable move by Bengal,"" JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said. ""We will block all goods trucks carrying foodgrain and other commodities to Bengal. Water levels in Jharkhand's reservoirs were nearing the danger mark due to heavy rain. In any case, an inter-state committee monitors release of water from overflowing dams.""While Mamata said the border was being closed to pre-empt cars being swept away by surging floodwaters on this side of the border, Soren-led JMM threatened retaliation over Bengal Police barring trucks and other commercial vehicles from Jharkhand beyond Dhanbad-West Burdwan border in Kulti .""I called DVC chairperson (S Suresh Kumar) and spoke to Jharkhand CM Soren, urging them not to release water... This cannot be allowed,"" the CM said, pointing out that 26 people had died in the floods and 2.5 lakh people displaced.Mamata alleged that DVC hadn't been providing details of how much water was being released from dams in the neighbouring state. Senior officials in several of Bengal's westernmost districts said police checkpoints had been set up along the border with Jharkhand and all inbound vehicles were being stopped, barring any emergency.Mamata, who visited East Midnapore 's Panskura and Howrah's Udaynarayanpur Thursday to survey the flood damage, later held an emergency meeting at the state secretariat with chief secretary Manoj Pant, DGP Rajeev Kumar and other senior officers. ""Even Durga Puja pandals are under water,"" the CM said.""Why should Bengal always suffer? Why will DVC always try to keep Jharkhand safe? I need to protect Bengal,"" she said. ""This flooding is not because of rain. It is because of the absence of any desilting or dredging despite my appeals to PM Narendra Modi.""DVC executive director Anjani Dubey said the PSU had ""reduced the release of water, corresponding to reduction in rainfall"". Denying Banerjee's accusations, the Centre said all norms were followed while releasing water from DVC. The Jal Shakti ministry and power ministry said all parties concerned were kept informed about the weather conditions likely to prevail from Sept 14-16 and the release of water.","Bengal's battle with floods triggered a face-off with Jharkhand Thursday.

These can be summarised as theatres associated with ISIL or AQ-linked extremist groups active in and around Jammu and Kashmir, whether directly or via proxies or affiliates, as well as other separatist movements in the region; other ISIL and AQ cells, their affiliates, or radicalised individuals in India; regional insurgencies in the Northeast and North of India; and left-wing extremist groups seeking to overthrow the government. The most significant terrorism threats appear to relate to ISIL or AQ-linked groups active in and around Jammu and Kashmir,"" FATF said.Praising India's performance in fighting against the anti-money laundering, the FATF report said that New Delhi has implemented an anti-money laundering (AML)/counter-terrorist financing (CFT) system that is effective in many respects and particularly good results are being achieved in the areas of money laundering/TF risk understanding; national coordination and cooperation; use of financial intelligence for money laundering, predicate offences and TF investigations; depriving criminals of their assets; preventing misuse of legal structures; the implementation of targeted financial sanctions related to proliferation; and international cooperation.FATF also said that there are scope of major improvements to strengthen the prosecution of ML and TF, protecting the non-profit sector from terrorist abuse, supervision and implementation of preventive measuresIndia achieved major success in the last two to three years before the FATF on-site visit, according to the report.""Many positive developments have taken place in the last two to three years before the on-site visit, and while some initiatives are beginning to show results (e.g., increases in ML investigations, improvements to the timelines for incoming MLA requests, the implementation of a new mechanism of TFS for PF), others have been too recent and require an appropriate period of time to be operational and lead to changes in the effectiveness of the system (e.g., DNFBP and VASP supervision)."""" India has achieved strong results in its technical compliance with the FATF Standards.

In January 2023, New Delhi issued a similar notice, citing Pakistan's failure to cooperate in its implementation.According to PTI sources, the recent notice builds on this earlier one and reflects India’s concerns over various issues, including demographic changes, environmental challenges, and the need to accelerate clean energy development to meet its emission targets.India has also raised concerns about the implications of cross-border terrorism, with officials suggesting that the treaty's provisions require updating to reflect new security realities. The review request is in view of India’s dissatisfaction with Pakistan’s handling of disputes related to the treaty, particularly over the Kishenganga and Ratle Hydro Electric Projects in Jammu and Kashmir.The World Bank , which is a signatory to the treaty, appointed a neutral expert and established a Court of Arbitration to resolve differences over the projects. New Delhi has since expressed frustration over the World Bank’s decision, arguing that the initiation of two concurrent processes violates the treaty's prescribed dispute resolution mechanism.","India formally sought a review of the 64-year-old Indus Water Treaty (IWT) Pakistan reaffirmed the agreement's importance, expressing hope that New Delhi would continue to adhere to its provisions.

Besides, steps to prevent non-profit organisations (NPOs) from being abused for terrorist financing was another priority highlighted by FATF.""We were trying to make a case that regulatory framework is good enough... Their case is that since the NPO sector is very big, we should have good risk-based metrics. For India, it should be a risk-based regulation and not stifling regulation.

CHANDIGARH: Jawan and kisan headlined BJP's manifesto for the Oct 5 Haryana polls that party president J P Nadda unveiled in Rohtak Thursday, containing a job guarantee to Agniveers at the end of their contracted four-year military service and MSP for 24 crops, reported.The manifesto also promises a more-than-double hike in compensation for crop failure from Rs 6,000 to Rs 15,000 an acre.Nadda contrasted it with Congress's alleged negligence of farmers and failure to ensure MSP for more than eight crops. Cong's guarantees include a legal guarantee for MSP. Lado Luxmi Yojana , under which every woman can claim a monthly stipend of Rs 2,100, aims to go one-up on a similar commitment in Cong manifesto with an extra Rs 100.Another similarity with Congress's guarantees is subsidised cooking gas at Rs 500 a cylinder. BJP has also promised a scooty each to rural girls going to college under its Avval Balika Yojna (scheme for meritorious girls). For the backward classes, the saffron party has lined up guaranteed entrepreneurship loans of Rs 25 lakh each and welfare boards for different categories. Full scholarships will be offered to OBC and SC students on admission to engineering or medical colleges.While Congress's manifesto assures citizens of free medical treatment worth up to Rs 25 lakh, BJP's commitment is limited to Rs 10 lakh, with a provision for an additional Rs 5 lakh for those above 70 years.BJP's manifesto countered Congress's social-security pension of Rs 6,000 a month under different categories with a commitment to pay pension proportionate to the increase in dearness allowance for govt employees and pensioners. Like Congress, the saffron party promises two lakh govt jobs without any ""parchi-kharchi"" (favouritism or bribe). The manifesto doesn't mention the old pension scheme, which Congress wants to revive. Nadda pointed out that Haryana's per capita income had more than doubled since 2014, from Rs 1.37 lakh to Rs 3 lakh in 2023. The state's exports, too, soared from Rs 68,000 crore to Rs 2.5 lakh crore during the same period, he said.The BJP chief highlighted electrification of 5,800-odd villages as another achievement, pointing out that the list comprised 538 villages a decade ago.

NEW DELHI: India has sent notice to Pakistan seeking changes in crucial Indus Water Treaty . According to news agency PTI sources, the Indian government served a formal notice to Pakistan seeking modification in the treaty.The notice highlighted fundamental changes in circumstances that require review of treaty.India had also sent a notice to Pakistan in January, 2023 seeking amendment to 1960 treaty.The notice was issued due to Pakistan's failure to cooperate in the implementation of the treaty.According to the Indus Waters Treaty signed between India and Pakistan in 1960, ""all the water of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi amounting to around 33 million acre feet (MAF) annually — is allocated to India for unrestricted use."" On the other hand, the majority of the water from the western rivers, namely the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab, which amounts to approximately 135 MAF annually, has been allocated to Pakistan.Also Read:The treaty grants India the right to generate hydroelectricity through run-of-the-river projects on the western rivers, subject to specific design and operation criteria. Pakistan has the right to raise objections to the design of Indian hydroelectric projects on these rivers. Under the treaty, Pakistan received roughly 80 per cent of the water in the Indus drainage system, while India was allocated about 3.3 crore out of the total 16.8 crore acre-feet of water in the Indus system. Currently, India utilises slightly more than 90 per cent of its allocated share of the Indus waters.India has the right to utilise water resources from the Indus River system in several states, including Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. These states also receive water from the Yamuna River, a tributary of the Ganga. Pakistan, on the other hand, heavily relies on the Indus system, particularly in its Punjab province, which is crucial for feeding the rest of the country. Whenever India attempts to use its allocated water quota or construct a dam as permitted under the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan raises objections, leading to increased tensions between the two nations.One such example is the Tulbul Navigation Project, which the Indian government decided to expedite following the Uri terror attack. The project, referred to as the Wullar Barrage project by Pakistan, is a long-standing plan that was suspended in 1987 due to objections from Pakistan. According to sources, despite India's repeated efforts to find a mutually acceptable solution, Pakistan refused to discuss the issue during the five meetings of the Permanent Indus Commission held between 2017 and 2022. Recently, at Pakistan's persistent insistence, the World Bank has initiated actions on both the neutral expert and Court of Arbitration processes.Under the Indus Waters Treaty, India has the right to develop 13.4 lakh acres of irrigation in Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. However, currently, only 6.42 lakh acres of land are irrigated in these Union Territories. Furthermore, the treaty allows India to store 3.60 million acre-feet of water from the western rivers, namely the Jhelum, Indus, and Chenab. To date, there is virtually no storage capacity developed in Jammu and Kashmir. The treaty also permits India to construct run-of-river dams on the Jhelum, Chenab, and Indus without blocking the flow of water. This provision gives India the advantage of temporarily restricting the flow of waters in the rivers allocated to Pakistan under the treaty.","India has served a formal notice to Pakistan seeking modification in the Indus Water Treaty.

US Fed cuts interest rates by 50 bps in a first since 2020: Why it matters for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-fed-cuts-interest-rates-by-50-bps-in-a-first-since-2020-why-it-matters-for-india/articleshow/113467841.cms,"Impact on foreign investment

Sectoral impacts

RBI's policy response

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The US Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday, marking the first cut in over four years. In its statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said, ""In light of progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4.75% to 5%.""This move signals the beginning of a policy shift to ease the restrictive conditions previously implemented to control inflation.The Fed's decision will lower the rates at which commercial banks lend to consumers and businesses, reducing the cost of borrowing across a range of financial products, including mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. This cut is expected to make borrowing more affordable, stimulating spending and investment.The ripple effects of the Fed rate cut will be felt globally, particularly in emerging markets like India.One of the most immediate likely effects of the rate cut is the potential increase in foreign investment in India. When US interest rates are high, investors tend to favor US Treasury securities for their relatively higher returns. However, with a rate cut, yields on these securities will decrease, prompting investors to seek better returns elsewhere, including in Indian equities and debt markets. This shift could lead to a substantial inflow of foreign capital into India, driving up demand for Indian stocks and bonds, which may subsequently increase their prices.The influx of foreign capital is also likely to affect the Indian Rupee (INR). As foreign investors convert their currencies into INR for investment purposes, demand for the rupee will rise, potentially leading to its appreciation against the US dollar. A stronger rupee can have mixed effects; while it may lower the cost of imports (especially crucial commodities like oil), it could also negatively impact Indian exporters by making their goods more expensive for foreign buyers.Globally lower interest rates typically lead to a rally in bond markets . In India, this could mean that existing bonds become more attractive as their yields appear favorable compared to new issues. Consequently, this dynamic may lower borrowing costs for both the government and corporations, encouraging more capital investments and stimulating economic growth .Certain sectors are poised to benefit directly from the Fed's rate cut. For instance, the information technology (IT) sector may see increased demand as US corporations expand their IT budgets due to reduced borrowing costs. Additionally, other sectors such as consumer goods and infrastructure could also experience growth as cheaper financing becomes available.The RBI's response to the Fed's actions will be crucial. Historically, Indian monetary policy has been influenced by US rates. However, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has already signaled that India is not compelled to follow suit and reduce its own rates.The governor emphasized that maintaining financial stability remains a top priority for the central bank.

“I want two.”

“He said, ‘How much do you think you’re going to make this year?’ I said, ‘Maybe $1.5 million?’ He said, ‘You’re going to make $15 million.’”

Big names in professional wrestling and entertainment alike, like The Rock, were eagerly awaited when they saw each other at Survivor Series in 1996. Despite the lack of fan appeal for his first babyface persona, Rocky Maivia, he became more well-known after transforming into ""The Rock"" and joining The Nation of Domination. Together with ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, The Rock had become one of the biggest names in professional wrestling by 1999.In a recent interview with Patrick Bet-David, The Rock discussed his first contract negotiations with Vince McMahon and the key moments that influenced his career path. The Rock praised his relationship with McMahon, which was grounded in mutual respect and a shared dedication to hard work. He noted,The Rock also revealed his ambition to elevate WWE to new heights after becoming “The Rock.” When McMahon inquired,as his career began to soar, The Rock’s answer was assertive:This vision marked the start of The Rock’s journey to superstardom.Also read: ""I Heard The Entire Show Just Got Ripped In Half"": WWE Superstar Reflects On His Frustrations With Last-Minute Script Changes During Vince McMahon's Tenure The Rock's initial WWE contract was far from what one might expect for a future superstar. He revealed,Although $150,000 annually might seem substantial, The Rock pointed out that the expenses of traveling—like hotels, food, and transportation—meant he had to manage his earnings carefully. He elaborated,highlighting the challenging reality of making ends meet despite the seemingly decent salary.It was time to review The Rock's contract terms as his notoriety increased. Although McMahon recommended that The Rock consider hiring a representative, The Rock decided to handle the talks on his own. “I said, ‘I’d like to negotiate with you directly. How we met was with a handshake, and I believe how we’re going to do this is with a handshake,’” The Rock explained.When it came to discussing his salary, The Rock asked about the highest-paid wrestler on the roster, who at the time was “Stone Cold” Steve Austin, earning a guaranteed $1 million. Without hesitation, The Rock stated,Although McMahon was initially taken aback, he appreciated The Rock’s rationale and ambition. He did, however, have a stipulation: The Rock needed to understand the business side of wrestling.The Rock immersed himself in studying WWE's financial aspects over the next few weeks, covering everything from state taxes to venue expenses to wrestler salaries. With this newfound understanding of the industry, he renegotiated his contract with the goal of matching Austin's $1 million guarantee. However, McMahon made an unexpected discovery.By the late ’90s and early 2000s, WWE was thriving, and The Rock’s career was poised for unprecedented success.Also read: WWE Hall of Famer Says that Hell in a Cell Might Disrupt Punk-McIntyre's Raw Feud","The Rock's first contract with WWE was a five-year contract for $150,000 a year.

WWE Legend Calls John Cena's Praise of Roman Reigns as 'Greatest of All Time' Unfair,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/wwe-legend-calls-john-cenas-praise-of-roman-reigns-as-greatest-of-all-time-unfair/articleshow/113483042.cms,"Ken Shamrock does not agree with John Cena’s comment on Roman Reigns



It is hard to achieve the status of Greatest of All Time and iconic WWE superstar John Cena previously called Roman Reigns a GOAT for his immense contribution to the company while making his own prominence in the business. However, recently former UFC and WWE star Ken Shamrock has responded to Cena’s comment on Reigns calling Cena’s verdict “unfair.”During his chat with Shannon Sharpe on Club Shay-Shay, John Cena praised Roman Reigns and called him The Greatest of All Time.However, giving the GOAT status casually is quite complicated as several superstars who have made their name written in golden words in the history of the business deserve the credit more, at least, according to Ken Shamrock.Also Read: Former WWE star shared a heartfelt message for Nikki Bella amid her divorce rumor Shamrock recently had a chat with VLAD TV and shared his thoughts on Cena’s claim for the Tribal Chief. ""I think it's unfair,” Shamrock said. “I just... how do you measure that? I just think there's so many great wrestlers. I would put Rock up there, no question, yeah, absolutely no question,"" he continued.""I would put John Cena up there. I mean... I would put Shawn Michaels up there. I mean, there's so many guys that you could put up there and make a great argument.""Of course, Reigns’ meteoric rise in the company is definitely commendable and almost no wrestling fan would deny that but Cena himself created a stunning legacy in the business. Several other superstars including Hulk Hogan, Shawn Michaels, The Rock, The Undertaker, Tripple H, and 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin have also rightfully earned their spot to be called greatest superstars.Following Cena’s comment, the Original Tribal Chief has recently responded in his interview at Bloomberg Power Players of New York. “The numbers don’t lie,” Reigns said. “I wish I could say, ‘I’m Taylor Swift out there,’ but we have a great team. I have a Wiseman. Business has been really good. It’s one of those weird situations.“As far as what John said, I kind of witnessed and observed his early reign as WWE’s top guy and face of the company. Nobody knows better about everything that it takes to get to that point and be in that conversation. I guess I’m just going to agree with him,” he added.Recently, Reigns has teamed up with Universal Champion Cody Rhodes to take down his cousin Solo Sikoa and Jacob Fatu in the upcoming PLE Bad Blood.Also Read: Rhea Ripley Spilled Beans on Dominik Mysterio's 'Daddy Issues'","Former UFC and WWE star Ken Shamrock has responded to John Cena's comment on Roman Reigns calling Cena's verdict “unfair” Cena previously called Reigns a GOAT for his immense contribution to the company.

NEW DELHI: Football is a game of glory, wealth, and fame, but even the biggest stars in the sport aren’t immune to legal troubles. In recent years, several world-class footballers have found themselves on the wrong side of the law, particularly when it comes to tax evasion .From Cristiano Ronaldo to Lionel Messi , these players have faced hefty fines and legal battles over unpaid taxes.Without any further ado, here are the top 5 footballers who were fined for tax evasion.Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the most famous footballers in the world, faced tax evasion charges during his time at Real Madrid . In 2019, the Portuguese star was ordered to pay €18.8 million in fines and was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence.The Spanish authorities accused Ronaldo of hiding income from image rights between 2010 and 2014.To avoid prison time, Ronaldo agreed to settle the case, paying the fine and resolving his legal woes, but the incident remains a blot on his otherwise glittering career.Arguably one of the greatest footballers of all time, Lionel Messi also found himself embroiled in a tax evasion scandal.In 2017, Messi and his father, Jorge, were found guilty of defrauding the Spanish government of €4.1 million by hiding earnings from image rights between 2007 and 2009.Messi received a 21-month prison sentence, which was later converted into a €252,000 fine. Like Ronaldo, Messi’s reputation was briefly tarnished by the scandal, though it didn’t affect his career trajectory.Brazilian star Neymar has also faced tax evasion allegations, both in his homeland and in Spain.In 2016, Brazilian authorities froze Neymar’s assets, including a yacht and a private jet, after accusing him of evading taxes between 2011 and 2013.He was fined approximately €45 million. Neymar also dealt with legal troubles following his high-profile transfer to Barcelona , where there were allegations of irregularities in his transfer fees, although those cases were settled.Former Real Madrid and Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso was another footballer caught up in tax evasion controversies. Alonso was accused of failing to pay nearly €2 million in taxes related to image rights earnings during his time in Spain between 2010 and 2012.Unlike Ronaldo and Messi, Alonso did not settle his case immediately, instead choosing to fight the charges in court.Later, Alonso was acquitted, but the legal battle dragged on for several years, keeping him in the headlines for all the wrong reasons.Colombian striker Radamel Falcao, known for his goal-scoring prowess, was accused of defrauding the Spanish tax authorities of nearly €5.66 million during his time at Atlético Madrid .Falcao was found guilty of concealing income from image rights between 2012 and 2013.Later, he agreed to pay a fine of €9 million to settle the charges. Like many of his peers, Falcao's legal troubles stemmed from the complex financial structures used to manage image rights, a recurring issue in football.The world of football brings fame, fortune, and sponsorship deals, but as these cases show, it also brings financial scrutiny.While the players listed above have all faced significant fines and legal issues, they’ve managed to continue their successful careers. However, these tax evasion cases serve as a reminder that even the wealthiest athletes are accountable to the law.","Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Radamel Falcao are among the footballers who have been fined for tax evasion.

What the lawsuit says



NEW DELHI: India on Thursday reacted sharply to a US court summoning the Centre's top officials following a civil lawsuit filed by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, leader of the banned pro-Khalistan group Sikhs for Justice.India-designated terrorist Pannun has claimed that there was a conspiracy orchestrated by Indian officials to assassinate him, which he alleges was thwarted when the hired hitmen turned out to be undercover US agents.Reacting to the summons, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said: ""As we have said earlier, these are completely unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations. Now that this particular case has been lodged. It doesn't change our views about the underlying situation.""""I would only invite your attention to the person behind this particular case whose antecedents are well known. I would also underline the fact that the organisation so-called that this person represents is an unlawful organisation, has been declared as such under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act of 1967 and it has been done so on account of its involvement in anti-national and subversive activities aimed at disrupting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India,"" Misri said during a press interaction.When asked if the Khalistan issue will be discussed during PM Modi's visit to the US from September 21-23, Misri said: ""As we have said earlier, whatever issues are of mutual concern between India and America, we discuss them all. Whether any specific issue will be raised or not, I cannot say at this time, but I can definitely say that we will discuss all the issues.""The summons, issued by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, names several high-ranking Indian officials, including National Security Advisor Ajit Doval , former Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) chief Samant Goel, and R&AW agent Vikram Yadav.It also names Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national incarcerated in a New York jail after being charged with murder for hire and murder-for-hire conspiracy for allegedly contracting hitmen to murder Pannun.The civil case is also against other ""possible defendants whose identity is currently unknown"".The pro-Khalistani terrorist is seeking financial compensation for assault and emotional distress, asserting that his life remains in jeopardy due to these alleged assassination attempts.Pannun's claims are particularly contentious given that he is designated as a terrorist in India and has been linked to various activities promoting Khalistani separatism. His lawsuit references past incidents, including the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, another Khalistani leader, in Canada.The lawsuit alleges that Yadav, directed by R&AW, recruited Gupta to hire hitmen to murder Pannun, and that the murder plot was approved by Goel and Doval.However, it was foiled as the hitmen were undercover US law enforcement agents.The complaint alleges that PM Modi knew about the murder plot but states that he is not named in the lawsuit as he has immunity as head of a foreign state.In the complaint, Pannun claims that it was not a ""rogue operative"" behind the plot and alleges that ""India has been traced to over 20 recent international murders carried out by R&AW"".""This lawsuit seeks to hold the GOI and a number of high-ranking officials there accountable under US tort law,"" said Pannun's counsel, Matthew Borden. ""We aim to hold everyone involved in this plot accountable"".In the complaint Pannun alleges he is being targeted because he campaigns for the creation of Khalistan and is organising an unofficial Khalistan referendum.","U.S. court summons India's top officials following civil lawsuit filed by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, leader of the banned pro-Khalistan group Sikhs for Justice.

The deputy conservator of forests has passed an order directing the PWD not to fell standing trees for the six-lane elevated corridor project at Porvorim. The order is “not to cut the standing trees as of now, and to seek the possibility of sparing the trees or carry out translocation, as suggested by the petitioners.”The direction was sent by the deputy conservator of forests, North Goa division, Ponda, Jiss Varkey, to the executive engineer works division VII (NH), Mapusa.The order was produced before the high court during a hearing on Thursday after it was brought to the notice of the HC that a large tree was felled while the court is hearing the matter. At the last hearing, govt told the HC that it has received permission for felling more than 600 trees and will translocate four. The HC then gave the petitioners, Aaron Victor Fernandes and others, an opportunity to list more large trees that can be saved from felling and can be translocated.The petitioners submitted a list of 14 large trees to the forest department which could be translocated, but they were told that one of these had already been felled.Govt was told by the HC to show what study was undertaken after receiving the application for felling trees. The HC also wanted to know the basis on which approval was granted for felling 600-odd trees for the Porvorim project .The Tree Authority approved the felling of hundreds of trees for the elevated corridor at Porvorim only a day after the application was filed, advocate Norma Alvares, representing the petitioners, submitted to the HC on Thursday.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
