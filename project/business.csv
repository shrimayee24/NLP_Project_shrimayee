Bangladesh wants fresh joint inspection of standoff fencing points; BSF doesn’t yield,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-wants-fresh-joint-inspection-of-standoff-fencing-points-bsf-doesnt-yield/articleshow/118436466.cms,"Representational image

NEW DELHI: Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), at the Director General-level border coordination conference between BSF and BGB here, formally objected to construction of single-row fence (SRF) by the Border Security Force (BSF) within 150 yards of the Indo-Bangladesh border, seeking a fresh joint inspection “where there are issues” and renegotiation of the terms, including how close to the ‘zero line’ can the fence be built.“It has been requested that we do a joint inspection and joint record of discussion on the ground very elaborately so that the fencing or further progress can happen,” the BGB DG told media persons at a joint press conference with BSF DG Daljit Singh Chawdhary after the conclusion of the biannual DG-level border talks here.BSF, however, has not agreed to any renegotiation of terms, which sources said are as per the joint record of discussions (JRD) already finalised in the past between BSF and BGB and duly ratified by the then Bangladesh govt. A senior official said the BSF stance is guided by the principle of continuity, which applies to bilateral pacts irrespective of the government in office in the signatory nations.BSF is erecting SRF at around 90 points along the Indo-Bangladesh border where fencing was found feasible only within 150 yards of the zero line, also known as “no man’s land”. Siddique on Thursday indicated the BGB’s request for a fresh joint inspection and joint record of discussion is based on the assessment that “proper mutual consenting is yet to be done or could be done in a better manner”.“How far back from the zero line the fence should be, was always a matter of discussion,” said the BGB DG.At the press conference, Siddique played down the attacks on minorities in Bangladesh post the regime change in August 2024, saying they were “an exaggeration of the media” and claiming that minorities were safe in his country. This comes days after the Indian ministry of external affairs told the Lok Sabha that there were reports of 23 Hindus having died and 152 incidents of attacks on Hindu temples in Bangladesh since the new regime took over.MEA informed the LS on Feb 7 that Dhaka, in a press release dated December 10, 2024, had announced that 88 cases relating to such attacks were registered, leading to the arrest of 70 people. had said subsequent police investigations verified 1,254 incidents. It also pointed to reports of 76 attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh between Nov 26, 2024 and Jan 25, 2025.The BGB DG, while claiming that “attacks on minorities (in Bangladesh) per se did not happen,” cited the “most peacefully organised” Durga Puja celebrations as proof. He said the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) were strictly tasked by the new regime in Dhaka to ensure that the Hindu community could observe the festival.“BGB jurisdiction is within 8 km of the international boundary, and BGB personally provided security at several puja pandals there,” he said while claiming that the attacks were not directed at minorities but linked to the “political problem” there. He said though there was some fear among minorities on the ground, the Bangladeshi LEAs and BGB could convince them against any need to migrate. He said the minorities were given security as requested in the couple of months following the regime change, and added that the offer of security stands if any threat is perceived in the future.BSF DG Chawdhary shared that cross-border infiltration had substantially reduced after August 5, the day Sheikh Hasina regime was unseated, with both BSF and BGB stepping up operational deployment.On BGB’s objections to killing of Bangladeshi miscreants trying to infiltrate into India under night cover, Chawdhary said the force strictly follows the protocol of graded escalation, using lethal force only as a last resort and with full restraint.","Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) formally objected to construction of single-row fence (SRF) by the Border Security Force (BSF) within 150 yards of the Indo- Bangladesh border.

We will promote biodiversity along Yamuna’s banks by creating green corridors, wetlands and riverbank buffer zones

We will ensure zero industrial emissions into the Yamuna

We will organise an annual Yamuna Festival

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and her ministers on Thursday hit the ground running with focus on ""Maa Yamuna."" The chief minister attended a grand ""Yamuna Aarti"" on Vasudev ghat before chairing her first cabinet meeting which announced implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme - one of the key poll promises made by BJP to the people of Delhi during elections.That ""clean Yamuna project"" was important for the BJP was evident from the fact that the process to start cleaning the river had started even before the government was formed. ""We want to make Maa Yamuna clean and free-flowing. This marks the beginning of the BJP's commitment,"" party's Delhi unit chief Virendra Sachdeva had said emphasising the government's dedication.Yamuna pollution has been one of the key election issues in Delhi for long. When Arvind Kejriwal became the chief minister in 2015 with a massive mandate, he promised to clean the Yamuna in 5 years. Ironically, ten years into power, he did little and in 2025 the people of Delhi turned to the BJP which promised a slew of measures in its manifesto to restore the lost glory of Yamuna river A month back, when the campaigning for assembly elections was at its peak, Kejriwal, who failed to live up to his promise of cleaning the Yamuna, added a completely new dimension to the Yamuna politics. The AAP chief accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna water that comes to Delhi.""BJP's Haryana government has poisoned the water in Yamuna. If this water would have entered Delhi only to be mixed with the drinking water, many people would have died in Delhi. It would have caused mass genocide,"" the former Delhi chief minister had then alleged.""A few countries use biological weapons to poison river water. But, the same has been done by the BJP government. They have done this to create chaos in Delhi so that the people of Delhi die and the blame comes on AAP. I want to tell BJP to not stoop this low,"" he also added.Clearly, this was an extreme which took everyone, even the people of Delhi, by surprise. BJP leader and former Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar claimed that Kejriwal's posioned water statement cost him very dear in elections. ""If he had not made such a statement, his party would have won 5-7 seats more,"" Khattar asserted, adding ""More than 40 per cent of Delhi's residents are from Haryana. This statement insulted people of Haryana and Delhi both.""Well, it would be difficult to quantify the extent of loss that the poison attack caused, one thing is sure that the people of Delhi did not buy the theory as the results showed.Interestingly, Arvind Kejriwal had also performed Yamuna Aarti at Gita ghat in November 2015 after becoming the chief minister to mark the beginning of his promise to clean the river. However, 10 years down the line Yamuna pollution was one of the key factors that led to his defeat. The BJP realises the importance of Yamuna in capital politics and that perhaps explains why Rekha Gupta did not want to miss the opportunity of sending out a strong message to people of Delhi on Day 1.","Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and her ministers on Thursday hit the ground running with focus on ""Maa Yamuna"" The chief minister attended a grand ""Yamuna Aarti"" on Vasudev ghat before chairing her first cabinet meeting which announced implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118426791,imgsize-1567485,width-400,resizemode-4/118426791.jpg"

Back to the 60s? Congress mulls making district units great again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/back-to-the-60s-congress-mulls-making-district-units-great-again/articleshow/118430292.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Adopting a back-to-basics approach in the face of prolonged political slump, Congress is mulling leaving major decision-making functions to its district units, the building blocks of the party organisation which have been marginalised in the recent decades.Sources said the idea of reorganising the party around District Congress Committees (DCCs) was discussed in the Wednesday meeting of the party brass, with office-bearers managing state units. While president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi are learnt to have spoken about focusing on district units, ranging from strengthening its structure to promoting loyal workers, sources said the future decision on the issue may revolve around giving greater importance to DCCs.Sources said the party may make district units crucial in selection of candidates for elections. While the present process involves recommendations starting from DCCs and then moving to state units and then to the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the leadership believes there is greater centralisation, with marginalisation of the first recommending authority. Some said the party was organised around the districts in the 1960s, before the shift towards the AICC happened. Also, the leadership of district units may get greater say in strategy and campaign, with the party building on their inputs. While Congress mulls returning the political primacy to districts, the lesson has been learnt at a big cost. As an insider said, the party did not have its DCCs constituted in Haryana for over seven years, a key reason behind the failure to manage better in the recent assembly elections. The same has been true for many other states.""The idea is to give greater responsibility, along with accountability, to DCCs in decision making,"" a party manager said.With the recent assembly defeats providing a reality check to Congress after the euphoria of Lok Sabha results in which the opposition did better than expected, Rahul has urged the states' managers to strategise better to take on the resource-rich BJP. Sources said he warned that the party had become predictable, which was providing an advantage to the rivals. Rahul is said to have stressed the importance of being unpredictable, citing the example of Bharat Jodo Yatra, and urged them to come up with out-of-the-box ideas in states. The importance of unpredictability was likened by a neta to that of Shivaji's guerrilla warfare.",Congress is mulling leaving major decision-making functions to its district units.

PM Narendra Modi has spoken of turning India into a $5 trillion economy. What would be MP’s contribution to it?

Where do you see MP tomorrow in terms of industry?

Investment promises are part of every such summit. How will you ensure that plans turn into reality?

What are your plans to decentralise development and take it to small towns and villages?

What inspired you to personally tour cities and hardsell Madhya Pradesh as an investment destination?

Madhya Pradesh won seven Krishi Karman Awards. Do you see the state winning industry accolades too?

How will you convince industrialists about MP’s ease of doing business?

MP has had political stability for a long time, and this is a major area of operation for BJP and RSS. Do you see this as an opportunity or a challenge?

‘Double-engine govt’ is a much talked about phrase. How has it benefited Madhya Pradesh?

What is the status of MP’s river-linking projects?

Your govt has banned liquor at 19 religious sites and you said this was the first step. Is your govt working towards prohibition, and if so, is there a timeline?

Will you move in the same direction?

If you had to pick the top three industrial sectors as ones with the biggest potential for MP’s growth, which would they be?

Would you be willing to reduce power tariffs for industries?

Congress was once strong here, but has been weakened drastically. Don’t you think a weak opposition is not healthy for a democracy?

We aim to double our economy in 5 years. MP’s success will be counted in India’s growth story. PM Modi has said that India will be the third largest economy in the world.

We will keep striving towards this.■ We want to make MP the No. 1 state in the country. Our state has the potential and it has everything going for it. All that we need to do is to make the most of opportunities in the best interests of the state and our people. It’s not a one-day job. We have to persist with long-term vision and long-term goals. By tapping MP’s potential and bringing more investment, we want to stop the brain drain from the state. Bright youngsters from MP are leaving the state to work in other cities or abroad. We will ensure that they get enough opportunities here so that they can contribute to their home state’s growth.■ Earlier, things were limited to speeches and talk. We decided to work. We created new policies, tailormade for specific sectors, and threw open the state to investors. They will come only when they see the state has the wherewithal and the determination to keep its word. We know that it won’t work if we do this once and sit back. We have been at it. We held regional conclaves. I went out and held business meetings in India and abroad. When you do it every month, it becomes a part of work culture and becomes part of a system. It picks up momentum. Since we are present at so many platforms, we keep meeting industrialists. If someone promises an investment, they will keep running into us somewhere or the other and the project will, of course, come alive.■ Every region of Madhya Pradesh must grow and develop, which is why our plans encompass the entire state. Every district is unique, it has its own set of potentials and possibilities. The districts that are rich in minerals, can excel in mining. Where agriculture is bountiful, there can be farmbased growth. Spiritual sites have their inherent, almost autonomous economy of religious tourism. This, too, will grow in a big way. MP has tremendous potential in forests and wildlife tourism. We will augment infrastructure to make it even bigger. After all, we have cheetahs and the brand of ‘Tiger State’. Where roads and railway tracks are needed, we are taking care of it. We look at the needs of today and tomorrow, and are flexible in our approach. For instance, BRTS was adversely affecting Bhopal traffic, so we had it removed. What was yesterday’s need is past. We are planning for the future. And we are taking decisions swiftly. There is a big advantage in that.■ I learnt from PM Modi that when you sit in a position of responsibility, if you don’t project your vision and immerse yourself entirely in the effort to achieve it, you will not succeed. When I was chairman of tourism corporation, I followed this rule for myself. Until the seed ends its own existence, no new plant can grow. If one has a vision, one has to also lead the way. My presence makes a difference at such meets. I believe it imbibes faith and trust in the minds of investors. Besides, God’s blessings also come my way for the hard work.■ We are already winning awards. We have got a wards in mining, tourism and education. We are one of the fastest growing economies in the country. Our GDP in the 2023- 24 fiscal grew by nearly 9.4%. We have even been awarded for good governance. Our revenue reforms have been well appreciated. We are No. 1 in agriculture, and we will soon be known as an industry powerhouse.■ We have simplified the application and approval process. What took 28 permissions earlier, now requires only 10. Our intention is that when an investor thinks of coming to MP, they will have already made up their minds because of the environment they will get here. When an investor comes to us with a proposal, our aim is to give him all the clearances in 28 days, maximum. Earlier, it used to stretch on for six months to even a year. They would grow frustrated from the uncertainty. We have made things simpler.■ We gain a lot from the strength of our organisation. We work like a family. Our work happens not because of someone’s post or designation but from a meeting of minds. It’s an administrative necessity that I am chief minister, otherwise there are so many veteran leaders, more senior to me, who we respect and work with perfect understanding.■ Oh, we benefit greatly from it. We don’t have to even think twice on so many issues. Take GST. We get around Rs 1.25 lakh crore from the Centre on this account. If it wasn’t PM Modi’s sarkar, we couldn’t even think of so much funds, that too on time. In Ken-Betwa river-linking project — the first of its kind in the world — or the project to link Parbati, Kalisindh and Chambal (PKC) rivers, we are getting Rs 75,000 crore. We only have to pitch in with 10% of the project cost, 90% comes from the Centre. This is the power of ‘double engine’.■ Projects dragged on for 20 years but now Bhoomi-pujan has been performed and tenders have been issued. There’s a new culture that has developed under PM Modi. States used to fight with each other earlier whereas there should be solidarity. After all, we are part of the same country. Now we are working closely with Uttar Pradesh not only on this but also sharing solar energy. In PKC river-linking, 13 districts each in Rajasthan and MP will benefit. Our relations with Rajasthan are great. We have another major project on Tapti river with Maharashtra. The aim should be to find common ground and a way to work in tandem for the betterment of people. All this is possible because of double-engine sarkar.■ At many places in MP, we had haphazard liquor bans. I said liquor should be banned completely in religious places. No half measures. Like Ujjain, liquor was prohibited in only 1km periphery. I extended it to the entire corporation area. So too with Omkareshwar, Datia, Orchha, Panna… If it’s a panchayat, nagar parishad or municipality, the entire area will be freed of liquor.■ Who has seen the future?■ I can name 13. We are very strong in energy sector, in all three forms – thermal, pump-storage hydroelectricity, which is big these days, and renewable energy. We are doing a lot of good work in solar and wind energy. Electricity from MP is powering the Delhi Metro. We sell power at the cheapest rates — solar at just Rs 2.10 per unit, where the rest of the country is selling it for Rs 4. We are doing a service to the nation. Similarly, mining sector is huge for us. We have diamonds. And now even gold mines. We are a mineral-rich state. Agriculture has tremendous potential, of course. We aim to turn into a powerhouse in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Pharma firms are lining up to come to MP. Our policies for start-ups and semiconductors are proving to be very attractive. Tourism is one of our strengths. We will do even better in this sector. We are the first in the country to launch air ambulance.■ We are giving industries so much benefit here, too. We encourage them to set up captive power plants.■ For that, Congress has to first believe in ‘lok-tantra’ (democracy). Congress believes in ‘parivar-tantra’ (dynastic politics). Four generations ruled after Independence, like Raja-Maharaja. Congress should think about it. BJP believes in a strong democracy. This is why no one from PM Narendra Modi’s family is no CM. No one from my family has ever been an MLA, minister or CM. It’s the same with Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal and Odisha CM Mohan Charan Majhi. There is a long line of such leaders. We are flag-bearers of lok-tantra. Congress is paying a heavy price for it. It cannot shake off ‘parivarwaad’, which is why people are distancing themselves from it.",Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav speaks to TOI's Akhilesh Singh and Prasenjit Mund.

NEW DELHI: Terming the Lokpal's decision to bring high court judges within its jurisdiction to entertain complaints against them as ""very disturbing"" and against the independence of judiciary, Supreme Court Thursday stayed the operation of the order and issued notice to the registrar general of Lokpal and the Centre, seeking their response.A full bench of Lokpal, headed by its chairman and former apex court judge A M Khanwilkar, had passed the order while entertaining a complaint filed against a sitting HC judge. It had ruled that a judge of a high court comes within the sweep of Section 14(1)(f) of the Lokpal Act and that the ombudsman can proceed against a sitting HC judge. The apex court has now initiated suo motu case against the order. A bench of Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant and Abhay S Oka said that something was very disturbing in the order passed by Lokpal and questioned its validity. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that an HC judge was never intended to be brought under the Lokpal.Senior advocate and Supreme Court Bar Association president Kapil Sibal submitted that the Lokpal’s order was fraught with danger and pleaded with the court to stay its operation.The court thereafter passed a brief order issuing notice to the Centre, the complainant, and the registrar general of the Lokpal, seeking their response. It also restrained the complainant from disclosing the name of the HC judge and the contents of the complaint. The court observed that all HC judges are constitutional authorities and cannot be regarded as mere statutory functionaries as held by the Lokpal.The Lokpal had passed the controversial order on Jan 27 on a complaint against a sitting judge of HC.“It will be too naive to argue that a judge of a high court will not come within the ambit of expression ‘any person’ in clause (f) of Section 14(1) of the Act of 2013... it will be useful to advert to the definition of ‘judge’ in Section 19 of IPC as also the enactment of Anti-Corruption Laws (Amendment) Act, 1964 and re-enacted Section 21 with the third category of public servant, including sub-clause (iv) of clause (c) of Section 2 of the Act of 1988 defining expression public servant to mean any judge.“In paragraph 35 of the majority view exposited by Justice Shetty in the case of K Veeraswamy vs UOI, it is plainly expounded that a judge of the superior court cannot therefore be excluded from the definition of public servant and would squarely fall within the purview of Prevention of Corruption Act . Applying the underlying principle and the logic as given in the reported decision, the expression ‘any person’ in Section 14(1)(f) of the Act must include a judge of the high court established by an Act of Parliament as well,” the order had said.","Lokpal brought high court judges within its jurisdiction to entertain complaints against them.

That's the problem,"" a bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyay and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela told Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, representing the Railways.The court was hearing a PIL over the recent stampede at the New Delhi railway station and asked the authorities to file an affidavit giving details of measures taken on these issues. The plea sought the implementation of existing provisions by Railways that may have helped avoid such incidents and cited sections 57 and 147 of the Railway Act that deal with overcrowding.""If you could implement a simple thing, such situations could be avoided... but not fixing the strength to be accommodated in a particular coach, this provision appears to have been neglected all along,"" HC remarked, while referring to Section 57 of the Railways Act, which says every railway administration must fix the maximum number of passengers allowed in each compartment of every carriage type.SG Mehta submitted that the PIL was not taken in an adversarial manner and the Railways is bound to follow the law. He said there was an ""unprecedented"" situation and assured the court that the issues raised in the PIL would be considered at the highest level. ""We are following the law, if there are any lacunae etc that can be taken care of,"" Mehta assured the court.During the hearing, the HC also pointed out that as per rules, the number of passengers that can be carried in each compartment should be ""conspicuously displayed outside each compartment"".

Now, if you see, have I visited any Mashoor (famous) place, Golden Temple or Mahakaal or Vaishno Devi, in the initial stages? No. The first thing I went to was to my unit, Bhakti Dham. And once I got the blessings there from my Maulvi, my Pandit, my Granthi, thereafter I started going to all the places,"" said the Army chief.General Dwivedi recalled how his father would tell him stories of freedom fighters and World War II heroes, inspiring him to join the army.In a candid revelation, Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi shared the story of how his childhood experiences shaped his decision to join the Indian Army.One particular memory that stood out was when his uncle would bring home copies with photographs of soldiers. These images sparked a sense of curiosity and admiration in young Dwivedi. As he grew older, he began to explore various career options, considering medicine and engineering, just like his brothers.However, the allure of the Army ultimately won him over. General Dwivedi recalled how he initially wanted to become an intelligence officer, but after gaining more exposure, he decided to join the Army first and then explore opportunities in intelligence.""I remember my uncle when he used to ask him, So the copy which he used to bring used to have a soldier's photo. Okay. My father used to always give me the story of freedom fighters or the story of World War II, where we won Vera, who escaped as a pilot. I remember. So all these stories I used to keep reading. And my one brother was a doctor. So I said, no, this is closed. My second brother was an engineer. I said, this is closed. Okay. So third was the army, which was there. I wanted to become an intelligence officer if I can say that. But when I went to school and saw everything, then I said, okay, let me join the Army first, thereafter look at intelligence,"" the Army chief said.He also shared his experience of flying the LCA with air marshal AP Singh during Aero India 2025, praising Singh's leadership and straightforward qualities.

He shared that it was simply fate that led him to join the Army.""See, when we were in school, we used to look at all three services. We used to love all three, if I can say that. It just so happened that I came into the army. Let me tell you about AP first. As far as AP is concerned, from NDA days, he is a gold torch. And he is, everybody has a natural liking towards him. He is a man who can collect people together. He is a natural leader. And he takes ownership of a crowd. But he is a very straightforward man. So, I say in the lighter moment, he should have been in the infantry,"" said the Army chief.The Army chief highlighted Air Marshal Singh's ability to bring people together, his natural leadership skills, and his willingness to take ownership of responsibilities. General Dwivedi jokingly added that Air Marshal Singh's straightforward nature and team-bonding skills would have made him an excellent fit for the infantry.""He's so straightforward. And such a team-bonding man, he should have been infantry,"" he added.This lighthearted exchange reflects the camaraderie and mutual respect between General Dwivedi and Air Marshal Singh, underscoring the strong bonds formed during their early days at the NDA.The Army chief’s remarks provide insight into his personal life and military journey, emphasising the significance of respecting all religions and the principles of teamwork and leadership.As the 30th Chief of the Army Staff, he brings extensive experience, having held key positions such as Northern Army Commander and Director General of Infantry.","Indian Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi recently opened up about his multi- religious upbringing and illustrious military career.

The outspoken and charismatic father of basketball stars, recently had his right foot amputated following a serious medical issue. The news, first reported by TMZ Sports on Wednesday, has yet to be publicly addressed by LaVar or his sons. However, despite the health issue, sources confirm that the 57-year-old remains in great spirits. LaVar Ball has long been a popular figure in the sports world who made his name known for his larger-than-life personality and relentless promotion of his sons. He co-founded the Big Baller Brand, which gained attention for launching signature shoes for the Ball brothers and making headlines with its ambitious $3 billion price tag for a deal with major sneaker companies. However, his recent health battle has brought a different kind of attention to the Ball family.According to TMZ Sports, LaVar underwent the amputation procedure on Wednesday afternoon. Though details surrounding the medical issue remain undisclosed, reports indicate that the father of basketball stars and musician Lonzo, LiAngelo, and LaMelo Ball , is handling the situation quite well. A recently surfaced photo of LaVar smiling post-surgery showed his positive attitude as he fought back despite the life-altering event.So far, none of the Ball brothers have publicly addressed their father’s surgery. LaMelo Ball is currently playing for the Charlotte Hornets, while Lonzo Ball , who plays for the Chicago Bulls, has been dealing with his own injury struggles. LiAngelo Ball, though never making an NBA roster, has been pursuing a career in music.Given LaVar’s history of fiercely supporting his sons, fans have no doubt that his family is rallying around him during this time. While he has kept a lower profile in recent years, LaVar remains a strong presence in their lives.Before becoming a household name in the basketball world, LaVar Ball had his own journey as an athlete. He played college basketball at Cal State-Los Angeles and had brief stints with the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers during his attempt at a professional football career.Though he has drawn criticism for his bold proclamations— such as claiming he could beat Michael Jordan one-on-one— LaVar has also been praised for his dedication to his sons’ success. He created the Big Baller Brand, which sought to disrupt the sneaker industry by giving young athletes an alternative to mainstream endorsement deals.Also Read: NBA Drama Unfolds: LiAngelo Ball's Ex-Girlfriend Nikki Mudarris Exchanges Jabs With His New Baby Mama After Cheating Allegation: ""You can keep him"" Fans are waiting for comments from the Ball family detailing LaVar’s health crisis and what led to the amputation of his right foot.

Chicago Bears expected to offer Kansas City Chiefs’ Trey Smith a record $105 million contract,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chicago-bears-expected-to-offer-kansas-city-chiefs-trey-smith-a-record-105-million-contract/articleshow/118424769.cms,"(Image via Imagn Images)

Kansas City Chiefs cannot match the Chicago Bears’ offer, and Trey Smith is set to hit the open market

The Athletic’s

“The Chiefs are not expected to place the franchise tag or the transition tag on Smith, according to a league source.”

Trey Smith and Darnell Wright played together at Tennessee, and the Bears could reunite them in 2025

Bleacher Report

“If Smith does end up in the Windy City, he’ll be reunited with stalwart right tackle Darnell Wright. Smith played next to Wright for two years at Tennessee, and the two could jump-start a flailing Bears offensive line together in 2025.”

If the Chicago Bears sign Trey Smith, the offensive guard market will shift dramatically

“Smith is a powerful mover in the run game, as his run block win rate of 75.1% ranked sixth among guards. Plus, he has the foot speed to mirror interior defenders and the strength at 6-6 and 321 pounds to anchor against bull rushes. Bears general manager Ryan Poles could make a splash move to rebuild the front for Ben Johnson’s new offense.”

The Chicago Bears cannot afford another disaster on the offensive line. Sixty-eight sacks last season. Dead last in the NFL. Caleb Williams barely had a chance to breathe. If they want their No. 1 overall pick to succeed, fixing this line isn’t optional—it’s survival.Enter Kansas City Chiefs guard Trey Smith . At 25, he’s already one of the best guards in the league. He’s played over 1,200 snaps every season since being drafted in 2021. He doesn’t miss games. He doesn’t miss assignments. He doesn’t get bullied.The Bears reportedly plan to offer Smith a five-year, $105 million deal. That would make him one of the highest-paid guards in history. It’s a massive commitment, but if they don’t do it, someone else will.Kansas City wants to keep Trey Smith. But wanting and affording are two very different things. The Chiefs are sitting on just $3.2 million in cap space, while the Bears have $63 million to spend.According toNate Taylor, the Chiefs are unlikely to use the franchise tag on Smith.If Kansas City can’t work out a long-term deal before free agency, Smith is gone.And Chicago is ready to pounce.Trey Smith knows Darnell Wright. They played side by side at Tennessee for two years. That chemistry matters.Rebuilding an offensive line isn’t just about talent—it’s about trust. Smith and Wright have already been through it together. Putting them on the right side of the Bears’ line would give Williams something he didn’t have last year: protection.Alex Kay ofpointed out the potential impact of this pairing:The Bears aren’t just throwing money at a problem. They’re building a foundation.The Bears’ reported $105 million offer would be the new gold standard for guards. Right now, Atlanta Falcons’ Chris Lindstrom holds the record with a $102.5 million contract. Philadelphia Eagles’ Landon Dickerson sits at $84 million, with $21 million per year. If Chicago closes this deal, Smith becomes the highest-paid guard in NFL history.ESPN’s Matt Bowen ranked Smith as the No. 2 free agent in 2025, behind only Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins.This isn’t just about Chicago. Once Smith signs, every team with a high-end guard will have to reconsider their price tags.","Trey Smith could be one of the highest-paid guards in NFL history.

WFI-SAI tiff leaves wrestlers in a limbo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/wrestling/wfi-sai-tiff-leaves-wrestlers-in-a-limbo/articleshow/118436690.cms,"Wrestlers worried about missing Asian, World meets

NEW DELHI: At the beginning of the new year, Indian wrestlers had hoped that their absence from international competitions, owing to the discord between the sports ministry and Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), would cease.Throughout 2024, the wrestlers were forced to remain idle due to the ministry's suspension of the federation and the subsequent rejection of competition proposals by the Sports Authority of India (SAI). Had it not been for the sit-in protest initiated by some of the aggrieved wrestlers at sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya 's official residence here in Oct last year, the grapplers' participation for the World Championships in Albania's Tirana wouldn't have been sanctioned.However, the situation hasn't changed one bit for the wrestlers, who have been punished by the sports administrators for no fault of theirs.Having already missed out on two crucial ranking series - Zagreb (Feb 5-9) and Tirana (Feb 26 to March 2) - due to the SAI's refusal to clear proposals owing to the WFI's continued suspension, the wrestlers are now unsure about their participation in the Asian Championships, scheduled in Jordan's Amman from March 25-30.The participation of Indian wrestlers in the forthcoming continental tournament has been made mandatory by the sport's world governing body United World Wrestling (UWW). Every Asian member nation of the UWW is required to compete in the meet, failing which it will attract sanctions and a probable ban from UWW.A no-show would also mean that the country's wrestlers will be barred from competing at the World Championships, scheduled later this year in Zagreb from Sep 13-21. UWW's rules are clear: non-participation in Asian meet means no entry for the Worlds. If that happens, it will come as a substantial blow for wrestlers. It would seriously jeopardise their preparations for the Asian Games in Japan next year.The wrestlers are already experiencing the repercussions owing to their no-show in the first two ranking series of the new season. In a wrestling calendar, there are four ranking series events and each of them carries crucial ranking points for seedings at the Worlds.For the Asian meet, WFI has decided to hold the selection trials - a first such exercise for a major event since the federation's suspension by the ministry in Dec 2023.""WFI will first organise the Federation Cup in Phagwara from March 8 to 9. The circular for the event is already out. Soon after, a selection trial will be held to pick the team for the Asian event. The federation will send the names of selected wrestlers, who will form part of the Indian contingent, to SAI for clearance. WFI will inform SAI that it's a crucial tournament for our wrestlers. Everything will then rest in the hands of SAI. If it doesn't clear the team, it will be a huge setback for our wrestlers,"" said a WFI official.","Wrestlers worried about missing Asian, World meets this year.

I haven't yet read the 40-and-odd-page judgment but we will certainly file an appeal before a superior court.""The state's case, as put up by assistant public prosecutor Poonam Ghodke, was that between Aug 9, 1989 and Nov 29,1994, the Kokate brothers and the two others had committed mischief and fraud with govt by showing lower income than the prescribed limit (below 30,000/- p.a.) to secure the flats at Nirman View Apartment, College Road in Nashik. They executed the documents, i.e. affidavits and income certificates by mentioning false contents of their income and induced the government for allotment of flats under the 10% reserved quota of the government which was for needy and economically weak people.On Oct 13, 1995, then deputy collector (ULC) Vishwanath Bhaskar Patil lodged a complaint with the Sarkarwada police in Nashik against Manikrao, his brother and the two others. After investigation, the police filed a chargesheet on March 25, 1997. The trial against the four accused started on April 3, 2001.Additional CJM Narwadiya, while referring to the deposition by nine prosecution witnesses and the defence arguments during the trial and the evidence on record, observed in her ruling, ""The prosecution has proved beyond all reasonable doubt that the accused no. 1 (Manikrao) and 2 (Vijay) were not economically weak at the time of applying for allotment of flats in the 10% reserved quota of the govt.""The court considered the deposition by police patil Vitthal Khandekar that Shivaji Kokate, father of Manikrao, has 25 acre of land with income of more than Rs1 lakh per annum. Manikrao in 1996 was chairman of Sinnar Panchayat Samiti, Vijay Kokate was a contractor and both brothers were members of Kopargaon Cooperative Sugar factory where they supplied sugar cane.The court also noted that as per the deputy collector, Manikrao Kokate had sought permission for a revolver in the past claiming that he had 40-50 labourers who he paid around Rs 9000 as overall payment per week based on a statement recorded on Jan 10, 1994.""It may be safely presumed that a person having 40-50 labourers is not a person who can be considered economically weaker. The prosecution is at fault as it did not show this evidence to the Investigating Officer, but the accused must not be benefitted from such fault of prosecution,"" the court noted.""The prosecution by examining the witnesses so also on the basis of documentary evidence successfully proved beyond all reasonable doubt that the accused no. 1 & 2 deceit the government by showing their income less than Rs. 30,000/- to avail of the benefit of 10% reserved quota for the residential flats, which were for the economically weak persons,"" the court said.The court also noted, ""The accused no.1 at the time of alleged incident was having post in political party so also, he is an advocate and now he is a Minister in Agriculture department, therefore such approach of accused no.1 for getting the flats in low rate by concealing the information regarding his income is highly dreadful.""","NCP's state agriculture minister Manikrao Kokate and his brother, Vijay, sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment for fudging documents to show less income. The court acquitted two other people tried in the same case, observing that there was no sufficient evidence to show that they had deceived govt by showing lesser incomes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118436623,imgsize-96174,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118436623.jpg"

Ahead of the Global Investors’ Summit in Bhopal,

Madhya Pradesh

chief minister

Mohan Yadav

outlines his govt’s plans to double the state’s economy in five years, turn it into the country’s most promising investment destination, stop braindrain, and inspire youngsters to be part of its growth story. MP’s time has come, he says in an exclusive interview to TOI

■ PM Narendra Modi has spoken of turning India into a $5 trillion economy. What would be MP’s contribution to it?

■ Where do you see MP tomorrow in terms of industry?

■ Investment promises are part of every such summit. How will you ensure that plans turn into reality?

■ What are your plans to decentralise development and take it to small towns and villages?

■What inspired you to personally tour cities and hardsell Madhya Pradesh as an investment destination?

Madhya Pradesh won seven Krishi Karman Awards. Do you see the state winning industry accolades too?

■ How will you convince industrialists about MP’s ease of doing business?

■ MP has had political stability for a long time, and this is a major area of operation for BJP and RSS. Do you see this as an opportunity or a challenge?

■ ‘Double-engine govt’ is a much talked about phrase. How has it benefited Madhya Pradesh?

■ What is the status of MP’s river-linking projects?

■ Your govt has banned liquor at 19 religious sites and you said this was the first step. Is your govt working towards prohibition, and if so, is there a timeline?

■ Will you move in the same direction?

■ If you had to pick the top three industrial sectors as ones with the biggest potential for MP’s growth, which would they be?

■ Would you be willing to reduce power tariffs for industries?

■

was once strong here, but has been weakened drastically. Don’t you think a weak opposition is not healthy for a democracy?

We are working on PM Modi’s vision and aligning our work in the same direction. We aim to double our economy in 5 years. MP’s success will be counted in India’s growth story. PM Modi has said that India will be the third largest economy in the world. That can be possible only when every state contributes to achieving the vision. Our aim is to exceed expectations. We will keep striving towards this.We want to make MP the No. 1 state in the country. Our state has the potential and it has everything going for it. All that we need to do is to make the most of opportunities in the best interests of the state and our people. It’s not a one-day job. We have to persist with long-term vision and long-term goals. By tapping MP’s potential and bringing more investment, we want to stop the brain drain from the state. Bright youngsters from MP are leaving the state to work in other cities or abroad. We will ensure that they get enough opportunities here so that they can contribute to their home state’s growth.Earlier, things were limited to speeches and talk. We decided to work. We created new policies, tailormade for specific sectors, and threw open the state to investors. They will come only when they see the state has the wherewithal and the determination to keep its word. We know that it won’t work if we do this once and sit back. We have been at it. We held regional conclaves. I went out and held business meetings in India and abroad. When you do it every month, it becomes a part of work culture and becomes part of a system. It picks up momentum. Since we are present at so many platforms, we keep meeting industrialists. If someone promises an investment, they will keep running into us somewhere or the other and the project will, of course, come alive.Every region of Madhya Pradesh must grow and develop, which is why our plans encompass the entire state. Every district is unique, it has its own set of potentials and possibilities. The districts that are rich in minerals, can excel in mining. Where agriculture is bountiful, there can be farmbased growth. Spiritual sites have their inherent, almost autonomous economy of religious tourism. This, too, will grow in a big way. MP has tremendous potential in forests and wildlife tourism. We will augment infrastructure to make it even bigger. After all, we have cheetahs and the brand of ‘Tiger State’. Where roads and railway tracks are needed, we are taking care of it. We look at the needs of today and tomorrow, and are flexible in our approach. For instance, BRTS was adversely affecting Bhopal traffic, so we had it removed. What was yesterday’s need is past. We are planning for the future. And we are taking decisions swiftly. There is a big advantage in that.I learnt from PM Modi that when you sit in a position of responsibility, if you don’t project your vision and immerse yourself entirely in the effort to achieve it, you will not succeed. When I was chairman of tourism corporation, I followed this rule for myself. Until the seed ends its own existence, no new plant can grow. If one has a vision, one has to also lead the way. My presence makes a difference at such meets. I believe it imbibes faith and trust in the minds of investors. Besides, God’s blessings also come my way for the hard work.■ We are already winning awards.We have got a wards in mining, tourism and education.We are one of the fastest growing economies in the country. Our GDP in the 2023 24 fiscal grew by nearly 9.4%. We have even been awarded for good governance. Our revenue reforms have been well appreciated. We are No. 1 in agriculture, and we will soon be known as an industry powerhouse.We have simplified the application and approval process. What took 28 permissions earlier, now requires only 10. Our intention is that when an investor thinks of coming to MP, they will have already made up their minds because of the environment they will get here. When an investor comes to us with a proposal, our aim is to give him all the clearances in 28 days, maximum. Earlier, it used to stretch on for six months to even a year. They would grow frustrated from the uncertainty. We have made things simpler.We gain a lot from the strength of our organisation. We work like a family. Our work happens not because of someone’s post or designation but from a meeting of minds. It’s an administrative necessity that I am chief minister, otherwise there are so many veteran leaders, more senior to me, who we respect and work with perfect understanding.Oh, we benefit greatly from it. We don’t have to even think twice on so many issues. Take GST. We get around Rs 1.25 lakh crore from the Centre on this account. If it wasn’t PM Modi’s sarkar, we couldn’t even think of so much funds, that too on time. In Ken-Betwa river-linking project — the first of its kind in the world — or the project to link Parbati, Kalisindh and Chambal (PKC) rivers, we are getting Rs 75,000 crore. We only have to pitch in with 10% of the project cost, 90% comes from the Centre. This is the power of ‘double engine’.Projects dragged on for 20 years but now Bhoomi-pujan has been performed and tenders have been issued. There’s a new culture that has developed under PM Modi. States used to fight with each other earlier whereas there should be solidarity. After all, we are part of the same country. Now we are working closely with Uttar Pradesh not only on this but also sharing solar energy. In PKC river-linking, 13 districts each in Rajasthan and MP will benefit. Our relations with Rajasthan are great. We have another major project on Tapti river with Maharashtra. The aim should be to find common ground and a way to work in tandem for the betterment of people. All this is possible because of double-engine sarkar.At many places in MP, we had haphazard liquor bans. I said liquor should be banned completely in religious places. No half measures. Like Ujjain , liquor was prohibited in only 1km periphery. I extended it to the entire corporation area. So too with Omkareshwar, Datia, Orchha, Panna… If it’s a panchayat, nagar parishad or municipality, the entire area will be freed of liquor.Who has seen the future?I can name 13. We are very strong in energy sector, in all three forms – thermal, pump-storage hydroelectricity, which is big these days, and renewable energy. We are doing a lot of good work in solar and wind energy. Electricity from MP is powering the Delhi Metro. We sell power at the cheapest rates — solar at just Rs 2.10 per unit, where the rest of the country is selling it for Rs 4. We are doing a service to the nation. Similarly, mining sector is huge for us. We have diamonds. And now even gold mines. We are a mineral-rich state. Agriculture has tremendous potential, of course. We aim to turn into a powerhouse in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Pharma firms are lining up to come to MP. Our policies for start-ups and semiconductors are proving to be very attractive. Tourism is one of our strengths. We will do even better in this sector. We are the first in the country to launch air ambulance.We are giving industries so much benefit here, too. We encourage them to set up captive power plants.For that, Congress has to first believe in ‘lok-tantra’ (democracy). Congress believes in ‘parivar-tantra’ (dynastic politics). Four generations ruled after Independence, like Raja-Maharaja. Congress should think about it. BJP believes in a strong democracy. This is why no one from PM Narendra Modi’s family is no CM. No one from my family has ever been an MLA, minister or CM. It’s the same with Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal and Odisha CM Mohan Charan Majhi. There is a long line of such leaders. We are flag-bearers of lok-tantra. Congress is paying a heavy price for it. It cannot shake off ‘parivarwaad’, which is why people are distancing themselves from it.","Madhya Pradesh CM Mohan Yadav plans to double the state's economy within five years.

As part of this initiative, he mentioned that a specialized committee, led by senior IAS officer Anjum Parvez, has been formed to conduct a detailed examination of the OPS implementation process.""Our government will take necessary steps to implement it after studying the report. Our party had given an assurance on implementation of OPS in our manifesto and we are committed to it. We will do it but it requires time and patience,"" he said.The minister commended the government employees' association for their productive efforts, highlighting that civil servants are instrumental in driving the administration forward.""Government work is a huge responsibility and you should manage it well. Government employees are like the priests in temples. People need priests to interact with God. I have also been working like a government employee for 38 years,"" he said.Emphasising the government's commitment to public welfare, Shivakumar highlighted that citizens from diverse backgrounds have shown trust in their administration.""People's representatives and government employees are one.

He was responding to a question regarding the Lokayukta's submission of a clean chit to CM Siddaramaiah in the MUDA case.Shivakumar further said, ""It is natural to seek compensation when land is lost. They didn’t demand sites in any specific area, and they returned the sites to avoid further controversy. The Lokayukta has done its job.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.
