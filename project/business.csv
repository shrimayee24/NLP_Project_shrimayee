Lalit shares Vanuatu broadcaster statement saying citizenship call only after court order

LONDON: Lalit Modi , who is wanted for criminal offences in India, has challenged Vanuatu govt's decision to revoke the passport it had granted him and will argue his case in a court in the south-western Pacific island in person.UK sources close to Modi told TOI on Tuesday that he has filed a case in the Vanuatu court appealing the decision of PM Jotham Napat to cancel his citizenship. Modi, an Indian national, is currently in Vanuatu fighting the case, from where he has been tweeting photos of its beaches and praising it as a “heavenly country”.TOI has learnt that there is no extradition request for Modi as of now. “He went to the high commission of India in London to surrender his Indian passport in order to take up Vanuatu citizenship but they refused to give him a surrender certificate. They said it was because of due diligence and checks had to be made,” a source said.The Vanuatu PM’s office issued a statement on Monday saying Napat had instructed Citizenship Commission to “begin proceedings” to cancel Lalit Modi’s Vanuatu passport. The commission is a constitutional body responsible for reviewing, approving, deferring or rejecting citizenship applications. It also has the power to revoke citizenship if granted in violation of Citizenship Act, or other relevant laws.Lalit shared a statement on his X handle, written by Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation on Facebook in Bislama. The English translation read, “The chairman of Vanuatu Citizenship Commission said his office will wait for outcome of court before making a decision on Lalit Modi’s citizenship as a NiVanuatu. Chairman of citizenship commission Charles Maniel made this statement following an order issued by PM Jotham Napat to Citizenship Commission to start the process of cancelling Lalit’s Vanuatu passport due to some allegations that he is facing in court. Chairman Maniel said if the court finds him guilty, the commission will start the process of cancelling his passport and citizenship as a Ni-Vanuatu. Lalit, who is originally from India, bought his Ni-Vanuatu citizenship through citizenship programme of Vanuatu govt.”","Lalit Modi, an Indian national, is currently in Vanuatu fighting the case.

Little known byrnihat

NEW DELHI: India was the fifth most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with Byrnihat in Meghalaya being the most polluted metropolitan area globally last year, according to IQAir’s 2024 World Air Quality Report released Tuesday.Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) which was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards. High air pollution level in the little-known Meghalayan city can be attributed to rapid industrialisation, unregulated emission, construction and deforestation.Though India improved its overall ranking from third most-polluted in 2023 to fifth last year, it had the dubious record of having six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities and 13 of the 20 most polluted cities globally, with Delhi being the most polluted capital in the world in 2024.The report that analysed a critical pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) data from over 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, finds Chad — a central African country — as the most polluted country last year, followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Congo and India by exceeding the WHO standards of acceptable limit of that pollutant multiple times.Only seven countries — Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — met WHO annual average PM2.5 guideline level of 5 µg/m3.As far as India is concerned, the report finds that the country with the annual average PM2.5 concentration of 50.6 µg/m3 in 2024 reported more than 10 times higher than the WHO PM2.5 annual guideline and over 26% higher than the acceptable limit of the hazardous pollutant as per Indian national ambient air quality standards.The report shows that India saw a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentrations in 2024, averaging 50.6 µg/m3 compared to 54.4 µg/m3 in 2023, but the capital, New Delhi, maintained consistently high pollution levels, with annual average of 91.6 µg/m3, nearly unchanged from 92.7 µg/m3 in 2023.“Overall, 35% of Indian cities reported annual PM2.5 averages exceeding 10 times WHO guideline,” it says. In 2024, air quality data was reported from 371 cities across 11 countries, with India being the most monitored, hosting more than half of central and south Asia region’s stations. The region was home to the top nine most-polluted cities in the world with six of them in India last year.Citing Air Quality Life Index released by University of Chicago in 2023, IQAir’s report noted that air pollution remains a significant health burden in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years.PM2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, is considered the most hazardous air pollutant. It can be deposited in lungs, causing respiratory problems and other health issues.","Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) It was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards.

MUMBAI: Mahayuti government’s populist pre-poll sops last July had left the state saddled with a massive debt. On Monday, it tabled its first Budget after its landslide win in the assembly polls. It reveals that the state faces the highest debt projection in its history at Rs 9.3 lakh crore and the steepest revenue deficit (gap between income and expenditure) at an estimated Rs 45,891 crores for 25-26.With little financial elbow room, the Budget does not offer new big-ticket schemes. Promises in Mahayuti poll manifesto, including a hike in stipend of its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,100 per month and a farm loan waiver, have been kept aside for another day. Instead, the Budget has focused on keeping existing schemes going and in trying to keep its debt and fiscal deficit within prescribed limits.Indeed, the estimated outlay for the Ladki Bahin scheme, whose beneficiaries are being scrutinised and trimmed, is Rs 10,000 crore lower than last year. The estimated allocation is Rs 36,000 crore for Rs 2025-26.With local body polls looming, the Budget has hiked the district annual plan by 11% from Rs 18,165 crore to an estimated Rs 20,165 crore. In a gesture towards social justice, it has hiked the proposed scheduled caste component of the annual plan by 42% and the tribal component by an estimated 40%. It proposes new taxes, mainly related to motor vehicles, which are expected to generate revenue of Rs 1,125 crore. It has also hiked stamp duty on certain transactions.The financial strain is apparent in the figures. The debt projection is Rs 2 lakh crore, higher than it was in 2024-25 when the figure was Rs 7.1 lakh crore. It is almost thrice as high as it was a decade ago. Its revenue deficit – the gap between the state’s income and expenditure — is more than twice the estimate last year, which was Rs 20,051 crore.However, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who controls the finance portfolio, emphasised that the debt and fiscal deficit were within fiscal limits.The state’s fiscal deficit is estimated at 2.76% of its GSDP. Also, the estimated debt is 18.7% of GSDP while the prescribed limit is 25%.The infrastructure projects are mainly ongoing projects for which no fresh outlay has been mentioned.","Mahayuti government’s populist pre-poll sops last July had left the state saddled with a massive debt.

Going off-patent

10.1cr Indians live with diabetes, most end up paying out of pocket

NEW DELHI: Several domestic drug companies are set to transform diabetes therapy by launching the blockbuster drug Empagliflozin at a fraction of the innovator’s price.Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin on March 11, industry sources told TOI.The launch of generic Empagliflozin , used to treat diabetes, related comorbidities, including heart failure, promises to slash therapy costs, making it more accessible to millions of diabetics and easing the financial strain of this debilitating disease. Those looking to launch the drug include Mankind Pharma , Torrent, Alkem, Dr Reddy’s and Lupin.Mankind Pharma, India’s fourth-largest firm by market share, plans to offer Empagliflozin at one-tenth the innovator’s Rs 60 per tablet, sources said.Most generic versions will cost Rs 9-14 per tablet, disrupting the high-growth diabetes therapy market valued at nearly Rs 20,000 crore, up 43% from Rs 14,000 crore in 2021.The market was further bolstered by Torrent Pharmaceuticals’ acquisition of three Empagliflozin brands from Boehringer Ingelheim last year. With India facing a staggering public health burden—10.1 crore people live with diabetes, according to International Diabetes Federation— this shift is critical.“This aligns with our philosophy of breaking cost barriers with a high-quality product (raw materials certified by regulators like the USFDA) at an affordable price. Using our own active pharmaceutical ingredient in bulk lowers costs, and we will deploy separate teams to promote two distinct brands, boosting distribution and market share,” said a Mankind Pharma executive.The market size of Empagliflozin and its combinations is estimated at Rs 640 crore. Experts highlight its ability to significantly reduce heart failure hospitalisations, slow chronic kidney disease progression and improve survival in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, though high pricing has long limited access.Metformin remains the first-line treatment for type-2 diabetes, but as the disease progresses, additional medications—such as Sulfonylureas (glimepiride, glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide), DPP-4 Inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin), and SGLT2 Inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin)—are added. Now, newer therapies like semaglutide and tirzepatide enhance management, offering improved glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits.The economic burden of diabetes weighs heavily in India, where most patients pay out-of-pocket due to limited medical reimbursement. Treatment costs escalate with complications, magnifying the challenge.","Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin.

The event, deeply rooted in Bhojpuri heritage, was performed as a tribute to the deep historical and cultural ties between India and Mauritius.Geet Gawai, which was recognised by UNESCO as part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2016, is a Bhojpuri musical tradition that blends songs, prayers, and dance.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin Tuesday described the National Education Policy (NEP) a “destructive plan of Nagpur” (referring to the RSS headquarters) and said DMK will never accept it.“Instead of bringing students into education, the NEP’s action plan is to push students out of it.

NEW DELHI: Sharing that an investment of Rs 2.5 lakh crore will be coming to the NorthEast, home minister Amit Shah Tuesday said no youth from the region would have to migrate to another part of the country for work in next 10 years as they will find employment there itself.Recalling the slew of initiatives made in 10 years of Modi govt to restore peace, lay the foundation of development and increase connectivity in the NorthEast, Shah, in his address at NorthEast Students and Youth Parliament organised by Student Experience in Inter-State Living (SEIL), said budget for NorthEast had been raised by 153% in 2024-25 as compared to 2014-15.Shah elaborated Rs 90,000 crore was spent specifically on roads in the NorthEast, 64 new air routes started and Rs 18,000 crore allocated for railway connectivity in the region. “By 2027, the capitals of all states in the NorthEast will be connected by train, air, and road,” he added.While praising the NorthEast for having youth with highest IQ in India, along with diversity — 220 tribal groups, 160 tribes and rich culture and traditions — the home minister lamented how the region had fallen behind in development under past govts on account of sustained insurgency, violence and blockades. He said the NorthEast had to face a 40-year delay in development, with terrorism and separatism being the primary obstacles.Shah credited BJP govt for always prioritising the NorthEast through initiatives like creating a dedicated ministry for the region under Vajpayee govt, talking and working with insurgent groups to bring them into mainstream and end conflict, and pushing development initiatives in the region. Shah said violent incidents in the NorthEast had declined by 70% between 2014 and 2024 and civilian deaths by 89%. As many as 10,500 insurgents had surrendered with their weapons in the past decade, he added.",Home minister Amit Shah said no youth from the region would have to migrate to another part of the country for work in next 10 years.

India, US will negotiate ‘mutually beneficial’ trade agreement

NEW DELHI: The debate on the Manipur budget and the Centre’s supplementary demand for grants turned into an extension of the language controversy in Tamil Nadu with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday accusing DMK of hypocrisy.“I do not want to name him, but the moment I read the passages, anyone with a small, faint familiarity with Tamil will know who I'm speaking about. So, when this person speaks about Tamil, much horribly, there’s no objection. On the contrary, they would keep his photo. They will also say he is our Dravidian icon,” she said while quoting the “elderly person” from various Tamil magazines in what was seen as a reference to Periyar, the leader of the Dravidian movement.Coming to the defence of her colleague, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Sitharaman said he was made to withdraw his remarks just for saying that the protest by DMK members was uncivil. “But a man who repeatedly says Tamil is a barbaric language, they keep his photograph in every room, they garland him and worship him and say he is the icon of Dravidian movement. Look at their hypocrisy,” she said.She also listed out a series of projects where the Centre was assisting Tamil Nadu.Earlier, replying to the debate on Manipur budget, Sitharaman said all financial support would be provided to the state for economic development as she stressed the overall law and order situation had improved, except for some sporadic incidents.Lok Sabha passed supplementary demands for grants, which entails Rs 51,463 crore additional spending in the current fiscal and the Manipur budget for the 2025-26 fiscal. The lower House also passed, by voice vote, the Rs 1,291 crore demands for excess grants for 2021-22 fiscal and the Rs 1,861 crore supplementary demands for grants for Manipur in 2024-25.“With the collective effort of both the Centre and state govts, there has been an improvement in overall law and order situation in the state, to a large extent, except for some sporadic (incidents),” Sitharaman said.She also assured that all financial support will be provided to Manipur for faster economic development.The FM also took a swipe at TMC’s Kriti Azad, who had been critical of the Modi govt that it had lied in the past 11 years and didn’t fulfil promises it made while he accused the Centre of not releasing funds allocated to states including West Bengal.“I will appreciate Kriti Azad if he speaks about corruption in West Bengal one day. The CAG report has cited corruption of over Rs 2 lakh crore in West Bengal. Even the state CM had acknowledged corruption in the state as she had asked her party colleagues to return the ‘cut money’,” she said amid protests by the TMC MPs.While asserting that India’s tariffs were way below the commitment at WTO, govt on Tuesday told Parliament that New Delhi and Washington intend to negotiate a “mutually beneficial” trade agreement that will seek to lower import duty, address non-tariff barriers, and look at ways to enhance supply chain integration.Commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal , who returned from the US, is due to meet exporters on Thursday as they seek clarity on where the negotiations are headed so that they can prepare to navigate through the latest turbulence in global trade amid repeated attacks by US President Donald Trump on India’s “high tariffs‘. On Tuesday, Goyal’s deputy Jitin Prasada also made it clear that currently, the US has not imposed any reciprocal tariff on India.“The US has issued a memorandum on reciprocal trade and tariffs on Feb 13, 2025, wherein the secretary of commerce and US trade representative are to take necessary actions to investigate harm to US and provide a report with detailed proposed remedies , based on which, US action against relevant trading partner could, thereafter be undertaken under any of the relevant US legislations,” he said.",The debate on the Manipur budget and the Centre’s supplementary demand for grants turned into an extension of the language controversy in Tamil Nadu.

"Air India reputation down the drain? Aging aircraft, old ducts, scaling in pipes and passenger behaviour lead to stink",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aging-aircraft-old-ducts-scaling-in-pipes-and-passenger-behaviour-lead-to-stink/articleshow/118906475.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Clogged toilets are not new to Air India flights, but the legacy of the old govt-run airline has been flushed across to the new Tata Group-owned company, right in the middle of its modernisation and expansion spree.For years, cleanup crew of Air India’s long-haul flights has found in holding tanks of blocked lavatories everything from socks to hand towels, plastic bags, underwear and even small pillows given on board.Just as the Chicago-Delhi flight was forced to return to O’Hare International Airport last Wednesday when eight of its 10 lavatories were clogged, over the years, several of the airline’s Europe and US flights have been forced to divert or return after flying for hours with hundreds of bursting bowels and bladders for similar reasons.The dumping has gone on regardless of clear signage asking flyers not to throw anything in the commode as that could “clog the toilet and cause inconvenience to you and your fellow passengers”.As Air India’s legacy Boeing 777s, used for North America nonstops, age, the problem is worsening as the old ducts find it increasingly difficult to suck in whatever indiscreet passengers flush away. “These aircraft are very old. The lavatory ducts or suction pipes have got scaling due to which their available width has reduced. External particles like shawls, sheets or towels easily and immediately clog them up,” said an engineer who has spent decades maintaining aircraft. Aircraft toilets use a vacuum system to remove waste into a storage tank.According to Air India’s former executive director Jitender Bhargava, the airline got 21 of its 23 B777s between 2007 and 2010. The other two were inducted much later and are now used as dedicated long-haul VVIP planes operated by the Indian Air Force. The B787 Dreamliners, used on the Europe, Far East and Australia routes, came in a few years later, starting 2010, and are also getting old now.The problem of clogged toilets has shown up on both these long-haul planes in the airline’s fleet. Due to night curfew in Europe, Air India’s affected B777s have in the past returned to either India or North America after flying hours. An engineer explained, “A B777 has two waste tanks. If a duct leading from a lavatory gets clogged, it will affect only that particular lavatory. But if the duct close to the waste tank inlet gets clogged, it will affect all lavatories connected to it.”On AI 126 being forced to return to Chicago on March 5, Air India said in a statement on Monday, “Our teams found polythene bags, rags and clothes that had been flushed down and stuck in the plumbing. This led the lavatories to become unserviceable. While not found on AI 126 of March 5, 2025, our teams have previously also found objects such as blankets, innerwear, and diapers, among other waste, having been flushed down the toilets on other flights. We take this opportunity to urge passengers to use lavatories only for the purposes that they are meant for.”Is this problem faced by airlines of other countries as well? TOI spoke to officials of multiple leading foreign airlines, who said they have only experienced this problem sporadically. This suggests passengers behave differently in an Indian carrier than when they are aboard a foreign airline.“This is a very, very rare occurrence that can happen anywhere. Sometimes, a couple of lavatories may become unserviceable. If detected before taking off from a place that is not our engineering base, we resort to denied boarding and proportionately reduce the number of passengers on that aircraft,” said an official with a foreign airline.Apart from educating passengers, aircraft maintenance engineers have a word of advice for Air India. “Small bottles are kept in lavatories by AI and almost all other global airlines operating medium to ultra-long hauls. However given the peculiar situation of AI, it will be better to have bigger fixed dispensers that can be refilled by crew as a lot of small bottles end up getting flushed. Ditto for dental hygiene kits but those have to be given,” said an engineer.Crew members say passengers ignore the waste bins, which are right there, below or beside the wash basin, and flush everything down the toilet instead. Toilets in the economy section are more prone to clogging simply because the passenger load is higher. “Given the impact on reputation for Air India, the management must take a call on whether pre-flight instructions by crew should also include what not to flush in the lavs,” said a crew member.","The Chicago-Delhi flight was forced to return to O’Hare International Airport last Wednesday when eight of its 10 lavatories were clogged.

NEW DELHI: For India, Mauritius is not just a partner country but family, connecting India to the wider Global South , PM Narendra Modi said on Tuesday as he invoked Ram, Ramayan and Ganga Maiya to emphasise the bond between the two countries.Speaking at a public reception, Modi recalled the struggle of indentured labourers who were duped by British colonisers to leave their homes in Bihar and travel to Mauritius. He emphasised that 200 years ago, Indian labourers — deceptively brought as ‘Girmitiyas’ to toil on plantations — found strength in Lord Ram and the Ramcharitmanas despite immense hardship.He recalled his 1998 visit for the International Ramayan Conference while underlining that Mauritius had declared a half-day holiday to mark the consecration of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.Welcoming Modi at the event, Mauritius PM Navin Ramgoolam announced that the country will confer its highest civilian award ‘Grand Commander of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean (GCSK)’ on Modi during National Day celebrations on Wednesday. The two representatives will also hold delegation-level talks that will be followed by the signing of several agreements.Modi thanked Ramgoolam, who received the Indian PM at the airport, for his warmth and friendship and for his contribution to strengthening the vibrant and special ties between the two countries, Indian govt said. In a special gesture, Modi handed over OCI cards to Ramgoolam and his spouse Veena Ramgoolam.Highlighting the shared heritage and familial connections that form the bedrock of the close people-to-people ties between the two countries, Modi appreciated how the Indian origin community in Mauritius had preserved and nurtured their cultural roots. “To further strengthen these bonds, a special carve out for Mauritius has been made whereby OCI cards can be made available to the seventh generation of people of Indian origin in Mauritius. The PM underscored that India would be supporting several initiatives to nurture the Girmitiya legacy ,” govt said.Modi also noted that India was privileged to be a close development partner of Mauritius. He further said India-Mauritius special ties played a key role in India’s ‘Sagar’ Vision and its engagement with the Global South. “Speaking about tackling the shared challenge of climate change, he appreciated Mauritius’s partnership in the International Solar Alliance and the Global Biofuels Alliance initiatives,” the govt said.With many in the audience tracing their ancestry to Bihar and UP, Modi, an MP from Varanasi, promised efforts to restore Bihar’s glory and predicted that Bihar’s Makhana would become a global snack staple. He described Mauritius as a “Mini India” and a vital bridge to the Global South. He also announced plans for a global Girmitiya database, a university-led study of their legacy, and a potential world Girmitiya conference to trace their journeys and settlements.",Mauritius PM Navin Ramgoolam announced that the country will confer its highest civilian award ‘Grand Commander of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean (GCSK) on Modi on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Armed with a Tamil Nadu govt letter to Union education secretary giving the state’s consent to sign an MoU for establishment of PM-SHRI schools, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan Tuesday doubled down on his charge that the three-language controversy had been staged by TN govt to earn “brownie points and to revive DMK’s political fortunes”.In RS, Pradhan accused DMK of “creating a fear psychosis” and playing with the future of TN’s youth when multilingualism was the order of the day both nationally and globally. Replying to a discussion on the ministry’s working, a day after being forced to withdraw certain remarks in LS, Pradhan said DMK could abuse him by calling him a “fool” but it could not “fool” the people of TN all the time and “deny” them opportunities to fulfil their “aspirations”. Later, he slammed the DMK govt on social media too.Pradhan said that contrary to all the noise, enrolment in Tamil-medium schools was on a continuous decline and that Indian languages were perceived as symbols of backwardness. With this, the govt is expected to stick to its position on implementing NEP-2020 in the state.The letter dated March 15, 2024, which TOI confirmed and accessed from sources in the education ministry, said, “… the state of Tamil Nadu is very keen to sign the MoU for establishing PM-SHRI schools in the state. In this regard, a state-level committee headed by the school education secretary has been constituted. Based on the recommendations of the committee, the MoU for establishing PM-SHRI schools will be signed by the state before the beginning of the next academic year, 2024-25.” It concluded with: “It is requested to kindly release the 3rd and the 4th instalments for the financial year 2023-24.”TN CM Stalin on Monday had accused Pradhan of misleading Parliament regarding the state’s consent for establishment of PM-SHRI schools. Stalin also shared on social media a letter dated Aug 30, 2025, from Pradhan, highlighting a paragraph where the Union minister wrote: “… after receiving the undertaking, a draft MoU was sent … I was surprised to see that the state responded with a modified MoU... wherein the key paragraph referring to the implementation of NE in entirety had been dropped.”Pradhan said that according to Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE+) data, 67% of students are now enrolled in English-medium schools, while Tamil-medium enrolment has dropped from 54% in 2018-19 to 36% in 2023-24.

Booze sales in J&K buck ban buzz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/booze-sales-in-jk-buck-ban-buzz/articleshow/118904256.cms,"Representative photo

SRINAGAR: A liquor paradox is playing out in J&K as sales are surging against the grain of political parties pushing for prohibition, driven by growing worries over alcohol abuse in the region.Govt’s economic survey report presented in the assembly last week projects a 4% increase in excise revenue, expected to reach Rs 2,000 crore in 2024-25. The rise is attributed to policy changes, including strengthened tracking mechanisms, transparent auctions for liquor vends, and an overhauled excise framework.However, at the heart of the political debate is the demand for prohibition. Opposition PDP has led the charge, with MLA Fayaz Ahmad Mir submitting a bill to ban the “advertisement, sale, purchase, consumption, and manufacture of alcoholic drinks” in the region.CM Omar Abdullah’s NC followed suit, as did independent legislator Sheikh Khurshid Ahmad.BJP has also voiced support, having long advocated for liquor restrictions. In Jammu, former J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina had earlier staged protests against alcohol sales.PDP chief and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti’s daughter Iltija launched a signature campaign last week to rally public backing, vowing to take it to every constituency in Kashmir. “We want J&K to be declared a dry state like Gujarat and Bihar,” Iltija said. “J&K is called the land of rishis and peers (Sufi saints). We have our own sensitivities, culture, and customs. That should be respected.”While political tempers rise, the new excise policy released on Feb 15 takes a dual approach. It acknowledges the “harmful effects of alcohol consumption and drug abuse” but also aims to provide a “choice of liquor brands and places for consumption”. The policy seeks to develop the liquor industry, promote local manufacturing, and create job opportunities.Plans are afoot to set up liquor shops at revenue-generating tourist locations, particularly in govt-owned facilities. The policy bans the import of IMFL brands priced at Rs 600 or below a bottle.Former finance minister Haseeb Drabu, who opposed a liquor ban in 2016 on grounds of personal choice rather than revenue loss, said the debate has evolved. Instead of a blanket ban, he suggested a phased approach.“One option could be to ban it only in the Valley to start with. That way, revenue would also be protected as the bulk of it comes from Jammu. The flip side of this would be bootlegging, especially in a tourist-driven state,” Drabu said.","Govt’s economic survey report projects a 4% increase in excise revenue, expected to reach Rs 2,000 crore in 2024-25.

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





IndusInd Bank's shares dropped 20% on Tuesday, reaching a new 52-week low of Rs 720.50. Multiple brokerages have reduced their ratings and price targets following the discovery of accounting irregularities in the bank's forex derivatives portfolio. On the BSE, IndusInd Bank's shares plunged 22.8 per cent, reaching the lower circuit at Rs 695.25 per piece, marking its 52-week low. The company's shares dropped 21.67 per cent on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), touching a 52-week low of Rs 705.35 apiece. The shares became the biggest decliner amongst the 30 constituents of BSE Sensex.The bank revealed a potential post-tax impact of Rs 15.8 billion, which is 2.35% of its net worth. This has sparked worries about corporate governance and future earnings clarity. IndusInd Bank issued a statement stating that its profitability and capital adequacy levels remain robust enough to withstand this singular impact.The sharp decline in share price followed the bank's disclosure on Monday evening regarding valuation inconsistencies in internal foreign exchange derivative transactions over a 5-7 year period. The financial impact will be reflected in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to an ET report.This revelation coincides with existing investor concerns after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) limited IndusInd Bank's CEO Sumant Kathpalia's extension to one year, despite the board's request for a three-year term.Also Read | Elon Musk, world’s richest person, loses $120 billion! Why Tesla CEO’s net worth is taking a hit In light of recent events, Motilal Oswal has revised downwards its stance on IndusInd Bank to 'Neutral', adjusting the target price to Rs 925. The firm acknowledges that whilst accounting irregularities will affect short-term results, the bank's future leadership planning and resolution of governance issues could facilitate improvement.""The recent accounting discrepancies related to derivative transactions have further dampened sentiments and are likely to drive losses in 4QFY25 as the bank absorbs the impact through its P&L. We expect the stock to react negatively to this development. However, we believe the board will expedite the process of evaluating both internal and external candidates for a suitable successor, which should help alleviate concerns and improve confidence in the bank's operations,"" the brokerage was quoted as saying.Following multiple adverse developments, including the CFO's departure, limited CEO tenure extension and forex derivative markdown, Nuvama has reduced its rating for IndusInd Bank to 'Reduce' from 'Hold'. The target price has been lowered to Rs 750, with expectations of sustained pressure on earnings.Also Read | RIL shares plunge 25% from peak! Rs 5.4 lakh crore wiped out - what’s the outlook on Reliance Industries stock? Emkay Global downgraded IndusInd Bank to 'Add' from 'Buy' and slashed its target price by 22% to Rs 875, citing the forex derivative loss and the uncertainty surrounding the final external audit report due in Q4FY25.Given the substantial decline of 47% over the past year and an additional 20% decrease on Tuesday, some brokerage firms anticipate limited potential gains from present valuations, whilst concerns regarding trustworthiness and uncertain profit outlook continue to pose significant challenges.Financial experts emphasise that improvement in share performance will be contingent upon three crucial factors: the results of the independent audit assessment, leadership transition arrangements, and the institution's capability to demonstrate robust corporate governance practices to its stakeholders, says the report.Also Read | Donald Trump's tariffs: India may be among least vulnerable Asian economies in trade war with US - but there's a catch!","IndusInd Bank's shares dropped 20% on Tuesday, reaching a new 52-week low of Rs 720.50.

NEW DELHI: The first rear fuselage for the Tejas Mark-1A jet produced by the private sector was handed over to defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), which is struggling to produce the indigenous fighter, in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh in Bengaluru on Sunday.“This is a testimony to India’s progress towards Aatmanirbharta in defence and the govt’s commitment towards enhanced public-private partnership. HAL and the private sector are playing a key role in strengthening the armed forces with the latest platforms and technologies,” Singh said, in the presence of IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh. “HAL, through its integrated model and strategies, is not only bolstering India’s defence capabilities but also adding new dimensions to Indian defence manufacturing ,” Singh added.HAL had placed orders with various Indian private companies such as L&T, Alpha Tocol Engineering Services, Tata Advanced Systems Ltd, VEM Technologies and Lakshmi Mission Works for supplying major modules for the Tejas Mark-1A fighters.This comes even as the IAF chief has publicly lashed out at HAL in recent weeks.The IAF till now has got 38 of the first 40 Tejas Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010. The first “improved” Tejas Mark-1A jet, out of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021, is yet to be delivered. The order for another 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore is also in the pipeline. The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-404 engines by US firm General Electric is one of the main reasons for the delay in the Tejas fighters.The MoD, on its part, said HAL has already manufactured 12 rear fuselages for the Tejas Mark-1A fighters, which are on the aircraft in the manufacturing line. “With this supply, a major structure module produced by an Indian private partner will be integrated into the Mark-1A aircraft, enabling HAL to meet additional delivery commitments for the IAF from 2025-26 onwards,” an official said.","The first rear fuselage for the Tejas Mark-1A jet produced by the private sector was handed over to defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Sunday.

Wayne Gretzky was sued for $10M over alleged false claims about a Weight Loss Gum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzky-was-sued-for-10m-over-alleged-false-claims-about-a-weight-loss-gum/articleshow/118879580.cms,"Image via TNT

Wayne Gretzky’s role and the impact of celebrity endorsements

What is the current status of the lawsuit

Wayne Gretzky, widely regarded as one of the greatest hockey players of all time, found himself at the center of a legal controversy in 2022 when he was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product. The lawsuit, filed by entrepreneur Steven Sparks in Los Angeles, alleged that Gretzky falsely promoted OMG Gum as a weight loss aid, claiming it helped him lose 35 pounds. Sparks, an investor in the product, argued that this statement artificially inflated the value of the company, leading to significant financial damages when the claim was revealed to be untrue.According to the lawsuit, Steven Sparks originally invested in OMG Gum because of its purported benefits and Wayne Gretzky's endorsement. The gum was marketed as a weight loss supplement, with Gretzky allegedly stating that he personally used it to shed excess weight. Sparks contended that this claim helped boost the product’s credibility and value, ultimately leading him to increase his financial involvement.However, Sparks later learned that Gretzky’s weight loss statement was false. As a result, he claimed that the company’s value plummeted, and he suffered substantial monetary losses. In response, Sparks filed a $10 million lawsuit against Gretzky, accusing him of fraud and deceptive business practices.While Gretzky was not the creator of OMG Gum, he was closely linked to its promotion. His status as a sports icon and public figure likely contributed to the product’s perceived legitimacy, demonstrating the significant influence that celebrity endorsements can have on consumer and investor decisions.This case highlighted concerns about the responsibilities of celebrities when endorsing products, especially those related to health and wellness. Investors and consumers often rely on such endorsements, assuming that public figures genuinely support and use the products they promote.As of now, there have been no major updates on the outcome of Sparks’ lawsuit against Gretzky. It is unclear whether the case was settled privately, dismissed, or remains ongoing. If proven, the allegations could serve as a cautionary tale for both investors and celebrities regarding the risks of false advertising and misleading promotions.Also Read: “A scumbag”: Brad Marchand a tongue-in-cheek answer when asked about coming back together with Sam Bennett Gretzky has not publicly commented in detail on the accusations, but the case remains an example of how endorsements, especially from high-profile figures, can have serious legal and financial consequences.","Wayne Gretzky was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product.

Who is Sarah Wynn-Williams?

What did Meta say about the new allegations?

Sarah Wynn Williams has hit the headlines after her book 'Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism' exposed the people in power of Meta, then Facebook. Williams too was a director of the company where she worked for six years before quitting in 2017.Williams accused former Facebook COO Sheryl Sanberg of approaching her female assistant improperly during a trip. Williams wrote that during a trip to Europe, Sandberg spent $13,000 on lingerie for herself and her young female assistant whom she invited to the bed on a private jet flight. Williams said she was also offered to join Sandberg in the only bed that the jet had and Sandberg was rankled when her offer was rejected.Williams said under Zuckerberg and Sandberg, Facebook's culture turned rotten with shocking accounts of misogyny and double standards as the two top executives turned a blind eye to what was happening in the company.Williams alleged that Zuckerberg worked 'hand in glove' with Beijing and considered sharing user data with China.A former New Zealand diplomat, Sarah Wynn-Williams was a Facebook director who accused her boss Joel Kaplan of sexually harassing her. Kaplan was then the vice president of Facebook for global public policy. Williams was fired from her post as director in 2017 following her complaint against her boss, which she believes was retaliation for making the complaint. Meta, however, maintained that Willians was fired for ""poor performance"" and ""toxic behavior"" and the investigation against Kaplan was found ""misleading"".Williams has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors.Meta said the allegations in Williams' books are a mix of ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" about the company. The company said since Williams was fired in 2017, she has been paid by anti-Facebook activists to continue complaining against Facebook.On the China allegations, Meta said it was no secret that Facebook was once interested in operating services in China but ultimately opted not to do it.","Sarah Wynn Williams has hit the headlines after her book 'Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism' Williams too was a director of the company where she worked for six years before quitting in 2017.

Photo: Rich Graessle/Icon Sportswire via Getty

Darryl Strawberry's take on Juan Soto's Mets' signing

“It was good for him to make the decision to play here because now he’s not going to be behind anybody. Juan Soto with the Mets, yeah, you have [Francisco] Lindor, who’s great, but if you play over there [with the Yankees] with a guy like [Aaron] Judge, you’re never gonna be bigger than him.”

“Him coming here means everything. It takes you to the next level when you have that type of player.""

""Juan Soto wanted to go to the Mets. I think Aaron Judge said it correctly. I don't think it's about the money when you're talking $765 million versus $760 million. There isn't that much difference there and the Yankees would have gone $765 million if he said he wanted $765 million, they would've just matched the Mets. Well, are they going to draw the line there?""

Juan Soto 's $765 Million signing with the New York Mets , was one of the most talked-about deals of the offseason. In fact, the buzz around his contract hasn't stopped yet and people are still talking about it. Recently, MLB legend Darryl Strawberry praised Soto for his decision to join the Mets, and how it'll turn out to be worth it.On Monday, the New York Post released an interview with MLB legend Darryl Strawberry, who spent around 8 years with the New York Mets. During a segment of the interview, Strawberry talked about Juan Soto's Mets signing and praised him for his decision to leave the Yankees.According to Darryl Strawberry, Juan Soto would have struggled to outshine his performance with that of Yankees captain Aaron Judge . However, that's not the case with the Mets. In the Mets, Soto could get ""bigger than"" many players and create a worthy legacy. Concluding his statement, Strawberry added:As of his $765 Million signing, MLB analyst Jon Heyman broke his silence last month when he talked about the reason why Juan Soto decided to accept the Mets' offer. Sharing his take in an episode of ""The Baseball Insiders"" podcast, Heyman said:Apart from Jon Heyman, the Yankees captain Aaron Judge also shared his take on Juan Soto's signing and claimed to be having ""no hard feelings"" for him leaving his former team."," MLB legend Darryl Strawberry praised Juan Soto for his decision to join the Mets.

Poll What Is the Most Effective Measure to Prevent Smuggling? Stricter Law Enforcement Increased Border Security

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah has ordered an investigation into allegations of protocol violations at Kempegowda International Airport and the alleged involvement of senior IPS officer Ramachandra Rao in the gold smuggling case linked to actress Ranya Rao.The probe will be led by Karnataka's Additional Chief Secretary Gaurav Gupta, who has been instructed to submit his report within a week.The controversy erupted following claims that Ranya Rao misused VIP courtesy services at the airport to evade security checks and engage in illegal activities.Reports suggest that Rao, the stepdaughter of DGP K Ramachandra Rao, leveraged her connections to smuggle gold from Dubai to Bengaluru.An official government order acknowledged the media reports detailing Ranya Rao’s arrest by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) for allegedly transporting 14.8 kg of gold bullion from Dubai. The order further highlighted that VIP privileges extended to senior officials were also granted to her father, raising concerns over possible misuse of power.""It is reported that Mrs. Rao misused her name and the courtesy services offered to her to evade checks at airports and conduct illegal activities. Therefore, the government considers it necessary to investigate the facts and circumstances leading to the availment of courtesy facilities and the role of Shri Ramachandra Rao, IPS, Director General of Police, and Managing Director of Karnataka State Police Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation in this case,"" the order stated.The investigation will focus on how these privileges were availed, whether proper protocols were followed, and if IPS officer Ramachandra Rao had any direct or indirect role in facilitating the alleged smuggling. Gaurav Gupta has been directed to initiate the probe immediately and submit a detailed report.The case came to light on March 3, when Ranya Rao was arrested at Kempegowda International Airport for allegedly smuggling gold. She was subsequently produced before a special court for financial offences on March 4 and remanded to judicial custody until March 18. Before being transferred to custody, she underwent a medical examination at Bowring Hospital in Bengaluru.During interrogation, Ranya Rao maintained that her Dubai trip was for business purposes, but investigators suspect her travel was linked to an organized gold smuggling operation. She was initially remanded to DRI custody until March 10, with the Economic Offences Court allowing her to meet her lawyer for half an hour daily during this period.The court, presided over by Justice Vishwanath C Gowdar, directed the DRI to ensure Rao was provided with essentials like food and a bed and cautioned officials against any harsh treatment during questioning.
