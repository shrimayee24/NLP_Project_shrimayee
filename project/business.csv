"Unified Pension Scheme vs OPS vs NPS: How is UPS different from National Pension Scheme, Old Pension Scheme?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/unified-pension-scheme-vs-ops-vs-nps-how-is-ups-different-from-national-pension-scheme-old-pension-scheme/articleshow/112796028.cms,"UPS vs OPS vs NPS

:

Unified Pension Scheme (UPS): Top Features

Under the UPS, employees with a minimum qualifying service of 25 years will receive an assured pension of 50% of the average basic pay drawn over the last 12 months prior to superannuation.

For service periods between 10 and 25 years, the pension will be proportional.

In the event of an employee's demise, their family will receive an assured pension of 60% of the employee's pension immediately before their demise.

The scheme also includes an assured minimum pension of Rs 10,000 per month upon superannuation after a minimum of 10 years of service.

The UPS will apply inflation indexation to the assured pension, assured family pension, and assured minimum pension.

Dearness Relief will be based on the All India Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (AICPI-IW), similar to service employees.

Additionally, employees will receive a lump sum payment at superannuation, calculated as 1/10th of monthly emoluments (pay + DA) for every completed six months of service. This lump sum payment is separate from gratuity and does not impact the assured pension amount.

Employees choosing the UPS will not incur any extra financial burden. Their contribution will stay at 10 percent, while the government's contribution will rise from 14 percent to 18.5 percent.

National Pension Scheme (NPS): Top Features

Under NPS, central government employees contribute 10% of their basic salary, while the government contributes 14%, according to an ET report.

The pension amount in NPS is not fixed as it is linked to market movements, whereas UPS provides an assured pension of 50% of the salary for those who joined the service after January 1, 2004.

Family pension under NPS depends on the accumulated corpus in the pension fund and the chosen annuity plan at retirement.

NPS has been implemented for all government employees, except those in the armed forces, who joined the central government on or after January 1, 2004. It is also available for private-sector employees. Most state/Union Territory governments have also notified NPS for their new employees.

Old Pension Scheme (OPS): Top Features

The Old Pension Scheme (OPS) provided retired government employees with a monthly pension equal to 50 percent of their last drawn salary. This amount was subject to increase in line with the hike in the Dearness Allowance (DA) rates. Upon retirement, employees were also entitled to receive a gratuity payment, with a maximum limit of Rs 20 lakh.

Under the OPS, if a retired employee passed away, their family would continue to receive pension benefits. Another notable aspect of the OPS was that no deductions were made from an employee's salary towards pension contributions, which is in contrast to the NPS.

The Modi government has introduced a new pension scheme called the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for central government employees who joined the service after January 1, 2004. This scheme, which will be implemented from April 1, 2025, guarantees a pension equal to 50% of the basic salary. The decision to introduce UPS comes in response to several non-BJP states reverting to the DA-linked Old Pension Scheme (OPS) and employee organizations in other states demanding the same.Employees have the option to choose between UPS and NPS.So how does UPS compare to NPS? And how does it compare to the OPS? We take a look:NPS and the newly proposed UPS differ in terms of government contributions, pension amounts, and family pension provisions.Recently, several states in India, including Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Punjab, have made the decision to revert to the Old Pension Scheme, moving away from the NPS.","The Modi government has introduced a new pension scheme called the Unified Pension Scheme.

"Judicial officers get array of tax-free allowances, Supreme Court forces states to pay allowance arrears by summoning chief secretaries",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judicial-officers-get-array-of-tax-free-allowances-supreme-court-forces-states-to-pay-allowance-arrears-by-summoning-chief-secretaries/articleshow/112851813.cms,"NEW DELHI: Judicial officers get an impressive array of tax-free allowances over and above their salaries and states agreed to pay up to four weeks' arrears of allowances to district court judges as per Second National Judicial Pay (SNJP) Commission after chief secretaries and finance secretaries of defaulting states were made to appear before the Supreme Court on Tuesday.If a judicial officer is tasked with additional charge, then she/he gets an additional allowance for that purpose. If the judicial officer has a higher degree, like LLM or equivalent against the required qualification of LLB, he/she gets three advance increments in his pay scale. An entry level judicial officer, as per SNJP, gets a monthly take home of around Rs 90,000. There are around 23,000 judicial officers distributed unevenly in different states, where as many as 4.5 crore civil and criminal cases are pending. Of these 38% of cases are less than one year old.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra agreed to examine the grievance raised by judicial officers that states do not pay advance increment for higher qualification on promotion under assured career progression (ACP), if the increments had been paid once. This means, with every promotion, they would be getting three increments if they had a higher qualification, which the CJI-led bench said prima facie it finds to be legitimate.In addition to the usual allowances like - DA, HRA, medical allowance during service and after retirement, earned leave encashment, LTA, conveyance, telephone and mobile phone allowance, the judicial officers are entitled to hill area/tough location allowance.If they are posted in trouble torn/ militancy infested or border areas, they are entitled to a risk allowance. Nagaland said it was not paying risk allowance to judicial officers as it has disentitled civil servants from getting the same. Judicial officers of the state protested the withdrawal of this allowance and the SC asked the committee of the Gauhati HC to examine this grievance of the trial court judges.The judicial officers also get sumptuary allowance and children's education allowances which include hostel subsidy. The electricity and water consumed by them and their families at residence is also substantially subsidized by the govts. Interestingly, the domestic help/home orderly allowance given to them while serving as judicial officers gets extended to them beyond retirement.Apart from these, they get furniture and air conditioner allowance, newspaper and magazine allowance and even an allowance to stitch or buy the judicial robes. They are also entitled to a grant for shifting to another town on transfer and can encash earned leave up to 300 days on retirement.","An entry level judicial officer, as per SNJP, gets a monthly take home of around Rs 90,000.

Kolkata Doctor Rape Murder: 'Enough is enough': President Droupadi Murmu speaks out on Kolkata rape-murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/enough-is-enough-president-droupadi-murmu-speaks-out-on-kolkata-rape-murder-case/articleshow/112870105.cms,"NEW DELHI: President Droupadi Murmu for the first time has publicly spoken about her views on the Kolkata incident through an article titled "" Women's Safety : Enough is Enough .""Declaring that ""enough is enough,"" Murmu stressed upon the urgency of addressing the harmful mindset that views women as ""less powerful, less capable, less intelligent,"" because of which women are often objectified and victimised.In a powerful statement, she said that both the government and society must work together to change this mentality.In a signed article for PTI, the president expressed her deep dismay and horror over the recent rape and murder of a junior doctor in Kolkata on August 9.Tragedy that has once again shook the nation's conscience and sparked widespread protests. This incident, she said, is not a single case but part of a distressing pattern of violence against women.""Even as students, doctors and citizens were protesting in Kolkata, criminals remained on the prowl elsewhere. The victims include even kindergarten girls,"" Murmu said.""No civilised society can allow its daughters and sisters to be subjected to such atrocities,"" wrote Murmu.""The nation is bound to be outraged, and so am I,"" she added.Reflecting on the context of women rights, Murmu stated that throughout history, women have to fight for every inch of progress.Social prejudices and customs have often restricted the expansion of women’s rights, leading to a ""deplorable mindset"" that views women as inferior. This mindset, she argued, is a root cause of the crimes committed against them.""It is ingrained deeply in the minds of such people,"" the president wrote, stressing that countering this mentality is a task for both the country and society at large.While laws and social campaigns are made, Murmu agrees that there is still ""something that continues to come in the way and torment us.""She highlighted the need for honest self-reflection, urging society to confront its collective failures. ""History often hurts,"" she said, pointing out that societies that are afraid to face history tend to bury their heads in the sand, like the proverbial ostrich.""Now the time has come not only to face history squarely but also to search within our souls and probe the pathology of crimes against women .""She called for a comprehensive approach to tackling the root causes of these crimes, starting with honouring the memory of the victims and fostering a culture that remembers these tragedies to prevent future ones.""Let us deal with this perversion in a comprehensive manner so as to curb it right at the beginning,"" she urged.The president also shared an instance from a recent Raksha Bandhan interaction with school children, where they asked her if incidents like the Nirbhaya case could ever be prevented in the future.She expressed her frustration that, despite efforts made after that 2012 Delhi gang rape incident, similar tragedies continue to occur.""Did we learn our lessons?"" she asked, noting that as social protests fade, these incidents are usually forgotten until another heinous crime happens.The society needs honest, unbiased self-introspection, and asks itself some difficult questions, the president said.""Where have we erred? And what can we do to remove the errors? Without finding out the answer to that question, half of our population cannot live as freely as the other half,"" she said.","President Droupadi Murmu for the first time has publicly spoken about her views on the Kolkata incident through an article titled "" Women's Safety : Enough is Enough.""Declaring that ""enough is enough,"" Murmu stressed upon the urgency of addressing the harmful mindset that views women as ""less powerful""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112870107,imgsize-1602730,width-400,resizemode-4/112870107.jpg"

‘Lawyer mustn’t act as client’s postman’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawyer-mustnt-act-as-clients-postman/articleshow/112879864.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court pulled up the counsel appearing for Maharashtra in a land compensation case in which it deemed a senior IAS officer's affidavit as ""contemptuous"" and told him that he should not have allowed the filing of such an affidavit.Though the lawyer apologised and instantly told the court the state was withdrawing the statement, it did not calm the bench which passed the order for the officer's personal appearance.It said a lawyer should not ""act as a postman of his client "" but as an officer of the court.The case pertains to litigation over a piece of land which was illegally taken by the state six decades ago and the court is exploring the option of giving monetary compensation and had asked the state to find the current value of the land situated near Pune. The court had earlier rejected the state's offer to pay Rs 37 crore compensation and sought to know the value of the land.Responding to the court's query, the officer filed an affidavit and said, ""The applicant (land owner) as well as this court may not approve the fresh calculation made by the collector, Pune, but it is the bounden duty of the state to follow the provision of law and to arrive at proper calculation. As per the fresh calculation, the amount of compensation comes to Rs 48.6 crore.""The state also agreed to allot an alternative piece of land within Pune municipal area to the land owner but the petitioner expressed reluctance in accepting it. The court thereafter asked senior advocate Dhruv Mehta, who was appearing for the petitioner, to seek instruction on whether his client wanted monetary compensation or alternative piece of land and also asked him to go for joint inspection of the land offered by the state.The court also noted that the current value of the land had not been calculated by the state and accused the govt of indulging in delaying tactics.""It is thus clear that the exercise as assured by the counsel of the state has not been undertaken. He again reiterated his earlier stand of paying the compensation as per the ready reckoner of 1989 and the interest accrued thereon. When the state had sought time for a particular purpose, it was expected that the state should have done the exercise and come with an amount arrived at... we find that the state is only indulging in delaying tactics,"" the bench said.","The case pertains to litigation over a piece of land which was illegally taken by the state six decades ago.

"In big step towards nuke triad, India set to commission 2nd nuclear-sub today",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-big-step-towards-nuke-triad-india-set-to-commission-2nd-n-sub-today/articleshow/112879589.cms,"Top Picks For You US govt approves sale of anti-submarine warfare sonobuoys to India for `hunter-killer’ helicopters

NEW DELHI: India will finally commission its second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles as INS Arighat on Thursday, in a major step towards further strengthening its strategic deterrence capabilities.The commissioning of the almost 112-metre-long submarine, armed with K-15 missiles that have a strike range of 750-km, will take place at the secretive ship-building centre in Visakhapatnam in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh and top national security and military officials.TOI was the first to report on Aug 11 that INS Arighat’s commissioning was now imminent after the 6,000-tonne boat became “fully ready” following protracted extensive trials and technological upgrades.INS Arighat will now join her forerunner INS Arihant , which became fully operational in 2018, to strengthen the country's ' nuclear triad ’ or the capability to fire nukes from the land, air and sea.“While INS Arighat is of the same size, length and displacement as INS Arihant, she can carry more K-15 missiles. The new boat is much more capable, efficient and stealthy,” a source said.Both INS Arihant and INS Arighat are powered by 83 MW pressurized light-water reactors at their core. The miniature nuclear reactors fitted in their hulls ensure they can stay submerged for months on end, unlike conventional diesel-electric submarines that must surface or “snorkel” every couple of days to get oxygen to recharge their batteries.The real punch in India’s deterrence capabilities will come when the third SSBN (naval parlance for nuclear-propelled submarines with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles), a slightly larger 7,000-tonne vessel, is commissioned next year. To be called INS Aridhaman, she will carry K-4 missiles that can hit targets 3,500-km away.A fourth SSBN is also being constructed under the classified Rs 90,000 crore advanced technology vessel (ATV) project to bolster the country’s weak sea-based leg of the nuclear triad. The other two legs, the land-based Agni ballistic missiles and fighter jets like Sukhoi-30MKIs, Mirage-2000s and Rafales that can drop nuclear gravity bombs, are much more robust.Given India’s declared “no-first use” nuclear doctrine, SSBNs are crucial for deterrence because they are difficult to detect and can escape a surprise first strike by an enemy to launch retaliatory strikes.India, of course, still has a long way to go. Countries like the US, Russia and China have much larger SSBNs armed with longer range missiles. China, for instance, has six Jin-class SSBNs, with 10,000-km range JL-3 missiles, apart from six nuclear-powered attack submarines (called SSNs, meant conventional warfare). The US, in turn, has 14 Ohio-class SSBNs and 53 SSNs.TOI had also reported earlier this month that the around Rs 40,000 crore project to indigenously construct two 6,000-tonne `hunter-killer’ SSNs, armed with torpedoes, anti-ship and land-attack missiles, is now before the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security for the final nod after repeated iterations and inter-ministerial consultations. It will take at least a decade to construct them."," INS Arighat is India's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to create plug-and-play infrastructure for industry to set up factories, the cabinet committee on economic affairs Wednesday cleared 12 new industrial cities with an investment of Rs 28,600 crore, with the largest one, spread over 6,000 acre, to come up near Dighi port in poll-bound Maharashtra.At least three of these proposed cities are in states governed by NDA allies: Gaya in Bihar, and Orvakal & Kopparthy in Andhra.Another two are in BJP-governed UP (Agra, Prayagraj), besides in Uttarakhand (Khurpia), and Rajasthan (Jodhpur Pali Marwar).Among the opposition-governed states, Punjab (Rajpura Patiala), Kerala (Palakkad) and Telangana (Zaheerabad) have been allotted one project each. The 12th project was not named, with Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw citing model code of conduct in force for assembly polls.“These projects have potential to generate investment of over Rs 1.5 lakh crore. But the estimates are conservative,” said commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, adding that a little under 10 lakh jobs will be created. Though earlier projects have taken longer to develop, he said basic infrastructure in the new ones will be developed in three years given that states are ready with land and environmental clearances. “Centre and state govt will set up a special purpose vehicle, with the states providing land, which is treated as its share of equity, and Union govt providing equivalent amount of cash.","Cabinet committee on economic affairs clears 12 new industrial cities with an investment of Rs 28,600 crore.

NEW DELHI: India has now inked another contract for the import of an additional 73,000 SiG Sauer assault rifles from the US, which will add to the 72,400 such guns bought earlier for frontline Army troops, amid the continuing military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh.“The SiG-716 `Patrol’ rifles, which are 7.62x51mm caliber guns with an effective ‘kill’ range of 500-metre, are meant for infantry battalions deployed along the borders with China and Pakistan.It is a repeat order valued at Rs 837 crore,” a source told TOI on Tuesday.The delay in the manufacture of Russian AK-203 Kalashnikov rifles in India had led to the import of the first lot of 72,400 SiG-716 rifles (66,400 for the Army, 4,000 IAF and 2,000 Navy) under a Rs 647 crore contract inked with US firm SiG Sauer under the fast-track procurement route in Feb 2019.The Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council (DAC) had given the nod for the procurement for the additional 73,000 SiG-716 rifles in Dec last year. Parallelly, the Army is also buying 40,949 light machine guns, which were cleared by the DAC in Aug 2023 at an estimated cost of Rs 2,165 crore.On the assault rifles front, the first 35,000 Kalashnikov AK-203s were finally delivered to the Army earlier this year after being assembled at the Korwa ordnance factory in Amethi district of UP under the joint venture called Indo-Russia Rifles Private Limited.In all, six lakh AK-203 rifles have to be manufactured at the Korwa factory over 10 years. These 7.62x39 mm caliber rifles, with an effective range of 300-metre, are supposed to cater to the overall needs of the over 11-lakh strong Army as well as the IAF and Navy.The AK-203 project was first announced in 2018 but was hit by huge delays due to costing, royalty, technology transfer, indigenisation level and other issues, as was earlier reported by TOI.The Army in the past has dismissed reports of glitches in the SiG-716 rifles, stressing that the US-origin rifles have “longer effective range, more lethality and higher recoil” as compared to the indigenous INSAS (5.56x51 mm) or AK-47 rifles.The Army says it has been using ammunition manufactured by Indian ordnance factories for the SiG-716 rifles. “The rifles are also fitted with Picatinny rails to facilitate mounting of various equipment and accessories, such as optical sights, UBGL (under-barrel grenade launchers), forehand grips, bipods and laser pointers, without any modifications,” an officer said.","India has now inked another contract for the import of an additional 73,000 SiG Sauer assault rifles from the US.

Yash Dhull makes a cautious return to cricket after heart surgery in Delhi Premier League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/yash-dhulls-return-to-cricket-after-heart-surgery-a-story-of-courage-and-determination/articleshow/112860390.cms,"NEW DELHI: Yash Dhull , a promising 21-year-old cricketer who previously captained India’s U-19 team, is making a cautious return to the field in the Delhi Premier League (DPL) after undergoing heart surgery earlier this year. He had a congenital heart condition that required surgical intervention, which was promptly addressed after being discovered during a routine check-up at the National Cricket Academy ( NCA ) in Bengaluru.Dhull was attending a training camp at the NCA when the routine medical examinations detected a congenital condition — a hole in his heart. The NCA’s medical team advised immediate surgery, which Dhull underwent in Delhi. According to a News18 report, the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) ensured he received the best possible care and monitored his recovery closely.""During the NCA check-up, the team, after consulting with a set of doctors, advised him to undergo surgery for the hole in his heart,"" said Pradeep Kochar, Dhull’s childhood coach. ""He was attending a camp with the rest of the emerging players a couple of months back in Bengaluru. The surgery went well, and Yash has been on a steady path to recovery.""Dhull’s father, Vijay, explained that the condition was congenital and the surgery was necessary for his son's long-term health and cricket career. ""It wasn’t anything serious. The hole in the heart was a condition from birth, and the NCA team advised a minor surgical procedure. He underwent that in Delhi, and the BCCI continued to keep a check on him during the period,"" said Vijay.Since receiving a fitness certificate from the NCA, Dhull has been gradually rejoining competitive cricket. His performances in the DPL have been subdued, reflecting his ongoing recovery process.""Certain things have happened in the past, and I have returned after a recovery. It’s taking time, but I am positive and will give 100 percent for my game,"" Dhull said after a recent DPL match.Despite the slow start, Dhull’s determination has impressed both his coaches and teammates. ""The NCA has given him the certificate of fitness, so there shouldn’t be an issue in any of the formats going forward. Even going forward, there shouldn’t be any problem for him to play the Ranji Trophy and the longer formats,"" Kochar asserted, expressing confidence in Dhull's ability to bounce back fully.Dhull's journey back to the cricket field after heart surgery has highlighted his courage and dedication. As he continues to work on his fitness and form, the cricketing fraternity remains hopeful that he will soon return to his best, fulfilling the immense potential he has shown at a young age.","Yash Dhull, a promising cricketer who previously captained India’s U-19 team, is making a cautious return to the field in the Delhi Premier League.

How the 'clash' started and went on ...

Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu was recently trolled by a doctor who goes by the moniker ' TheLiverDoc ' on X, formerly known as Twitter. 'TheLiverDoc' slammed Vembu for a post on the benefits on walking barefoot. ""I have been walking bare foot in the farm for close to a year now. This thread talks about the health benefits of ""grounding"" - walking barefoot. It is easy to do, doesn't cost anything and isn't harmful - our rural people have been doing it for ages.So I reasoned why not try it and I got so used to it by now I don't even think about it. Try it!""To this 'TheLiverDoc', who has over 274K followers on Twitter, contested. ""Grounding or Earthing (via bare-foot walking) is a pseudoscientific practice. It has no clinically relevant benefits. There are a lot of absolutely nonsense wasteful studies on this topic that has contaminated the published literature,"" he wrote.The two clashed in a series of posts. Vembu called him an arrogant doctor. ""Stay away from arrogant doctors - that is the best health tip I can give anyone."" In response 'theliverdoc' called Zoho CEO ""Health illiterate boomer uncle "".Tagging the 'boomer uncle' post, Vembu wrote, ""Can we at least be original in our insults online? Is that too much to ask?"" He then went on to add that he has been insulted often online, and often called ""boomer uncle"". He went on to write what the meaning of 'boomer uncle' is and how another common insult he most often faces is ""Sanghi"".""Take the insult ""boomer"" often handed out by ""sophisticated"" young people in India. The word ""boomer"" came from ""baby boom"" in the US which refers to the post World War II period of high fertility - so boomers are the generation born between 1946-64.In the US, ""boomer"" insult is used as code by young people for ""you guys had the good jobs, the good life and piled up debt and we face bad jobs and low income now and can't even afford a house"".In India young people are better off economically than their parents at the same age. Older people in their youth had jobs that paid a pittance and had long hours. So ""boomer"" has no meaning in India.There are plenty of insults original to India - I get called ""sanghi"" and at least I am happy it is a very Indian insult! 😁But ""boomer"" - I say ""Guys I know you think it is sophisticated and shows you know American lingo but all it shows is that you are a mental slave to another culture, using terms with no relevance here at all"".

SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission is set to achieve a remarkable milestone this week by conducting the first privately managed spacewalk . The Program is a pioneering initiative designed to advance human spaceflight capabilities rapidly while also raising funds and awareness for critical causes on Earth.The Polaris Dawn mission is slated to commence at 3:38 am on August 27, launching from Nasa 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule.The mission is anticipated to span six days, with the spacewalk scheduled to take place on the third day of the journey.During the mission, two crew members from the four-person team will exit their Crew Dragon capsule while in Earth's orbit to perform a tethered spacewalk. This event will serve as the inaugural test of SpaceX's newly developed spacesuits . The capsule doesn't have an airlock, so it will fully depressurise during the spacewalk, forcing all four crew members to depend entirely on their suits for survival.Jared Isaacman, an experienced pilot and the billionaire CEO of Shift4 Payments will lead the Polaris Dawn mission and during the mission, he and Sarah Gillis will conduct a spacewalk outside the spacecraft. Isaacman is financing the mission through his Polaris program, although he has not disclosed the total cost, which is believed to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.This will be Isaacman's second space mission, following his leadership of the Inspiration4 mission in 2021, which he organised and primarily funded in collaboration with SpaceX. The Inspiration4 mission was the first all-civilian mission to orbit Earth.Isaacman has two additional missions planned under the Polaris program after Polaris Dawn, one of them will involve another flight on Crew Dragon, while the other will be on Starship, SpaceX's next-generation rocket currently under development. He has not yet announced crewmates or dates for those flights.Sarah Gillis, a senior space operations engineer at SpaceX, is transitioning from her role as an astronaut trainer to becoming an astronaut herself. After completing her engineering degree at the University of Colorado Boulder, Gillis joined SpaceX as an intern in 2015 and since then, she has risen through the ranks to her current position.In her capacity as a senior space operations engineer, Gillis has been responsible for ""training astronauts on safety and flight operations.""Her expertise has been invaluable in preparing Nasaastronauts for various missions, such as the ""International Space Stations Dragon missions Demo-2 and Crew-1 and Inspiration4 mission in 2021.""Anna Menon, a mission specialist and medical officer for the Polaris Dawn program, serves as a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX. In her role, she oversees the development of crew operations, making sure that the necessary procedures and protocols are established to support astronauts throughout their missions.During the Polaris Dawn mission, she will be tasked with ensuring the crew's health and well-being by monitoring their physiological responses and providing medical assistance when required and previously, Menon worked as a biomedical flight controller at Nasa. Menon earned her Master of Science degree in biomedical engineering from Duke University.Menon is married to Anil Menon who was born to Indian and Ukrainian parents in Minneapolis. Anil has worked with Nasa and SpaceX, contributing to multiple space programs. He formerly worked as a flight surgeon at SpaceX and is currently undergoing training to become a Nasa astronaut.Scott Poteet, a former US Air Force pilot with extensive flight experience, including over 3,200 hours in various aircraft such as the F-16 fighter jet, will serve as the mission pilot for the upcoming Polaris Dawn mission. Poteet's journey in the private space industry started when he took on the role of Mission Director for the Inspiration4 mission.The New Hampshire native's responsibilities in the latest mission go beyond piloting the spacecraft; they also include assisting with the spacewalk, providing communication support, and working closely with mission control.Prior to his current position, Poteet held the role of vice president of strategy at Shift4, a company owned by Isaacman, until 2022. He also worked as a business development director at Draken International, a defense contractor founded by Isaacman, until 2020, before Isaacman sold a majority stake in the company to Blackstone in 2019.Named after the North Star, Polaris has historically guided navigation on Earth and in the skies.

NEW DELHI: Thomas Jolly , the creative director for the Paralympic Games opening ceremony on Wednesday, has ambitious plans to challenge and transform society's perceptions of disabilities.The outdoor ceremony will take place at the Champs-Elysees and Place de La Concorde , a historic site where several members of the royal family were executed during the French Revolution.“When we cut off the heads of the king and queen here, it changed society once. Maybe this ceremony will be the second time we change society,” said Jolly as quoted by AP.Jolly, who also directed the Paris Olympics opening ceremony last month, believes that this event could be a catalyst for societal change, much like the beheading of the king and queen.A final rehearsal took place at La Concorde under the Parisian sun, with a hundred dancers, including 20 performers with disabilities. The square, transformed into a grand open arena around the Luxor Obelisk, will host a show focusing on dance and celebrating diverse bodies through the universal language of movement.Swedish director Alexander Ekman has designed a rhythmic spectacle featuring dancers using crutches, wheelchairs, and adapted tricycles. All performers will interact with pulsating beats.Victor Le Masne, who composed the music for the Paris Olympics, is also responsible for the event's soundtrack. He previewed the track Sportography for journalists.Sportography captures the essence of athleticism by incorporating real-life elements such as the screeching of shoes and an athlete’s hard breathing.Le Masne also shared insights into his recent collaborations with Céline Dion and Lady Gaga for the Olympic Opening Ceremony, highlighting their professionalism and dedication.“I had to work on the ‘Mon Truc en Plumes’ arrangement and then flew to Los Angeles to pitch the idea to her management,"" he said. ""They loved it, and Gaga immediately immersed herself in learning about French cabaret culture, even perfecting the pronunciation of the old-timey French song. Her professionalism was awe-inspiring.”For the Paralympics, Le Masne is adopting a different approach by prioritizing athletes and incorporating the physical and emotional sounds of sport. The ceremony will include athletes parading down a section of the Champs-Elysees, with measures taken to ensure accessibility, such as covering the cobblestones with a layer of asphalt for wheelchair users.Unlike the Olympic Opening Ceremony, which had tight security and heavy rain, this event will allow the public to freely watch from along the Champs-Elysees and near the Louvre Museum.Security measures for the Paralympic ceremony will differ from those of the Olympic Opening Ceremony, aiming to provide a more open and welcoming environment for spectators. This decision emphasizes the event's intention to celebrate the spirit of the Paralympics and its athletes.The weather forecast promises bright sunshine and clear skies, although Thierry Reboul, who oversees all Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies, jokingly expressed caution about the weather conditions.“But we’re still pretty cautious about that last part,” Reboul joked about the weather conditions.The Paris Paralympics 2024 opening ceremony will commence at 11:30 PM IST (8 PM local time) on Wednesday, August 28.The grand event will be held at the iconic Champs-Elysees in Paris, marking the beginning of the highly anticipated Paralympic Games.India will be proudly represented by Sumit Antil and Bhagyashree Yadav, who have been chosen as the flag-bearers for the opening ceremony.For Indian fans eager to witness the spectacular opening ceremony, the event will be live-streamed on the Jio Cinema app and website. This digital platform will provide comprehensive coverage of the Paris Paralympics 2024, ensuring that viewers across the country can enjoy the festivities and cheer for their favorite athletes from the comfort of their homes.As the countdown to the opening ceremony begins, sports enthusiasts and supporters of the Paralympic movement are gearing up for an unforgettable experience.

Atrial septal defects (ASDs):

India's Silent Killer: Heart Surgeon Unmasks Root Cause Of Heart Attack Crisis

Ventricular septal defects (VSDs):

Patent foramen ovale (PFO)

How important is early detection?



The cricketer who led India to victory in the 2022 U-19 World Cup , Yash Dhull recently underwent a heart surgery that has raised concerns and curiosity among fans. The surgery, described as minor as per PTI, was necessary after a routine scan during a training camp revealed a small hole in Dhull’s heart. While the condition may sound alarming, it’s important to understand what having a hole in the heart means and how it can impact a person's health.A ""hole in the heart"" is a term often used to describe a range of congenital heart defects (CHDs) that involve an abnormal opening in the walls (septum) separating the heart’s chambers. These defects are usually present at birth and can vary in size and severity. The most common types of septal defects include Atrial Septal Defects (ASDs) and Ventricular Septal Defects (VSDs), each with its own implications.ASDs occur when there is a hole in the wall (septum) between the heart's upper chambers, the left and right atria. This defect allows oxygen-rich blood to mix with oxygen-poor blood, leading to an increased workload on the heart and lungs. ASDs are often congenital and can vary in size. Smaller defects may close on their own over time, while larger ones might require surgical intervention.VSDs are holes in the wall between the heart's lower chambers, the left and right ventricles. These defects can lead to a significant mixing of blood, causing symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and delayed growth in children. Depending on the size and location of the defect, VSDs may close naturally or require surgical correction.Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO), a type of septal defect that occurs when a small hole between the heart's upper chambers fails to close after birth. The foramen ovale is a naturally occurring hole in the fetal heart that allows blood to bypass the lungs, which are not yet functional before birth. Normally, this hole closes shortly after birth, but in about 25% of people, it remains open, leading to a PFO.Yash Dhull's heart condition was detected during a routine scan, highlighting the importance of early detection. Routine medical check-ups and screenings can identify congenital heart defects that might otherwise go unnoticed. Early detection allows for timely intervention, which can prevent complications and improve outcomes for those affected.","Yash Dhull's heart condition was detected during a routine scan.

Legal troubles surrounding Telegram

Durov's revelation: Father to over 100 children

Pavel Durov , the enigmatic founder and CEO of Telegram , has recently made headlines not only for his business ventures but for a startling personal revelation. The billionaire, who was detained by French authorities following his arrival at Le Bourget Airport, claimed during his arrest that he has fathered over 100 children. This revelation, alongside his legal troubles, has added another layer of intrigue to the life of one of the most controversial figures in the tech world.Pavel Durov is a Russian-born entrepreneur known for his innovative contributions to the digital world.Born on October 10, 1984, in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), Durov is best known for co-founding VKontakte (VK), Russia's largest social networking site, and Telegram, a globally popular messaging app.Durov’s journey in the tech industry began with the launch of VK in 2006. The platform quickly became Russia's leading social network, drawing comparisons to Facebook for its widespread popularity. However, Durov’s refusal to comply with Russian government demands, particularly concerning censorship and surveillance, led to his ousting from VK in 2014. Following his departure, Durov turned his focus to Telegram, which he had launched in 2013. Telegram distinguished itself with its strong emphasis on privacy, offering features like end-to-end encryption and self-destructing messages. These features quickly attracted a massive user base, particularly in regions like Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet states.Telegram’s rapid growth has not been without controversy. The platform’s robust privacy features have made it a preferred tool for individuals and organisations concerned about surveillance. However, these same features have also attracted criminal elements, leading to widespread criticism. As per reports, Telegram has been accused of being a haven for illegal activities, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, and the distribution of child exploitation material. The platform’s lack of sufficient moderation has been a focal point of concern for law enforcement agencies worldwide.The complaints filed by Telegram users, particularly about the app's failure to moderate content effectively, led to Durov's recent detention in France. This arrest has intensified the spotlight on Durov and the platform he created, raising questions about the responsibilities of tech entrepreneurs in moderating content on their platforms.Amidst his legal troubles, Pavel Durov made a shocking personal revelation that has captured global attention. In a post on Telegram, Durov claimed that he has fathered over 100 children across 12 countries through sperm donation. This disclosure has added a surprising and personal dimension to the public's perception of the tech mogul.Durov explained that his journey into fatherhood began 15 years ago when a close friend struggling with infertility asked him to donate sperm. Intrigued by the request, Durov visited a clinic where he was informed that he was considered ""top-tier donor material."" The clinic suggested that his donations could help couples around the world who were facing similar challenges. Although initially hesitant, Durov was persuaded by the unconventional nature of the proposal and agreed to become a sperm donor.In his Telegram post, Durov expressed surprise upon learning that he had fathered over 100 children, particularly given his personal lifestyle choices. “I just found out I have over 100 biological kids. How is this possible for someone who has never been married and prefers to live alone?” Durov wrote. This revelation has not only surprised the public but has also led to widespread discussions about the implications of sperm donation and the responsibilities of donors.","Pavel Durov is the founder and CEO of messaging app Telegram.

The death of a 22-year-old dog trainer , Hasrat Ali, following a fatal attack by a Great Dane on Monday, has been attributed to hemorrhage and shock due to multiple injuries, according to the post-mortem conducted by doctors at Rajawadi Hospital. Ali's parents, who arrived in Mumbai on Wednesday evening to claim his body, have alleged negligence on the part of the Marshal Dog Company , where Ali was employed.The tragic incident has also sparked a broader conversation about dog training practices, with animal activists and dog experts highlighting the potential dangers of harsh, punishment-based training methodsThe incident occurred when the Great Dane, named Rocky, attacked Ali at the dog training facility. Despite immediate medical attention, Ali succumbed to his injuries within two hours of being admitted to Rajawadi Hospital. Ali's uncle, Parvez Shaikh, who had helped secure the job for his nephew at the company eight months ago, expressed frustration over the lack of clarity regarding the cause of the dog's aggression. ""We hold the company responsible for not taking any precautions to prevent this. We demand that they show us the CCTV footage to understand the unfortunate incident,"" Shaikh said.In response to the incident, the Vikhroli police have booked Marshal Dog Company and its officials under Section 106 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for causing death due to negligence. Senior Inspector Sudhir Hirlekar of the Vikhroli police confirmed that an investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the aggressive attack.Mumbai-based animal activist and dog groomer, Urdhvi Shah, emphasized the importance of reward-based training, which reinforces positive behavior in dogs. ""We always tell pet owners to do reward-based training for their pets. However, many dog trainers also use punishment-based methods, which can be torture for the animals,"" Shah explained.Shah recounted a past experience with a Labrador that had been subjected to extreme restraint in an attempt to turn it into an aggressive guard dog. The dog became so aggressive that it had to be rescued and later posed a danger even to its owners. ""If the pet dog does not get any love, then don't expect loyalty in return,"" Shah added.Experts also noted that police dogs, which undergo specialized training for tasks like bomb detection and narcotics, are typically selected for their calm temperament from a young age. The incident has reignited discussions about the regulation of dog breeds, particularly those like Rottweilers and Pit bulls, which have been banned in some parts of the USA, Canada, and Europe due to their potential for aggression.In India, dog fights, particularly involving Pit bulls, are illegal but still occur in remote areas, leading to widespread animal cruelty. Animal rights organizations, including PETA India and Humane Society International, have repeatedly called for stricter regulations on dog breeding and the sale of pets to curb these inhumane practices.","Hasrat Ali, 22, died after being attacked by a Great Dane on Monday.

This incident echoes a similar situation in 2017 when the then chief minister Vijay Rupani visited the society and promised to address the persistent issue of urban flooding.Seven years later, the problem remains unresolved, leaving residents to face the same nightmare during every monsoon.The Madhumalti Housing Scheme is just one of several societies in Ahmedabad that have been plagued by chronic flooding despite repeated assurances from AMC and the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (Auda). Over the past seven years, crores of rupees have been spent on various flood mitigation projects across the city, including those targeting Madhumalti, Shrinandnagar in Vejalpur and Vanshree Villa Society in Bodakdev.However, these investments are yet to yield the desired results, with the situation seemingly worsening over time. Despite an investment of Rs 20 crore, Madhumalti continues to suffer from severe flooding, a problem that has persisted for over a decade. AMC and Auda had installed stormwater lines and connected the area to Singarva lake in an effort to alleviate the issue. However, the lake's capacity has been overwhelmed, leading to recurrent flooding.Originally designed to hold 27 crore litres of water, Singarva lake now receives an astonishing 52 crore litres of stormwater each monsoon, far exceeding its capacity. This has caused the lake to overflow, inundating the surrounding areas and rendering the earlier mitigation efforts ineffective.Both civic authorities have been grappling with this issue for years, but a lasting solution remains elusive. In July 2022, a plan was announced to install a new stormwater line to divert excess water to the Khari River at an estimated cost of Rs 24 crore. This plan was seen as a crucial step toward resolving the flooding crisis. However, more than a year later, the project remains a pipedream, with little progress made on the ground. Auda had also awarded a contract for the installation of a stormwater line and a reinforced concrete (RCC) push box under the nearby national highway to divert waters. Yet, these measures have failed to make a significant impact.Despite the substantial financial resources allocated to these projects, the residents are still waiting for a permanent solution that will safeguard their homes and lives from the devastating impact of monsoon floods.","The Madhumalti Housing Scheme in Kathwada continues to suffer from severe flooding.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

For girls, the figure fell from 63 to 57 percent over the same period.Moreover, almost one-third of adolescents reported using neither a condom or contraceptive pills during their last intercourse, a figure largely unchanged since 2018.The use of contraceptive pills remained relatively stable between 2014 and 2022, with 26 per cent of 15-year-olds indicating that they or their partner had used the pill the last time they had sex.The report highlighted socioeconomic disparities in contraceptive use. Teens from low-income families were more likely to forgo using either a condom or a contraceptive pill , with 33 percent reporting using neither during their last intercourse, compared to 25 percent from more affluent families.""Age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education remains neglected in many countries, and where it is available, it has increasingly come under attack in recent years on the false premise that it encourages sexual behaviour,"" WHO Europe director Hans Kluge said.""The truth is that equipping young persons with the right knowledge at the right time leads to optimal health outcomes linked to responsible behavior and choices,"" he added.The WHO warned that inadequate sexuality education could lead to higher rates of STIs and unplanned pregnancies, which in turn result in increased healthcare costs and disrupted education and career paths for young people.""We are reaping the bitter fruit of these reactionary efforts, with worse to come unless governments, health authorities, the education sector and other essential stakeholders truly recognize the root causes of the current situation and take steps to rectify it,"" the agency stated.The WHO has urged policymakers, educators, and healthcare providers to invest in comprehensive sexuality education, improve access to sexual health services, promote dialogue, and better train educators.",Condom use among sexually active teens has majorly declined in Europe over the past decade.
