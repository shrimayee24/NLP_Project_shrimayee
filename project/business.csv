NEW DELHI: From basic infantry skills and seamanship to operating advanced weapon systems and platforms like diesel-electric submarines and supersonic fighter jets, India is further cranking up the training of foreign military personnel to strengthen defence partnerships with different countries.The focus is on training cadets and personnel from “friendly foreign countries” in the Gulf, the ASEAN , and Africa, apart of course from the neighbourhood, in the various Indian military establishments and academies.As part of the ongoing military outreach to Gulf countries like UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain, for instance, as many as 76 Saudi cadets have now begun sea training at the Southern Naval Command (SNC) at Kochi.The trainees from the King Fahad Naval Academy of the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) have joined the Indian Navy’s first training squadron for the four-week programme, which comes after Saudi navy chief Admiral Fahad Abdullah S Al-Ghofaily’s visit here in january this year.“The curriculum ranges from basic seamanship activities to simulator-based training during the harbour phase. The sea phase will focus on practical exposure to nuances of life at sea,” an officer said. This is the second such RSNF batch after the first included 55 cadets in May-June last year.Similarly, military personnel from 26 countries in Africa, where China has made huge strategic inroads, regularly attend courses in the Indian Army’s establishments and pre-commissioning training academies.“The Army trains around 3,100 foreign personnel from over 100 countries every year, which includes about 450 from African countries,” another officer said. The Army even offers special training packages in its establishments like the counterinsurgency and jungle warfare school at Vairengte in Mizoram.The Navy, in turn, provides training to at least 300 foreign trainees at its various training establishments or on-board warships at any given time. “At present, 14 naval schools are training students from more than 20 different countries,” the officer said. There were, for instance, 10 foreign cadets at the passing out parade of the Indian Naval Academy in Ezhimala last month.India has also been steadily deepening military ties with ASEAN countries like Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines through regular joint exercises, military exchanges, arms sales and training programmes, with an eye firmly on an aggressive and expansionist China.India, for instance, has trained Malaysian pilots to fly Russian-origin Sukhoi-30 jets and Vietnamese sailors to operate Kilo-class submarines. India also provides its military facilities and ranges for Singapore’s army and air force to train under special five-year bilateral pacts.“Training personnel from other countries is a very important aspect of military diplomacy. It strengthens India's foreign cooperation, while also showcasing our world-class military training facilities,” a senior officer said.India, of course, is also trying to step up its exports of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, Akash air defence missile systems, Pinaka multi-launch rocket systems and lightweight Tejas fighters, among other military hardware and software.","India is cranking up the training of foreign military personnel to strengthen defence partnerships with different countries.

"Every second Indian adult physically inactive, fails WHO guidelines: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-second-indian-adult-physically-inactive-fails-who-guidelines-study/articleshow/111300179.cms,"TIMESVIEW Inactivity can lead to both physical and mental issues. Unfortunately, modern office work often doesn't encourage physical activity. The report rightly reasserts the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle. We must prioritise the wellness of our own body, take time out to take care of it. There’s no better investment than yourself.

NEW DELHI: Nearly 50% of Indian adults are unfit and fail to adhere to World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations for adequate physical activity , according to a study published in medical journal The Lancet Global Health on Tuesday.The research, conducted across 197 countries and territories from 2000 to 2022, highlighted a significant gender disparity, with 52.6% of women and 38.4% men found physically inactive in 2022. The most concerning aspect of the findings was the dramatic increase in the prevalence of insufficient physical activity among Indian adults, which surged from 22.4% in 2000 to 45.4% in 2022. If the trend of 2010-22 continues, levels of inactivity are projected to rise to 55% by 2030.To maintain optimal health, WHO recommends adults to engage in “150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or equivalent, per week”. Failing to meet these guidelines can lead to serious health consequences. Physically inactive adults are more susceptible to developing various cardiovascular diseases and face an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, dementia and breast and colon cancer.According to city-based doctors, the lack of physical activity and increased consumption of unhealthy food are among major factors contributing to the rise in li- festyle-related diseases. With everything available on mobile phones, people have stopped going to markets, further reducing physical movement. The availability of snacks and beverages within the office has also limited the need for employees to move around. Thissedentary lifestyle affects all age groups.“In our OPD, we see a substantial number of patients with orthopaedic issues related to sedentary lifestyles and poor diets. In a month, the number of such patients ranges between 15 and 25. This indicates that these conditions are prevalent and increasing,” said Dr Hitesh Bhandari, consultant, orthopaedics, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre.He added, “Sedentary lifestyles and consumption of junk food are key contributors to diseases. These include osteoporosis, where a lack of weight-bearing exercise can lead to weaker bones, and osteoarthritis, which is exacerbated by obesity caused by poor diet and inactivity. Chronic lower back pain is another common issue, resulting from poor posture and weak core muscles due to inactivity. Adults aged 40-65 are most affected by a sedentary lifestyle in terms of orthopaedic health . This age group often has desk jobs and establishes sedentary habits, leading to musculoskeletal problems.”Dr Balbir Singh, group chairman, cardiac sciences, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, emphasised the significant health risks associated with a sedentary lifes- tyle, particularly in relation to cardiovascular diseases, which affect both the heart and the brain. These ailments are a major concern for people who engage in minimal physical activity. A sedentary lifestyle is also linked to issues like hypertension, diabetes and obesity.“The consequences of a sedentary lifestyle are more pronounced in older age groups, particularly those aged 40 and above. However, in recent years, there has been a significant change in the lifestyle habits of younger groups. The younger generation is also being impacted, as many work on computers and avoid in-person interactions. Online meetings and lack of walking are becoming prevalent among them. At least 80% of the people who visit my OPD lead a sedentary lifestyle,” said Dr Singh.Women tend to lead a more inactive lifestyle compared to men, he added. Many women believe working in the kitchen and performing household chores constitute significant physical activity, and they often claim to be very active as a result. However, this perception is inaccurate, he said.Dr Anoop Saraya, a gastroenterologist from ILBS, said annual check-ups and corporate health screenings have been instrumental in identifying health issues through incidental findings.“Individuals with fatty liver are at a higher risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which can progress to liver fibrosis, scarring and cell destruction. In advanced stages, this condition may lead to cirrhosis, and those with cirrhotic liver have a higher likelihood of developing liver cancer compared to the general population. The progression from fatty liver to liver malignancy can span over 20-25 years,” he said, adding genetic predisposition plays a crucial role in the development of certain diseases. When coupled with unhealthy eating habits, the risk of developing these conditions increases.According to Dr Pragya Shukla, head of clinical oncology department at Delhi State Cancer Institute, “There is an increasing trend of cancer incidence in the younger population. Breast and colon cancers are directly or indirectly affected by a sedentary lifestyle.”The sedentary nature of modern lifestyles, characterised by prolonged periods of sitting and minimal exercise, has been identified as a significant risk factor for cancer occurrence across all age groups, particularly among young people, she said.“Insufficient exercise can contribute to psychological issues, and there is a correlation between eating unhealthy food and experiencing anxiety and depression,” said Dr Praveen Gupta, principal director and chief of neurology, Fortis Hospital.A sedentary lifestyle may negatively impact a person’s mental well-being. Moreover, the consumption of nutrientpoor, high-calorie foods has been associated with increased levels of stress and low mood.","Nearly 50% of Indian adults are unfit and fail to adhere to World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations for adequate physical activity.

India must aim to lower cost of access to space: Isro chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-must-aim-to-lower-cost-of-access-to-space-isro-chief/articleshow/111296895.cms,"NEW DELHI: Isro chairman S Somanath on Wednesday said that India must aim to lower the cost of access to space as it could boost small satellite launches and attract new participants in the space sector .At the third Annual India Space Congress (ISC) 2024 here, which saw the participation of delegates from over 300 global space organisations and 30 countries, the Isro chief said, “Bringing down the cost of access to space is a global trend, and India must also look at it. Space can never be solely for business and economy; it must inspire generations to innovate for humanity.” he said. “Isro has created significant space capability and talent in the country. It’s time for new actors to scale India’s space operations,” he added.The Isro chief also said that there is not enough internal demand for the satellite-launch market in India but it can be created through more work on the application of satellite technology . He said big companies are willing to enter the space sector but they are concerned about the timeline. “When I talk to many of those industries who are willing to come and set up facilities, they are all very ready to do it. But they are asking when they are going to break even and where the orders are so that they can safely invest in this. I think this is a big question. It is the bigger challenge of convincing investors to come in a big way in big state projects,” the Isro chief said.Somanath mentioned that PM Narendra Modi’s vision for Amrit Kaal includes extending human space activity beyond the Gaganyaan mission, with the goal of landing on the Moon by 2040. However, he said India’s current rockets are not sufficient for round trips to the Moon. Developing rockets with higher payload capacity is essential for both bringing back samples and future human missions, the Isro chairman said. “Though GSLV MKIII (LVM3) is the biggest rocket that we have, it is not big enough. We need to develop the capability to bring samples back and then send humans to the Moon and bring them back,” he said.The Isro chief also mentioned Gsat-20, a high-throughput Ka-band satellite, with over 50gbps high bandwidth connectivity capacity, is set to be launched in mid-Aug onboard Space X’s Falcon 9 and it has received clearance to be moved to the US for launch.","Isro chairman S Somanath said that India must aim to lower the cost of access to space as it could boost small satellite launches and attract new participants in the space sector. “Isro has created significant space capability and talent in the country.

Another dirty NEET secret? Students' ranks jump on 2nd attempt from obscure centres,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-dirty-neet-secret-students-ranks-jump-on-2nd-attempt-from-obscure-centres/articleshow/111240029.cms,"Experts: NEET issue not local, likely to have ‘large spread'

MUMBAI: When Ashalata (name changed) took the NEET for the first time in 2022, her rank was in the six-digit range. However, in her second attempt the following year, her rank leapfrogged from 2 lakh-plus to 8,000. At present, the 20-year-old is a student of LTMG Sion Hospital in Mumbai.Another aspirant from 2022 who had secured a rank beyond 10 lakh now studies in a govt hospital in Mumbai after she secured a rank of around 13,000 in her second attempt in 2023.This ""second-time lucky"" trend, with students scoring ""unbelievable"" ranks after taking a year's break to prepare for the second attempt, has been seen as baffling by academics in medical corridors. And there was a common thread: the second time, each had taken the exam from an obscure centre. While some took it from a tiny village in Belagavi, others opted for a small town near Patna and other places not popular as coaching hubs.Govt sources said attempts are on to make a list of students who scored well in their second attempt at obscure centres and are now pursuing MBBS in govt-run medical colleges.This year, a similar scenario emerged when students from various states opted to take the exam from a school in Godhra, Gujarat. The Gujarat police, who blew the lid off the scam, said students were asked to fill answers for the questions they knew and leave the rest unanswered.""The empty answer-sheets were to be filled in by the centre's deputy superintendent during the half-hour gap the supervisors get to pack the papers. The answer key was to be provided by coaching institutes, which make the key available online after the exam,"" Godhra superintendent of police Himanshu Solanki said. A counsellor said police should investigate how students managed to get allocated to centres that are ""compromised"".When candidates fill their NEET (UG) application, they are expected to give two cities as options for exam centres. Parent representative and counsellor Sudha Shenoy said, ""Before filling the form in Feb, parents called me about agents who had said that they would fill the form for the candidates and that exam centres would be far from cities.""They had assured the parents that their child would get ‘high’ rank and demanded Rs 1 lakh as advance and Rs 9 lakh after the results. I had dissuaded them from falling into any such trap, parent representative and counsellor Sudha Shenoy said.The National Testing Agency (NTA) has always maintained that a computer randomly generates an exam centre based on the choice of cities given by each candidate. “If computer-generated centres are given, how are students who have paid ending up in compromised exam centres,” asked Shenoy.In another instance last year, a private university’s head was surprised to find the brightest first-year students failing on concepts that they had cracked in the entrance test conducted by the university just about 10 months ago and analysed the problem closely to find that some of their exam centres were compromised. “We changed the test agency we worked with. We realised that the exam centres were compromised,” the head of the university, who did not want to be named, told TOI.Experts said the NEET 2024 controversy is not just “local” but probably one with a “large spread.” The NTA needs to “look closely” at the system and “find gaps and fix them”, they said.Student representative and counsellor Sachin Bangad said, “A student should be allotted a local centre based on the combination of where the candidate took the Class X, XII exams and the address on the Aadhar card. Additionally, govt officials need to be roped in for supervision. Like in the polling system, they should be informed merely a night before where their exam supervision duty is.”An officer, who has worked with the Maharashtra admission process for decades, said NEET should be conducted on computers for safety reasons. “Additionally, the new provisions brought in for the post-graduate test, to break down the test into multiple-timed sections that cannot be revisited once the time is up, should also be brought into the UG test,” the officer added.","When Ashalata (name changed) took the NEET for the first time in 2022, her rank was in the six-digit range.

HYDERABAD: Telugu students packing their bags for the US this fall are more likely to feel at home than before. There has been an explosion in the Telugu-speaking population across America , from 3.2 lakh in 2016 to 12.3 lakh in 2024.According to a Statistical Atlas of the US report based on US Census Bureau data this population ranges from fourth-generation immigrants to recently-arrived students. California hosts the largest Telugu-speaking population - of close to 2 lakh - closely followed by Texas (1.5 lakh) and New Jersey (1.1 lakh). States like Illinois (83,000), Virginia (78,000), and Georgia (52,000) too have a significant pool of people from the two Telugu states. Data shows each of these states have seen an almost four-fold rise in numbers. Local Telugu associations say these numbers are in line with their own estimates.Between 60,000 and 70,000 students arrive in the US each year, along with close to 10,000 H1B visa holders. About 80% of them are registered with us, said Ashok Kolla, former secretary of the Telugu Association of North America. ""Over 75% of them settle here in the US, mostly in Dallas, the Bay Area, North Carolina, New Jersey, Atlanta, Florida, and Nashville.""The older generations are largely entrepreneurs, whereas over 80% of the younger lot are in IT and finance.

Shame that local train users carried worse than cattle: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/shame-that-local-train-users-carried-worse-than-cattle-hc/articleshow/111295622.cms,"MUMBAI: Observing that passengers in local trains are carried worse than cattle, Bombay high court on Wednesday asked Railways whether it has been able to stop train-fall and track-trespassing deaths ""It is your responsibility and duty. You must not depend on the court's direction to save the lives of people,"" said Chief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Amit Borkar, hearing a PIL that highlighted the possible causes for high fatalities on suburban railways and gave suggestions to salvage the situation.""I feel ashamed. The manner in which the passengers in local trains are made to commute,"" said the CJ.The petition said Mumbai suburban railway, which is the second busiest globally after Tokyo, sees over 2,000 deaths annually, with a high 33.8 fatality rate. It also stated that while there is phenomenal growth in the number of passengers, infrastructure at railway stations is old and crumbling.Advocates Rohan Shah and Surabhi Prabhudesai, for petitioner Yatin Jadhav, argued that Railways disowns deaths due to crossing tracks, falling from train or slipping between platform-train gaps and terms them ""untoward incidents"".Shah said: ""Going out to pursue your vocation or to college is like going to war."" He also submitted news reports, including of a stampede-like situation to board a train at Kalyan station.Western Railway's advocate Suresh Kumar said that since 2008, it has complied with directions in an earlier PIL in which guidelines for Railways, including fixing platform-train gaps, and HC was satisfied with the steps taken. The judges then asked if Railways have been able to stop train-fall and trespassing deaths. They said WR cannot take a refuge by saying it carries 33 lakh passengers daily. ""You have to change your attitude and mind,"" the chief justice said. ""This time we are going to make the officials accountable... You are carrying human passengers like cattle. Perhaps even worse.""In the order, the judges said the issue raised in the petition ""needs urgent attention"" of all concerned, specially higher-ups, including a Railway Board member and zonal safety commissioners.

NEW DELHI: Noting that the threat from nuclear weapons has once again occupied centerstage in the geopolitical landscape , chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan on Wednesday said that the ""uniqueness"" of India's nuclear trajectory is premised on the principle of ""no first-use and massive retaliation"".

There is an urgent need for ""a deeper thought, development of new doctrines, reimagining deterrence and safeguarding nuclear C4I2SR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, information, surveillance and reconnaissance) infrastructure"", he said while addressing a seminar here on 'Nuclear Strategy: Contemporary Developments and Future Possibilities'.

Delivering the keynote address on 'Nuclear Strategy: Contemporary Developments and Future Possibilities' at a seminar here, Gen Chauhan also highlighted the changing nature and characteristics of conventional warfare.

The speech comes soon after the latest assessment by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI) on June 17 held that China was boosting its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country around the globe. China now has 500 warheads, up from 410 in January 2023, while India has 172 and Pakistan 170, as per SIPRI.

India even retains the option to retaliate with nuclear weapons if its forces ""anywhere"" are attacked with biological or chemical weapons, as per the doctrine.

He made this suggestion noting that collection from cars and private vehicles accounts for less than 25% of NHAI's toll revenues. ""Around 75% of the toll revenue comes from trucks and commercial vehicles. The remaining 25% comes from cars. There is a thought, which the secretary and NHAI officials can look at... whether we can give monthly or annual passes for cars. The income from this category of vehicles is not much,"" he said at a conference on next-generation toll collection system.

NHAI issues monthly passes with a cap on the number of trips a vehicle can make, on a particular stretch. IHMCL that deals with all toll related matters, will soon carry out a study to assess the financial impact of exempting private vehicles - car, jeep and van - from paying toll at NH toll plazas as part of a bigger exercise to find the impact of electronic toll collection.

Sources said IHMCL has received bids for this study, to show the impact of the exemption. ""The findings will help us plan better,"" said an official.

He said the Speaker will be defending the Constitution by helping the opposition.In what sounded like a riposte to Modi lavishing praise on Birla for overseeing record business in the 17th LS, Rahul said the issue is how much of ""India's voice"" is heard in the House, and not how efficiently it is run. ""The idea that you can run the House efficiently by silencing the voice of the opposition is a non-democratic idea ... This election has shown that the people of India expect the opposition to defend the Constitution.""The words, at once laced with plea for Chair's indulgence and warning of opposition's intent, were echoed by Akhilesh Yadav who, speaking in easy Hindi, conveyed the message with two terse comments - ""your control should be on the treasury benches too, as it is always there on the opposition"" and ""the House should run on your directions, and not the opposite"".""We believe you will move forward without discrimination... You are the chief justice of the court of democracy...actions like suspensions which hurt the dignity of the House will not be taken,"" he said.

He said India is open to engaging all stakeholders in addressing this situation and pressed for credible security protection for India's projects in Myanmar. ""Urged early return to the path of democratic transition in Myanmar. India stands ready to help in any manner,"" the EAM said.

This was possibly the first time there was an acknowledgement publicly by India about its engagement with a senior leader of the military junta. In a tough diplomatic stance, India has maintained ties with the regime because of the need to cooperate for checking activities of insurgents active in border areas.

He was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling, which will be rolled out across 5,000 km during this financial year.Known for not mincing his words, Gadkari said, “If you don’t provide good services, you should not charge toll...We are in a hurry to start tolling to collect user fees and protect our interest. When the condition of any road is not good I get numerous complaints and there are social media posts all over...You should collect the user fee where you provide the best quality road. If you collect toll on roads with potholes, mud, then there will be a backlash from people. We (political leaders) face people’s ire.”The minister said the field officers of NH agencies must be more sensitive towards the pain that people face waiting for long at toll plazas and there must be a mechanism for lodging grievances and their quick redressal.Though govt made the use of FASTag for paying toll on highways mandatory in 2021 for seamless travel through toll lanes and currently around 98% transactions are through these smart tags fixed on vehicles, there have been numerous reports of queues at plazas from across the country. In its bid to put an end to this, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on the roll out and expansion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based toll collection. This aims to remove toll gates from the NH network in the next few years.The highway authority proposes to roll this out in a phased manner, starting with only commercial vehicles and dedicating one lane on each side of toll plazas for them to pass without stopping. It’s mandatory for commercial vehicles to install vehicle tracker system (VTS), an on board unit, which is necessary for GNSS-based tolling.Govt plans to bring private vehicles under this tolling system at a subsequent phase.The road transport ministry has finalised a series of amendments in Central Motor Vehicle Rules and NH Fee Rules, which don’t need legislation, for roll out of the system. While vehicle owners will be incentivised to get a discount in toll charge for complying with their vehicles having OBUs for paying toll without stopping, there will be disincentives for those who don't opt for this.Gadkari said the system (GNSS)-based toll collection will add Rs 10,000 crore to govt’s toll revenue. “We need to put in place a transparent, qualitative and a leak proof system of GNSS-based toll collection in India to ensure no inconvenience to toll users,” he added. The GNSS-based toll collection is expected to enhance efficiency, bring down logistics cost and major relief for the highway users as they will have to pay only for the distance travelled.","Gadkari was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling.

(With inputs from agencies)

More than 1,300 pilgrims died during this year’s Haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia , facing soaring temperatures that reached up to 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit). The Saudi authorities announced the toll on Sunday, revealing that most of the deceased were unauthorized pilgrims who lacked official permits and faced extreme heat without adequate shelter.Saudi health minister Fahd Al-Jalajel reported that 83% of the 1,301 fatalities were among unauthorized pilgrims who had to walk long distances under the intense sun. Many suffered from chronic diseases or were elderly, exacerbating their vulnerability to the harsh conditions. The minister emphasized that the health system provided extensive medical services , including to those who were not officially registered for Haj.Here is an FAQs on extreme heat wave during Haj in Saudi ArabiaThe extreme heat in Saudi Arabia, with temperatures soaring as high as 51.8 degrees Celsius, played a significant role in the high number of fatalities. Many of the deceased were unauthorized pilgrims who walked long distances under the sun without adequate shelter or comfort. According to Saudi Health Minister Fahd Al-Jalajel, ""deaths were caused by pilgrims walking long distances under direct sunlight without adequate shelter or comfort.""A total of 1,301 people died during this year's Haj. Among the fatalities, 83% were unauthorized pilgrims. Notably, Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths, with 630 of them being unregistered pilgrims. Additionally, there were significant numbers of deaths among pilgrims from Indonesia, India, Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Malaysia, and two U.S. citizens.Saudi authorities provided extensive medical services, including 465,000 specialized treatments. They also deployed over 1,600 personnel with medical units and 30 rapid response teams specifically for heatstroke , along with 5,000 health and first aid volunteers. However, many unauthorized pilgrims did not receive the necessary support, leading to tragic outcomes.The Egyptian government took immediate action by revoking the licenses of 16 travel agencies that facilitated unauthorized pilgrimages and referred their managers to the public prosecutor. The agencies had organized Haj trips using visas that did not allow entry to Mecca, leaving many pilgrims stranded and vulnerable to the extreme heat.The tragic loss affected many families worldwide, including Saida Wurie from the US, whose parents died during Haj. They had saved their entire lives for the pilgrimage, spending $23,000 on an all-inclusive package. In an interview to CNN, Wurie criticized the tour company for not providing proper transportation or credentials, which left her parents unprepared for the harsh conditions.Wurie said that the tour operator failed to adequately equip her parents for their journey. She feels that the services provided by the company fell short of what was promised and did not align with the financial investment made by her parents. In her view, the tour operator had an obligation to ensure her parents were well-prepared for the trip, but ultimately did not fulfill this responsibility. ""They saved their whole lives for this,"" she lamented, expressing heartbreak over their unfulfilled dream and their untimely deaths due to heatstroke.A senior Saudi official defended the state's response, stating, ""The state did not fail, but there was a misjudgment on the part of people who did not appreciate the risks."" The health minister also described the management of this year's Haj as ""successful,"" despite the high death toll, highlighting the extensive medical services provided.Deaths during Haj are not uncommon due to the large number of participants and the challenging conditions. In 2015, a stampede in Mina resulted in over 2,400 deaths, the deadliest incident in Haj's history. Extreme heat has also been a recurring issue, with predictions indicating that future Haj pilgrimages will continue to face dangerously high temperatures due to climate change.","More than 1,300 pilgrims died during this year’s Haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.

India tops the list of countries with highest remittances! In the fiscal year 2023-24, overseas Indians sent a record-breaking $107 billion in remittances to their relatives in India, surpassing the $100 billion mark for the second consecutive financial year.According to an ET report, these net remittances are nearly twice the amount of net foreign investments , which include both FDI and portfolio investments, totaling $54 billion during the same period.Several global studies and domestic research have suggested that remittances are connected to the level of migration in various economies, as well as job opportunities and the economic situation in the source countries. The cost of remittances is also considered a factor influencing overseas remittances.The gross remittances by the Indian diaspora , as reflected in private transfers in the balance of payments, reached $119 billion in FY 2023-24. After accounting for the repatriation of income by private foreign residents and other remittances, the net private transfers amounted to $107 billion.The United States remained the largest source of remittances. In 2023, the top five remittance recipient countries were India ($125 billion), Mexico ($67 billion), China ($50 billion), the Philippines ($40 billion), and Egypt ($24 billion).An RBI survey on remittances conducted after the Covid pandemic showed that the United States is the largest source of remittances, accounting for 23% of the total, while flows from the Gulf region have decreased. The survey also indicated that the majority of these remittances are used for family needs, with a portion also being invested in other assets such as deposits.According to the World Bank 's ""Migration and Development Brief"" released in December, India has been the top recipient of remittances from its diaspora for more than 20 years, largely driven by the increase in IT professionals moving to North America and Europe since the 1990s.Also Read | What are inward remittances and will their uptrend continue? Explained ""Remittance flows to developing countries have surpassed the sum of foreign direct investment and official development assistance in recent years, and the gap is increasing,"" said Dilip Ratha, lead economist and lead author of the World Bank report.The World Bank Report predicts that due to the trajectory of weaker global economic activity, the growth of remittances to low-and-middle income countries is expected to soften further to 3.1% in 2024. This moderated forecast is driven by slowing economic growth and the prospect of weaker job markets in several high-income countries.","India tops the list of countries with highest remittances!

What is the dark web?

Malware risk on dark web

Allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG and UGC-NET exams have sparked nationwide protests and concerns. There are allegations of paper leak on the dark web before the exam.A Central Bureau of India (CBI) investigation reveals that the question paper for the University Grants Commission-National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET) exam was leaked 48 hours before the exam, reports NDTV. The UGC NET exam paper which matched the original, it says, was sold for Rs 6 lakh on the dark web. It was then circulated on Telegram by a group that sold it for Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000. The discovery led to the immediate cancellation of the exam by the education ministry.""The cancellation of UGC-NET was not a knee-jerk reaction. We got proof that the paper had leaked on darknet and was circulating on Telegram…"" Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said at a press conference last week.In this article, we will explore what is dark web and how it is used by cyber criminals for online crimeThe dark web is a hidden part of the internet that is not indexed by regular search engines. It can only be accessed through special browsers like Tor (The Onion Router). Conversations on the dark web are heavily encrypted and there are no traces of communication between the sender and the receiver. It provides high anonymity for website users.Dark web was originally developed for secure, anonymous communication, especially for government and military use. But in recent times, it has become synonymous with criminal activities like illegal weapons sale, drugs sale and more.Malware thrives fully on the dark web. It is actively sold on certain platforms, providing cybercriminals with tools for cyberattacks. On the other side, it lurks across dark web sites, ready to infect unsuspecting users, much like it does on the regular internet.Some of the malwares that dark web users can find themselves regularly exposed to are keyloggers, botnet malware, ransomware and phishing malware.","Allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG and UGC-NET exams have sparked nationwide protests and concerns.

Manta Ray: Google Maps ‘removes’ photo of this ‘top-secret US underwater drone’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-maps-removes-photo-of-this-top-secret-us-underwater-drone/articleshow/111291015.cms,"What is ‘Manta Ray’

Google has reportedly ‘edited’ or ‘removed’ a photo of a ‘top-secret’ vessel, nicknamed “Manta Ray”, after its picture went viral online. A report said that the underwater drone has been clearly visible, docked at Port Hueneme naval base in California.According to a report by The New York Post, a high-resolution satellite photo shows the distinctive, smooth hull of the submarine contrasting with surrounding vessels. After the image popped up online, Manta Ray ‘disappeared’ and was apparently replaced with boats.The report indicates the “Manta Ray” is an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a top-secret US submarine prototype weapon designed for extended, low-power operation at significant depths.‘Manta Ray’ is manufactured by Northrop Grumman as part of a US Navy project to develop long-range underwater weapons. The report said that it is an underwater drone that can hibernate on the seafloor for “very long periods” without need of it being refuelled.It uses “efficient, buoyancy-driven gliding to move through the water. Our successful, full-scale Manta Ray testing validates the vehicle’s readiness to advance toward real-world operations,” said Dr. Kyle Woerner, Manta Ray program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.“The craft is designed with several payload bays of multiple sizes and types to enable a wide variety of naval mission sets,” Woerner added.It has a modular design, which makes it easier to be disassembled and transported in shipping containers. Manta Ray has been tested by the US Navy off Southern California for over three months, the Telegraph reported.Defense analysts believe that the drone technology is aimed at countering Russian and Chinese submarine operations, the report noted.",'Manta Ray' is an underwater drone that can hibernate on the seafloor for ‘very long periods’ without need of it being refuelled.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"'Fired after complaining about poor repair work on Boeing 787 jets', claims whistleblower",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-richard-cuevas-another-whistleblower-who-warned-boeing-of-flaws-in-787-dreamliner/articleshow/111299686.cms,"Who is Richard Cuevas?

What issues did Cuevas observe in the Boeing?

What were the previous complaints?

What the company said?

Another whistleblower has come forward on Wednesday with allegations that certain components of Boeing 's 787 Dreamliner aircraft were constructed in an unsafe manner, potentially leading to ""devastating consequences.""Richard Cuevas , a mechanic employed by Strom, a former contractor, has filed complaints with two US agencies, claiming he faced retaliation after raising concerns about potential manufacturing issues on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.According to his attorneys at Katz Banks Kumin, Cuevas was terminated in March 2024 after he brought attention to manufacturing deviations in the forward pressure bulkhead, a crucial component for managing pressure during flights, as per CNN reports.Richard Cuevas is the latest in the list of whistleblowers who have come forward from Boeing's operations, further intensifying the scrutiny faced by the plane manufacturer, in an incident involving a 737 MAX aircraft operated by Alaska Airlines in January, after the plane was forced to make an emergency landing due to an inflight issue.Cuevas was employed by Strom, a contracting company that assigned him to work atSpirit AeroSystems , the manufacturer responsible for building fuselages for the Dreamliner.According to CNN, in October 2023, Cuevas submitted a complaint to Boeing, claiming that Spirit had implemented unapproved modifications to the dimensions of fastener holes located in the forward pressure bulkhead of 787 aircraft.The Boeing initiated an investigation into his concerns in October 2023, notifying Spirit management of the complaints. During this period, Cuevas says a colleague commented, ""we've got a snitch among us,"" and in March, Spirit abruptly terminated his employment.Katz Banks Kumin said, ""Our client witnessed critical issues with the forward pressure bulkhead assembly on multiple planes that deviated from Boeing's specifications.""""He recognized the substandard work and expressed concern about his safety concerns, but Spirit and Boeing failed to stop the faulty manufacturing processes. Mr. Cuevas was fired when his manager found out that an employee complained about these issues, and suspected that employee was Mr. Cuevas,"" he added.Cuevas reported that he observed gaps in the forward pressure bulkheads of two aircraft he helped construct, which could potentially lead to ""catastrophe.""Cuevas witnessed the improper drilling of holes into the forward pressure bulkheads of 787 planes at Spirit's facility in Wichita, Kansas, during 2023,"" which he believes could compromise power and air pressure on the planes, posing a serious safety risk to passengers.He filed a report with Boeing's ethics hotline, informing management that he believed Spirit was concealing the issues from Boeing.Cuevas witnessed these issues with three planes he worked on and believes that these problems may affect at least 10 to 12 planes, either in production or already delivered to Boeing.In response to the allegations, Boeing has said that they had previously investigated Cuevas' claims and determined that they did not present a safety issue.The bulkhead is a critical component of an airplane's structure, essential for maintaining the aircraft's integrity while in flight.A previous whistleblower, Sam Salehpour , a Boeing engineer, reported similar gaps in 787 and 777 aircraft. The FAA and Boeing suspended deliveries of new Dreamliners for nearly two years starting in 2021 to investigate the gaps.The same attorneys are also representing Sam who testified before the Senate in April regarding his concerns about the manufacturing practices of the 787 and the retaliation he faced for speaking out.More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has increased significantly since a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane in January just after takeoff, leaving a large hole in the side of the plane, CNN reported.Last week, a current Boeing employee claimed that the company attempted to conceal broken or out-of-specification 737 Max plane parts from regulators and lost track of them, fearing that they may have been installed on planes carrying passengers.The Boeing said, ""A subcontractor's employee previously reported concerns to us that we thoroughly investigated as we take seriously any safety-related matter. Engineering analysis determined that the issues raised did not present a safety concern and were addressed.""""We are reviewing the documents released today and will thoroughly investigate any new claim,""they added.company spokesperson Joe Buccino said, Spirit ""leadership is aware of the allegations and looking into the matter. We encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected.""Attorneys representing Cuevas submitted complaints to the Federal Aviation Administration and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration in a letter of submission, saying ""based on his direct observations of glaring safety issues, that Boeing's and Spirit's statements to the public and investors about the safety of 787 Dreamliners are fraudulent.""The FAA has initiated multiple investigations into Boeing, and the US Department of Justice has stated that it may file criminal charges against the company due to its ongoing quality and safety failures.""We strongly encourage anyone with safety concerns to report them and we thoroughly investigate every report,"" the FAA said.According to the FAA, it has received a total of 126 such reports in the current year, while only 11 were submitted last year.","Richard Cuevas, a mechanic, has filed complaints with two US agencies.

Two astronauts stuck on ISS as Boeing capsule faces technical woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/two-astronauts-stuck-on-iss-as-boeing-capsule-faces-technical-woes/articleshow/111299153.cms,"The current situation

If the unexpected happens

If Starliner cannot be used

WASHINGTON: Problems with Boeing's Starliner capsule, still docked at the International Space Station, have upended the original plans for its return of its two astronauts - Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore - to Earth, as last-minute fixes and tests draw out a mission crucial to the future of Boeing's space division. Nasa has rescheduled the planned return three times, and now has no date set for it. Since its June 5 lift-off, the capsule has had five helium leaks, five manoeuvring thrusters go dead and a propellant valve fail to close completely, prompting crew in space and managers in Houston to spend more time than expected pursuing fixes.Starliner can stay docked at the ISS for up to 45 days, according to Nasa's commercial crew manager Steve Stich. But if absolutely necessary, it could stay docked for up to 72 days, relying on various backup systems, according to a source. Internally at Nasa, Starliner's latest targeted return date is July 6, according to this source. Such a return date would mean that the mission, originally planned for eight days, instead would last a month.Starliner's expendable propulsion system is part of the craft's service module. The current problems centre on this system, which is needed to back the capsule away from the ISS and position it to dive through Earth's atmosphere. Many of Starliner's thrusters have overheated when fired, and the leaks of helium - used to pressurise the thrusters - appear to be connected to how frequently they are used. Stich said recent test-firings of the thrusters gave mission teams confidence in a safe return. The mission team in Houston, made up of Nasa and Boeing personnel, is scrutinising data on the propulsion issues and considering how to fix them, such as by updating software or changing how the hardware is used. Once Nasa officials give the team a go-ahead for a return, Starliner's thrusters would be used to undock the capsule from the ISS and begin a roughly six-hour journey home. This is Starliner's first mission to orbit carrying astronauts - the final test needed for Nasa to certify it as its second ride to ISS along with SpaceX's Crew Dragon.Even with the propulsion system issues, Nasa has said Starliner still would be capable of returning the astronauts to Earth if absolutely necessary - that is, if the capsule must serve as an escape pod from the ISS in an emergency or if any of Starliner's perishable items - such as solar panels - show signs of expiring earlier than planned.If Starliner is deemed incapable of safely returning Wilmore and Williams to Earth, one option would be sending them home aboard Crew Dragon, which ferried four astronauts to the ISS in March and is able to fit more people in an emergency. That scenario, considered unlikely, would be embarrassing for Boeing. The last time a Nasa astronaut needed an alternative ride home came in 2022, when Russia's Soyuz capsule sprang a coolant leak after delivering to the station two cosmonauts and US astronaut Frank Rubio. He used an empty Soyuz capsule that Russia launched as a rescue craft. His mission was extended from 6 months to 371 days - a record-breaking duration for an American in space.","Nasa has rescheduled the planned return three times, and now has no date set for it. Since its June 5 lift-off, the capsule has had five helium leaks, five manoeuvring thrusters go dead and a propellant valve fail to close completely.

However, the supreme court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked the necessary legal standing to sue the administration in federal court.The plaintiffs argued that the administration had violated the rights of social media users whose posts were removed by platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter (now called X). They claimed that the administration's actions amounted to coercion, a form of state action prohibited by the First Amendment.The Justice Department countered that government officials have long used their position to express views and inform the public on matters of concern. It also argued that private entities making decisions based on that information are not state actors unless threatened with adverse consequences.The supreme court's decision comes as part of a series of rulings concerning free speech rights in the digital age. In March, the justices decided that public officials can sometimes be sued under the First Amendment for blocking critics on social media. They also set a new standard for determining if public officials acted in a governmental capacity when blocking critics on social media.In the coming days, the supreme court is expected to rule on the legality of Republican-backed laws in Florida and Texas intended to restrain social media companies from curbing content that their platforms deem objectionable.","The justices, in a 6-3 ruling, overturned a lower court's 2023 decision that various federal officials likely violated the First Amendment of US Constitution.

Instead, a significant portion of tax revenues is earmarked for debt servicing, a trend expected to escalate in the upcoming fiscal year, as reported by Dawn.""The government would spend PKR 7.21 trillion on domestic debt servicing and an additional PKR 1.04 trillion on foreign debt servicing, taking the total to PKR 8.25 trillion,"" according to the budget document for FY2023-24.
