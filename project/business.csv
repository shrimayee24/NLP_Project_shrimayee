'What if China stops Brahmaputra water?': Himanta Biswa Sarma shuts down 'Pakistan's new scare narrative',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-if-china-stops-brahmaputra-water-himanta-biswa-sarma-shuts-down-pakistans-new-scare-narrative/articleshow/121584347.cms,"NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday hit back at Pakistan’s latest water-related scare narrative, calling it a “baseless attempt” to incite fear over a hypothetical situation involving the Brahmaputra River.Responding to a viral claim, “What if China stops the Brahmaputra’s water to India?”, Sarma issued a fact-driven rebuttal in a strongly worded post on X.His response came as India had suspended the Indus Waters Treaty in a diplomatic move following the Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Pahalgam.“After India decisively moved away from the outdated Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan is now spinning another manufactured threat,” Sarma wrote on X.“Let’s dismantle this myth, not with fear, but with facts and national clarity,” he added, emphasising that the Brahmaputra is an Indian river that gains strength downstream, not one diminished by upstream influence.Sarma highlighted that China contributes only around 30 to 35 per cent of the Brahmaputra’s flow, primarily from glacial melt and limited rainfall over the Tibetan plateau. In contrast, 65 to 70 per cent of the river’s volume is generated within India, thanks to monsoon rains and tributaries in the Northeast.Using hydrological data, the chief minister noted that while the river’s flow at the Indo-China border (Tuting) ranges between 2,000 and 3,000 cubic metres per second, it swells dramatically to 15,000–20,000 m³/s in Assam during monsoon season. This, he said, proves India’s dominant role in sustaining the river.“The Brahmaputra is not a river India depends on upstream. It is a rain-fed Indian river system, strengthened after entering Indian territory,” Sarma said.He further argued that in the unlikely event China did attempt to reduce the river’s flow, it could even benefit India by reducing the annual floods in Assam that displace hundreds of thousands.Sarma also pointed out that China has never officially threatened to weaponise the Brahmaputra and dismissed such speculation as fear-mongering.Taking a direct swipe at Pakistan, he said that the country, which has long relied on the Indus Waters Treaty, is now “panicking” as India asserts its water sovereignty.“Brahmaputra is not controlled by a single source. It is powered by our geography, our monsoon, and our civilisational resilience,” he said.The Brahmaputra is a trans-boundary river that originates from the Mansarovar region near Mount Kailash in southwestern China. It flows through Tibet, enters India in Arunachal Pradesh, and continues through Assam before making its way into Bangladesh, where it eventually empties into the Bay of Bengal.",Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma hit back at Pakistan’s latest water- related scare narrative. He called it a “baseless attempt’ to incite fear over a hypothetical situation involving the Brahmaputra River.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121584794,imgsize-1023533,width-400,resizemode-4/121584794.jpg"
SC refuses to stay demolition drive in Okhla encroachments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-refuses-to-stay-demolition-drive-in-okhla-encroachments/articleshow/121584770.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday rejected pleas of some residents of Muradi Road, Batla House, Jamia Nagar in Delhi to stop the impending demolition drive against encroachments and illegal constructions on land which were acquired by Delhi Development Authority more than 43 years ago.As many as 40 residents of the unauthorised colony through senior advocate Sanjay Hegde pleaded before a partial working day bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and A G Masih for a stay on the impending demolition drive citing the notices pasted in public places and unauthorised constructions asking the residents to vacate the place in 15 days.Senior advocates Guru Krishna Kumar and A D N Rao pointed out that the demolition drive is being carried out based on the SC’s May 7 order, which noticed that part of the unauthorised colony falls under Pm-UDAY Scheme under NCT Delhi (Recognition of Property Rights to Residents in Unauthorised Colonies) Regulations, 2019.The bench had directed the DDA “to take action of demolition in accordance with law in respect of the unauthorised structures of area of 2 bigha 10 biswas. The DDA shall file a compliance affidavit within a period of three months from today. We make it clear that when we say due process of law before demolishing any structure at least 15 days’ notice shall be served upon the concerned persons.”Justices Karol and Masih, who in principle do not want to dismiss any petition during the partial working day period, said the petition by residents of unauthorised colonies in Batla House area will be heard in July.Hegde said he apprehended that the authorities would act in full swing during the interregnum and pleaded for stay. But the bench refused.The petitioner said the colony comprises a diverse group of individuals, including retired police personnel, govt employees serving in various departments and public offices as well as women, children and senior citizens. Any banket order for demolition would affect their fundamental right to live and right to shelter.The DDA had issued notices on May 26 and 27 to many residents of unauthorised colonies in the Batla House area to vacate the land in question. “Several affected properties, including those situated at Muradi Road, Batla House, are presently inhabited by families who have resided in the locality for decades, and who possess documentary proof of possession, such as electricity bills, house tax receipts, water bills, General Power of Attorney (GPA) documents, and sanctioned building plans. Yet, in spite of their legitimate claims, these residents have been denied an opportunity to be heard, and are now at imminent risk of displacement,” the petitioners claimed.","The Supreme Court rejected pleas of some residents of Muradi Road, Batla House, Jamia Nagar in Delhi to stop the impending demolition drive.

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India tells TOI, “Changes in the tax law in the past year and additional disclosure as well as other updates to the tax return form for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 have necessitated additional time for updating the technology for the tax department. This will entail revising the tax filing utility on the income tax portal as well. Hence, extending the deadline to file the income tax returns for FY 24-25 by almost one and a half months from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 is in line with the expectations. This extension aims to enhance the taxpayer experience by providing requisite time to file returns once the TDS credits are appropriately reflecting in taxpayers Form 26AS and AIS/ TIS following the submission of TDS statements by employers/ deductors of TDS due by May 31, 2025.“Nonetheless, it is in the taxpayers' best interest to file their returns as soon as the filing utility is made available to avoid additional interest costs where tax payments are due or to allow department time to process the returns at the earliest where refunds are due,” she adds.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025. This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121438242,imgsize-1565741,width-400,resizemode-4/121438242.jpg"

While Nifty50 went below 24,550 intraday, BSE Sensex tanked over 750 points. Nifty50 ended the day at 24,716.60, down 34 points or 0.14%. BSE Sensex closed at 81,373.75, down 77 points or 0.095%.Market experts anticipate continued positive momentum through June, supported by robust Q4 GDP data, potential RBI rate reductions and steady institutional capital flows.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The market structure favours continuation of the ongoing consolidation phase. There are global headwinds like renewed tariff concerns that will restrain a breakout rally. At the same time there are domestic tailwinds that will support the market at lower levels. President Trump’s 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium is a clear message that the tariff and trade scenario will continue to be uncertain and turbulent. This headwind will impact markets. On the domestic front the tailwinds are getting stronger with the latest Q4 GDP growth data coming at 7.4%, which is much better-than-expected.”“Trends in consumption expenditure and capital expenditure are promising. This along with low inflation and the expected continuation of the rate cutting policy provide the perfect setting for sustained economic growth in FY26. The only challenge is the tepid earnings growth. If leading indicators suggest a recovery in earnings growth there is a high probability of the market breaking out of the present range and moving higher.

Gold price prediction today: Investors face uncertainty regarding their gold investment decisions due to multiple factors affecting market sentiment. The ongoing geopolitical conflicts, coupled with evolving US-China trade negotiations, have created ambiguity in the precious metals market. What is the gold rate prediction for this week and what should investors do?Gold prices slipped from a two-week high after US President Donald Trump postponed the implementation of 50% tariffs on EU imports to July 9, easing immediate trade tensions and reducing safe-haven demand. This delay came after the EU requested more time for negotiations, leading to a temporary pullback in bullion prices.However, geopolitical risks continued to support underlying demand, with Russia launching the largest aerial assault of the war on Ukraine and Israel intensifying military strikes in Gaza.Meanwhile, gold remained under pressure from a stronger US dollar, as the dollar index hovered near the 100 mark amid rising US bond yields and mixed economic data.A US trade court initially blocked Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, only for a federal appeals court to reinstate them a day later, injecting uncertainty into markets.On the economic front, US consumer confidence came in stronger than expected at just under 100, compared to a forecast of 87.1, while core durable goods orders rose 0.2% against expectations of a 0.1% decline.However, preliminary US GDP remained in negative territory, reinforcing concerns about slowing growth. The April PCE Price Index rose 2.1% year-on-year, slightly below the 2.2% estimate, suggesting softening inflation pressures. Weekly jobless claims exceeded expectations, adding to mixed economic signals.Minutes from the Fed’s May meeting revealed growing concern about the dual risk of rising inflation and unemployment, with policymakers indicating that rate cuts remain possible later this year but are not imminent. Geo-political tensions are once again on the rise and comments from President Trump’s administration on EU and China are also keeping market participants on edge.Focus this week will be on US Jobs market data, manufacturing and Services PMI from major economies and Governor Powell’s speech.

For persons aged five years and above, the national literacy rate was 79.7%. The disaggregated literacy data across all states and Union Territories was based on nationally representative sampling.The PLFS captures detailed literacy data across age groups (5+ and 7+), gender, and rural-urban categories for all states and Union Territories. For persons aged seven and above, male literacy at the national level was 87.2%, while female literacy stood at 74.6%. For the 5+ age group, male literacy was 85.6% and female literacy was 73.7%.States with the lowest literacy rates in the age 7+ category were Bihar (74.3%), Madhya Pradesh (75.2%), and Rajasthan (75.8%). In the 5+ age group, Bihar again ranked lowest at 73.2%, followed by Madhya Pradesh (73.7%) and Rajasthan (74.9%).Urban India continues to report higher literacy levels than rural areas. The national urban literacy rate was 88.9% for persons aged seven years and above, compared to 77.5% in rural areas. In states like Madhya Pradesh, the rural literacy rate was 71.6%, while the urban literacy rate stood at 85.7%, marking a gap of over 14 percentage points. Bihar reported a rural literacy rate of 72.1% and urban rate of 83.2%. Rajasthan showed a rural literacy rate of 72.5% and an urban literacy rate of 84.7%. These trends reflect similar urban-rural gaps across northern and central states.The gender gap in literacy remains significant. Nationally, the gap for persons aged seven and above was 12.6 percentage points. Rajasthan had the highest gap at 20.1%, with male literacy at 85.9% and female literacy at 65.8%. In Bihar, the gap was 16.2% (males: 82.3%, females: 66.1%), while in Madhya Pradesh, the difference was 16.1% (males: 83.1%, females: 67.0%).In rural areas, gender gaps tend to be wider. Rural Rajasthan had male literacy at 83.6% and female literacy at 61.8%. Rural Bihar reported 81.5% for males and 65% for females. Rural Madhya Pradesh recorded 80% literacy for males and 62.6% for females. In contrast, the gender gap in better-performing states was smaller. In Mizoram, male and female literacy rates were 99.2% and 97%, respectively. In Kerala, the rates were 96.7% for males and 94% for females.The PLFS 2023-24 highlights that while overall literacy has improved, regional, gender, and rural-urban disparities remain substantial.

The reason: India has so far not acceded to Dubai’s request for increasing the long-exhausted bilaterals or flying rights. As a result, airlines of both India and Dubai are operating the maximum possible flights under the current air service agreement (ASA), with no room to add services till the bilaterals are revised.“We’ve been stuck with 65,000 seats in each direction (Dubai-India and vice-versa) for just over 11 years now (during which period the demand for travel has grown exponentially). For every seat we sell, there are probably 10 takers. So I don’t see getting impacted by IndiGo and Air India expansion plans. In fact, there probably be a major relief valve for the pent up demand that has been in India for decades. Frankly, good luck to AI and IndiGo with getting airplanes at the pace they need,” Emirates Airlines president Tim Clark said Sunday in Delhi, where he is among the global aviation leaders attending the IATA AGM.Stressing the need for more bilaterals, he said: “Fifteen years ago, the population to Dubai was about 25 lakh. This is over 80 lakh. Dubai is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and 40% of the ethnic mix is of Indian origin. If you look at the way the Indian community has moved to and from Dubai over the last 10 or 11 years, you can see the scale of what is not happening by not giving seats to Emirates or wherever else it may be. The Indian government has a policy at the moment of restricting capacity of foreign carriers into India, and they have their own reasons for that.”Clark said he hopes “this will change when (India) realises the significance, the criticality of air transport as a wealth multiplier for their own economy. After all, it's been a it's been a catalyst for so many economies in the last 20-30 years,” he said.India is planning to have aviation hubs at its airports like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. “You have to have open access. We (Dubai) have got 80 lakh and we can make a hub out of it. So you have every opportunity on the planet to make a hub and make it very good with your 1.4 billion population. But if you have these sorts of restrictive practices (bilaterals), it doesn't make much sense when you look at the other aspects of Indian economy which are expanding,” he said.He said since the existing bilaterals have been exhausted, there is no possibility of Emirates starting flights to the upcoming airports in India like Navi Mumbai and Greater Noida.",Emirates does not see the huge transit business the mega carrier gets at its Dubai hub from flights to and from India getting impacted by the expansion of Air India.

India Hosts G20, Pakistan Hosts Top 20 Terrorists? Priyanka Chaturvedi Blasts Islamabad in UK

For the first time in 6 years, PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to be a part of the G7 summit that is being hosted this year by Canada June15-17. There’s no official invitation yet from Canada for the meeting in Alberta but Modi in all likelihood would not have travelled to the North American country in any case, especially when India still isn’t sure the new government in Ottawa will be more receptive to its concerns about the activities of Khalistan separatists.A Canadian G7 spokesperson didn’t confirm to TOI late on Sunday if Modi was going to be invited.Any eleventh-hour invitation is unlikely to be considered by India because of logistical constraints, likely efforts by the separatists to disrupt the visit and the strained bilateral ties that both Modi and his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney have committed to improve. A bilateral meeting on the margins could have provided an opportunity for the leaders to jointly reaffirm their commitment to rebuilding ties.Canada hasn’t officially announced the names of the guest leaders for the summit, which will see the heads of government of major world economies in attendance, but reports in the Canadian media say Ottawa has invited the leaders of Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Ukraine and Brazil. This will be the first time that he won’t be at the meeting of the economically most advanced group of nations since France invited him for the summit in 2019.His presence at the summit of what is also an informal grouping of like-minded democracies has been seen as a sign of India’s growing role in shaping up the global agenda and addressing transnational issues.Last week, Sikh separatists urged the Carney government now not to ask the Indian Prime Minister, bringing up India’s alleged loss of cooperation within the investigation into the killing of separatist chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had accused the Indian government of involvement in Nijjar’s homicide but did no longer publicly offer assisting evidence—an allegation India has always denied. The ensuing diplomatic fallout brought about both nations expelling diplomats, mentioning antagonistic activities.Prime Minister Carney has but to remark directly on the Nijjar case. However, even as outlining his plans to use change as a means to reset ties, he asserted that Canada isn't responsible for the current strain in its dating with India. In response, India has expressed hope that Carney will take a more measured approach than his predecessor. New Delhi has indicated its willingness to work with Ottawa, provided the relationship is grounded in mutual accept as true with and sensitivity. India has additionally referred to as on Canada to ensure robust security for its diplomats and take firm movement in opposition to extremists and separatist elements undertaking anti-India sports.","Canada hasn’t officially announced the names of the guest leaders for the summit, which will see the heads of government of major world economies in attendance.

We had little time to scrutinise the applications and identify the ineligible ones. At that time, elections were supposed to be announced in two to three months,” news agency PTI reported Pawar as saying.The Ladki Bahin scheme, launched in August 2024, offers Rs 1,500 per month to eligible women aged 21 to 65 years with an annual income below Rs 2.5 lakh. Though it was designed to empower poor women, scrutiny revealed thousands of ineligible recipients, including over 2,200 government employees.Pawar, who also heads the state’s finance department, clarified that the aid already deposited will not be withdrawn. “When the scheme was unveiled, the government had appealed that only eligible women apply but that didn't happen. A scrutiny is being conducted. Only the needy women will get the monthly payout,” he said.Also read: No legal action against ineligible Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin scheme beneficiaries, says Ajit Pawar His admission drew strong reactions from the opposition. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut demanded Pawar’s resignation, accusing him of enabling a misuse of public funds to gain electoral advantage. Raut said the finance department had presided over a “loot of government money for the sake of votes”.Earlier, Maharashtra minister Aditi Tatkare confirmed the government had disqualified 2,289 ineligible government employees after examining nearly two lakh applications. In a recent post on X, she assured the public that such scrutiny would continue regularly. “After realising this, such beneficiaries are not being given the benefit of the scheme,” she wrote.The Ladki Bahin scheme was credited with boosting the Mahayuti alliance’s performance in the November 2024 assembly elections. However, it has also led to budgetary strain. Social Justice Minister Sanjay Shirsat conceded that the government was under pressure, saying, “It is a reality that the monthly amount of Rs 1,500 cannot be raised to Rs 2,100.” He added that the scheme would continue even if it required the state to borrow funds.A;so read: Raut says CM, dy CMs indifferent to people’s issues in the state Shirsat also criticised the finance department for diverting funds from his ministry without notice. In March, he alleged that Rs 7,000 crore had been slashed from the Social Justice Department’s budget, and on Monday, he called for a law to protect such departments from arbitrary cuts.According to official guidelines, beneficiaries must meet income and residency criteria and provide Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. Newly married women can present a marriage certificate if their name does not appear on a ration card. While the scheme aims to support women’s economic independence, the government now faces growing scrutiny over its execution.","Mahar Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar says the state government made a ""mistake"" in extending financial benefits to all applicants of the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana without sufficient scrutiny.

MUMBAI: Rajit Gupta of Kota emerged at the top of the JEE Advanced 2025 rank list, securing 332 out of 360 marks. Gupta, whose father himself ranked 48th in Rajasthan's Pre Engineering Test of 1994, will join IIT Bombay 's computer science department.Nipping at Gupta's heels, Saksham Jindal from Hisar in Haryana, the son of doctor parents, matched his score but fell just short on tie-breaking metrics - based on higher positive marks. Gupta got 335 and Jindal got 333. Majid Husain stood third with 330. This year the list saw more ties - ranks 6 and 7 both scored 321, and 8 and 9 shared a score of 319 - making the race not just close, but highly competitive.The coaching hub of Kota, often in the news for negative reasons, had cause to celebrate Monday as an unprecedented 42 from the city ranked in the top 100 - its best showing since the exam's current format was adopted in 2013.Devdutta Majhi from West Bengal, who gave up her violin during her JEE Advanced preparation, emerged as the top-ranking female candidate in the country. With an All-India Rank of 16 and a score of 312, her preparation was largely self-led, with some mock tests and doubt-solving sessions. She also turned to her mother to clear her doubts. In Aug, she will join the Indian Institute of Science.Of the 1.8 lakh candidates who sat through both the papers on May 18, only 54,378 made it past the finish line. Among them, 9,404 are women.

With just 7 marks needed per subject-physics, chemistry and math-the subject-wise cutoff also reduced, down from 10 a year ago.Across social categories, the dip was uniform. OBC and Economically Weaker Sections candidates needed 66 marks (18.5%), while SC/ST candidates qualified at 37 marks-10.28% - with a subject-wise minimum of 3.While students from the IIT Bombay zone dominated the upper echelons of the merit list, it was the IIT Hyderabad zone - encompassing the southern states - that sent the largest cohort across the qualifying line. As many as 13,000 candidates from this zone made the cut. Close on its heels was the IIT Delhi zone, with 11,370 qualifiers, followed by the IIT Bombay zone, contributing 11,226 aspirants to the pool of those eligible for counselling.Analysis showed that the top 10 ranks closed at 317 this year, down from 329 in 2024. Sreedhar Babu, a math mentor and IIT Bombay alumnus, said, ""The paper was long. Some students who followed the linear order - chemistry, then physics, then math - ended up losing steam midway.""

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu, Tripura and Delhi have emerged as top performers in tackling the challenge of adult literacy and education. The 2024-25 Foundational Literacy and Numeracy Assessment Test (FLNAT), conducted under ULLAS - Nav Bharat Saaksharta Karyakram, has thrown up encouraging results among states that submitted the certification data in time.Data compiled by the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), exclusively accessed by TOI, showed that the top performers ranged in the late 90s in terms of success percentages, while the relative laggards - Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh - were over 85%.The FLNAT programme was rolled out in phases between July 2024 and March 2025, with over 1.77 crore adult learners tested in all.By May 2025, only 34.3 lakh were officially certified, reflecting a national average of about 19.4%. However, this figure is skewed due to pending certification data from the March 2025 phase, which included over 49 lakh participants whose results were still being processed.Under FLNAT, which is a nationwide assessment of foundational literacy and numeracy skills, ""states/UTs identify illiterate populations, educate them, and then conduct a test to reveal outcomes,"" said a senior official of ministry of education (MoE).TN recorded a flawless performance, certifying all 5,09,694 learners who appeared in FLNAT - a 100% success rate. ""This is attributed to strong administrative oversight, pre-exam preparation, and local mobilisation through community volunteers and panchayat support,"" the official said. Tripura was close behind, certifying 13,909 of 14,179 learners, with a success rate of 98.1%. Delhi also performed exceptionally, certifying 7,901 of 7,959 candidates, with a 99.3% success rate.On the other hand, states like Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh posted lower certification rates despite moderate participation. Uttarakhand certified 8,109 of 9,459 learners (85.7%); Gujarat, 1,853 of 2,128 (87.1%); and Himachal Pradesh, 14,500 of 15,351 candidates (88.3%). ""While these states didn't perform poorly in absolute terms, their outcomes were among the lowest of those with fully declared results,"" said a senior official of department of school education and literacy.One encouraging finding is the high participation of women. In Madhya Pradesh, more women appeared in FLNAT than men - 8.52 lakh versus 8.11 lakh men. Similar trends were seen in Jharkhand and Odisha. This indicates a growing awareness and desire for literacy among adult women, who increasingly see education as a means of empowerment and dignity.","The FLNAT programme was rolled out in phases between July 2024 and March 2025, with over 1.77 crore adult learners tested in all.

NEW DELHI: India's flyer footfall is projected to more than double from the current 24 crore to almost 50 crore annually by 2030, which is more than the population of many countries, PM Narendra Modi said Monday while showcasing the country's aviation success story at the International Air Transport Association's 81st AGM here.Modi also said India's aviation ambitions included commercial space flights and integrating interplanetary journeys into civil aviation. While these will take time, the country is geared to make this a reality through its prowess in transformation and innovation, he said.PM Modi pointed out that India already had the most inclusive workforce in aviation with 15% of pilots being women, three times the global average of 5%. By 2047, the number of airports will expand to 350 - there are 162 currently in operation - while cargo is expected to increase from 3.5 to 10 million metric tonnes by the end of this decade.Another potential feather in the aviation cap is India becoming a $4 billion maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) hub by 2030, PM Modi said.""India should not be viewed merely as an aviation market, but as a value-chain leader.From design to delivery, India is becoming an integral part of the global aviation supply chain,"" Modi said, asking the aviation ecosystem to ""not just make in India but also design in India"".""We are working on a futuristic roadmap to maximise India's potential. In 2014, the country had 74 operational airports, which have now expanded to 162 and will increase to 350 in 2047. We are now the third largest aviation market globally.

This is attributed to 100% FDI under the automatic route, reduced GST and rationalised taxation. ""India is more confident than ever before,"" Modi said, spotlighting ""big changes"" the country had seen since the time last IATA AGM was held. ""Today, India is emerging as a global leader in space-aviation convergence,"" he said.""There are three foundational pillars driving India's aviation sector: A vast market - not merely a collection of consumers but a reflection of India's aspirational society. A strong demographic and talent pool where young innovators are pioneering breakthroughs in AI, robotics, and clean energy. And finally, an open and supportive policy ecosystem which will take aviation to unprecedented heights,"" the PM said.The seamless Digi Yatra app for paperless domestic travel came in for special praise, with Modi urging other countries to adopt the same. ""Digi Yatra stands as a secure and smart solution, serving as a model of inspiration for the Global South.""He also spoke about the work being done in the fields of sustainable aviation fuels, green technologies and reducing carbon footprint.""The new Indian Aircraft Act aligns aviation laws with global best practices, ensuring a streamlined regulatory framework, ease of compliance and a simplified tax structure which presents a significant investment opportunity for major international aviation companies,"" he said.","India's flyer footfall is projected to more than double from the current 24 crore to almost 50 crore annually by 2030.

Adivasis say Project Tiger and tourism are displacing them from their ancestral land,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/adivasis-say-project-tiger-and-tourism-are-displacing-them-from-their-ancestral-land/articleshow/121578752.cms,"TOI correspondent from London: Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects whilst the laws to protect them are being diluted and not implemented properly, Adivasis told a global press briefing on Monday.“They say India has got freedom. But I think Adivasi people have not yet got freedom,” J C Shivamma, from the Jenu Kuruba tribe, said at the online event organised by Community Network Against Protected Areas.She is among the 52 households who reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.“Some of our family members died when in the plantations, but our sacred deities, our graveyard, everything that concerns us, is still in the village, so we used to go back to bury our people in our ancestral land, but it was always a fight with the forest department toconduct rituals. We consider our ancestors to be on the lands, they become deities and this way we were tortured. If we have to die, we will die on our ancestral land,” she said.Shivu JA recalled how their houses were burnt and elephants brought to destroy their fields when they were evicted from Karadikallu. “This land is ours. It's not any tiger project or scheme of the govt for tiger conservation,” he said.“Our elders are very happy now.We are having our food, we are going for honey collection. We have our own water resource. We sit together in the evening, and they are teaching us songs. All these songs and lessons were silenced for 40 years.""“The forest department keeps saying that only after your rights are recognised, you can live on this land. We already have these rights,” he said.The Jenu Kurubas are filing a case against the Forest Department under the SC/ST Atrocities Act for withholding their rights and filing an appeal against 39 rejected forest rights claims.“Why are their rights not being recognised despite the notification of central legislation such as the Forest Rights Act 2006,” asked scholar Nitin Rai.“People across the country in different states are fighting the same battles. It is important to find a way to raise a collective voice for what is happening all over,” said lawyer Lara Jesani.","Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects. 52 households reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.

Ready to contest Bihar assembly polls if it helps my party improve strike rate: Chirag Paswan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ready-to-contest-bihar-assembly-polls-if-it-helps-my-party-improve-strike-rate-chirag-paswan/articleshow/121578315.cms,"NEW DELHI: In what can further stir the already roiled Bihar political waters, LJP leader, Union minister Chirag Paswan, has said that he was open to contesting the forthcoming assembly polls if that helps his party and improves its ""strike rate"".“The BJP has tried this strategy many times by fielding their MPs in the assembly elections and have got its benefit. If my candidature in the assembly polls strengthens my party’s position and my strike rate increases — we had a 100% strike rate in the Lok Sabha elections, I would like my strike rate to be good in the seats where my party and the alliance will be contesting,” Paswan said in a video clip that he reposted on his X handle.The Union minister said that he did not see himself being confined to central politics for long, adding that his desire to improve conditions in Bihar and people there was the sole reason why he joined politics. “I have my own vision of Bihar first, Bihari first. In such a situation, I want my state to stand at par with developed states. After becoming an MP for the third time, I realised that it may not be possible (to work for Bihar) by staying in Delhi,” he said.Chiarag also said that he had shared his views before party leaders that he wanted to go back to Bihar “quickly”. He added that if the party’s evaluation finds it will benefit from his contesting in the polls, he would contest in the assembly election.Chirag, who has successfully inherited the reins of the LJP fending off a strong claim by his uncle, is seen as a potential swing factor in Bihar politics because of his hold over fellow Paswans who account for nearly 4.5% of the population. He has never been loath to leverage this to drive hard bargains and seek to force reluctant partners to acquiesce in his demands.Chief minister Nitish Kumar and his JD(U) paid a stiff cost for underestimating his ‘damage potential’ in 2020 as Chirag, angered by the latter's dismissal of his claim for at least 30 of the 240 seats, focused his energy on hurting Kumar's candidates. The revenge strike saw Nitish's tally dipping to 42.BJP helped them patch up and recently Chirag's statement that there was no vacancy for the job of CM was seen as accommodative of JD(U)'s insistence that their leader was deserving of one more term and BJP's desire to spare the CM discomfiture.Chirag repeated this on Monday in response to a question from a reporter.“There is no vacancy for the post of Bihar CM. Nitish Kumar will be on the post after the polls.” However, the tone of the statement and the build up for it, with his brother-in-law, LS member Arun Bharti telling media Chirag could consider an assembly run, suggest that he is not reconciled to being the perpetual fourth fiddle after BJP, RJD and JDU and could he positioning himself for a hard stand in seat-sharing talks among NDA partners, as well for the openings which may come up post -assembly elections.","LJP leader Chirag Paswan has said that he was open to contesting the forthcoming assembly polls if that helps his party and improves its ""strike rate"" He said he did not see himself being confined to central politics for long, adding that his desire to improve conditions in Bihar was the sole reason why he joined politics.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121578286,imgsize-64944,width-400,resizemode-4/121578286.jpg"

India-US trade deal talks

US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said that a trade deal between New Delhi and Washington could be finalised soon.Addressing the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum in Washington, Lutnick said that US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's relationship is very strong and very positive, and so it gives an easy path to do the trade negotiations.He said, ""Earlier countries get a better deal. That's the way it is. So those who come in, you know, July 4th to July 9th, there's just going to be a pile. I think India is trying hard to be one of the earlier countries, which I appreciate. But these, these kind of deals used to take two or three years, and we're trying to get them done in a month, which is, you know, just not the ordinary DNA of trading relationships between countries. But what I hope to achieve is we would like market access, we would like our businesses to have reasonable access to the markets of India.""""I think if you have the right person on the other side, and what happens is, if they put a normal trade minister, it's an endless set of talking and no outcome, because they're used to saying, this kind of deal will take three years, let's get. We'll get this done in two years. And that's not really fun for me.So the idea is when they put the right person and India put the right person on the other side of the table, and we've managed, I think, to be in a very, very good place. And you should expect a deal between the United States and India in the not too distant future, because I think we found a place that really works for both countries,"" he added.He also said that the president is willing to call out things straight away, meaning India is very protectionist with tariffs.At the summit, the US commerce secretary said that the President thinks America first, but Trump does not think America only or America exclusively.""First, he's got to take care of home, so we're big and strong. But then he's going to take care of his allies. He's going to make sure he takes care of India, who he deeply, deeply admires and respects, and we are going to have a great, great relationship together,"" he said.In the ongoing trade negotiations, India seeks complete relief from the 26 per cent reciprocal duty imposed on its domestic products.India and the US have established a target to finalise the initial phase of the suggested BTA before autumn (September-October) this year.India seeks to negotiate duty reductions in the proposed agreement with America, focusing on sectors that employ a significant workforce, including textiles, gems and jewellery, leather products, garments, plastics, chemicals, shrimp, oil seeds, chemicals, grapes and bananas.The United States, in return, is requesting tariff reductions across various sectors, including industrial products, automobiles (particularly electric vehicles), wines, petrochemical items, dairy products and agricultural goods such as apples, tree nuts and GM (genetically modified) crops.India maintains strict regulatory standards regarding GM crop imports from the US, making their entry unfeasible. However, New Delhi remains receptive to importing non-GM products, including Alpha alpha hay, which serves as cattle feed.The United States maintained its position as India's main trading partner for the fourth straight year in 2024-25, with two-way trade reaching $131.84 billion. The US constitutes approximately 18 per cent of India's overall goods exports, 6.22 per cent in imports, and 10.73 per cent of the nation's total merchandise trade.","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said that a trade deal between New Delhi and Washington could be finalised soon.

US-China tech tensions 'escalate'



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly praised President Donald Trump while sharply criticising the Biden administration ’s export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, calling the policy 'a failure' that cost US companies billions. Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang blasts Biden-era AI chip export policy.

But today, General Anil Chauhan, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), has confirmed that Rafale aircraft were brought down.""He also cited Air Marshal Bharti, Director General Air Operations, who in the DGMO briefing had said: ""Losses are normal in combat. The objectives of the mission have been achieved and all pilots have come home."" Uttam emphasised that while the pilots returned safely, ""the aircraft have not returned to their bases,"" highlighting the need for transparency.He criticised the BJP govt for initially denying these losses and launching a campaign against Rahul Gandhi. ""Now that the CDS himself has spoken, the govt should stop the denials. We are proud of our armed forces, but transparency strengthens trust and helps us learn from every operation.How did the US President announce the ceasefire before the DGMOs of India and Pakistan? The govt of India has never clearly explained how this happened. ""He stressed the need for a serious reassessment of India's defence technology, pointing out that most of the firing during the four-day operation happened from within each country's international borders. ""Yet, we lost fighter aircraft. This requires a thorough review of our technological capabilities,"" he said. The BJP-led govt at the centre should act urgently on the concerns raised by the air force chief about delays in fighter aircraft supply, talent shortages, and the gap between sanctioned and operational squadrons in the armed forces.India's operational fighter squadrons were below the sanctioned strength of 42 squadrons. All three armed forces are short of manpower by over 10 percent. Given the live threats on both our borders (China and Pakistan), we should be going beyond the sanctioned strength. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) did not deliver the Tejas Mark-1A fighter jets on time as said by the Air Chief. This can prove to be a serious problem. The entire country and the govt of India must wake up to the reality to strengthen our armed forces considerably,"" Uttam said.Quoting the Air Chief Marshal directly, Uttam said: ""India has fallen behind China in defence technology and production although our training standards remain superior. This is of serious concern and urgent necessary corrective steps should be taken. The best minds are not joining the service in sufficient numbers, especially in operational and R&D wings. The govt should attract top talent.""Uttam reaffirmed his pride in the Indian armed forces while urging the govt to ensure they are equipped, supported, and respected with honesty and transparency.

The planned bankruptcy declaration for one of Microsoft's Russian units was reportedly published via a note on Fedresurs, Russia's official online registry for legally significant corporate information. However, the tech giant has yet to share a comment regarding the potential bankruptcy of its Russian subsidiary or President Putin's remarks. Microsoft maintained critical services in Russia following Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but in June 2022 announced a major reduction of its operations there due to shifts in the economic outlook and their effects on its business.According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the company had already pulled RT’s mobile apps from the Windows App Store and prohibited ads on Russian state–sponsored media shortly after the invasion. A recent notice posted on Fedresurs indicated that Microsoft Rus LLC plans to file for bankruptcy, the report claimed.According to the Russian news agency TASS, Microsoft also operates three additional Russian entities in the country, which are: Microsoft Development Centre Rus, Microsoft Mobile Rus, and Microsoft Payments Rus. However, the report doesn’t mention the status of these subsidiaries.In 2022, Alphabet-owned Google’s Russian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy after Russian authorities seized its bank account, rendering operations, such as paying local employees, suppliers, and vendors, impossible.","A Russian subsidiary of Microsoft is planning to file for bankruptcy, a report claims.

"Microsoft cuts hundreds more jobs weeks after 6,000 layoffs: These employees likely to be impacted",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-cuts-hundreds-more-jobs-weeks-after-6000-layoffs-these-employees-likely-to-be-impacted/articleshow/121586352.cms,"Previous cuts targeted coders and managers

Microsoft eliminated over 300 additional jobs on Monday, just weeks after announcing its largest workforce reduction in years, according to a Washington state notice reviewed by Bloomberg. While the company has not disclosed which specific roles were targeted in the latest round, the cuts come as the Redmond giant continues restructuring efforts while investing billions in artificial intelligence infrastructure.The Monday layoffs add to the 6,000 positions Microsoft cut last month, representing the company's second-largest workforce reduction since eliminating 10,000 roles in 2023.CEO Satya Nadella recently addressed the earlier cuts at an internal town hall, calling them a ""realignment"" rather than performance-based decisions. ""This was not about people failing. It was about repositioning for what comes next,"" Nadella explained, referring to the company's AI transformation.While it's not clear what departments and roles have been impacted in Monday's layoffs, based on previous layoff patterns at Microsoft, software engineers and project managers are likely to be most affected by the latest cuts.Last month's 6,000-person reduction hit software engineers hardest, with over 40% of eliminated Washington state positions belonging to coding professionals. Project management roles were also significantly impacted, accounting for nearly 30% of cuts despite Microsoft's claims of ""reducing management layers.""The layoffs coincide with Microsoft's revelation that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some company projects, according to CEO Satya Nadella. The company has allocated approximately $80 billion for data center spending this fiscal year as part of its AI infrastructure push.Microsoft's workforce restructuring mirrors industry-wide efficiency initiatives. Salesforce recently announced reduced engineering hiring due to AI usage, while the company joins Amazon and Google in implementing flatter organizational structures with higher engineering ratios.As of June 2024, Microsoft employed about 228,000 full-time workers, with 55% based in the United States. The company has introduced new performance management systems, including a two-year rehire ban for performance-related departures and voluntary separation agreements offering 16 weeks of severance pay.","Microsoft eliminated over 300 jobs on Monday, according to a Washington state notice.

And this strategy is working well now. With a lot of uncertainty in geopolitics, tariffs and trade the market will continue to remain volatile. Therefore, investors may persist with the strategy of buying on dips.“The concern in the market now is the high valuation, particularly in the broader market.

Disney to lay off hundreds across entertainment divisions amid shift to streaming,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/disney-to-lay-off-hundreds-across-entertainment-divisions-amid-shift-to-streaming/articleshow/121586176.cms,"The Walt Disney Company is cutting several hundred jobs across its film and television divisions, a Disney spokesperson confirmed to USA TODAY. The layoffs, which formally took effect on Monday, June 2, impact departments involved in marketing, publicity, casting, development, and parts of corporate finance. No entire teams are being dissolved, the company said.A Disney representative attributed the decision to the “rapid pace” of industry transformation and the company’s push to “operate more efficiently.”This move is the latest in a series of cost-cutting measures implemented since CEO Bob Iger returned to helm the company in 2022. In early 2023, Iger announced that Disney would lay off 7,000 employees to reduce spending by billions of dollars. That plan has since unfolded through multiple rounds of layoffs.In September 2024, Disney cut around 300 positions in corporate functions such as legal, HR, and communications. Earlier layoffs affected Disney-owned brands including National Geographic, Pixar, and Freeform. In March 2025, the company trimmed another 200 jobs—nearly 6% of its workforce in ABC News and Disney Entertainment Networks.Despite the cuts, Disney reported strong financial results.According to its Q2 2025 earnings report, revenue rose to $23.6 billion, a 7% year-on-year increase. Subscriber numbers for Disney+ also climbed by 126 million in the first quarter, reflecting the accelerating shift in consumer preferences toward streaming platforms.As of its latest fiscal year ending September 2024, Disney employed approximately 233,000 people worldwide.Meanwhile, Disney’s theme parks are also facing challenges. At Walt Disney World in Florida, employees under Temporary Protected Status (TPS) were recently informed they must provide updated work authorization documents or risk being placed on leave. The notification followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding the Trump-era decision to end TPS protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans.","Disney is cutting several hundred jobs across its film and television divisions.

Ex-CEO Steve Ballmer on why letting go of Microsoft was the best thing he ever did,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ex-ceo-steve-ballmer-on-why-letting-go-of-microsoft-was-the-best-thing-he-ever-did/articleshow/121586171.cms,"Steve Ballmer

Nearly sold everything to achieve emotional distance

Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said emotionally detaching from the tech giant after stepping down in 2014 was the best decision he made, even though the process took nearly a year and almost led him to sell all his company stock .Speaking on the ""Acquired"" podcast Monday, Ballmer revealed he was ""too emotionally attached"" to Microsoft after three decades with the company, including 14 years as CEO. He initially stayed heavily involved as an investor, reading everything and attending conferences, but realized he couldn't control operations anymore.""It was my baby,"" said Ballmer, who replaced co-founder Bill Gates as CEO in 2000. ""I was there so early, and I hired basically everybody.""The emotional attachment became so intense that Ballmer considered selling his entire Microsoft stake to achieve complete detachment. As he and his wife Connie Snyder ramped up their philanthropy work, he felt the need to distance himself further from the company.""It was nothing to do with money,"" Ballmer explained. ""My only thought process was emotional detachment .""However, a former Microsoft colleague in finance stopped him just before he could sell, telling him the stock would be worth much more. Ballmer decided his ""loyalty trumps emotional attachment"" and kept his shares.Now Ballmer says he's found the right balance, remaining loyal to Microsoft while staying emotionally detached enough to avoid obsessing over stock performance. The approach has given him peace of mind as he focuses on philanthropy, knowing their foundation will thrive regardless of Microsoft's daily fluctuations.Ballmer, famous for his energetic ""Developers! Developers! Developers!"" chant, admitted he was initially ""kind of a dick"" at shareholder meetings before learning to step back.","Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer says he was ""too emotionally attached"" to the company.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
