INS Vikrant fraud case: 2nd closure report against BJP neta,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ins-vikrant-fraud-case-2nd-closure-report-against-bjp-neta/articleshow/114927075.cms,"MUMBAI: More than two months after a court refused to accept Mumbai economic offences wing's ( EOW ) 2022 report closing the case against senior BJP functionary Kirit Somaiya and his son, Neil, for allegedly misappropriating Rs 57 crore collected to save INS Vikrant from being dismantled, police have filed another closure report, effectively giving them a clean chit, reports Ahmed Ali.The FIR had alleged that the amount collected in 2013-14 via a fundraising drive by the Somaiyas and their associates was supposed to be handed over to the governor but a letter from Raj Bhavan said it had received no money. In Aug, a magistrate's court had observed that the investigating officer had not probed what Somaiya and Neil had done with the donations and had ordered further investigation. INS Vikrant was the Navy's first aircraft carrier to be dismantled.In its fresh closure report, the 'C summary report', EOW said Rs 12,881 was raised during the drive outside Churchgate station, and that there was no concrete evidence of substantial fund transfers or more collection drives elsewhere in Mumbai. Witnesses provided conflicting accounts regarding the dates and amounts collected, police claimed.The report said given the duration and location of the fundraising event, it appeared improbable Rs 57 crore could have been raised. It also noted the absence of third-party records to verify donor claims. As a result, it said, investigators could not corroborate the conduct of a significant collection drive beyond the modest sums collected publicly.EOW concluded that absence of concrete evidence, combined with lack of substantial witness testimony, pointed towards no criminal intent. It highlighted the fundraising drive appeared to have been a symbolic public awareness campaign, rather than a substantial financial endeavour.","Kirit Somaiya and his son, Neil, were accused of misappropriating Rs 57 crore collected to save INS Vikrant from being dismantled.

Madhya Pradesh increases death compensation in wild animal attack to Rs 25 lakh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/madhya-pradesh-increases-death-compensation-in-wild-animal-attack-to-rs-25-lakh/articleshow/114926691.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Madhya Pradesh government on Sunday increased compensation from Rs 8 lakh to Rs 25 lakh to families of those killed in wild animal attacks.This announcement came after an elephant claimed two lives near the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in Umaria district.""We have decided to raise the compensation for the loss of lives due to wild animal attacks from Rs 8 lakh to 25 lakh. We have also covered the families of the two persons who were killed (in elephant attacks) in Umaria under it,"" MP chief minister Mohan Yadav told news agency PTI.The increase in compensation was implemented shortly after forest minister Pradeep Ahirwar distributed the previous compensation amount of Rs 8 lakh each to the affected families in Umaria district.A captured elephant had fatally attacked Ramratan Yadav (50) in Devra village, approximately 10 kilometres from the tiger reserve.The same elephant later killed Bhairav Kol (35) in Brahe village within the buffer zone of Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, and injured Malu Sahu (32) in Banka.Meanwhile, the Union environment ministry had initiated an independent inquiry into the death of 10 elephants in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve and said preventive measures are being taken by state officials to avoid the possibility of such incidents.Out of those ten dead elephants, one was male and nine were female. Amongst the ten dead elephants, six were juvenile/sub-adults and four were adults.The ministry further said that according to the preliminary information shared by the state govt, the cause death may be because of poisoning, but the final cause will only be ascertained after a thorough inquiry, detailed postmortem reports, results of histopathological and toxicological reports, and other corroborative evidence.","The Madhya Pradesh government on Sunday increased compensation from Rs 8 lakh to Rs 25 lakh.

'Other steps could happen': EAM Jaishankar on India-China ties after LAC disengagement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/other-steps-could-happen-eam-jaishankar-on-india-china-ties-after-lac-disengagement/articleshow/114914401.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar said Sunday that India and China have made “some progress” in disengaging along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), calling it a “welcome” move that could lead to further positive steps in the relationship. His remarks come after Indian and Chinese troops recently completed disengagement at two major friction points-Demchok and Depsang Plains-in eastern Ladakh.The minister said that following a recent meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Russia, plans were set for further discussions involving India’s national security advisor and the foreign ministry . “So that’s where things are,” he noted, adding that the disengagement “opens up the possibility that other steps could happen.”“In terms of India and China, yes, we have made some progress,” Jaishankar said during an interaction with the Indian diaspora in Brisbane. “Our relations were very, very disturbed for reasons all of you know. We have made some progress in what we call disengagement, which is when troops were very close to each other, with the possibility that could lead to some untoward incident.”The disengagement process, which saw Indian forces beginning verification patrolling at Depsang and Demchok on Friday, is seen as a significant step towards resolving lingering border issues from the 2020 standoff. The LAC had seen large deployments of Chinese troops, a move countered by India, and this increase in forces on both sides contributed to heightened tensions.“There are very large numbers of Chinese troops deployed along the Line of Actual Control who were not there before 2020. And we, in turn, have counter-deployed,” Jaishankar added.This new agreement on patrolling and disengagement was formalised after several rounds of talks, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had earlier said, marking a potential breakthrough to end the four-year standoff along the LAC. The Galwan Valley clash in June 2020 had deeply strained relations between the two countries, making disengagement and talks essential steps in normalising ties.Jaishankar, in Brisbane on the first leg of a two-nation tour, also addressed global issues, including conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, expressing concern over their impact on global stability. Highlighting India’s role in promoting diplomacy, he said Prime Minister Modi had been actively involved in discussions with leaders of Russia and Ukraine. “We are trying to do something in both,” Jaishankar stated, emphasising India’s commitment to a diplomatic resolution in both regions.On the Middle East, he said that India is attempting to prevent further escalation of tensions, pointing out the challenges in mediating between Iran and Israel due to a lack of direct communication. “At the moment, the effort is more to prevent the conflict from spreading,” he said, hinting at India’s involvement without divulging specific details.Touching upon the Quad alliance , Jaishankar explained that the grouping of India, Australia, Japan, and the United States is focused on a broad agenda that includes maritime security, connectivity, and climate forecasting, among other areas. “You have four democracies, four market economies, four countries with a strong record of global contributions,” he said, underscoring the Quad’s broader purpose.During his Australian visit, Jaishankar will inaugurate India’s fourth consulate in the country and co-chair the 15th Foreign Ministers' Framework Dialogue with Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong in Canberra.","India and China have made “some progress” in disengaging along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), External affairs minister S Jaishankar said.

"BJP’s ‘secular’ allies Naidu, Nitish must not allow Waqf Bill to be passed in Parliament: Jamiat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjps-secular-allies-naidu-nitish-must-not-allow-waqf-bill-to-be-passed-in-parliament-jamiat/articleshow/114918505.cms,"NEW DELHI: NDA allies — TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu and JD(U) supremo Nitish Kumar — should take note of Muslim sentiments and not allow the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024 to be passed in Parliament, the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind said Sunday, stepping up its campaign against the passage of the proposed legislation, which is at present under the scrutiny of a Joint Parliamentary Committee.Adopting a resolution at the “Save The Constitution” convention held at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium in the Capital, JUH appealed to the “parties within the NDA that claim to be secular to distance themselves from supporting this dangerous proposed bill and to prove their secular credentials”. JUH said that it supports the stance of opposition parties regarding the proposed Bill.Incidentally, the JPC on the Waqf bill will be meeting for another round of meetings for two days starting Monday.Calling the two allies -TDP and JD(U) as “crutches” that the BJP led NDA govt at the Centre was dependent on for staying in power, Maulana Arshad Madani, chief of the one of the factions of the JUH that led the Convention, cautioned that if the Waqf Bill is passed ignoring the sentiments of the Muslims - “it will be as much a responsibility of the crutches as it would be of those calling the shots in the Central govt. Both the TDP and JD(U) will not be able to escape responsibility.”“People did not give the BJP the required mandate in the Lok Sabha elections to form a govt on its own as they did not accept their policies. However, the BJP led govt that is running the show today is dependent on two crutches - its allies - TDP and JD(U). Without them the BJP would not have been able to form govt.”Sharing that he had invited N Chandrababu Naidu for the convention, Madani acknowledged that even though he did not come the TDP chief sent his party’s vice president Nawab Jan. “I perceive this to be a positive sign as he is Naidu’s representative and will convey the message of all those present at the Convention,” Madani said.The JUH chief shared that as part of its outreach on the issue, Jamiat has decided to hold a public meeting in December, in Andhra Pradesh where they will bring together around five lakh Muslims to put forth the concerns of the Muslims.Attended by clerics and scholars from prominent Muslim organisations including the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, the JUH passed a resolution at the convention, where it rejected the Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2024 and demanded that it be withdrawn by the govt. They also sought that the existing law - Waqf Act 2013 be retained as it is.“No individual from any other religion be included in the Waqf Board, and that the JPC be bound to consult only Muslims, Muslim organizations, and Muslim leaders,” the resolution asserts.“If the bill is passed, the board will become powerless, the status of the Waqf Tribunal will be abolished, and a district collector will identify Waqf with their decision being final. As a result, government control and occupation of Waqf (endowments) will become extremely easy,” the JUH resolution highlights with concern.",The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) appealed to the “parties within the NDA that claim to be secular to distance themselves from supporting this dangerous proposed bill” The JPC on the Waqf bill will be meeting for another round of meetings for two days starting Monday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114918641,imgsize-101970,width-400,resizemode-4/114918641.jpg"

When PM Modi questioned EAM on India-Australia ties. Jaishankar shares story in Brisbane,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-pm-modi-asked-eam-on-india-australia-ties-jaishankar-shares-story-in-brisbane/articleshow/114912218.cms,"External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Sunday shared his views on Indo-Australian relations and discussed how the bilateral relationship between the two nations evolved, highlighting the dedicated efforts made from both countries to strengthen this partnership.Speaking to the Indian community in Brisbane , he said, “I remember an early conversation with him ( PM Modi ) in 2014. He asked me that 'explain to me why hasn't our relationship with Australia developed?' Because it has everything going for it. There is a language, share culture, tradition and yet somehow, something is not happening. That day, I did not have an answer perhaps because I myself had not reflected upon it. So, this is a reflection that this relationship did not happen on auto-pilot. People, on both ends, made great efforts to build it.”At the University of Queensland the EAM outlined the four fundamental elements that have contributed to the strengthening of bilateral ties between the two nations.""This is my fifth visit to Australia in the last three years... I first came to Australia when I was Foreign Secretary. Yesterday, before I boarded the flight, I launched a book in which they highlighted seven crucial friendships of India, Australia was one of them,"" EAM said""And I told the author; that if he had written the book 10 years ago, I am not sure it would have been. I am saying this because I am trying to stress how much this relationship has in the last decade and why has it changed... There are four reasons. One PM Modi, two Australia, three the world and fourth is all of you. That is the reason why the relationship has come a long way,"" he added.Jaishankar discussed the significance ofQUAD and Australia's foundational role in the partnership. He elaborated on the diplomatic implications of their bilateral relations.He said, “The QUAD ranks right up there and Australia is a founding partner of that mechanism in terms of our bilateral ties. In diplomacy, you come up with words that signal to your own system and to others. When we speak today of a comprehensive strategic partnership, this description has a meaning in bureaucratic terms.He highlighted the Indian presence in the region, stating that “About 125,000 people of Indian origin live here. I'm told there are roughly 15,000-16,000 students living in this state. What impressed me was that 75% of Australia's exports to India come from this state... In the last 10 years, we should not treat it as an achievement but as a glimpse of what is possible. What we have done is put in place a framework in which this relationship will grow and foster in the times to come.He further highlighted the recent developments in educational cooperation, noting, ""We have just had the visit of our Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan to Australia and I do believe that education and research will play a disproportionate role in the knowledge economy and the era of AI.”Addressing the Indian diaspora , Jaishankar expressed confidence about India's trajectory and said, ""India will grow. India is growing, but India wants to grow with the world.""""We are optimistic. There may be problems, but overall, we think the world has goodwill and a desire to work with India. We see a sentiment overall in the world for India to succeed and it's important we harness that sentiment,"" he added.Jaishankar said that over the past decade, major advancements have been achieved through interconnected initiatives that collectively enhance business operations in the country. These developments encompass streamlined business processes, enhanced living standards, and substantial infrastructure improvements through the Gati Shakti programme .""In the last 10 years, we believe we have made very significant progress and I would attribute the progress to the fact that we have embarked on a series of efforts which feed into each other, making it much easier to do business in the country, improving the ease of living, radically improving the infrastructure through a program called Gati Shakti, putting in place what has been a remarkably effective digital public infrastructure, improving the quality of governance overall, ensuring the political stability which allows for decisions taken to be implemented in full and for new decisions to build on earlier ones,” he said.“Today's India is building 28 kilometers of highway every day, 12-14 kilometers of railway track every day, we had 6 cities with metros a decade ago and have 21 today, and we are planning an additional 39.

You (Hemant Soren) have given shelter to the infiltrators. You see your vote bank in the infiltrators. Due to infiltrators, the number of tribals in this state is decreasing, the demography is changing and Hemant Soren's government is busy with its own work. The number of tribals in Santhal Pargana is continuously decreasing.”“Infiltrators are coming here and luring our daughters and marrying them and occupying the land. If this is not stopped, then neither the culture of Jharkhand, nor the employment, land, or daughters here will be safe. BJP government is being formed in Jharkhand and we will drive out these infiltrators,"" Shah added.Home minister further criticised Soren’s handling of security, particularly for women, vowing that a BJP government would prioritize protection and reclaim land taken from women. “In Assam, after the BJP took charge, infiltration has stopped. We will bring the same commitment here to protect roti (livelihood), beti (daughters), and maati (land),” Shah said.Turning his attention to West Bengal, Shah argued that infiltration remains an issue there due to local administrative support for such activities. He expressed confidence that with a BJP government in Jharkhand, all levels of authority would work together to curb infiltration and deport illegal residents.In addition to security concerns, Shah also commented on an ongoing controversy surrounding Soren's age, urging the chief minister to clarify discrepancies in his affidavit.""It is his moral responsibility to be truthful with the people,"" Shah said, highlighting that the BJP alleges Soren’s age has increased by seven years over a five-year period—his age reportedly shifting from 42 in 2019 to 49 in his current affidavit.","Union home minister Amit Shah issued a stark warning about the consequences for those who commit heinous acts against women.

Let down by government: Surrendered Reds rue 'raw deal',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/let-down-by-government-surrendered-reds-rue-raw-deal/articleshow/114924578.cms,"Representative Image (Lexica generated image)

HYDERABAD: Even as security forces push hard into the forests of Chhattisgarh to smoke out the last Naxal strongholds, a number of surrendered cadres in neighbouring Telangana say they have received a raw deal from government. They say they are happy to have ended a life of playing hide and seek . But since laying down their arms, government officials have started playing hide and seek with them each time they ask for help.A big grouse the surrendered Naxals have is that they have not been given agricultural land . Farming is the only skill they have and in the absence of land, they have been reduced to doing odd jobs.Meet Saralamma (name changed), who was once with the banned CPI (M), as a divisional committee member (DCM) and was married to a prominent Central Committee (CC) member (who died of Covid). She had herself lost an eye in a shootout with security forces. Saralamma surrendered in 2021 after 27 years as a Maoist in the hope of turning her life around. Three years on, she has been forced to become an agriculture labourer and says she is tired of making rounds to various officials in Mahabubabad seeking a residential plot and an acre of agricultural land .""I am not even given widow pension. When I applied, district authorities asked me to produce my husband's death certificate when the world knew he died in the Chhattisgarh forests working for Maoists. How can I get the death certificate?"" she asks.Police officials promptly pay reward money as soon as Maoist cadres surrender. But most of those who TOI spoke to said that after being handed the cheque, they were left to fend for themselves. Many suffer health problems.Venkatesham (name changed), a former DCM from Mahabubabad and now a gig worker delivering food in Hyderabad, says he gets a cold response from officials whenever he asks them about the farmland he was promised . ""They make us wait for hours. And the stock reply we get is: there is no govt land to spare. I feel let down. For the sake of my wife and children, I have shifted to Hyderabad,"" he says.The surrendered Naxals blame revenue officials for playing truant. Till 2018, there have been instances of former Naxals managing to get hold of a piece of land but since then their requests for sanction of govt land have fallen on the deaf ears of officials, they claim. Some tried their luck by getting in touch with political leaders, but with little success.Revenue officials claimed they treat each surrendered Maoist separately and decide the package accordingly. ""The relief and rehabilitation issue is dealt with at the collectorate level. But one should also remember that land has become dearer with steep rise in prices,"" a senior official said.Some officials point out the assignment committee does not exist anymore. On alleged apathy of tahsildars and making surrendered Naxals run from pillar to post around govt offices, a top official said: ""If there are any specific cases, we will get them verified.""","A number of surrendered Naxals in Telangana say they have received a raw deal from government.

Consensus eludes COP16 on creating new biodiversity fund,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consensus-eludes-cop16-on-creating-new-biodiversity-fund/articleshow/114924547.cms,"Union minister Kirti Vardhan Singh (second from right) with others at UN biodiversity summit in Cali, Colombia. The meet agreed on an expanded role of indigenous people in saving biodiversity

NEW DELHI: India’s last-minute intervention to protect sovereign rights through changes in final text could manage a groundbreaking agreement on the operationalisation of a new global mechanism to share benefits from digital genetic information at 16th session of UN biodiversity summit ( COP16 ) in Cali, Colombia, even as the biennial meet failed to reach consensus on the creation of a new global biodiversity fund on Saturday.The countries also agreed on an expanded role of indigenous people and local communities in saving biodiversity — another important takeaway from COP16 that had to be suspended due to lack of quorum in its final plenary that continued for 12 hours without decision on setting up the fund to support biodiversity initiatives globally.Observers noted that the quorum could not be reached as the session ran into extra time and members started leaving the venue to catch their respective flights back home. The COP16 was earlier scheduled to conclude on Friday. Its leftover tasks — financial mechanism (fund) and monitoring framework — now need to be revisited at a later date and new venue.The decision on the benefit sharing from uses of digital sequence information (DSI) on genetic resources “more fairly and equitably” addresses how pharmaceutical, biotechnology, animal and plant breeding and other industries benefiting from it should share those benefits with developing countries and indigenous people and local communities.Sources familiar with the final negotiations on DSI issues said India objected to the text which was meant to supersede national laws. The country asked for a clause on ensuring national ‘access and benefit sharing’ laws to be included in the annexure. The final agreement reached only when the chair agreed for New Delhi’s suggestion through consensus, they added.Besides India, other developing countries including Bolivia, Egypt and Argentina did also object to any such move that could interfere with the countries’ sovereign rights. India was represented at COP16 by a team of officials led by junior environment minister KirtiVardhan Singh.Under the agreed guidelines on the issue, large companies and other major entities benefiting commercially from DSI uses should contribute to a special fund for this purpose - called the Cali Fund - based on a percentage of their profits or revenues. The model targets larger companies most reliant on DSI. It exempts academic, public research institutions and other entities using the information but not directly benefiting.""It's a kind of agreement which will ensure that those who profit from biodiversity should now give back to nature, countries and communities. India has already notified rules under its existing domestic law on fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of biological resources and knowledge,"" said an official here.Though contributions to 'Cali Fund' will be non-binding (voluntary) where beneficiaries are expected to contribute 1% of their profits or 0.1% of their revenue, it will at least ensure that the responsibility now lies with the companies to give back to countries and communities.It is learnt that the consensus on financial mechanism to implement the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF) - a global treaty on nature like the Paris Agreement on climate - eluded over 190 participating countries as rich nations including Australia, Japan and EU nations - opposed to any new fund to meet the global biodiversity goals.The KMGBF was adopted by the countries at COP15 in Montreal in 2022 to achieve 23 biodiversity targets with an aim to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030 under the 30x30 plan (protecting 30% of the world's land and water by 2030).“From Cali, this UN Biodiversity Conference sent a powerful call to action. It has never been clearer that the implementation of the KMGBF and the Paris Agreement in a synergistic fashion will make peace with nature within reach,” said Astrid Schomaker, executive secretary, Convention on Biological Diversity.",The countries also agreed on an expanded role of indigenous people and local communities in saving biodiversity. India objected to the text which was meant to supersede national laws. The country asked for a clause on ensuring national 'access and benefit sharing' laws to be included in the annexure.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114924556,imgsize-67824,width-400,resizemode-4/114924556.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: It was akin to a Diwali surprise - several IAS officers belonging to the Kerala cadre got ""added"" to a new WhatsApp group on October 31, labelled 'Mallu Hindu Officers.'The WhatsApp group, which included only Hindu officers in the cadre, was created from the phone number used by IAS officer K Gopalakrishnan . It led to immediate objections, with many officers finding it inappropriate and contrary to the secular principles that officers are expected to uphold.The WhatsApp group was disbanded a day after its creation, with Gopalakrishnan claiming that his phone was hacked. He stated that multiple groups were formed using his contacts without his consent. It is learnt that the officer also filed a police complaint in this regard.The incident comes on the heels of another high-profile controversy involving senior IPS officer MR Ajith Kumar. Kumar was removed from his position as ADGP (law & order) after it was revealed that he covertly met senior RSS functionaries, allegedly without the knowledge of the LDF govt in Kerala. Though govt has not officially acknowledged this as the reason for his transfer, it was forced to transfer Kumar after even LDF ally CPI took a tough stand on it.""There are several WhatsApp groups among officers, but a WhatsApp group on religious lines is something new,"" a senior officer told TOI, on condition of anonymity. He said WhatsApp groups among officers differentiated between junior and senior officers, are intended for various services and there are others based on different considerations including language, but many of them are largely inactive in nature. A group explicitly created on religious grounds, however, was unprecedented.A senior intelligence officer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that the agency was alerted about the group by a few officers who were added to it. These officers provided evidence, prompting the agency to take the matter seriously and prepare a report. Intelligence agencies, both at the state and Central levels, are now looking into the matter.","Several IAS officers belonging to the Kerala cadre got ""added"" to a new WhatsApp group on October 31, labelled 'Mallu Hindu Officers' The WhatsApp group was created from the phone number used by IAS officer K Gopalakrishnan.

NHAI to launch first-ever bank-driven toll collection system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhai-to-launch-first-ever-bank-driven-toll-collection-system/articleshow/114890904.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: In a first, NHAI will rope in a bank to collect user fee on a highway stretch, marking a paradigm shift in the tolling system in the country. It has invited bids for selecting an acquirer bank for country’s first multi-lane free flow (MLFF) toll collection on the recently-opened Dwarka Expressway The MLFF tolling stretch will have no physical plaza. The tolling system will consist of field equipment and sensors mounted on gantries, which will capture information from passing vehicles. This data will be transmitted to the electronic toll payment system for the deduction of user fee.There will be no need for a separate toll collector or operator. Banks that offer maximum revenue share will get the tolling rights.The 28-km urban expressway will have only one tolling point at the Delhi-Gurgaon border, about 9 km from the Delhi side. Only vehicles crossing this point will have to pay user fee. Govt has not yet notified the toll rate for the stretch. The successful bidder, which will get the tolling right for three years, will have to put the system in place within three months of securing the contract.Considering that banks have no expertise in direct toll collection, NHAI’s subsidiary responsible for tolling, IHMCL has allowed them to engage sub-contractors to carry out the task. As per the bid document, the sub-contractors must have the experience of implementing MLFF-based tolling on at least 200 km and for 10 years in India or abroad.NHAI is looking at bringing more new greenfield expressways under MLFF to reduce congestion, pollution and make travel hassle-free. “Since banks are regulated by RBI, they will follow a more transparent system and there will be no leakage of revenue,” said an official.While the acquirer bank will deduct toll from the Fastag wallet, the system will also flag vehicles with faulty tags or no tags. It will automatically share the details of non-payment of tolls with the Vahan database, the central depository of registered vehicles. Pending toll will be reflected on the Vahan portal or app with the vehicle's photo for evidence when the owner logs in. Clearing pending dues will be made mandatory for getting NOC and fitness certificate.","The 28-km urban expressway will have only one tolling point at the Delhi-Gurgaon border.

India gets its first analog space mission in Leh to plan its lunar mission experiments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gets-its-first-analog-space-mission-in-leh-to-plan-its-lunar-mission-experiments/articleshow/114892994.cms,"Hab-1 inflatable habitat at Leh is equipped with essentials like a hydroponics farm, kitchen and sanitation facilities for analog space

NEW DELHI: The country’s first analog space mission has taken off at Leh in Ladakh , where space agency Isro will simulate life in an interplanetary habitat as India is planning to send a human to the Moon in the near future.Analog space missions are field tests in locations on Earth that have physical similarities to the extreme space environments and play a significant role in problem solving for spaceflight research. Ladakh has been chosen for such a mission as the geographical features of the area — dry and cold climate, barren land, high-altitude terrain and extreme isolation — are considered to closely resemble Martian and lunar landscapes, and are an ideal training ground for scientific missions aimed at exploring planets.“India’s first analog space mission kicks off in Leh! A collaborative effort by Human Spaceflight Centre, ISRO, AAKA Space Studio, University of Ladakh, IIT Bombay, and supported by Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, this mission will simulate life in an interplanetary habitat to tackle the challenges of a base station beyond Earth,” Isro posted on X on Friday.The month-long mission, which kicked off mid-Oct, comes in the wake of India’s plans to set up lunar habitats, which could provide a base to launch interplanetary missions. The mission includes a compact, inflatable habitat named Hab-1, which is equipped with essentials like a hydroponics farm, kitchen, and sanitation facilities. It provides a self-sustaining environment, offering valuable data as India is planning long-duration space missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.Lying at an elevation over 3,000 metres above sea level, Ladakh has oxygen levels only 40% of those at sea level. The low-pressure, low-oxygen setting allows researchers to evaluate life support systems under conditions similar to those on Mars. The team of AAKA Space Studio is therefore testing environment suits and conducting geological studies in Leh.Currently, scores of analog missions are being organised by space agencies as well as private entities and researchers. Some of the prominent ones are Nasa’s Analog Missions Project and Analog Astronaut Training Center. The Nasa project is managed by Johnson Space Center and includes four funded analog missions: Research and Technology Studies (RATS), Nasa’s Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO), In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), and International Space Station (ISS) Test bed for Analog Research (ISTAR). Analog Astronaut Training Center (AATC) in Poland has two full-isolation research laboratories and an analog astronaut training program. AATC, which has organised 75 analog simulations till the end of 2023, specialises in human physiology research and operational training for scientists, engineers, and astronaut candidates.","Analog space missions are field tests in locations on Earth that have physical similarities to the extreme space environments.

JD Vance on Indian Food: What JD Vance said about Indian vegetarian food,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/when-i-first-started-dating-usha-what-jd-vance-said-about-indian-vegetarian-food/articleshow/114841564.cms,"Joe Rogan Experience #2221 - JD Vance

US Senator and Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance delved into his evolving views on food, particularly the appeal of Indian vegetarian cuisine , on his apperience on The Joe Rogan Experience . The conversation with Joe Rogan, which spanned three hours, offered insights not only into Vance's culinary journey but also into his marriage to Usha Vance .Rogan began the exchange by voicing scepticism about heavily processed plant-based meats, labelling them ""highly processed garbage"" and highlighting the health and environmental concerns often attached to such products. Instead, he championed traditional vegetarian food, specifically Indian cuisine, as a healthier and more flavourful option. “If you want to eat vegetables and be vegetarian, eat Indian food. They make really delicious vegetarian food,” Rogan stated.Vance, quick to agree, shared how his wife’s Indian heritage has opened him up to a world of vegetarian dishes he previously hadn’t considered. ""I'm married to an Indian-American . They make very good vegetarian food,"". As a self-described “meat and potatoes guy from Ohio,” Vance admitted that his initial forays into cooking for his wife were less than successful. Recalling an early attempt at impressing Usha with a homemade vegetarian meal, he said, ""I rolled out a flat thing of crescent rolls. I put raw broccoli on top of it. I sprinkled ranch dressing, and I stuck them in the oven for 45 minutes."" The result, he admitted, was ""disgusting.""Vance explained that he initially struggled to grasp what vegetarian meals could look like, particularly when he tried to cater to Usha’s preferences. Over time, he came to appreciate the wide variety and depth of flavours in Indian vegetarian cooking. ""If you're any vegetarian, eat paneer and rice and delicious chickpeas. Do not eat this disgusting fake meat,"" he remarked.Vance, a Catholic convert, has previously spoken about his respect for his wife’s Hindu upbringing, noting the nuances and compromises each has made in their relationship. In a prior interview with The New York Times, he expressed mixed emotions about introducing Usha to his faith, explaining that while she encouraged his spiritual journey, she has not converted to Catholicism herself. “She thought that [Catholic teachings] were good for me, in a sort of good-for-your-soul kind of way,” Vance revealed. He acknowledged feeling “kind of bad” about the change, explaining how Usha has had to shoulder responsibilities, particularly in church with their three children, even though she wasn’t raised in the faith.Their relationship, which began at Yale Law School and led to marriage in 2014.","US Senator and Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance delved into his evolving views on food, particularly the appeal of Indian vegetarian cuisine.

Goa-based NIO finds microplastics in Antarctica’s Adelie penguins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goa-based-nio-finds-microplastics-in-antarcticas-adelie-penguins/articleshow/114919962.cms,"Panaji: Microplastics have infiltrated even the most remote regions of our planet, with alarming new evidence emerging from Antarctica . A recent study conducted by a team of researchers led by Mahua Saha, principal scientist, CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography (NIO Goa), on the Adelie penguin on Svenner Island, unveiled the presence of microplastics in its organs and gastrointestinal tissues.Microplastics are tiny bits of plastic that are less than 5mm in size—about the size of a grain of rice or smaller. They come from many sources, like discarded plastic bags, bottles, and even from clothes. As a result, despite its isolation from significant human activity, the Antarctic region is not immune to the pervasive threat of microplastic pollution.During the 39th Indian expedition to Antarctica, scientists of the CSIR-NIO, Goa, and the University of Calcutta, West Bengal, collected an adult Adelie penguin carcass, meticulously dissected it at the Bharti Research Station, Antarctica, and scientists at CSIR-NIO Goa examined its body samples to look for microplastics. They found that most of the plastic they discovered was in the form of fibres—long, thin pieces that are often found in clothing and fishing gear. Interestingly, more than half of these fibres were blue, which might come from things like fishing nets or even clothes.Sampling revealed microplastics in the gastrointestinal tracts of the penguins, with fibres constituting 97% of the identified particles. According to NIO, the ingestion of MPs by Adelie penguins can occur as they mistake these plastic particles for food. This poses risks of bioaccumulation within individual penguins and may also threaten entire populations, as scientists fear that adult penguins who commonly feed their young crop milk could inadvertently transfer harmful pollutants. This means that the pollutants can get passed down to the baby penguins, putting the entire population at risk.The study revealed that many of the microplastics in the penguins’ bodies were not digested. This suggests that their bodies are struggling to break down these foreign particles, which could lead to toxic substances building up in their systems. These harmful particles could not only affect the penguins but also other animals that eat similar foods, like skuas (a type of bird that also lives in Antarctica).The way microplastics are accumulated in penguins involves both direct ingestion and indirect ways. Adelie penguins primarily eat marine creatures like krill and fish, which have also been found to contain microplastics. This creates a worrying cycle of pollution that could impact the entire food web. To make matters worse, scientists have also found microplastics in the penguins’ respiratory tracts. Inhaling these tiny particles could lead to inflammation and breathing issues, adding yet another layer of danger for these majestic birds.The findings serve as a clarion call for enhanced conservation efforts and stricter regulations on plastic production and disposal as microplastics invade even the most pristine environments on earth.","Microplastics have infiltrated even the most remote regions of our planet, with alarming new evidence emerging from Antarctica.

NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality sharply worsened on Sunday as calm winds and low mercury impacted the dispersion of pollutants.Within 24 hours, the Air Quality Index (AQI) rose from 316 on Saturday to 382, placing it in the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category. This was the worst AQI in over nine months. A higher AQI than this was last recorded at 392 on Jan 31, shows Central Pollution Control Board data.The highest AQI in Oct was 364 in the ‘very poor’ category on Oct 23. The air quality is likely to hover within the ‘very poor’ category till Wednesday.IMD has predicted that mist or smog conditions during the early hours of Monday to Wednesday. Experts said the wind direction has been changing from north-westerly to southeasterly on Sunday, and wind speed dropped to zero during the transition phase. Even the night temperature, which mostly remained at least 3-4 degrees above normal in Oct, has now started dipping in November. On Sunday, the city recorded the season’s lowest minimum temperature at 16.5 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. It was a dip of around four degrees as the minimum temperature settled at 21.1 degrees Celsius on October 31.“As the wind direction is changing to south-easterly, winds turned calm during the daytime, causing accumulation of pollutants. Variable winds blew in the city in the last 24 hours, but south-easterly winds are expected to prevail on Monday and Tuesday. Though south-easterly winds are unfavourable for the transport of emissions from stubble burning to Delhi, local winds are expected to be calm during the night and light during the daytime. Since local winds will not pick up in the next two days, it is likely to impact the air quality,” Mahesh Palawat, vice-chairman of Skymet Meteorology, said.As the winds turned calm during the daytime, the AQI spiked from 366 at 8 am to 382 at 4 pm based on the average calculated by CPCB of 39 stations out of a total of 40. The AQI reading surpassed 400 at 14 stations, placing them in the ‘severe’ category. This included Anand Vihar, the most polluted with an AQI of 436, followed by Nehru Nagar at 430 and Punjabi Bagh at 425.“Meteorological conditions are likely to be extremely unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants,” the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi (EWS) said on Sunday. The EWS added that the air quality is likely to remain in the very poor range till Wednesday, but it is forecast to stay in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ category during the subsequent six days from November 6 onwards.The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 was 14.96% on Saturday, according to the Decision Support System. However, as southeasterly winds are likely to blow in the city, the contribution of stubble burning is expected to decrease. Satellites detected 351 residue burning events on Sunday. Of these, 216 were in Punjab, 19 in Haryana, 16 in UP, 36 in Rajasthan, and 67 in MP, according to satellite data compiled by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute.","The Air Quality Index (AQI) rose from 316 on Saturday to 382, placing it in the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public. Musk has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-96413764,imgsize-26192,width-400,resizemode-4/96413764.jpg"

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

I have witnessed the atrocities against them—their temples, businesses, and homes,"" Hindu civic leader Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari told news agency AFP.The interim administration under Muhammad Yunus has recognized and condemned these incidents against Hindus, while maintaining that many of the attacks were politically rather than religiously motivated.Continuous demonstrations since then indicate ongoing attacks and demand action from Yunus's administration, which serves as an ""advisory council"" responsible for implementing democratic reforms and organizing new elections.Recent tensions escalated when sedition charges were filed against 19 individuals who participated in an earlier minority rights demonstration in Chittagong.Authorities accused these individuals of disrespectingBangladesh 's national flag by positioning a saffron flag—the symbolic color of Hinduism—above it.""Framing our leaders with false charges, like sedition, has made us skeptical of the government's intentions,"" said protest member Chiranjan Goswami.In predominantly Muslim Bangladesh, Hindus constitute the largest minority religious group, representing approximately eight percent of the population.Reports also indicate attacks on Sufi shrines, with Islamist groups suspected of targeting alternative Islamic practices.Saturday's protest followed a larger gathering in Chittagong the previous day, which drew 10,000 participants.Minority community leaders have announced plans for additional demonstrations in the coming weeks.In August, Hasina, aged 77, departed by helicopter to India as protesters filled Dhaka's streets, marking a dramatic conclusion to her authoritarian leadership.Her administration faced accusations of extensive human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings of thousands of political opponents during her 15-year tenure.","Demonstrators call on interim government to establish legislation protecting minorities.

Gold reserves play a crucial role in a nation’s financial stability, serving as a valuable asset for central banks and governments. These reserves, which refer to the stockpile of gold held by a country, help stabilise currency values and provide security during economic uncertainties. Historically, gold has been seen as a safe-haven asset, essential during times of crisis or financial downturns.For example, the U.S. began building its substantial reserves in the late 19th century and solidified its dominance through the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. Today, countries around the world hold significant amounts of gold as part of their strategic economic policies. Explore the top countries with the highest gold reserves, based on the latest data from the World Gold Council, showcasing their holdings and economic impact.The U.S. holds the highest gold reserves at approximately 8,133.46 tonnes, which make up about 72.41% of its total reserves. Stored in secure facilities like Fort Knox, these reserves bolster financial stability and reinforce the U.S. dollar's dominance in international trade.Germany ranks second with 3,351.53 tonnes, accounting for about 71.46% of its foreign reserves. Most of its gold is kept in vaults in Frankfurt and some repatriated from New York and London. Germany’s substantial holdings provide a buffer against financial crises and elevate its influence within the EU.Italy’s 2,451.84 tonnes of gold reserves, managed by its central bank, represent 68.33% of its total foreign reserves. These assets serve as a symbol of economic resilience, supporting Italy's stability within the Eurozone.France holds 2,436.97 tonnes, constituting 69.99% of its reserves. Managed by the Banque de France, these holdings provide financial security and reflect a longstanding strategy to mitigate economic risks.With 2,335.85 tonnes of gold, Russia has significantly increased its reserves as a strategic response to geopolitical challenges and to diversify away from the U.S. dollar.

SRINAGAR: Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, according to officials. This comes as the neighbouring country strengthens defence ties with Gulf and Western European countries, and its long-standing ally Turkiye, the officials said.The movement of the 155 mm guns, produced in collaboration with a Gulf nation under the supervision of a state-owned Chinese defence company , along the LoC was observed recently, they said.The guns -- a variant of SH-15 that is known for its 'shoot and scoot' capability -- can fire a range of munitions, including high-explosive, armour-piercing and smoke rounds, boasting of a maximum range of approximately 30 kilometres and a firing rate of up to six rounds per minute.Among the arsenal being tested is the refurbished M109, which has a firing range of 24 kilometres and can launch six shells in just 40 seconds. Initially acquired from a Western European country, this artillery system is now undergoing trials in its enhanced version, the officials said.Turkiye has contributed to this military enhancement with the deployment of a modern 105 mm artillery piece manufactured by a Turkish defence company, FNSS, they said.This medium-weight tank is equipped with a two-man turret armed with a standard 105 mm rifled gun capable of firing both armour-piercing and high-explosive ammunition.China has also been instrumental in bolstering Pakistan's military capabilities along the LoC, according to the officials.This assistance includes construction of fortified bunkers, provision of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), combat aerial vehicles, and advanced communication systems, the officials said.Early this year, China's North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) delivered the second batch of 56 SH-15 155 mm calibre wheeled self-propelled howitzers to the Pakistan army.Chinese support has also extended to the installation of encrypted communication towers and underground fibre optic cables along the LoC, the officials said.","Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm.

Tories replace Sunak with party’s first black leader Kemi Badenoch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/tories-replace-sunak-with-partys-first-black-leader/articleshow/114891942.cms,"TOI Correspondent from London:

Britain’s Conservative Party has elected its first black leader, Kemi Badenoch , since its founding in 1834. Badenoch, who was announced as the new Opposition leader on Saturday, also makes history as the first black woman to be elected to lead any major UK political party .The 44-year-old mother-of-three received 53,806 votes and Robert Jenrick received 41,388 votes in the ballot by the party membership after four other candidates were knocked out by the parliamentary party.The results were announced just as a new poll showed the Conservatives leading Labour for the first time since Dec 2021.Born in the UK to Nigerian parents, Badenoch, who is stepping into Rishi Sunak ’s shoes (Sunak was the first non-white to lead the Tories), is known for her forthright no-nonsense approach and anti-woke views. In her victory speech, she vowed to “renew” herparty.Her parents took her back to Lagos where she was raised under successive military regimes until she returned to the UK aged 16.She became an MP in 2017. In her maiden speech she spoke about doing her homework by candlelight in Nigeria and fetching water in heavy, rusty buckets from a borehole.She travelled to India as international trade secretary to negotiate the UK-India free trade deal with her counterpart, Union minister Piyush Goyal, but said afterwards she had refused to cave in on India's demands for visas.During her election campaign, she had told “Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg”: “I saw as equalities minister people bringing cultural disputes from India to the streets of Leicester. We need to make sure that when people come to this country, they leave their previous differences behind.”She had also told a Conservative Friends of India (CFI) hustings: “We have to make sure the people who come here from India are the people who want to contribute to UK”. She had said there needed to be a level playing field in terms of movement of people as many British people want to travel and work in India.She said Delhi was a warm place full of friendly people and it reminded her of growing up in Nigeria. She had recalled having a “jolly good time” with Goyal and that they had “agreed on so much”. “This is why I think the UK India FTA is definitely possible, but we need to make sure it works for both countries,” she had said, blaming India being a “protectionist country” for the FTA not getting over the line.“We need to ensure that we keep India close. There is an axis of authoritarian states collaborating against the West and they would love to have India on their side,” she had told the CFI hustings.","Kemi Badenoch is the first black woman to be elected to lead any major UK political party.

Badenoch was raised in Nigeria.

She is the first black woman to lead a major political party in the UK

During her campaign, Badenoch vowed to return the Conservatives to ""first principles"" and launch a series of reviews in the coming months to shape a new policy platform.

She is also the sixth Tory leader in less than eight and a half years and faces the challenge of uniting a fractured party.

Although a British citizen and born in the UK, during her parliamentary maiden speech Badenoch stated that she was ""to all intents and purposes a first-generation immigrant"".

Badenoch studied Computer Systems Engineering at the University of Sussex, completing a Master of Engineering (MEng) degree in 2003.

Badenoch joined the Conservative Party in 2005 at the age of 25.

Badenoch supported Brexit in the 2016 UK EU membership referendum.

She has served in ministerial roles under three prime ministers.

What it means for India

Kemi Badenoch on Saturday won the race to become the new leader of Britain's Conservative Party , vowing to return the once dominant party to its ""founding principles"" to try to win back voters who handed the Conservatives their worst election defeat in July.A staunch proponent of Brexit , 44-year-old Badenoch is known for her outspoken views and tough stance on divisive issues such as immigration and rights for transgender people, including in her role as minister for women and equalities.Badenoch replaces former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak , who in July led the Conservatives to their worst election result since 1832. The Conservatives lost more than 200 seats, taking their tally down to 121.A self-proclaimed straight speaker, Badenoch won the majority of votes among party members, the final stage in a months-long contest that saw a field of six whittled down to two. Robert Jenrick, a former immigration minister, came second.During the leadership race — her second in two years, after placing fourth in a 2022 runoff — Badenoch vowed to reset the Conservative Party, arguing they had become too much like Labour and proposing smaller state intervention and a greater focus on families.Her strong political views have courted controversy over the years, however, with recent comments about maternity pay having ""gone too far"" sparking a backlash, while her suggestion that ""not all cultures are equally valid"" reinforced her image as a so-called culture warrior.She also faced a backlash when she said 5-10% of civil servants, or apolitical officials working in government, were ""very bad"" and ""should be in prison"" for undermining ministers - a comment her team said was a joke.Badenoch is likely to run for PM in the next UK general elections scheduled for 2029.Badenoch's victory confirms a further shift to the right for the UK's oldest political party, suggesting it may take a more hardline approach toward immigration, climate measures and culture politics in opposition.Badenoch had said that she blocked the India-UK free trade agreement (FTA) due to demands for additional visas, according to UK media reports.The shadow minister of Nigerian heritage suggested that one of the reasons the Sunak-led government could not finalise the FTA was because India was seeking greater concessions regarding migration.""As business secretary, even as I was trying to do things to limit immigration, we had an India FTA where they kept trying to bring in migration and I said no. It's one of the reasons why we didn't sign it,"" Badenoch told 'The Telegraph'.However, some of Badenoch's former Tory ministerial colleagues argued that her claims are unlikely, as she was actively advocating for a deal and overseeing multiple rounds of negotiations aimed at an FTA that could significantly boost the £38 billion annual bilateral trading partnership.",Badoch is the first black woman to lead a major political party in the UK. She is known for her tough stance on immigration and women's rights. She has vowed to return the Conservative Party to its roots in the 21st century. Badoch is expected to run for re-election next year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114882745,imgsize-164612,width-400,resizemode-4/114882745.jpg"

""But maybe living in the States wasn't what they thought it would be and that could be why they're now supposedly edging their way back in the direction of the UK."" Both Meghan and Harry became less popular after they exited the royal family and moved to California -- despite their several tell-acll accounts against the family.""Their life in the US -- there's so many people that move away and move back, so I don't think there'd be anything unusual about Harry and Meghan leaving the US for Europe,"" Harrold told the New York Post.“There’s no obvious reason for choosing Portugal as a location to live, but let’s not forget that it’s not unusual for royals to set up overseas,” Harrold said.“Some have historically moved to France, Princess Margaret used to spend a lot of time in Mauritius, so Harry would be following in the footsteps of other royals who have done something similar.”But before they move to Portugal they will have to obtain European Union citizenship.After exiting the royal family, Meghan Markle dreamt of ruling Hollywood but she lost a golden opportunity when she refused to work for a Suits reboot.""This could become the costliest decision of her life and one that she may bitterly regret in years to come. The female lead character, a campaigning, hotshot lawyer named Erica, was written with Meghan specifically in mind and there is little doubt she would have been paid many times her original salary,"" an expert said.""There had been industry talk that she could command as much as half-a-million dollars per episode. That’s the kind of golden shot that even established stars dream of.
