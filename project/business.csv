"Hindenburg report: Government unlikely to wade into row, officials say report 'malicious'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindenburg-report-government-unlikely-to-wade-into-row-officials-say-report-malicious/articleshow/112453009.cms,"Top Picks For You Full statement of Sebi chief, her husband on Hindenburg allegations

NEW DELHI: Government is unlikely to immediately step into the controversy created by the Hindenburg report as senior officials believe that the charges against Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval, are ""untrue and malicious"" and are in response to the regulator 's notice to the short seller.They alleged that Hindenburg may also be trying to make a quick buck from the Indian markets through its latest action and the regulator and govt are keeping a close tab on how the developments unfold.Describing it as a fresh attempt to ""create a smokescreen"", a govt source suggested that this may be part of a larger attempt to discredit the regulator at a time when the Indian stock market is seeing a good run on the back of healthy macroeconomic fundamentals and strong growth prospects with clean corporate and bank balance sheets. The source alleged such actions were part of a pattern to hit Indian markets but argued that the markets were now strong and deep enough to withstand Hindenburg-type attacks.""There have been a series of regulatory actions to improve the overall functioning of the markets and the regulator itself has not shied away from cautioning investors, wherever it sees pressure building up,"" another official said, while listing out a host of measures taken by Sebi. The officer said that Sebi has submitted its probe findings on issues raised by Hindenburg in its earlier report to the Supreme Court.Pointing to the statements issued by Madhabi Puri Buch and Dhaval Buch , who both worked in the private sector, officials said required disclosures had been made, which may not be in public domain like those of civil servants.While suggesting that some of Puri Buch's actions may have upset some of the market participants, sources said, the regulator has followed an elaborate consultation paper, even in the case of REITs, amid suggestions by Hindenburg that the rules benefited Blackstone, where Dhaval is an adviser.Market players are closely monitoring govt's response, given that Puri Buch has over six months to go as Sebi chief and is eligible for another term. She took over as Sebi chief in March 2022 and was given a three-year term.","Government unlikely to immediately step into the controversy created by the Hindenburg report.

Government moves to ready ground for 5% ethanol mix in diesel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-moves-to-ready-ground-for-5-ethanol-mix-in-diesel/articleshow/112451657.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt is looking at a new plan of 5% blending of ethanol in diesel (ED-5) as it moves closer to achieving the target of 20% blending in petrol in the next two years.The PMO last week held a meeting on the new proposal with all ministries concerned, sources said.In June, ethanol blending with petrol touched 15.9%. Sources said govt wants to get the ground ready for ethanol blending in diesel.""Though ethanol blending in diesel will mean that we have to produce more of this green fuel, it will be good for the environment and cut our crude oil imports and save foreign exchange,"" said an official.TOI has learned that Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) had done a trial run in 2018-19. The trial was done on BS-III and BS-VI buses to assess vehicular performance, emission and durability. The test was conducted for 500 hours and no major failure was recorded. Sources said the pilot project found fuel consumption was slightly lower than normal diesel.However, the trial of ethanol-blended diesel has so far not been done on BS-VI vehicles. One of the oil PSUs is likely to undertake a trial of the fuel on a heavy-duty vehicle for assessment.Recently, while replying to a question in RS, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said blending of ethanol with diesel was at an experimental stage and initial tests showed the formation of deposits in fuel tanks and other implications.","PMO last week held a meeting on the new proposal with all ministries concerned.

Hindenburg report claims Adani's regulator immunity tied to Sebi chairperson

Adani Group dismisses Hindenburg claims

NEW DELHI: The political clash between Congress and the BJP intensified on Sunday after US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research levelled allegations against Sebi chairperson Madhabi Buch . The Congress party demanded immediate government action to address potential conflicts of interest in the regulator's investigation of the Adani Group and called for a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to investigate the full scope of the ""scam"" involving senior officials.Hindenburg's latest report accused Buch and her husband of having stakes in offshore funds allegedly linked to the Adani money siphoning scandal.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said that Sebi had previously cleared ""Adani, a close associate of PM Modi,"" in the Supreme Court following the January 2023 revelations by Hindenburg Research.However, he noted that new allegations have now emerged involving a ""quid-pro-quo"" concerning the Sebi chief.""The small & medium investors belonging to the middle class who invest their hard-earned money in the stock market need to be protected, as they believe in the Sebi. A joint parliamentary committee (JPC) inquiry is imperative to investigate this massive scandal,"" he said.""Until then, concerns persist that PM Modi will continue to shield his ally, compromising India's Constitutional institutions, painstakingly built over seven decades,"" Kharge said in a post on X.In response, BJP leader Rajeev Chandrashekhar dismissed the allegations as part of a ""conspiracy"" to destabilise India's financial system. He also accused the opposition party of seeking foreign assistance to undermine the independent regulator, Sebi, and to create chaos in the country.""This is a conspiracy and some forces are working together to destabilise India's economy and discredit our regulator, stock markets and financial system. It is something that we should never allow as our country is on the path of expansion and growth. Using these innuendos and lies against an independent regulator is a crime. Nothing in the report is credible. This is a conspiracy and deliberate attack on India's economy,"" said Chandrasekhar.The grand old party has also questioned why Sebi's official twitter account is currently locked and inaccessible to the public.Later in the day, leader of opposition and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi asserted that the integrity of Sebi has been seriously undermined by the allegations against its chairperson.""The integrity of Sebi, the securities regulator entrusted with safeguarding the wealth of small retail investors, has been gravely compromised by the allegations against its chairperson,"" Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet.Rahul also questioned why Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch has not resigned, calling on the government for an explanation. He further inquired, ""If investors lose their hard-earned money, who will be held accountable—PM Modi, the SEBI Chairperson, or Gautam Adani?""In a post on X, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said that Sebi's official Twitter account is ""locked"" and thus inaccessible to the general public.""Some reports suggest it may have been locked for a while, but this continued inaccessibility - at a time when evidence of conflict of interest by its top leadership has come out - is puzzling. The Modani scandal has been brewing for many months now, and the Sebi's inaction has been a recurring disappointment,"" Ramesh said.He raised concerns about why the account was locked, saying, ""This opacity leads to questions about whether the platform has been quietly deleting past advisories/press releases which may be incriminating the organisation/its leadership on the Modani scam,"" Ramesh said.Meanwhile, the BJP MP and spokesperson, Sudhanshu Trivedi intimated the Congress's involvement behind the Hindenburg report and said such foreign reports come only at the commencement of Parliament session.In an interview with a news agency, Trivedi said, ""For the past few years, whenever the Parliament session commences, a foreign report gets released. BBC documentary was released just before the Parliament session. The Hindenburg report came in January just before the Parliament session. Sometimes there is a report on religious freedom or sometimes there is a report on farmers from foreign countries or sometimes Greta Thunberg's statement. All these sequences happen during the Parliament session. Today, when the opposition is carrying forward such reports, then it is suspected that the opposition has some connections with the abroad to create instability and anarchy during every Parliament session of India.""Allies of the INDIA bloc have also focused on the 'Adani-Sebi' connection highlighted in the Hindenburg report. The Trinamool Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, and CPI(M) have criticised the ruling BJP-led NDA government for its close ties with industrialist Gautam Adani.AAP MP Sanjay Singh has alleged that the Modi govt is deeply embroiled in corruption and is attempting to protect ""their friend Adani.""In a post on X, Singh claimed, ""The Hindenburg revelations were hinted at three days before Modi ended the Parliament session. The Modi Government is corrupt from top to bottom. To shield his friend Adani, Modi Ji has had the investigation handled by the same Sebi chairperson allegedly involved in the scam with Adani. The Supreme Court should reconsider its decision.""TMC leader Mahua Moitra also took to X, posting, ""In true Adani style, even the Sebi Chairman is an investor in his group. Crony capitalism at its finest. @CBIHeadquarters & @Dir_ED – will you be filing POCA and PMLA cases or not?""CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, in a post on X, said, ""The latest Hindenburg revelations have accused the regulator, SEBI, and that its chairperson herself is part of the manipulation. She must immediately quit and a Joint Parliamentary Committee to be constituted for the investigation.""Earlier on Saturday, US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research made new allegations, claiming, ""We had previously noted Adani's total confidence in continuing to operate without the risk of serious regulatory intervention, suggesting that this may be explained through Adani's relationship with Sebi chairperson, Madhabi Buch.""The report went on to assert, ""What we hadn't realised: the current Sebi chairperson and her husband, Dhaval Buch, had hidden stakes in the exact same obscure offshore Bermuda and Mauritius funds, found in the same complex nested structure, used by Vinod Adani.""Hindenburg Research stated that these new allegations are based on documents provided by a whistleblower and investigations conducted by other entities.In January 2023, Hindenburg had published a report accusing the Adani Group of financial irregularities, which led to a significant drop in the company's stock price. The Adani Group had strongly denied these claims at the time.The Hindenburg report alleged stock manipulation and fraud by the Adani Group, claiming the conglomerate had inflated its share prices. Following the publication of these allegations, there was a sharp decline in the stock prices of various Adani Group companies.In January 2024, the Supreme Court rejected a request to transfer the investigation into the stock price manipulation allegations to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) and instructed market regulator Sebi to conclude its probe into two pending cases within three months.Earlier this year, the top court also dismissed a plea to review its previous verdict, which had mandated an investigation by Sebi into the Adani-Hindenburg case.However, the Adani Group has strongly rejected the recent claims from Hindenburg Research, dismissing them as ""distractions from a desperate organisation showing complete disregard for Indian laws.""","US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research levelled allegations against Sebi chairperson Madhabi Buch. Congress party demanded immediate government action to address potential conflicts of interest. BJP leader Rajeev Chandrashekhar dismissed the allegations as part of a ""conspiracy"" to destabilise India's financial system.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112444112,imgsize-894379,width-400,resizemode-4/112444112.jpg"
"Prime Minister Modi releases 109 new varieties of crops, suggests farm experts to engage with farmers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prime-minister-modi-releases-109-new-varieties-of-crops-suggests-farm-experts-to-engage-with-farmers/articleshow/112446631.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday released 109 high-yielding, climate-resilient and biofortified varieties of 61 crops, including 34 field crops and 27 horticultural crops, and suggested that the ‘ Krishi Vigyan Kendras ’ (KVKs) - agri extension centres - should proactively inform farmers about the benefits of the new varieties as it will help them produce more, spend less and earn more.Farmers will receive seeds of all these new varieties within three years.The Prime Minister also proposed that experts from KVKs, Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR ), and state agricultural universities engage with farmers one day each month and the goal of this exchange should be to tackle a current issue related to agriculture and attempt to identify answers through mutual learning.It is expected that the regular interaction may not only help farmers know the best farm practices and effectiveness of new varieties but also solve their problems of how to get the best price of their produce. Such an exchange may also be helpful in handling the simmering tensions among farmers at a time when a section of them has constantly been on protest mode demanding better price of their produce either through minimum support price (MSP) or other interventions.New crop varieties, developed by scientists of ICAR, include nine of paddy, six of maize, two of wheat, one each of jawar, bajra and ragi, seven of different oilseeds, 11 of pulses, five of cotton and four of sugarcane. Among horticultural crops, the new varieties include three of mango, two of guava, one of pomegranate and two of tomato among others fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants. These crop varieties are developed for different agro-climatic zones of the country, focusing on short duration, resistance to floods and droughts/heat, and adaptability to various biotic and abiotic conditions.Interacting with farmers here at farms of ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), PM Modi emphasised on how these climate-resilient varieties of different crops would increase the yield as well as farmers' income in addition to encouraging them towards environment-friendly sustainable farming practices.The Prime Minister on the occasion also discussed the importance of millets and underlined how people are moving towards nutritious food. Talking about the benefits of natural farming and the increasing faith of common people towards organic farming, he noted that people have started consuming and demanding organic foods and therefore adoption oforganic farming by farmers would be quite beneficial for them.Agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also accompanied PM Modi to the ICAR-IARI farms. Calling it a historic day for farmers, he said the release of new varieties of crops is the best example of a ""lab to land"" programme.The move to release these 109 new varieties was announced by the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her budget presentation on July 23. Release of new improved varieties of seeds is a regular process by the ICAR which is driving innovation and technology development to maintain the agri-productivity, keeping in view changing climate and evolving biotic and abiotic stresses.The ICAR - premier public sector farm research institution - released as many as 323 varieties of 56 crops including cereals, oilseeds, forage crops, and sugarcane were released during 2023-24. These varieties include 27 biofortified and 289 climate-resilient varieties for the various biotic and abiotic stresses.The ICAR's records show that a total of 2,593 high-yielding varieties were released during 2014-15 to 2023-24. These varieties include 2,177 climate resilient (83% of total) with biotic and abiotic stress resistance, and 150 biofortified ones. High-yielding fine grain aromatic Basmati rice varieties (Pusa Basmati 1121, Pusa basmati 1509, Pusa Basmati 1401 and Pusa Basmati 17180, which contribute to annual export of more than Rs. 42,000 crores, are among the most successful varieties developed by the institution.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday released 109 high-yielding, climate- resilient and biofortified varieties of 61 crops, including 34 field crops and 27 horticultural crops.

India Commissions INS Arighat: Second Nuclear Submarine Armed with Nuclear Missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-fully-ready-to-add-to-fleet-2nd-sub-with-n-tipped-missiles/articleshow/112433199.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is now all set to commission its second nuclear-powered submarine armed with nuclear missiles for strategic deterrence, while the project to build two nuclear-powered attack submarines with conventional weapons is also headed for final approval amid China’s fast-expanding naval footprint in the Indian Ocean Region.The 6,000-tonne INS Arighat , constructed at the ship-building centre (SBC) at Vizag, is “fully ready” for formal commissioning after extensive trials that saw some technical issues being ironed out with upgrades over an extended period.“The SSBN (naval parlance for nuclear-propelled submarines with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles) will be commissioned within a month or two. She will then join her sister INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018,” a source told TOI.Parallelly, on the conventional (non-nuclear) warfare front, the around Rs 40,000 crore project to indigenously construct two nuclear-powered submarines, armed with torpedoes, anti-ship and land-attack missiles, is now before the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security for the final nod after repeated iterations and inter-ministerial consultations, another source said.The initial case was for six such 6,000-tonne `hunter-killer’ submarines (called SSNs) under `Project-77’ at the SBC. But it was first whittled down to three and now stands at two vessels. It will take at least a decade to build the first two SSNs, which will be around 95% indigenous, while the next four will be approved at a later stage, the source said.As per long-standing approved plans, India requires at least 18 diesel-electric submarines, four SSBNs and six SSNs to tackle the twin-threat from China and Pakistan, which is also turning collusive in the maritime domain after the land borders.The country, however, currently has only one SSBN in INS Arihant, which is propelled by an 83 MW pressurized light-water reactor at its core, and 16 diesel-electric submarines. Moreover, the conventional underwater combat fleet consists of six old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW submarines, apart from six new French-origin Scorpenes.China, in contrast, already has 60 submarines, and is fast building more. Its fleet includes six Jin-class SSBNs, armed with JL-3 missiles that have a strike range of 10,000 km, and six SSNs.INS Arighat will to a certain extent strengthen India’s weakest leg of the nuclear triad, or the capability to fire nukes from land, air and sea. The land and air vectors, with the Agni ballistic missiles and fighters with nuclear gravity bombs, are relatively more robust.While INS Arighat will also be armed with 750-km range K-15 missiles like INS Arihant, she can carry a larger number of them. The real teeth will come when the third SSBN, the slightly larger 7,000-tonne INS Aridhaman with 3,500-km range K-4 missiles, is commissioned next year.The fourth SSBN, which will be able to carry more K-4 missiles, is also being constructed under the secretive Rs 90,000 crore advanced technology vessel (ATV) project launched decades ago. There is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs with much more powerful 190 MW reactors.Bigger SSBNs with longer-range missiles will give India’s deterrence posture greater credibility because they are the most secure and survivable platforms for assured retaliatory strikes after a first-strike by an adversary.The SSNs, in turn, are critical because they can discreetly operate at high speeds for long distances while remaining submerged for extended periods to take out enemy targets unlike diesel-electric submarines that have to surface or “snorkel” every few days to get oxygen to recharge their batteries.Till the indigenous SSNs roll out, India is slated to get an advanced Akula-class SSN on lease from Russia in 2026 under the $3 billion deal inked in Mar 2019, as reported by TOI earlier.","The 6,000-tonne INS Arighat is ‘fully ready’ for formal commissioning after extensive trials.

You have been one of the early investors in OpenAI. You have also invested in AI startups in India. As a longtime technologist and tech investor what are your views on AI and the opportunities it offers?

Where does one start? What would be the roles for the government, private sector?

If the government wanted to take and offer it as their service, we'd give all the technology for free. Vinod Khosla

AI can assess and teach students better than humans: Vinod Khosla

Medical diagnostics in rural areas is an issue, not so much getting a doctor online. How do you think AI can solve this problem?

Vinod Khosla on challenges of matching patient-doctor ratios with the West

An ultrasound can be done by an AI. You don't need an ultrasound technician anymore. Vinod Khosla

How medical tech can reach every Indian: Vinod Khosla

India has large youth unemployment and the fear is that AI could worsen it…

Doctors and tutors: Entrepreneur Vinod Khosla's vision for new digital India

AI can train an Uber driver to perform cardiac ultrasounds in a week: Vinod Khosla

Are you talking about guaranteed work or guaranteed income?

Should it be a universal basic income?

Do we want farm labourers to be earning (low) farm wages working in 45 degrees centigrade? No, that's not a job. It's servitude, but it’s a necessity today.. we can change the nature of those jobs. Vinod Khosla

How should AI be regulated? There are differing views on this.

What do you think about the future of entrepreneurship as an individual passion, and startup as a business in India?

Risk taking is very different from the financial venture ecosystem in India--it’s less risk taking and more focused on growth investments. I hope we start to get to more fundamental risk taking in India. Vinod Khosla

Should the government play a role in setting up a large fund itself?

You were one the earliest backers of Sam Altman. What prompted you to invest in Open AI?

We have to find somebody who has a vision and can make that happen. Mukesh Ambani did that with Jio. Sam Altman is doing it with Gen AI. He was a big part of my belief in AI. Vinod Khosla

Dependence on technology is also creating a lazy workforce at a time when India needs to reap benefits from the demographic dividend...

Technology can't override centuries-old human motivations: Vinod Khosla

You have worked closely with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus who is heading the transition government in Bangladesh. What are your hopes for him and the country?

What is your assessment of his ability to sort out the issues in Bangladesh?

On July 22 you had an exchange with Elon Musk on X which was one of the most mature exchanges of views that Musk has had on US politics...

Between the perils of tomorrow and promise of tomorrow,has always bet on the latter. That’s why billionaire founder of Khosla Ventures, who describes himself as a ‘techno-optimist with caring & empathy’, is busy convincing the world of an AI-powered future that can be good for all. Among the first investors in Open AI--and several Indian AI startups--Khosla spoke toofon a host of issues ranging from AI to startups to Mohammand Yunus and Elon Musk. Here’s an edited excerpt:Let’s look at a couple of different aspects of AI. From the national security point of view, governments want to be in control of their AI destiny, not be dependent on foreign algorithms. This is why we invested in Sarvam in India. Because India should have a national AI champion. We have invested in a company called Sakana in Japan.Japan has already announced doubling its national defence budget. They made it clear that AI be a Japanese AI, so they have control over it. Sovereignty and AI are important at a level people don’t quite understand.I would like to see a primary care physician for every Indian, available 24/7, for free as part of the set of digital services the government offers. Aadhaar was the first example of such a service. The hardest part of that service was identity, and that’s already done. With UPI payments are done too. There’s no reason not to add other digital services -- the two most important ones are a free tutor for every child and a free primary care doctor for every citizen of the country.I would like to send a clear message to the Indian government that AI educators, AI teachers for every child in India would cost far, far less than today’s schools and provide much more personalised instruction. Similarly, AI primary care doctors could scale primary care and health far better than any other way.None of these are hard technologies in today's context of AI, and we are working on both. If the Indian government wanted to take and offer it as their service, we would give them all the technology for free.There’s no agenda here. I’d give them all the technology for free, so it becomes a government service, and nobody has any questions about what the agenda is, other than these services should be available to every Indian and every Indian child and even adult education. It's very, very doable in the very short term, and I mean two to five years max.My wife is in India right now, talking about our free AI tutor (CK-12 tutor). One way is to just take it over. It's used in many countries already. It's being translated into 120 different languages. I'm fine if they develop it inside India and take it over and have a starting point that's useful today.Kids using this tutor do better. Turns out it's not only cheaper, but also substantially better. It can teach each kid at the level at which they are, in their language, in a way that the kid will understand best. For example, the same physics concept can be explained using the analogy of cricket or dance depending on which kid understands better with what analogy. You can generate AI explanations in real time, generate the content so it looks more interesting, though it's teaching the same concept.An AI tutor would change the level and method of teaching depending on each student’s level of understanding. If they're not keeping up with the class. Teach them in simpler steps, change the language…I really hope this becomes a national agenda in India. We would give the technology. The content is already there. I think fairly large chunks are translated into the Indian context. It's relatively lightweight to launch it as part of the digital public infrastructure.Digital public infrastructure should include payments, which are basic financial services everybody needs. It should include education. It should include primary healthcare. You can then expand it to others. This can be done, and it can be done philanthropically.In India we started ‘10 Bed ICU’ during Covid, because ICUs were not available in most parts of rural India. I donated the first couple of 100 to remote areas and we wanted to cover all 700 remote districts in India. It’s working really, really well.AI lets you take an unskilled person and teach them very quickly how to do skilled tasks, because the expertise sits in the AI. A 10-bed ICU is a very simple version of it, typically under the supervision of a regional hospital. A hospital in Manipur would cover the remote areas around it. It’s just the beginning of what is really possible.Yes, if you need an MRI, you are going to go to a city to get an MRI. But for simpler things like even an ultrasound can be done by an AI. You don’t need an ultrasound technician anymore. You can buy these devices for Rs 50,000 rupees. Of course, there’s expensive ones too, but small handheld, portable ones are becoming inexpensive and adapted to the Indian environment. All 6 lakh, however many villages there are, should have one. In fact, these diagnostics can be put in one van -- blood test, ultrasound, ECG...We have a company called Alivecor that sells ECG machines in the US for $99. They diagnose without a cardiologist 35 different cardiology conditions with AI. It’s FDA approved. Most of cardiology can be done with a simple device, and you don't need expertise, and expertise is what’s expensive. The cardiologist is what takes 20 years to train. And so this is the promise that I hope India pivots to rapidly.This is a real issue. Firstly, you can upgrade the skills of India’s youth very quickly with AI. We had a company (that General Electric bought) to teach an Uber driver to do a cardiac ultrasound in a week. It's FDA approved. This is an extension of the idea of an AI tutor, which is where we should start. You can impart skills, which very quickly, can be upgraded so they can participate at a higher level. The countries that do this well will be more competitive than others.Secondly, it’s hard to imagine the kind of abundance we can get (in an AI-driven economy). If GDP grows 10% in real terms for the next 25 years, you can imagine the standard living we can achieve and the kind of surplus we can have to provide income and other support to people for whom transition will be hard.The economy can grow much, much faster, and people can be upskilled much faster. We should think about the transition period. There’s very much Utopia at the other end, but, but there is a transition period, and people will get disrupted.India has schemes for guaranteed work. I think we will have to get guaranteed income.I think it will be absolutely required. I first wrote about it in 2016 that AI will cause great GDP growth, great productivity growth. I ended that piece by saying, we will need to think about universal basic income. It’s very clear to me, it's where it leads, but there will be enough abundance.If we are thinking of the world in 2050 do we want farm labourers to be earning farm wages working in 45 degrees centigrade heat in the fields? No, that's not a job. In my view it's servitude, but it’s a necessity today, and if we can change the nature of those jobs then it’s a good thing.The notion of GDP creation and GDP acceleration is separate from the notion of distribution in the west. It’s a controversial idea… everybody wants low taxes. India is in a much better position to tackle it, things like guaranteed work schemes were a bad idea from an economist point of view when they were enacted. They may not be a bad idea in the world of AI, because they are really ways for redistributing income.I believe there’s some right level of regulation. I was very involved in what President Biden did with what's called the ‘executive order on AI’, and that was the right level to focus it on.The technology is in very early stages. Remember, it was only December of 2022 that ChatGPT was released. It’s so new, most people haven't had time to adjust. And my bet is that in 6-12, months from now, the capability will be substantially better than it is today.Technology is making rapid progress, but, you know, human beings adjust at their pace, and jobs will take a decade or two to adjust.If you look at my robot prediction (over a billion robots that will do most of the low-value labour work done today), it’s like creating a business larger than the auto industry globally. How long does that take to put in place? A long time. So the physical world moves at a different pace, even with technology like robots. We just have to recognize that these things have to be managed and managed closely. Regulation may need to protect certain people.The venture business in the US is very different what’s what’s called the private equity business, which is the investing business, where you run spreadsheets and you calculate rates of return. We just bet on big ideas and we bet on technological risk. India’s startup system has been closer to private equity than real risk taking.If you need a physics invention or an AI algorithm invented, you don’t know you can do it when you start. So, risk taking is very different from the financial venture ecosystem in India. It is less risk taking and more focused on growth investments. I hope we start to get to more fundamental risk taking in India.I don’t think governments should be in this business. It’s too dynamic a business for governments.Look, there are so many good ideas. People don’t try them, and when they try them, you need certain types of special individuals to make them happen. These things don’t happen because some academic made a forecast. They happen because one person decides to change things.When Elon Musk said, I will build an electric car, every major automaker in the world had given up on it. In fact, the department of energy here did a forecast for the number of electric cars in 2035 which Elon Musk (Tesla) exceeded in 2016 itself.So, big companies and institutions don't do these things. We have to find somebody who has a vision and can make that happen. Mukesh Ambani did that with Jio. He said, I will lay fibre... I don’t care about the market. Everybody thought it was a stupid 10 billion investment. He just made it happen. So it takes individuals, and Sam was a big part of my belief in AI.The one problem technology will not solve is human motivation. If there’s an easier way, humans tend to take it. I am not sure we should say technology will solve every problem, because human motivations will not change. They haven’t changed for the last 500 years. In the new context, they're presented differently, but personal self interest has always been the case. Less work and more goods has always been something people strive for.I have been to Bangladesh and over the last three to six months, I have been in touch with him (Yunus) and all of his people and writing in support of him when he was being put in jail. I was very much advocating he not be sent to jail, which the then prime minister had wanted to do. I was very much part of the process of trying to give it enough visibility so he doesn’t get sent to jail.Most of it is through public relations influence. There was a full paid ad in the New York Times. Richard Branson and I and a few others funded that. It was much less with the government itself, much more general public pressure and visibility, which obviously autocrats don’t love.It's not my area of expertise. I have been there, I have talked to him a lot. I know he is a caring man, and we have gotten to know him over the years and his foundation. But as to the status of the country, it's very hard to say. As far as I can tell Yunus has said that he has no interest in being in politics, so it is very unlikely he will play a role other than the interim role. He is mostly interested in helping the transition and getting out of the way, and hopefully we will see democratic elections.My interaction with him on Twitter was the most rational discourse I have seen. It was not emotional. It was rational. It got close to 14 or 15 million views because it was rational.Elon is an emotional person, so his comments on the UK riots, I don’t know why he's wading into that. Obviously, he is not doing it because he has an agenda. He has nothing to gain from that.On the question of liberal views versus sort of super conservative views. I don’t think he is particularly religious, so it's not like he’s a religious conservative. I do think there’s a personal side of him that rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, because of the situation with one of his children. I think that's where it goes into the emotional domain as opposed to the logical domain of what’s good for progress, what's good for government. He is a very smart guy, obviously.",Vinod Khosla is one of the first investors in Open AI and several Indian AI startups.

AAP, meanwhile, demanded PM Narendra Modi’s resignation over the issue.SP chief too wrote on X: “There should be a historical investigation of Sebi because the history of Sebi has been such that it has never become the true protector and support of investors.

He said, “A JPC inquiry is imperative to investigate this massive scandal. Until then, concerns persist that PM Modi will continue to shield his ally, compromising India’s constitutional institutions, painstakingly built over seven decades.”Party spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said the SC expert panel had noted that the Sebi had shown strange reluctance to probe the Adani ‘MegaScam’, while underlining that the Sebi had in 2018 diluted, and in 2019 entirely deleted, the reporting requirements relating to the ultimate beneficial ownership of foreign funds, which tied the hands of the expert panel and led to Sebi’s failure to reach to the bottom of the irregularities.AAP’s Sanjay Singh, demanding a JPC, said, “Any statement or report made by the Sebi chief in the SC on Adani’s probe has no meaning. The Court should take cognisance of this, because the truth has been hidden from it.”Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate asked if the govt curtailed the Budget session of Parliament because it was aware of the impending release of Hindenburg report.","Alleged quid pro quo between Adani Group and Sebi chief Madhabi Buch following fresh Hindenburg claims.

Chhattisgarh High Court Condemns Physical Punishment in Schools, Upholds Teacher's Accountability

The Chhattisgarh High Court condemned corporal punishment in schools, calling it inhumane and a violation of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. This ruling came as the court dismissed a petition by Sister Mercy, accused of abetting a student's suicide, stating her actions were part of regular disciplinary procedures but resulted in mental trauma for students.

Indore school teacher accused of strip-searching girl students removed

In Indore, Madhya Pradesh, a government teacher was removed and reassigned after allegations of strip-searching girl students in search of a mobile phone. Parents accused the teacher of inappropriate behavior and beating the students. Authorities are investigating the incident, and the police have involved a woman officer to ensure a thorough and sensitive inquiry.

BENGALURU: Various stakeholders of private schools , including managements, teachers, and non-teaching staff, will observe Aug 15 as a black day , protesting against the lack of freedom and ease in running schools.Speaking at a press conference Tuesday, D Shashi Kumar, convener of Karnataka Private School Managements Teaching and Non-Teaching Staff Coordination Committee, said there is no freedom to run a “quality educational institution”.“The education department doesn’t honour any of the court orders. They don’t understand the challenges faced by private schools. Private schools aren’t involved in any of the policy decisions taken by the govt,” he alleged.Shashi Kumar’s accusations come at a time when the department has appealed against a high court order on the matter of renewal of recognition, which was in favour of private schools.“After 20 months of the court order, the education department has appealed against the order. It is impossible for old schools to have the same certificates as the new ones,” he said.“We require around 50 certificates from various departments, including that of fire safety and building safety. All these departments are engulfed in corruption. That the education department wants these rules back is only to encourage corruption,” he added.Meanwhile, teachers of govt primary schools have also threatened to go on a strike on Aug 12. The strike will be held from 9am to 5pm at Freedom Park and is expected to host thousands of teachers.“The new recruitment and promotion rules should be applicable only to teachers appointed after 2017, they shouldn’t be retrospective for those who applied before 2016,” said Chandrashekhar Nugli, president of Karnataka State Primary School Teachers’ Association.In case the govt doesn’t pay heed to the demands, the association plans to observe Sept 5 as a black day and also refrain from teaching classes 6-8.","Chhattisgarh High Court condemned corporal punishment in schools, calling it inhumane and a violation of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.

Singh had been battling a prolonged illness and was receiving treatment at Medanta Hospital in Gurugram, near Delhi.Born in 1931 in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, Singh's career spanned several fields.He started as a career diplomat , joining the Indian Foreign Service in 1953. His diplomatic service included key postings in China, the US, Pakistan, and the UK. He also played significant roles as secretary-general of the Non-aligned Summit and Chief Coordinator of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 1983.In 1984, Singh transitioned from diplomacy to politics, joining the Indian National Congress and winning the Bharatpur seat in the Lok Sabha. He served as a Union minister of state until 1989. Singh's return to prominence came in 2004 when he was appointed minister for external affairs under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.In 2005, the UN's Volcker Committee implicated Singh in the Iraqi oil scam, leading to his resignation from the ministry and the Congress party.In 2006, The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had investigated a Rs 8 crore transaction linked to the 'oil-for-food' scam. The money was traced from London-based NRI businessman Aditya Khanna's account to his Delhi account and was suspected to have been distributed among Indian beneficiaries, including former external affairs minister Natwar Singh. The funds, identified as part of the scam's proceeds, were reportedly transferred to India after paying a commission to a Swiss firm.He had a strong rapport with former Prime Ministers Indira and Rajiv Gandhi but fell out with Sonia Gandhi over the scandal, upset that they did not defend him. Following his resignation, Singh joined the Bahujan Samaj Party but was expelled within months.""At the time of the Rajya Sabha elections, he had expressed his desire to enter into the fray on BSP ticket but as there were several dedicated party workers who should have been given priority over Singh he was told that neither a capitalist nor an opportunist would be fielded"", BSP national general secretary Satish Chandra Misra had told TOI.Aside from his political and diplomatic work, Singh was a prolific author. His books include 'The Legacy of Nehru: A Memorial Tribute,' 'My China Diary 1956-88,' and his autobiography 'One Life is Not Enough.'Singh was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1984.","Singh had been battling a prolonged illness and was receiving treatment at Medanta Hospital in Gurugram, near Delhi.

Panathur Road: BBMP's Oversight Turns 3.5km into 1.2-Hour Epic Trip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bbmps-oversight-turns-35km-into-12-hour-epic-trip/articleshow/112358096.cms,"The winding S-Cross and narrow railway under bridge is a notorious bottleneck on Panathur Rd

BENGALURU: In a quirky twist to the usual race for speed, Bengaluru’s tech hub is now hosting an unintentional contest: “Who takes the longest time to cover the shortest distance?”The spotlight falls on the ever-clogged Panathur Road , where travel time on the nearly 3.5km has hit an astonishing low. Commuters are now spending an average of 1.2 hours navigating this stretch, which connects with Outer Ring Road (ORR) that is dotted with multi-national companies.Panathur Road, especially the winding S-Cross and the narrow railway under bridge, is a notorious bottleneck that turns a short trip into an epic journey, highlighting the city’s never-ending struggle with its road conditions.Namma Balagere, a group of resident welfare associations, recently took to social media platform X to voice their concern, posting an image in which a car took 86 minutes to cover 3.5km. Calling it a ‘new record’, Namma Balagere (@BalagereConnect) dared BBMP to show if there was any other record beating this. “Imagine the condition of commuters,” the X post asked while underlining the fact that the stretch was just 2km from ORR.This sparked a wave of responses, with users sharing their own speedometer readings and journey times. Sandeep Reddy, an ‘X’ user, posted a picture of his speedometer showing a distance of 2.5km taking over 1.54 hours to cover, captioning it, “Can’t beat mine.” Asish Thomas, another user, shared that a 17.6-km stretch took 3.39 hours to traverse. The flood of complaints highlighted the dire state of the road, with users like Cumar K urging residents to take direct action by sitting in front of their MLA’s office, reminiscent of Gandhi’s protests.Manjunath Reddy, a resident, lamented, “The distance between Kadubeesanahalli and Balagere Road is just 6km, but due to poor road conditions, it takes more than two hours to commute.” He added that BBMP officials have promised improvements, though residents remain skeptical.Ramya K, another resident, described the daily challenges, noting that even a short trip to the grocery store can take 45 minutes due to slow-moving traffic and numerous potholes. Sunil P from Balagere, said: “The stretch is already congested, and with heavy vehicle movement, traffic worsens. People can walk to work faster than travelling by car or bike.”A volunteer from Namma Balagere highlighted the lack of alternative routes and the narrowness of the road, calling for the construction of a comprehensive development plan (CDP) road over the rail over bridge (ROB).Residents feel their complaints are falling on deaf ears. “We have written letters, conducted email campaigns, and even met deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar regarding the issue, but nobody seems to care,” a volunteer said. The BJP MLA, except for showing up when public pressure intensifies and assuring road development, has been of little help, he added.BBMP’s engineer-in-chief BS Prahalad said: “We are working with the railway department on finding a solution. In less than six months, we will widen the road and resolve the issue.”","Panathur Road, especially the winding S-Cross and the narrow railway under bridge, is a notorious bottleneck that turns a short trip into an epic journey.

But look at the persons from district judiciary who after being appointed as HC judges have a tenure of less than four to five years. They get a pension of Rs 15-25,000. Their tenure in the district judiciary is not counted. We have a slew of petitions by such retired HC judges.”“To get a pension of Rs 15-25,000 after spending the entire life in the judiciary is no social security for them. Look at the profile of such retired HC judges. They, except a few who can be counted on fingertips, do not return to practice nor do arbitration work after retirement. My earnest appeal to both of you (AG and SG) to sit down with the concerned officials (of the ministry) and examine the issue to arrive at a reasonable solution,” the CJI said.Though the AG reiterated that the issue involves multiple aspects, the SG said he and the AG would surely examine the issues involved regarding the pension. The CJI said, “We do understand the financial implications. But as the Supreme Court, we must also discharge our duties as the guardian of the judiciary,” he said and posted the matter for hearing on Aug 27.","The Supreme Court expressed grave concern over the pittance of pension received by retired HC judges, who were appointed as HC judges after spending their entire life in the district judiciary.

Bangladesh: Dozens Of Hasina's Party Members Chased & Killed In Mob Attacks; 29 Bodies Found

Heavy rains in Brazil have led to a remarkable paleontological discovery : a 233 million-year-old dinosaur fossil . This significant find was made in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , near the town of São João do Polêsine. The fossil, which is almost fully preserved, was unearthed next to a reservoir after torrential rains eroded parts of the fossil site.The dinosaur, believed to be a member of the Herrerasauridae family , roamed the Earth during the Triassic Period when all the continents were part of a single landmass known as Pangea.Herrerasaurids were among the earliest carnivorous dinosaurs, and this particular specimen is estimated to have been about 2.5 meters (8 feet) long. The discovery was made by a team led by Rodrigo Temp Müller , a paleontologist from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM).The site where the fossil was found has been a focus of paleontological research for about 20 years. The region is known for its rich deposits of Triassic fossils, which have provided valuable insights into the early evolution of dinosaurs . The recent heavy rains accelerated the erosion process, exposing the fossil that had been buried for millions of years. According to Müller, the fossil was initially thought to be just a few isolated bones, but further excavation revealed an almost complete skeleton.This discovery is particularly significant because it is one of the oldest dinosaur fossils ever found. The oldest known dinosaur fossils date back to around 231 million years ago, making this find potentially one of the earliest examples of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s excellent preservation allows scientists to study its anatomical details, which could provide new insights into the characteristics and behaviors of early dinosaurs.The Herrerasauridae family, to which this dinosaur belongs, includes some of the first known carnivorous dinosaurs. These dinosaurs were bipedal, meaning they walked on two legs, and had free hands with sharp claws for catching prey. The newly discovered fossil is expected to shed light on the evolutionary adaptations that allowed these early dinosaurs to thrive in their environment.The discovery has generated excitement in the scientific community, as it could help fill gaps in our understanding of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s age and preservation make it a valuable addition to the fossil record, offering a rare glimpse into the distant past. Researchers are now working to carefully extract the fossil from the surrounding rock and conduct detailed analyses to determine whether it represents a new species of dinosaur.The region where the fossil was found has been subject to increasingly severe weather events, including the heavy rains that led to this discovery. In June 2024, the state of Rio Grande do Sul experienced three months’ worth of rain within just two weeks, causing widespread flooding and displacing over 500,000 people. While the rains have accelerated the erosion process, they also pose a threat to newly exposed fossils, which can be damaged or destroyed if not promptly rescued.The Federal University of Santa Maria and other research institutions are now focused on preserving the fossil and conducting further studies. The findings from this discovery are expected to be published in scientific journals, contributing to our knowledge of early dinosaur evolution and the conditions that shaped their development.For the unversed, dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago. They were some of the most successful and varied animals ever to have lived, ranging from the small, bird-like Velociraptor to the gigantic, long-necked Brachiosaurus.Did you like this article?

CHENNAI: The city's streets are undergoing a safety upgrade as the Greater Chennai Traffic Police (GCTP) are introducing a new system to highlight accident-prone zones .This initiative involves marking areas that have seen multiple accidents with bright yellow circles , featuring illustrations of accidents and the relevant legal code, section 106 (BNS).These markings will be easily visible, even in low light, serving as a reminder to motorists to exercise caution.The decision to implement this system comes after a study conducted by police, which revealed that traditional warning boards often go unnoticed by drivers. Accidents in these zones could be attributed to various factors, including structural deficiencies in roads, poor light or visibility of road signs. By clearly marking these dangerous spots, police say they have already observed a reduction in the number of accidents, as drivers become more aware of the risks and adjust their behaviour accordingly.Additional commissioner of police, R Sudhakar, said this marking system is not entirely new, but it has been reintroduced due to its proven effectiveness in the past. Reports indicate that drivers have become more conscious of their speed and are likely to avoid risky manoeuvres in these marked zones, leading to a dip in accidents.So far, the GCTP has identified 156 locations across the city that require these safety markings. These include areas such as Thiruvanmiyur, Sastri Nagar , Anna Nagar , Eldams Road, Guindy, T Nagar, Adyar, and the East Coast Road (ECR).","Greater Chennai Traffic Police are introducing a new system to highlight accident-prone zones.

BENGALURU: Karnataka high court has ruled that insurance companies cannot avoid paying interest on amounts awarded under ' future prospects ' - a term to describe likely earnings if the victim had survived - in accident cases.A division bench consisting of Justices K Somashekar and Chillakur Sumalatha made the decision while dismissing an appeal filed by Reliance General Insurance Company.The case involved Supreeth , a software professional with a finance major who died in an accident on Nov 18, 2014, while returning from Sabarimala in a car with friends.The accident occurred on National Highway near a hotel on Hosur Road when a lorry ahead of the car suddenly turned right without signalling, causing the collision. Supreeth was seriously injured and died in hospital.On June 17, 2019, the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in Bengaluru awarded Rs 51.6 lakh compensation to Supreeth's family members, with the insurer being ordered to pay 95% of the amount.The insurer argued the car driver was also negligent, and that the car owner should be liable to pay a portion of the compensation. Additionally, the company claimed the awarded amount was excessive and the tribunal should not have awarded interest on the amount awarded under loss of prospects.After reviewing the evidence, the division bench found the accident was caused solely by the negligence of the lorry driver, as per the police investigation report. The bench noted that Supreeth was a 26-year-old MBA graduate.The bench emphasized the Motor Vehicles Act is beneficial legislation, and insurance companies are required to settle claims promptly. ""The award of an amount as compensation is a one-time procedure.Even if in the future course, it is found the deceased would have earned much more amount in light of hike in his position and global opportunities, the tribunals will not order payment of any further amount and insurance companies will not be made liable on that count.Such being the case, this court is of the view that the insurance companies are liable to pay the awarded amount, including the amount awarded under the head future prospects together with banking rate of interest which is prevalent during relevant time,"" the bench explained.""In no case, the claimants get the exact amount the deceased would have earned had he been alive.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Despite its highly-anticipated status, the sequel failed to meet fan expectations. After a strong opening day, 'Indian 2' saw a significant decline in box office performance and quickly wrapped up its run. As of August 9, the film has made its debut on OTT platforms and is available in multiple languages.However, within hours of its digital release, 'Indian 2' has been subject to a wave of social media trolling , as it continues to disappoint viewers online. Netizens have been sharing clips from the film to mock its perceived illogical scenes . Comparisons between Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth have also emerged, with fans noting that Haasan’s sequel included commercial elements that some felt detracted from its quality. Siddharth’s character in particular has faced scrutiny and criticism.The film on day 1 of its release made Rs 26 crore at the box office and by the end of its run, the movie managed to gross Rs 83 crore in India.Despite the backlash, Kamal Haasan's supporters have rallied to defend the film and the actor, sharing explanations and context for some of the scenes that have been criticized.Looking ahead, 'Indian' is set to expand with a third installment, 'Indian 3,' which will serve as a prequel to the original film. Kamal Haasan will portray a freedom fighter in this upcoming period drama, and Kajal Aggarwal, who did not appear in 'Indian 2,' will take on a leading role alongside Haasan. ' Indian 3 ' is scheduled for an early 2025 release, with its VFX work currently underway.","'Indian 2' has been subject to a wave of social media trolling.

TikTok’s ‘Underconsumption Core’ trend goes viral: Everything you need to know about this social media sensation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tiktoks-underconsumption-core-trend-goes-viral-everything-you-need-to-know-about-this-social-media-sensation/articleshow/112453522.cms,"TikTok’s ‘ underconsumption core ’ trend represents a significant shift in social media behavior, emphasizing minimalist living and sustainability over consumer excess. As the cost of living rises and social media continues to flood users with advertising and trends centered around material wealth, many young adults in the US are turning towards this new movement.This movement advocates for sustainable living , repurposing items, and focusing on quality over quantity, diverging sharply from the consumerism often showcased online.Kara Perez, a financial influencer, highlighted the growing dissatisfaction with constant consumer pressures. “When every moment of your life feels like you're being sold something and the price of said item keeps going up, people will burn out on spending money,” she was quoted by AFP as saying. This trend is gaining traction as individuals seek alternatives to the excess and materialism frequently promoted on platforms like TikTok.The ""underconsumption core"" trend emphasizes making do with what one already has and living more sustainably. This shift stands in stark contrast to the opulence often depicted by influencers on social media. Perez, who repurposes everyday items like jars for practical use, is part of this growing movement.TikTok user loveofearthco’s video, which critiques the culture of overconsumption, has amassed over 100,000 views. The video reflects a growing awareness of the pitfalls of excessive spending: “I spent money I didn’t have on things I didn’t need.”The US economy, while showing record corporate profits, has not alleviated the financial strain felt by many, especially younger generations. Culture analyst Tariro Makoni noted that this economic disparity can feel misleading. “It feels almost 'gaslighty' to consumers,” she said, suggesting that BNPL plans might exacerbate overconsumption and skew perceptions of financial stability.A recent surge in searches for ""underconsumption"" and related terms reflects a shift in priorities. The trend aligns with broader economic concerns, as many young adults face challenges in keeping up with social media-driven consumption patterns.Andrea Cheong, a UK-based influencer, observed that social media pressure can drive compulsive spending. Her recent video on mending old clothes exemplifies the ""underconsumption core"" approach, emphasizing sustainability and authenticity over fleeting trends.Ashley Ross of Bank of America noted that the ""underconsumption"" trend offers a practical way for Gen Z to manage their finances and adopt environmentally friendly practices. A 2024 survey found that high living costs are a major barrier for over half of Gen Z adults, underscoring the relevance of this movement.As the trend gains momentum, it reflects a broader cultural shift towards sustainability and mindful consumption. Anjali Zielinski’s participation in a ""Mending 101"" workshop with her daughter highlights how this approach resonates across generations. By teaching the value of preserving and repurposing items, Zielinski embodies the principles of ""underconsumption core,"" demonstrating that sustainable choices can span age groups and lifestyles.",TikTok’s ‘ underconsumption core ’ trend represents a significant shift in social media behavior.

""She resigned and the resignation letter is with the President. This has been confirmed. If the law ministry tells us to seek her return, I will do so,"" said Hossain.According to earlier accounts, Hasina wanted to announce her resignation in a TV address before leaving her official residence, but didn't get to do so because of army's insistence that she leave immediately in view of violent protesters closing in on her Ganabhaban residence.

Soaring mortgage rates imposed by the Bank of England to curtail price increases pushed up the cost of owning and renting homes. Effectively, that drove up the price of dissolving long-term partnerships.“Some people have postponed divorcing or separating until the economy is better,” said Joanna Newton, a partner at Stowe Family Law. “What one income may have covered previously — bills, childcare and other living expenses, that’s become increasingly stretched and increasingly more unaffordable.”The figures also support a broader decline in happiness levels across the UK. The number of Britons reporting high anxiety and low life satisfaction was above pre-Covid levels in the first quarter of 2024, according to household survey data published by the ONS on Thursday.The report showed the share of people unhappy with their relationship hit 6% in 2022, the most since 2014.Divorces in England and Wales are at their lowest level since 1971, according to separate figures published earlier this year. The number of divorces fell 30% on the year to 80,057 in 2022.That’s despite a landmark shakeup of divorce laws in 2020 aimed at improving the separation process by stopping one partner from contesting a divorce requested by their spouse. The reform also introduced so-called “no-fault” divorces, which no longer require one of the spouses to provide evidence of unreasonable behavior on the part of their partner.The economic trends overwhelmed that impact. And while real household incomes are growing again after inflation returned to the 2% target in the last two months, mortgage rates remain more than double the average in the years leading up to the pandemic, and the rental market is still red-hot.“I don’t think mortgage costs and interest rates have come down enough for people to feel comfortable and confident to push the button,” Newton said. “It’s a bit of ‘watch this space’.”The housing market was one of the key reasons why unhappy couples put off separation. The increase in mortgage costs — together with the spike in rental prices due to supply shortages, made moving out on their own out of reach for many. And while the housing market avoided a crash last year, some couples postponed putting their house on the market out of fear of selling at a loss.“Selling your house at the best possible time means more money to be split between the parties and purchase new accommodation,” Newton said.More than 30% of the 500 people surveyed by Stowe Family Law were sticking with their partners because they wouldn’t afford to leave alone, according to a report last year.The cost-of-living crisis was also one of the reasons why many relationships turned sour in recent years. About half of the respondents of the Stowe Family Law report said they hadn’t experienced any financial tensions before January 2022.Most said the cost-of-living crisis has affected their relationship. Respondents cited issues around rising utility and food bills, and worries they wouldn’t be able to maintain their current lifestyle, the report also said.In other words, financial strain is a common element in many unhappy relationships — a twist on Tolstoy’s conclusion in Anna Karenina that, “all happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”",The share of adults declaring themselves to be either fairly or extremely unhappy with their relationship is at the highest since 2014.
