"Biden administration satisfied with accountability it has demanded from India in Pannun case, says Garcetti",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/biden-administration-satisfied-with-accountability-it-has-demanded-from-india-in-pannun-case-says-garcetti/articleshow/109994410.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti expressed satisfaction with the accountability demanded by the Biden administration from India regarding allegations of officials' involvement in a plot to kill a Khalistani separatist on US soil.Speaking at a council on foreign relations event, Garcetti emphasized the importance of accountability in maintaining the US-India relationship, saying that this incident could potentially be the first significant challenge in their partnership.""When I was referring to a relationship that might have bumps along the road, this would be potentially the first big fight in a relationship. And so far, knock on wood, I would say the administration is satisfied with the accountability that we've demanded on this, because this is a red line for America, for our citizens,"" he said.Garcetti highlighted the ongoing criminal case and indictment, stressing that any connection to State actors must be met with accountability. He acknowledged India's establishment of a commission of inquiry and the expectation of shared information while the US pursues American justice.""So, there's been a commission of inquiry that India has brought together, and that we expect, while we do the criminal case that is about American justice, that there need to be consequences and shared information. So far, one of the most difficult things you can do as an ambassador in diplomacy, I have been satisfied with what they have done. I think the administration is, but we have many steps still to go,"" Garcetti said.The case revolves around Pannun, an India-designated terrorist holding American and Canadian citizenship.According to the US Justice Department's indictment, Nikhil Gupta was allegedly approached by an unidentified government employee to hire a hitman for the attempted assassination that was foiled by US police. However, the Russian and Indian authorities have expressed doubts about the Washington-provided evidence and have demanded hard evidence of India's purported participation in the plan.Amidst these developments, the ministry of external affairs has vehemently denied any official engagement in the reported assassination plot, dismissing it as baseless speculation. Describing it as an ""unwarranted and unsubstantiated"" imputation on a ""serious matter"" that is under investigation, MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the US media report was ""speculative and irresponsible.""","US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti expressed satisfaction with the accountability demanded by the Biden administration from India.

US Ambassador Garcetti dismisses concerns about democracy in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-ambassador-garcetti-dismisses-concerns-about-democracy-in-india/articleshow/109994237.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Biden administration 's top diplomat in New Delhi on Thursday dismissed concerns being raised in certain quarters about democracy in India and observed that in many ways Indians are better than the Americans.At an event organised here by the Council on Foreign Relations , a top American think-tank, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti told the audience he was confident that ""10 years from now India is going to be a vibrant democracy as it is today in terms of free and fair elections "".""Again there's things that probably are worse and there's things that are better. They have a law, you can't go more than two kilometers to vote. So there'll be one guy who lives in the mountains as a monk (at) someplace. They will walk for two days to bring the voting machine, execute the vote,"" he said, responding to a question expressing concerns over the status of democracy in India.He said that during elections times in India, there are people who check trucks to make sure that nobody has cash going around. ""There's probably walk-in money, as they call it in some cities here in the United States, Philadelphia, that's like a tradition where cash kind of gets you votes and things like that. So, I've been impressed with certain things they do that are better than us.""He, however, added there are things that ""we keep our eyes on. And I just disagree that we don't speak out about them"",""We put them out. It's not the only thing. I mean, some people want us to only say that. But this is too important a relationship to spend all day long only saying that over and over. You're not going to get anything else done.

Whereas where we find the common ground, which I think is really human to human, very deep,"" he said.""You have a lot of leaders there who have come worked, been educated here, have an affinity. There's a huge positive polling of Americans. I told the president before the state visit that Americans poll better in India than Americans do in America. They like us more than we like ourselves. That's rare in the world today,"" Garcetti said, adding that Poland is the only other country that comes close.This is a huge advantage for the US, he said.""... If you don't know state governments in India, which are as powerful as the centre and are run by opposition parties, and there's plenty of criticisms you can make, too, about other parties that have been in power. If you look at history in India, there's not been some golden era where everybody's rights have been respected,"" Garcetti said.""America's role is to stand up for the principles and the values that we have, to never retreat from those and talk about them.

down by 7.82%

NEW DELHI: The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) recently published a study that analyzed the shifts in religious demographics across various countries from 1950 to 2015. The study, named ""Share of religious minorities: A cross-country analysis,"" shed light on change in demographics from 1950 to 2015.According to the findings, India's Hindu majority population experienced a decline of 7.81 per cent during the 65-year period.In contrast, the Muslim community in India witnessed a significant increase of 43.15 per cent within the same timeframe.The study aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how religious composition has evolved in different nations over the past several decades, offering valuable insights into this critical dimension of demographic transformation.According to the report, the global average for the share of the majority religious denomination in 1950 was 75%. By 2015, this figure had decreased by approximately 22%, indicating a global trend towards greater religious heterogeneity. The study highlights significant regional differences. For instance, more than half of the countries with the largest demographic shifts are located in Africa, where shifts from animist majorities to other religious denominations were most common.Countries like India and several OECD nations have also seen declines in their majority religious shares, signaling a diversification of religious demographics. In contrast, many Muslim-majority countries have seen an increase in the share of their dominant religious groups.The report reveals that India, like many other South Asian nations, has experienced a noticeable decrease in the share of its majority religious group. In 1950, the majority religious group in India comprised a larger share of the population compared to 2015, reflecting a trend towards greater religious diversity and pluralism. This change is attributed to various factors including demographic shifts, migration patterns, and changing socio-political landscapes.As per the report, specifically, all the Muslim-majority countries in this study saw an increase in the share of their dominant religious groups, with the sole exception of the Maldives. In the Maldives, the majority group, Shafi’i Sunnis, experienced a decrease of 1.47 per cent.Among the non-Muslim majority nations, the trends were mixed. Myanmar, India, and Nepal all saw a reduction in the proportion of their majority religious groups. Conversely, in Sri Lanka and Bhutan, the share of the majority denomination saw an increase. The extent of these changes varied widely across the region, with Myanmar experiencing the most significant drop of 9.84 percent in its Theravada Buddhist population, reducing from 79 per cent to 71 per cent. Bangladesh observed the most substantial increase, where the Hanafi Muslim population surged by 18.55 per cent, from 74 per cent to 88 per cent of the populace.The share of the majority Hindu population decreased by 7.82 per cent from 1950 to 2015, moving from 84.68 per cent to 78.06 per cent. Concurrently, the Muslim population in India grew from 9.84 per cent in 1950 to 14.09 per cent in 2015, marking a 43.15 per cent increase in their proportion.Smaller increments were noted among other religious groups: Christians increased from 2.24 per cent to 2.36 per cent, Sikhs from 1.24 per cent to 1.85 per cent, and Buddhists from 0.05 per cent to 0.81 per cent.In contrast, the Jain community in India saw a decrease from 0.45 per cent in 1950 to 0.36 per cent in 2015. The Parsi population experienced a significant decline, decreasing by 85 per cent from a 0.03 per cent share in 1950 to just 0.004 per cent in 2015. These figures underscore the complex and evolving religious landscape in India and the broader region, reflecting broader social, cultural, and possibly political changes.The Hindu population in Bangladesh experienced a dramatic 66% decline from 23% in 1950 to 8% in 2015, while the Buddhist and Christian populations remained relatively stable or increased, respectively.The Tibetan Buddhist majority in Bhutan grew from 72% to 84% between 1950 and 2015, possibly influenced by the forced eviction of Nepali Hindus in the 1990s, which reduced the Hindu population by 50%.The Buddhist majority increased by 5% from 64% in 1950 to 67% in 2015, while the Hindu and Christian populations saw decreases, and the Muslim population rose to become the third-largest religious group.The Muslim population increased overall, especially among Shia and Ahmadiyya groups, while the Hindu population plummeted by 80% from 13% to 2% over 65 years.The Muslim population slightly increased from 99.4% in 1950 to 99.7% in 2015, with Sunni Muslims experiencing a minor increase and Shia numbers remaining stable.Unique among Muslim-majority countries, Maldives saw a slight decline of 1.47% in its majority Shafi’i Sunni population, dropping from 99.8% to 98.4%.The Hindu majority decreased by 4% from 84% to 81%, while the Buddhist population also saw a significant decrease and the Muslim population increased substantially.The Buddhist majority saw a 10% decrease from 84% to 75%, with increases noted in the Christian population and indigenous religions.","India's Hindu majority population experienced a decline of 7.81 per cent during the 65-year period. In contrast, the Muslim community in India witnessed a significant increase of 43.15 per cent within the same timeframe.

"After West Bengal governor's video show, woman threatens suicide over identity leak",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/after-west-bengal-governors-video-show-woman-threatens-suicide-over-identity-leak/articleshow/109989576.cms,"KOLKATA: Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose screened CCTV footage Thursday before a select group that shows a Raj Bhavan female staffer he is accused of molesting walking out of the complex last week, prompting her to describe the disclosure of her identity without consent ""as another crime that made her even contemplate suicide"".The video of the woman between 5.33pm and 6.41pm on May 2 shows her approaching a police outpost within the compound and then leaving in a car.But it does not show anything to either corroborate or disprove the allegations.TMC ministers denounced the screening and questioned the governor's intent, specifically his stand that he would not show the video to ""(CM) Mamata Banerjee and her police"" and his earlier contention that his position gave him immunity from prosecution. Bengal women and child development minister Shashi Panja Panja announced a ""boycott"" of Bose. ""Will I sit beside him on the same dais when I know he is accused of molestation?"" Panja asked.In a text message to TOI, the complainant said: ""The governor committed a heinous act and is now trying to cover up his misdeeds by staging a farce. I was aware that Indian law mandates protecting the identity of the complainant during an investigation.""Speaking about ""contemplating suicide"", she decried the fact that her and her family's reputation was shattered because of the governor. ""He has released a video of mine without permission, thus leaving me with no choice but to take my own life. However, if a real investigation can take place, truth will come to light,"" she said. The complainant added: ""The footage shows me crying while walking towards the outpost. It shows I am walking with a person. That person had earlier snatched my bag and the governor had instructed that the person would accompany me to my home in a Raj Bhavan car and had asked me not to speak about the matter to anyone.""Minister Panja rejected Bose's assertions of immunity. ""The constitutional immunity refers to his roles as governor, not against sexual abuse. But if he misused his position, believing that abusing women is a part of the governor's responsibilities... it would be contrary to the constitutional provisions. You are not above the law,"" Panja added, announcing the ""boycott"". Raj Bhavan had arranged a viewing for 100 people after Bose announced that he wanted to show the CCTV footage to the ""citizens of Bengal"", but half of the chairs were vacant, a source said.","CCTV footage shows woman he is accused of molesting walking out of Raj Bhavan.

Reciprocal sensitivity a must for ties: EAM S Jaishankar to Male,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/close-ties-with-neighbours-are-of-great-value-mea-jaishankar-to-maldivian-counterpart/articleshow/109989721.cms,"India completes troop withdrawal

NEW DELHI: Development of India’s ties with the Maldives, as close neighbours, is based on mutual interests and “reciprocal sensitivity”, foreign minister S Jaishankar told his counterpart Moosa Zameer who is in India for the first high-level visit by either side since the pro-China Maldivian president, Mohamed Muizzu, assumed office last year.Jaishankar also underscored before his counterpart the “great value” of close partnerships with neighbours in a volatile and uncertain world.Bilateral ties between the 2 countries have soured in the past 6 months, with Male looking to limit defence and security cooperation and simultaneously cosying up to China and others to reduce its reliance on India. The meeting took place a day before the May 10 deadline set by Male for the withdrawal of Indian troops who were operating Indian naval choppers and an aircraft in the Maldives.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal confirmed later in the day that the process of appointing “competent Indian technical personnel” to keep running these aviation platforms, which are crucial for evacuation and other HADR activities, has been completed. After some intense diplomatic negotiations , India had acquiesced to the replacement of military personnel with civilian staff.Removal of Indian military personnel dominated Muizzu’s campaign agenda in the run up to the presidential polls and it’s significant the first high-level bilateral visit from the Maldives to India coincided with the fulfilment of his poll promise.Jaishankar’s emphasis on reciprocal sensitivity is significant as it suggests the Indian Ocean neighbour cannot expect the relationship to be driven by unilateral concessions alone. Welcoming Zameer, he said the visit was an opportunity to discuss the relationship and chart out future directions.“As close and proximate neighbours, the development of our ties is obviously based on mutual interests and reciprocal sensitivity. As far as India is concerned, these are articulated in terms of our Neighbourhood First policy and SAGAR vision ,” said Jaishankar, as he expressed hope that the meeting will enable them to strengthen the convergence of their perspectives in various domains.Jaishankar also recalled before Zameer India has been a key provider of development assistance to the Maldives, including financial help on favourable terms. Muizzu has sought leniency from India for the repayment of loans taken by previous governments and the issue figured in the meeting.“Our projects have benefited the people of your country; contributed to the quality of life. They range from infrastructure projects and social initiatives to medical evacuation and health facilities. India has been a first responder on numerous occasions for Maldives,” said Jaishankar, adding bilateral cooperation cooperation had also enhanced the security and well-being of the Maldives through shared activities, equipment provisioning, capacity building and training. There was no major announcement during the visit because of the model code of conduct in place for the ongoing Indian elections.Jaishankar told Zameer the world is today passing through a volatile and uncertain period and, in such times, like during Covid, natural disasters and economic difficulties, close partnerships with neighbors are of great value.“It is in our common interest that we reach an understanding on how best we take our relationship forward,” he said, as they discussed additional avenues for taking forward the relationship.According to Male, they expressed commitment to working closely together bilaterally and in international arena on priority areas of mutual interest.","First high-level visit by either side since pro-China Maldivian president, Mohamed Muizzu, assumed office last year.

Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, crashed in trade on Thursday due to multiple factors. While BSE Sensex plunged over 1,000 points, Nifty50 went below the 22,000 mark for the first time since April mid. BSE Sensex ended the day at 72,404.17, down 1,062 points or 1.45%. Nifty50 closed the day at 21,967.10, down 335 points or 1.50%.The market volatility, as measured by the India VIX, surged 5% to 17.85, marking its eleventh consecutive session of gains.As a result, investors witnessed a staggering loss of Rs 6 lakh crore, causing the market capitalization of BSE-listed companies to drop below Rs 400 lakh crore to Rs 393.73 lakh crore, according to an ET report.the ongoing general elections have introduced uncertainty, leading to a noticeable decrease in pre-election enthusiasm. Although the consensus view is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be re-elected, the market is closely monitoring the margin of victory for the incumbent government. Abhishek Goenka, founder and chief executive of IFA Global, said, ""The rise in volatility can be attributed to the fear of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance getting a weaker-than-expected majority.""the performance of index heavyweights, such as Reliance Industries (RIL) and Larsen & Toubro (L&T), significantly impacted the market. L&T experienced a nearly 5% drop due to lower margins in its core E&C segment and reduced revenues from its subsidiaries in Q4. Additionally, strong selling pressure in HDFC Bank and ITC contributed to the market's woes, with the Nifty Bank and Nifty FMCG indices trading lower.the lack of positive global cues also played a role in the market's decline. Stocks edged lower ahead of the Bank of England's rate decision and the release of US initial jobless claims data. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures pointed to declines at the Wall Street open.the market reacted to earnings announcements by top companies. While banks such as State Bank of India (SBI) and Canara Bank reported strong Q4 numbers, the market was unimpressed with Asian Paints' earnings, causing its stock to plunge over 5% in intra-day trade. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) also reported a year-on-year decline in its Q4 net profit, leading to a 4% drop in its share price. Arvinder Singh Nanda, Senior Vice President of Master Capital Services, noted that the muted cues from the Q4 earnings of large-cap companies have further dampened investor sentiment.the selling by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) has weighed on the overall sentiment, as they have been net sellers in the Indian equity market so far in 2024.

The unrest has added another layer of complexity to the merger, as cabin crew members continue to protest against perceived injustices in their employment terms.The sudden disruption in operations caused chaos at Delhi Airport as the Air India Express cancelled flights to Goa, Guwahati and Srinagar at the last moment.The announcement led to a state of confusion and distress among the affected travellers, who congregated around the airline's counter, visibly upset and demanding explanations. Passengers were seen crowding in front of an Air India Express desk.Soon after the chaos broke out, the airline asked passengers scheduled to fly Wednesday ""to check if their flight is affected before heading"" to the airport.""The situation is dynamic as senior cabin crew are reporting sick at the last minute, just before they are to operate flights.

So far, around 15 lakh tonnes of yellow peas have been imported for use as a substitute for chana (gram) since import duty was abolished in Dec last year.Government last week removed import duty on Bengal gram and extended import duty exemption on yellow peas till Oct.Sources said the move to do away with import duty on Bengal gram will give a signal to farmers in Australia and other countries for planting this pulses variety. “Once they know that we will be importing more, their farmers will be motivated to take up more cultivation of chana,” an official said.Earlier, black gram attracted 66% import duty, to encourage domestic production. While Government has maintained that estimated production of Bengal gram as per agriculture ministry is pegged at 121 lakh tonnes for 2023-24 crop years (July-June) compared to 122 lakh tonnes in the previous year, trade sources estimate the output to be less than the official projection.Trade sources said the market prices of chana (gram), which has almost 50% share of country’s tur output, is in the range of Rs 6,000-Rs 6,100 per quintal against the MSP of Rs 5,440 a quintal. With demand for chana rising from state Government for distribution for their welfare schemes, there is also strain on the stock held by the Centre.In its bid to prevent hoarding by private players, the consumer affairs department has made the stock declaration mandatory for traders, importers and millers from April 15.","Government last week removed import duty on Bengal gram and extended import duty exemption on yellow peas till Oct.

According to a recent working paper compiled by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), the share of the Hindu population decreased by 7.82 per cent between 1950 and 2015 in India, while that of Muslims increased by 43.15 per cent, suggesting that there is a conducive environment in the country to foster diversity.The study led to a slugfest among political parties, with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleging that the ""appeasement politics"" of the Congress led to the increase in the population of Muslims in the country.In a statement, the Population Foundation of India said it is deeply concerned about recent media reports ""misreporting"" the findings from the study to spread alarm regarding the growth of the Muslim population in the country.""The study's focus on changes in the share of majority and minority religious groups globally over a 65-year period should not be used to incite fear or discrimination against any community,"" it said.According to census figures, the decadal growth rate for Muslims has been declining over the past three decades.Specifically, the decadal growth rate for Muslims decreased from 32.9 per cent in 1981-1991 to 24.6 per cent in 2001-2011.""This decline is more pronounced than that of Hindus, whose growth rate fell from 22.7 to 16.8 per cent over the same period,"" the NGO said.The census data is available from 1951 to 2011 and is quite similar to the data in this study, indicating that these numbers are not new, the organisation said.Noting that the TFR among all religious groups is declining, it said the highest decrease in the TFR from 2005-06 to 2019-21 was observed among Muslims, which dropped by 1 percentage point, followed by Hindus at 0.7 percentage point.""This trend underscores that the fertility rates are converging across different religious communities,"" it said.The NGO, which promotes and advocates for the effective formulation and implementation of gender-sensitive population, health and development strategies and policies, said such interpretations are not only inaccurate but also misleading and baseless.""The media's selective portrayal of data to highlight the increase in the Muslim population is an example of misrepresentation that ignores broader demographic trends ,"" said Poonam Muttreja, executive director, Population Foundation of India.Fertility rates are closely linked to education and income levels, not religion, she added.""States with better access to education, healthcare and socio-economic development, such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, exhibit lower TFRs across all religious groups. For example, the TFR among Muslim women in Kerala is lower than the TFR among Hindu women in Bihar,"" the NGO said.Successful family planning programmes in Muslim-majority countries like Bangladesh and Indonesia have resulted in lower birth rates compared to India. These countries have achieved this through higher levels of female education, greater employment opportunities and better access to contraceptive choices. This clearly shows that fertility decline is influenced by development factors rather than religious affiliation, Population Foundation of India added.""The most effective way to manage population growth is through investment in education, economic development and gender equity . Our analysis indicates that women's education is the most critical factor in reducing fertility rates. Therefore, interventions should focus on providing education and family planning services irrespective of religion,"" Muttreja said.There are several population issues the world is grappling with.""Population Foundation of India urges the media to refrain from using demographic studies to create fear and division. It is essential to present data accurately and contextually, highlighting the role of education, income and socio-economic development in shaping demographic trends. We advocate for policies that promote inclusive development and gender equity to ensure a balanced and harmonious society,"" the NGO said.","Population growth rates are not linked to religion, NGO says.

We have seen immediate reversals in the Nifty after hitting fresh highs and this tells a lot about the jitters that the market has on account of the big event,"" said Abhishek Goenka, founder and chief executive of IFA Global.Strong selling pressure in HDFC Bank, Asian Paints, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), Reliance Industries (RIL) which are the major constituents among the 30 in Sensex led the steep decline of the index today.L&T declined 6% or 197 points to settle at Rs 3,289.95, down by 197 whereas Asian Paints settled at 2711 after it fell by 4.68%.HDFC Bank also plunged by −31.85 or 2.15% to settle at 1,450.80 while Reliance witnessed a fall of 1.77%.Global markets witnessed a slight decline ahead of the Bank of England's interest rate announcement and the release of US initial jobless claims figures.The Stoxx 600 index in Europe remained relatively stable, S&P 500 futures fell 0.1%, Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.2%, indicating a potential dip in US stock markets.The market is also being affected by the Q4 results released by companies. Asian Paints and HPCL witnessed a decline after reporting weak fourth quarter results.Asian paints reported an increase of 1.8% in net profit, however it missed analysts' estimates whereas Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) declined by 4% after reporting a 25% decline in its year-on-year Q4 net profit to Rs 2,709.31 crore versus Rs 3,608.32 crore.Selling by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) has negatively impacted the market sentiment.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
US Meddling: Russia Accuses US of Meddling in India's Affairs in Pannun Case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/russia-accuses-us-of-meddling-in-indias-affairs-in-pannun-case/articleshow/109990859.cms,"Accusations reflect US’s India disrespect: Russia spokesperson

NEW DELHI: Russia waded into the Gurpatwant Singh Pannun murder-for-hire case on Wednesday to claim that the US had not yet provided any “reliable evidence” about the involvement of Indian nationals in the alleged murder plot to kill the Khalistani rabble rouser, and also accused the Americans of meddling in India’s internal affairs and “complicating” the ongoing Lok Sabha elections by destabilising the internal political situation.According to an agency report, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, when asked about a report by the Washington Post claiming that India was trying to adopt the policies of Russia and Saudi Arabia, said, “According to the information we have, Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the preparation of the murder of a certain GS Pannun.”“Speculation on this topic in the absence of evidence is unacceptable. Washington lacks understanding of India's national mentality and history and continues to make unfounded accusations about religious freedoms in India.”India had earlier formed a committee in Nov last year to probe the US allegations and said the information shared by US authorities had a bearing on India’s own security too, but strongly refuted the claims in the Post report, saying it made “unwarranted and unsubstantiated” imputations on a serious matter and that an investigation into the case was underway.The Washington Post report had identified an Indian govt official who allegedly ordered the hit on Khalistani separatist and US national Pannun. The report also shared the US “assessment” that top Indian security officials, including then RAW chief Samant Goel, approved the plot. “Regular unfounded accusations by the US against New Delhi... we see that they groundlessly accuse not only India but also many other states of violating religious freedoms. These are a reflection of the United States’ misunderstanding of the national mentality, the historical context of the development of the Indian state and disrespect for India as a state,” Maria Zakharova further said on the matter.Describing the interference as a “colonial period mentality”, the Russian spokesperson accused the White House of complicating the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. “The reason is that they try to unbalance the internal political situation in India in order to complicate the (ongoing) parliamentary elections. That is part of meddling into India’s internal affairs,” RT news quoted Zakharova as saying. PM Modi had spoken about efforts by foreign actors to influence Indian polls.",Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the US had not yet provided any “reliable evidence” about the involvement of Indian nationals in the alleged murder plot.

Indians caught in OPT fraud get another shot to live & work in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indians-caught-in-opt-fraud-get-another-shot-to-live-work-in-us/articleshow/109990961.cms,"Scam's modus operandi

A 'stipulated dismissal agreement' recently approved in a US district court has given a shot in the arm to more than 90 foreign nationals, many of them Indians, who fell victim to an Optional Practical Training (OPT) fraud committed by their former OPT-employer company. These individuals had been denied re-entry to the US or were held ineligible for a visa, including a work visa .Now, all these sanctions have been lifted.A few individuals, who had found themselves embroiled in such a fraud, had reached out to TOI explaining their predicament. For instance, one such individual, originally from Chennai who had enrolled in a company which was apparently blacklisted by the US department of homeland security ( DHS ), was denied entry by the border and customs officials when he landed at a US airport after a brief vacation at home. He points out that this company had been certified for conducting OPT. He had been in this company for some months, before realising he wasn't given projects to work on under guidance as is required under OPT regulations and had shifted to another firm. Despite a short stint with this alleged blacklisted company, he suffered.Jesse Bless, one of the attorneys who represented the plaintiffs, told TOI, ""After months of negotiations, the US DHS, agreed to review the govt's internal records. DHS confirmed these plaintiffs (former students, undergoing OPT training and swindled by their OPT-employer company) are not inadmissible to the US or ineligible for a visa simply because they worked for a nefarious OPT-company. In other words, with the inadmissibility lifted, these plaintiffs have now regained another opportunity to live and work in the US.""International students are eligible for a one-year OPT to gain work experience in the US. In addition, those in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) field get an additional two-year tenure for their OPT. According to an Open Doors Report, for the academic year 2022-23, there were 2.7 lakh Indian students in the US of which 69,000 were undergoing OPT.Jonathan Wasden, who also represented these students, explained to TOI that these firms were certified by DHS under the e-Verify system as eligible to hire OPT students. ""They began to aggressively market consulting jobs to recent graduates on social media platforms. After offering employment they would state that some more training was needed. While the companies did not ask for money in exchange for OPT job offers, they charged for the training - typically a charge of under $ 500 - that too of dubious quality, In addition, many of these students were not assigned any projects, so as to gain work experience,"" he said.DHS did not alert the public to the scam. Instead, it raided some of these firms and seized employee lists. It then began matching names in their system to names on the list. Some erstwhile OPT-students were holding H-1B visas and were gainfully employed for several years. On return from a vacation to India, they were told by the consulate that DHS had made them inadmissible to the US. Wasden said students should watch out for any company that asks them to pay for training or anything else. Through an attorney students should report this to the DHS, this would offer them some protection at a later date from being rendered inadmissible or ineligible for a visa, he added.","More than 90 foreign nationals, many of them Indians, fell victim to an Optional Practical Training (OPT) fraud committed by their former OPT-employer company.

Trump attorney and Stormy Daniels trade barbs during questions about alleged 2006 sexual encounter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-attorney-and-stormy-daniels-trade-barbs-during-questions-about-alleged-2006-sexual-encounter/articleshow/109989302.cms,"NEW YORK: Donald Trump's defense attorney on Thursday accused Stormy Daniels of slowly altering the details of an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, trying to persuade jurors that a key prosecution witness in the former president's hush money trial cannot be believed.“The details of your story keep changing, right?” attorney Susan Necheles asked at one point.“No,” Daniels said.As the jury looked on, the two women traded barbs over what Necheles said were inconsistencies in Daniels' description of the encounter with Trump in a hotel room . He denies the whole story.“You made all this up, right?” Necheles asked.“No,” Daniels shot back.But despite all the talk over what may have happened in that hotel room, despite the discomfiting testimony by the adult film actor that she consented to sex in part over a “power imbalance,"" the case against Trump doesn’t rise or fall on whether her account is true or even believable. It’s a trial about money changing hands — business transactions — and whether those payments were made to illegally influence the 2016 election.Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying internal Trump Organization business records. The charges stem from paperwork such as invoices and checks that were deemed legal expenses in company records. Prosecutors say those payments largely were reimbursements to Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet.The testimony over the past three weeks has seesawed between bookkeepers and bankers relaying the nuts-and-bolts of check-paying procedures and wire transfers to unflattering, seamy stories about Trump and the tabloid world machinations meant to keep them secret.This criminal case could be the only one against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee to go to trial before voters decide in November whether to send him back to the White House. Trump has pleaded not guilty and casts himself as the victim of a politically tainted justice system working to deny him another term.Meanwhile, as the threat of jail looms over Trump following his repeated gag order violations, his attorneys are fighting the judge’s order and seeking a fast decision in an appeals court. If the court refuses to lift the gag order, Trump’s lawyers want permission to take their appeal to the state’s high court.“Here we sit after two and a half weeks, and I think you’ll see some very revealing things today,” Trump said outside the courtroom.At the time of the payment to Daniels, Trump and his campaign were reeling from the October 2016 publication of the never-before-seen 2005 “Access Hollywood” footage in which he boasted about grabbing women’s genitals without their permission.Prosecutors have argued that the political firestorm over the “Access Hollywood” tape hastened Cohen’s payment to keep Daniels from going public with her claims that could further hurt Trump in the eyes of female voters.The tape rattled RNC leadership, and “there were conversations about how it would be possible to replace him as the candidate if it came to that,"" according to testimony from Madeleine Westerhout, a Trump aide who was working at the Republican National Committee when the recording leaked.Daniels was on the stand for 7 1/2 half hours over two days. During questioning from prosecutors, she relayed in graphic detail what she said happened during their 2006 encounter, after the two met at a celebrity golf outing at Lake Tahoe where sponsors included the adult film studio where she worked.Trump scowled and shook his head through much of Daniels’ description, including how she found the Republican presidential sitting on the hotel bed in his underwear after she returned from the bathroom and that he did not use a condom. At one point, the judge told defense lawyers during a sidebar conversation — out of earshot of the jury and the public — that he could hear Trump “cursing audibly.”Trump’s lawyers have sought to paint Daniels as a liar and extortionist who’s trying to take down Trump after drawing money and fame from her story about him. And they say the hush money payments were an effort to protect his reputation and family — not his campaign — by shielding them from embarrassing stories about his personal life.On Thursday, Necheles grilled Daniels on her description of the encounter in which she described fear and discomfort even as she consented to sex. She testified earlier this week that while she wasn’t physically menaced, she felt a “power imbalance” as Trump, in his hotel bedroom, stood between her and the door and propositioned her.As for whether she felt compelled to have sex with him, she reiterated Thursday that he didn’t drug her or physically threaten her. But, she said, “My own insecurities, in that moment, kept me from saying no.”Necheles suggested that her work in porn meant her story about being shocked and frightened by Trump’s alleged sexual advances was not believable.“You’ve acted and had sex in over 200 porn movies, right?” Necheles asked. “And there are naked men and women having sex, including yourself, in those movies?”Necheles continued: “But according to you, seeing a man sitting on a bed in a T-shirt and boxers was so upsetting that you got lightheaded. The blood left your hands and feet, and you felt like you were going to faint.”The experience with Trump was different from porn for a number of reasons, Daniels explained, including the fact that Trump was more than twice her age, larger than her and that she was not expecting to find him undressed when she emerged from the bathroom.“I came out of a bathroom seeing an older man that I wasn’t expecting to be there,” she said.Necheles pressed her on why she accepted the payout to keep quiet instead of going public.“Why didn’t you do that?” she asked, wondering why Daniels didn’t hold a news conference as she had planned.“Because we were running out of time,” Daniels said.Did she mean, Necheles asked, that she was running out of time to use the claim to make money?“To get the story out,” Daniels countered. The negotiations were happening in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign.While she was in talks with Cohen, Daniels was also talking with other journalists as a “backup” plan, she testified. Necheles accused her of refusing to share the story with reporters because she wouldn’t be paid for it.“The better alternative was for you to get money, right?” Necheles said. Daniels said she was most interested in getting her story out and ensuring her family’s safety.“The better alternative was to get my story protected with a paper trail so that my family didn’t get hurt,” Daniels replied.But she testified that she never spoke with Trump about payment, and said she had no knowledge of whether Trump was aware of or involved in the transaction.“You have no personal knowledge about his involvement in that transaction or what he did or didn’t do,” Trump lawyer Susan Necheles asked.“Not directly, no,” Daniels responded.Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger later asked Daniels: “Have you been telling lies about Mr. Trump or the truth about Mr. Trump?”“The truth,” said Daniels, who also said that although she has made money since her story emerged, she also has had to spend a lot to hire security, move homes and take other precautions, and she still owes Trump hundreds of thousands of dollars in attorneys fees.“On balance, has publicly telling the truth about Mr. Trump been a net positive or net negative in your life?” Hoffinger asked.“Negative,” Daniels replied quietly.","Daniels was on the stand for 7 1/2 half hours over two days. She relayed in graphic detail what she said happened during their 2006 encounter. Trump scowled and shook his head through much of Daniels’ description, including how she found the Republican presidential sitting on the bed in his underwear.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109989550,imgsize-947586,width-400,resizemode-4/109989550.jpg"
Problem of plenty: Record 9 million 'akiya' homes are vacant in Japan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/problem-of-plenty-record-9-million-akiya-homes-are-vacant-in-japan/articleshow/109948491.cms,"Japan is grappling with a significant challenge as the number of vacant homes , known as ""akiya,"" has surged to a record high of nine million, which is more than the population of New York City . This alarming increase is largely attributed to the country's continuously declining population, presenting a unique set of problems for both urban and rural areas.According to Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Chiba, ""This is a symptom of Japan’s population decline.It’s not really a problem of building too many houses, but a problem of not having enough people."" This situation is exacerbated in cities like Tokyo and Kyoto, where abandoned homes are increasingly common, a CNN report said.The akiya issue is not just a housing market concern but also poses significant risks during disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, which Japan is prone to. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications reports that 14% of all residential properties in Japan are now vacant, encompassing second homes and those temporarily unoccupied due to owners working abroad, the CNN report said.These vacant homes can hinder the efforts to rejuvenate aging towns, becoming hazards due to lack of maintenance and complicating rescue efforts during disasters. Yuki Akiyama, a professor from the faculty of architecture and urban design at Tokyo City University, highlighted the dangers posed by akiya during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Noto Peninsula in January. ""When an earthquake or a tsunami occurs, there is a possibility that vacant houses will block evacuation routes as they break down and get destroyed,"" Akiyama explained.The issue also has a negative impact on the value of real estate in areas with high concentrations of akiya, as these properties stall development and lower regional attractiveness. ""The value of the area will be reduced because it is a place where you can’t buy and sell it properly and you can’t do large-scale development,"" said Akiyama.While some have turned to renovating these homes into guesthouses or cafes, Hall warned that the process is not as straightforward as it seems, especially for foreigners. ""The truth is most of these homes are not going to be sold to foreigners, or that the amount of administrative work and the rules behind it [are] not something easy for somebody who doesn’t speak Japanese and read Japanese very well,"" he said.As Japan's population continues to shrink and the number of children born each year declines, the challenge of managing and repurposing these empty homes remains daunting. With the fertility rate remaining far below the replacement level, the problem of too many homes and too few people is expected to persist, shaping the future of housing and urban development in Japan.",The number of vacant homes in Japan has surged to a record high of nine million. The increase is largely attributed to the country's continuously declining population. 14% of all residential properties in Japan are now vacant. These vacant homes can hinder the efforts to rejuvenate aging towns.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109948456,imgsize-1816916,width-400,resizemode-4/109948456.jpg"

Though last week's claims were the most since the final week of August 2023, it's still a relatively low number of layoffs and not cause for concern.The four-week average of claims, which softens some of the weekly volatility, rose by 4,750 to 215,000.Weekly unemployment claims are considered a proxy for the number of U.S. layoffs in a given week and a sign of where the job market is headed. They have remained at historically low levels since the pandemic purge of millions of jobs in the spring of 2020.Last month, U.S. employers added just 175,000 jobs, the fewest in six months and another sign that the labor market may be loosening. The unemployment rate inched back up to 3.9% from 3.8% and has now remained below 4% for 27 straight months, the longest such streak since the 1960s.The government also recently reported 8.5 million job openings in March, the lowest number of vacancies in three years.Moderation in the pace of hiring, along with a slowdown in wage growth could give the Fed the data its been seeking in order to finally issue a cut to interest rates.The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark borrowing rate 11 times beginning in March of 2022 in a bid to stifle the four-decade high inflation that took hold after the economy rebounded from the COVID-19 recession of 2020. The Fed’s intention was to loosen the labor market and cool wage growth, which can fuel inflation.Many economists thought there was a chance the rapid rate hikes could cause a recession, but jobs have remained plentiful and the economy forged on thanks to strong spending by U.S. consumers.Though layoffs remain at low levels, companies have been announcing more job cuts recently, mostly across technology and media. Google parent company Alphabet, Apple and eBay have all recently announced layoffs.Outside of tech and media, Peloton, Stellantis, Nike and Tesla have recently announced job cuts.In total, 1.79 million Americans were collecting jobless benefits during the week that ended April 27. That’s up 17,000 from the previous week.","Unemployment claims for the week ending May 4 rose by 22,000 to 231,000, up from 209,000 the week before.
