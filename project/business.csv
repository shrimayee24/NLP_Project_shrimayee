"'Lot of countries nervous, we are not': Jaishankar on potential impact of Trump's return on India-US ties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lot-of-countries-nervous-we-are-not-jaishankar-on-potential-impact-of-trumps-return-on-india-us-ties/articleshow/115158439.cms,"External affairs minister S Jaishankar addresses the gathering during the silver jubilee celebrations of the Aditya Birla Group's Scholarships programme, in Mumbai.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Sunday said that India is not among the countries who are ""nervous"" as Donald Trump is set to return to White House after defeating Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections.""I know today a lot of countries are nervous about the US. Let's be honest about it. We are not one of them,"" Jaishankar said while speaking at the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of the Aditya Birla Group Scholarships Programme in Mumbai.In response to a question on the reset in the global power dynamic that was playing out amid the shift in the balance of power from the West to the East, Jaishankar remarked, ""Yes, there is a shift. We are ourselves an example of the shift. If you look at our economic weight, you look at our economic ranking, you look at even Indian corporates, their reach, their presence, Indian professionals, which I spoke about. So no question there is a rebalancing.""He explained that this change was expected, saying, ""And to my mind, it was inevitable because once these countries after the colonial period got their independence, they started making their own policy choices, then they were bound to grow.""Nevertheless, Jaishankar pointed out that western industrialised nations maintain significant influence globally. ""But do remember one thing, the older, the western economies, the older industrialised economies, they have not gone away. They still count, they are still prime investment targets. They are big markets, strong technology centres, hubs for innovation. So let's recognise the shift, but let's not get carried away and kind of overstate it and distort our own understanding of the world,"" the minister said.When asked about the impact of the recent US presidential election on Indo-US relations, Jaishankar highlighted PM Modi's consistent ability to establish strong connections with US Presidents, from Barack Obama through Donald Trump to Joe Biden. ""The Prime Minister was among the first three calls I think that President Trump took. Prime Minister Modi has actually built rapport across multiple presidents. When he first visited DC, Obama was the president, then it was Trump, then it was Biden. So, you know, for him (PM Modi), there's something natural in terms of how he forges those relationships. So, that's helped hugely,"" Jaishankar said in his response.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's victory on November 5 against vice president Kamala Harris secured his return to the White House. PM Modi's subsequent telephone conversation with ""friend Donald Trump"" on November 6 included congratulations for both his presidential win and the Republican Party's Congressional success.The Prime Minister acknowledged the strong trust Americans placed in Trump's leadership and vision. He recalled significant events like the Howdy Modi event in Houston in September 2019 and the Namaste Trump event in Ahmedabad in February 2020.""Heartiest congratulations my friend Donald Trump on your historic election victory. As you build on the successes of your previous term, I look forward to renewing our collaboration to further strengthen the India-US Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership. Together, let's work for the betterment of our people and promote global peace, stability and prosperity,"" PM Modi shared on X."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar said that India is not among the countries who are ""nervous"" as Donald Trump is set to return to White House. He was speaking at the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of the Aditya Birla Group Scholarships Programme in Mumbai.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115159192,imgsize-670095,width-400,resizemode-4/115159192.jpg"

Excerpts from the interview:



How would you describe your eight-and-a-half years in SC as a judge, especially the last two years as CJI?

Is Indian democracy in danger? There have been attempts to create a phobia about democracy being in danger in India. Your take on the role of the judiciary on this issue.

Is hate speech a cause for concern? What should India do to curb it?

Reservations for SCs and STs were to last for 10 years. But backwardness appears to be an incurable defect in Indian society with political parties vying with each other for an increase in quota beyond the 50% limit set by the SC in 1992 in the Indra Sawhney case. Should reservations be eternal?

Over the past decade, a degree of transparency has been infused into selection of persons by the SC collegium for appointment as constitutional court judges. Would it have been better if the SC had allowed the NJAC model to operate for a few years, maybe with appropriate tweaking?

Should India follow the US mechanism for selection of judges to the SC? Should the retirement age of HC and SC judges be raised?

After implementation of the Second National Judicial Pay Commission, the salaries of trial court judges have increased substantially. Should the salaries of HC and SC judges, who are paid a pittance compared to their income as advocates, be increased to give them a fair compensation for their tedious work and to attract more talent?

As CJI, the bench you headed gave many landmark judgments involving sensitive social, economic and governance issues. Were you ever approached by the executive seeking a favourable order?

Have PILs, an instrument created on the lines of class action suits to address problems faced by vulnerable sections of society, the marginalised and poor, been hijacked by a few? Has it become an industry in itself?

NEW DELHI: Marking out hate speech as a cause for concern, Justice D Y Chandrachud said its impact was multi-fold with the rise of social media.“Hurtful comments have far-reaching consequences on the psyche and emotional well-being of people,” he said while warning that curbs on hate speech must not have the effect of “chilling free speech”.Looking back at his eight-and-a-half years in the Supreme Court as a judge, the last two years as CJI, Justice Chandrachud told TOI in an exclusive interview he believed he had “left the system better than I found it”, pointing to his verdicts on disability rights, right to information, and economic federalism, besides the equal opportunity doctrine in the context of sex and caste discrimination.Asked if reservations should continue for perpetuity, the outgoing CJI said it could not be denied that quota as a means of affirmative action had promoted substantive equality. “That is a model of equality that is tried and tested, and has worked in India,” he added.Justice Chandrachud said he did not agree with the perception that a judge’s work involved an element of ‘service’. “A judge, while discharging her functions, is not doing any service. Judges are doing a job just like everybody else. They are two different issues and must not be mixed,” he said, adding that a judge must be paid commensurate with the work output.Many lawyers refer to Justice Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud as the ‘Rockstar’ of judiciary. After a stellar 25-year judicial career, eight of which were in the Supreme Court, the curtains came down on Sunday. He spoke on a range of subjects — from democracy, hate speech, reservation, executive-judiciary relations to judges’ salaries.I don’t think I can speak of my experience as a judge of the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of India without a reference to 13 years as a judge of Bombay High Court and three years as Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court. Much of what I have learnt and, particularly, my judicial philosophy is shaped by my experiences from then. In Bombay HC, I learnt the ropes of judging from many, especially judicial craftsmanship by observing Justices Sujata V Manohar and P D Desai. As CJ of Allahabad HC, I learnt about judicial administration.Allahabad HC has the highest sanctioned strength of 160 judges and heading the court was a challenge. It taught me many lessons on leadership and judicial administration. As the Chief Justice, you are not a ‘leader’ in the traditional sense. You are the first among equals. Your brother and sister judges could be older and more experienced in the profession.Thus, a very delicate balance has to be drawn. I learnt much about human emotions and relationships as the HC CJ. These experiences guided my functions, both administrative and judicial, at the Supreme Court. The switch from being the HC CJ to a puisne judge at the Supreme Court is in a lot of ways humbling. You are back to focusing solely on the judicial side of things. Looking back, I have had a very fulfilling journey.I had the opportunity to lay down the jurisprudence on disability rights, expanded the equal opportunity doctrine in the context of sex and caste discrimination, limited the scope of sealed cover jurisprudence to exceptional situations, gave teeth to the right to information, and crafted a nuanced understandings of economic federalism while deciding Centre-State disputes in the mineral and liquor cases. I am retiring with a sense of satisfaction.I have critically engaged in areas of law and developed jurisprudential frameworks to limit the ad-hoc model of judicial decision making. As the Chief Justice of India, I believe that I have left the system better than I found it.There are no uniform components of democracy that every country must tick to ensure that it is functioning ‘democratically’. The premise of democratic functioning in India, where we are faced with our own unique problems, is different from the premise of democracy in other countries.In India, we don’t subscribe to a merely ‘political’ understanding of democracy. Issues relating to elections or representation such as the right to vote or gerrymandering are a part of democratic governance.We also believe in social democracy, that is, the existence of certain minimum social factors such as absence of discrimination and ensuring substantive equality of opportunity. What is the role of institutions in democracy? Institutions are created and conferred with power to ensure that (i) the premises of democracy are not abrogated and (ii) the values that democratic foundations rest upon are fostered. I would term courts as ‘specially abled’ democratic institutions whose function itself is to ensure that the other democratic institutions are not captured and are able to freely exercise their duties.Viewed in that manner, the courts are conferred with powers to prevent democratic decay. This could include the role of courts to challenges which alter the rules of elections and the process of appointing persons to democratic institutions and their independence. But it would equally include the role of courts in a challenge against a reservation policy or even a challenge to the recruitment process to the post of a teacher or the challenge to arrest or an application requesting bail.Each of these issues is connected to the constitutional idea of democracy. So, it cannot be denied that courts have a very important role to play in the sustenance of Indian democracy. But it must be equally recognised that the length and breadth of Indian democracy and its meaning cannot be limited to certain ‘big’ matters.I am an ardent believer and proponent of the freedom of speech and expression. Constitutional freedom is subject to reasonable restrictions. I also believe that the restrictions must not render the right a mere paper right. Hate speech is a cause for concern. Its impact is multi-fold now with the rise of social media.There are an increasing number of keyboard warriors who say things in exercise of their freedom of speech to just gain traction and to stay relevant in public. Hurtful comments have far-reaching consequences on the psyche and emotional well-being of people. What should India do to curb it? The method opted by the state must be covered within the fold of the restrictions. It must not have the effect of chilling free speech.A balance must be drawn to ensure that the means adopted are proportionate to the infringement of the right.The statement that reservations for SCs and STs were to last for 10 years is factually inaccurate. Article 334 of the Constitution states that reservations for SCs and STs in the House of the People and the legislative assemblies of states must cease to exist in 10 years. This provision was amended multiple times that it now reads that it shall cease to exist in 80 years.Thus, the time limit was prescribed only for reservations in the legislature and not for reservations in educational institutions and services. From a constitutional perspective, the amendments to the time limit are unconstitutional only if the original and unamended provision has attained the character of a basic feature.The concept of equality of opportunity is eternal. That is one of the basic features of the Constitution. Reservation is a means to ensure equality of opportunity. You cannot deny that reservation as a means of affirmative action promoted substantive equality. That is a model of equality that is tried and tested, and has worked in India.The question is based on a surmise. I am not in a position to answer whether the NJAC model of appointment would have been ‘better’ than the collegium system. The Supreme Court decided the ‘constitutional validity’ of the NJAC model.The court does not sit in judgment on whether a model of appointment is better than the other but only on whether it is constitutionally sound. A constitution bench of the Supreme Court held that the NJAC model of appointment was not constitutionally sound.Within the system of appointment that is in place, I have infused a degree of transparency. There are parameters based on which we recommend a judge. We consider the factors of (i) merit, performance and integrity; (ii) diversity and inclusion; and (iii) representation.I don’t have an appropriate answer for whether the retirement age for judges must be raised. There are two perspectives from which this question can be viewed. If you ask me whether our brain becomes ‘slower’ at the ages of 62 and 65, and whether we can no longer discharge the functions of a judge, I would say no. We have legal luminaries in the bar who are at their prime even at the ages of 70 and 75.There is another perspective to this. The prescription of a retirement age is to prevent the concentration of power and to ensure that the opportunity is available to many from the younger population. The aim must be to balance experience with adaptability.I am a firm believer in payment of salaries commensurate with work. I also believe that any service must provide competitive salaries to attract talent. For example, when I took over as the Chief Justice of India, the salary of judicial law clerks was Rs 65,000. It is now Rs 80,000 for the first year of clerkship and Rs 90,000 from the second year.Clerkship in India is now a highly competitive and sought after job, which attracts talent. Competitive salaries also ensure that the job presents an opportunity to law graduates across the board, irrespective of the social and economic status. The same principle applies to judgeship as well. I know more than one candidate who has denied taking up judgeship because of the lack of financial prospects.It is a particularly difficult choice to make when you are offered judgeship in the high court. In many cases, candidates have to give up their lucrative practice which pays them 10x to 100x the salary they would be offered as a judge. There is often a perception that floats around. That as a judge, there is an element of ‘service’ involved and that economic benefits should be immaterial. I do not subscribe to this school of thought.A judge, while discharging her functions, is not doing any service. The minute that is the perception, then any decision of the judge will be viewed not as a discharge of her constitutional function but as an outcome of ‘graciousness’. A judge must be paid commensurate with the work output. While they are working, they are doing a job just like everybody else. The manner in which they discharge their job must conform to the principles prescribed by the Constitution. They are two different issues and must not be mixed.No, I have never been approached by the executive seeking a favourable order.I think it would amount to diminishing the impact and the benefits of PILs to say that it has been hijacked by a few. The core principle of public interest litigation is that it dilutes the traditional rule of locus standi on who can raise an issue before the court.A person who is not directly affected by an action (or inaction) may initiate a public interest litigation if it affects the public. It cannot be denied that courts have been more ‘activist’ in the PIL pleas. It can also not be denied that these petitions have contributed to social progress in India.The judgment of the Supreme Court in Vishaka is a prime example, where it developed the right against sexual harassment and framed guidelines to fill the legislative vacuum. Another very recent example is the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sukanya Shantha , where the court dealt with caste discrimination in prisons. The petitioner in the case was a journalist.There are numerous frivolous petitions which are instituted because of the dilution of locus standi. There is no denying that it burdens the already heavy docket. I remember that there was a PIL filed claiming that Charles Darwin was wrong in his evolution theory and Albert Einstein erred in deducing E=mc2.There was another petition with the grievance that the Chief Justice of Bombay High Court did not say ‘I’ while taking oath. So, there are good and bad cases. A few lawyers have made their name and have become popular through PILs but that is really a natural consequence of diluting the principle of locus standi. It is up to the court (and individual benches) to take a firm stand against it.",Justice D Y Chandrachud said its impact was multi-fold with the rise of social media. The outgoing CJI said it could not be denied that quota as a means of affirmative action had promoted substantive equality. He said he did not agree with the perception that a judge’s work involved an element of ‘service’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115155699,imgsize-1072305,width-400,resizemode-4/115155699.jpg"

2020-21 killings of Dera followers put Dalla on intel radar

NEW DELHI: A shooting in Ontario and the subsequent detention of two men by Canadian Police have sparked speculation that one of those detained is designated terrorist Arshdeep Singh , alias Arsh Dalla, close aide and successor of slain terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar . However, there has been no official confirmation regarding Dalla’s detention from either Canadian or Indian officials, with the latter still trying to verify the authenticity of the reports.Dalla, a rival of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, had taken over reins of Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) after Nijjar’s killing by unidentified men. He has been on the ‘most wanted’ list of India since he orchestrated the murder of a Hindu man in Delhi in December 2022.The buzz suggests that Dalla was reportedly involved in a shootout on Oct 27-28 and was remanded in custody by Halton Regional Police Service (HRPS). He had also sustained a minor gunshot injury, it was claimed.HRPS had on Oct 29 said it had arrested two men on charges of “discharging firearm with intent” following an investigation after the duo had come to a hospital and one of them was treated for a non-life-threatening gunshot and later discharged.Indian intelligence agencies, who have been closely monitoring his activities, confirmed that Dalla has been residing in Canada with his wife. However, it is unclear if he was still in detention. Sources said he has been released.The report of detention came around the time Punjab Police on Sunday apprehended two of Dalla’s operatives in Mohali and Delhi, linked to a recent murder case. Dalla’s shooters were also found involved in a killing in Gwalior.Indian officials stated that Dalla has been wanted for multiple criminal offenses in India. He is believed to have continued Nijjar’s activities, maintaining ties with extremist networks overseas.Dalla, who fled to Canada in July 2020, has been linked to multiple heinous crimes such as murder, extortion and targeted killings in which more than 13 FIRs have been registered against him. He has been allegedly transferring money from Canada to India to his associates to commit various crimes, cops said.He first came on radar of Indian agencies after his role came to fore in the murder of two Dera Sacha Sauda followers in 2020 and 2021. Wanted by NIA besides police in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab, Dalla has been operating from Canada for four years and is suspected to be behind many targeted killings in Punjab.In Jan last year, Dalla was declared a designated terrorist by Union home ministry (MHA) due to his alleged involvement in a series of murders, extortion, terror funding and targeted killings besides terrorist activities.","A shooting in Ontario and the subsequent detention of two men by Canadian Police have sparked speculation that one of those detained is designated terrorist Arshdeep Singh.

Ranthambore’s missing tigers: A tale of turf wars and human threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ranthambores-missing-tigers-a-tale-of-turf-wars-and-human-threat/articleshow/115153520.cms,"File photo

JAIPUR: Tigers may be disappearing from Ranthambore national park due to a complex mix of territorial disputes, human-related threats, and natural aging, as per according to wildlife experts.Recently, chief wildlife warden Pavan Kumar Upadhyay issued an order regarding 25 tigers missing from the park. A search committee could trace 10 of them within three days. Dharmendra Khandal, a conservation biologist with Tiger Watch, noted that among remaining 15 missing tigers, territorial conflicts and human threats appear to be significant factors.Forest department’s report reads, “These younger males were frequently observed roaming in search of unclaimed territories. Territorial disputes with dominant males could be the cause of their disappearance. However, human-related factors must also be considered.These young males may have been exposed to threats from locals, such as poisoning or other manmade risks.”Five older tigers are believed to have died of natural causes due to their advanced age, ranging from 18 to 19 years.The report adds, “Tigers typically live up to around 15 years, making survival beyond that age increasingly difficult. While it is remarkable that these tigers survived in Ranthambore for so long, once they passed the age of 15, they faced immense challenges.Their breeding ceased, and they struggled to maintain their health and territories in the face of mounting competition from younger, dominant tigers.”","Tigers may be disappearing from Ranthambore national park due to a complex mix of territorial disputes, human-related threats, and natural aging.

NEW DELHI: India is set to receive the first of its two guided-missile warships being built in Russia by the end of this month, following a long delay due to ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. However, the delivery of 2 remaining squadrons of S-400 Triumf air defense missile systems is likely to be delayed until 2026, and lease of a nuclear-powered attack submarine until 2028.The multi-role frigate, with a displacement of almost 4,000-tonne, will be handed over to the Indian crew of over 200 officers and sailors stationed at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad for the last few months, defence sources told TOI.The warship will then be commissioned as INS Tushil by defence minister Rajnath Singh, who is slated to visit the country early-Dec for India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) meet.“The second frigate, Tamal, will be handed over early next year. Both the stealth frigates will be packed with weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, and sensors to undertake a variety of missions,” a source said. India in Oct 2018 had inked an umbrella agreement for procurement of four Grigorovich-class frigates , with the first two to be imported from Russia for around Rs 8,000 crore.The other two are being built at Goa Shipyard (GSL) with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore, with the first being “launched” as Triput in July this year. These four warships will add to the six such Russian frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted in the Navy from 2003-04 onwards.Delivery of fourth and fifth squadrons of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in 2018, in turn, will take place only by 2026. “India has asked Russia for faster delivery. But it looks difficult because Russia’s entire defence-industrial production is geared towards Ukraine war,” another source said.IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, missiles and drones at a range of 380-km, in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan, as reported by TOI earlier.On underwater front, India in the past has operated two nuclear-powered attack submarines armed with conventional weapons (called SSNs), INS Chakra-1 and INS Chakra-2, after leasing them from Russia. Then, in March 2019, India inked an over $3 billion (Rs 21,000 crore) deal with Russia to lease a more advanced SSN for 10 years, but its delivery has also been delayed beyond 2027. “Russia has been asked to deliver the SSN earlier, but it is doubtful before 2028,” the source said.The PM-led cabinet committee on security on Oct 9, incidentally, cleared the indigenous project to build two SSNs at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore, but it will take at least a decade for them to roll out.India had of course commissioned its second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBNs) as INS Arighaat in August and plans to induct the third as INS Aridhaman early next year, in a major boost for strategic deterrence.","The multi-role frigate, with a displacement of almost 4,000-tonne, will be handed over to the Indian crew of over 200 officers and sailors stationed at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad.

AHMEDABAD: The number of Indians seeking asylum in the US has seen a significant jump in the past three years, a trend reflecting the strong lure of living the American dream.

Officials in Indian agencies say close to half of these applicants are from Gujarat.In 2023, Indians were the fifth largest group in seeking defensive asylum and the seventh largest in affirmative asylum applications. That year, 5,340 Indians received asylum, states the 2023 Asylees Annual Flow Report of Department of Homeland Security released in October.The 4,330 in FY 2021 included both affirmative applications (2,090) submitted to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services and defensive applications (2,240). The next year, the total applicants nearly tripled to 14,570 — 5,370 affirmative and 9,200 defensive. By FY 2023, the number of Indian asylum applications surged to 41,330, nearly three times the previous year’s total.In FY 2021, as many as 1,330 Indians were granted asylum, including 700 through affirmative applications and 630 through defensive proceedings. In FY 2022, this number more than tripled to 4,260, with 2,180 affirmative and 2,080 defensive grants. The upward trend continued in FY 2023, with 5,340 Indians receiving asylum — 2,710 through affirmative cases and 2,630 through defensive proceedings, making India the fifth leading nationality for defensive asylum grants.","Number of Indians seeking asylum in the US has seen a significant jump in the past three years.

Officers may exercise their judgement in deciding whether to issue a single or multiple-entry visa, and in determining the validity period.""This change coming amid the long visa processing time in India has come as a big blow to Indians given the diaspora in Canada.Travel Agents Federation of India VP Anil Kalsi said: ""Canada used to mostly issue multiple entry visitor visas with a validity of 10 years subject to validity of passport. Which means if my passport has a validity of 8 years when my Canadian visa is approved, I will get the same for 8 years.The change in rule will severely impact travellers and hit visitations to Canada.

OTTAWA: Canadian police have arrested a 35-year-old Brampton resident on charges of assault with a weapon during a violent demonstration at a Hindu temple in the city, authorities said.On Nov 3, a protest occurred at Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton and unverified videos circulating on social media appeared to show demonstrators holding banners in support of Khalistan.The videos showed fist fights and people striking each other with poles on what appears to be the grounds surrounding the temple.Peel police responded to the altercation during the demonstration at the temple. As tensions between opposing sides increased, the demonstrations became physical and assaultive, a statement said on Saturday.Police began investigating several offences that occurred during the demonstration, many of which were captured on video; including individuals using flags and sticks to assault people, it said. Investigators from 21 Division Criminal Investigations Bureau and Strategic Investigation Team (SIT) have arrested and charged Inderjeet Gosal of Brampton, Peel police statement said.A SIT dedicated to investigating incidents of criminality during the Nov 3 and 4 incidents had since been formed. On Nov 3, the protestors carrying Khalistani flags clashed with people and disrupted a consular event co-organised by the temple authorities and the Indian Consulate.Gosal, is a Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) coordinator for Canada, Toronto Star reported.

In a statement, ministry of external affairs said Delhi remains “deeply concerned” about safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada.The relations between India and Canada had come under strain following Trudeau’s allegations in Sept last year of a “potential involvement” of Indian agents in Khalistan extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s killing.

Pakistan on social media overdrive to revive terrorism in Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-on-social-media-overdrive-to-revive-terrorism-in-kashmir/articleshow/115124996.cms,"New Delhi: An exponential rise in social media activity over the past month by Pakistan and PoK-based terrorist handles, aimed at glamourising terrorism and secessionism in J&K, as well as threatening anti-India posts, is being viewed by Indian security agencies as ""a fresh bid by Pakistan-backed terror outfits to revive local terror recruitment in J&K"", according to intelligence sources.An analysis by the agencies here of anti-India activities across ""identified"" Pakistan and PoK-based terror-linked accounts on platforms like Facebook, X, Telegram, Dark Web etc, revealed over 2,000 'posts of concern' in the past one month alone (Oct-Nov), as against 89 during the corresponding period of 2023. This translates to a more than 22-fold rise.Of the nearly 2,016 objectionable posts, more that 130 each were terrorism-specific and anti-India rants, 33 backed separatism and secessionism, and 310 were in the nature of threats to infrastructure and public places like schools etc, TOI has learnt.A senior officer in the central security establishment told TOI that the social media route to influence and exploit impressional minds of J&K youths and radicalise them for anti-national activities - something that had seen young Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani turn into a terror icon before he was killed in 2016 - follows a sharp decline in the number of local Kashmiris joining terrorist outfits. Just four locals in J&K - two from Shopian and one each from Srinagar and Tral - were recruited for terrorist activities till Nov this year, down from 22 in 2023 and 113 in 2022. In fact, there are only 30 local terrorists operating in J&K as of now, as against 75-80 foreign terrorists.""Attempts at raising local recruitment may not point to plans for a troubled winter but to preparations for heightened terror activity in the summer of 2025,"" said an officer.The decline in local recruitment in the past few years was attributed by a senior J&K govt functionary to the central and the UT administration's zero-tolerance approach to terror over the past few years, which focused not only on tackling terrorists but also on dismantling the terror eco-system by choking funding and cracking down on overground supporters by denying them govt jobs and clearances for passports, driving licence, etc.Interestingly, the rise in terrorist outfits' social media outreach to J&K youths coincides with the installation of an elected govt in the UT.Agencies are probing whether the changed power equations in J&K, even though control of police remains with the LG, have emboldened the Pakistan-based terrorist masterminds to whip up trouble there. A recent intelligence input warned of the plan of Pakistan's ISI to target over a dozen Jamaat-e-Islami leaders in Kashmir through their terror associates ""in the near future"". This could be to create public unrest or possibly linked to JeI's decision to enter the political space by contesting the recent J&K assembly elections, a source told TOI.Drone activity, meanwhile, continues to be a concern in J&K, with 40 sightings reported until Oct this year as compared to 31 in the corresponding period of 2023.","Over 2,000 'posts of concern' in the past one month alone (Oct-Nov), as against 89 during the corresponding period of 2023.

"Slums now cover 7.3% of Mumbai, down from 8%: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/slums-now-cover-7-3-of-mum-down-from-8-study/articleshow/115153178.cms,"File photo

MUMBAI: Land covered by slums in Mumbai region declined 8.6%, or 4.1 sq km, between 2005 and 2022, a new study has revealed. That’s an area approximately 4.5 times the size of Mahalaxmi racecourse.The study found the area covered by slums in estuarial Mumbai — Greater Mumbai and Thane city — fell from 47.7 sq km in 2005 to 43.6 sq km in 2022. This overall decline masks a more complex dynamic, though: some bastis grew larger, others became smaller, and a few vanished over the two decades. Slums shrank in some places by a total of 10.2 sq km and grew in others by 6.1 sq km, it found.Many slums also became more closely packed, or dense, after 2010. “While slums grew in area in the first decade, they densified in the second,” says John Friesen, lead author of the study.The findings show that slums should not be seen “as areas of uncontrolled urban expansion but as integral components of the city, constantly undergoing deconstruction and reconstruction”, researchers say.For the study, Friesen and others used high-resolution satellite imagery and other data to map changes in land occupied by slum structures across the Mumbai region between 2005 and 2022.With total land area covering almost 600 sq km (including the national park), the reduction brought down the proportion of land occupied by slums in Mumbai region from 8% in 2005 to 7.3% in 2022.Meanwhile, on the mainland, including Navi Mumbai and parts of Mumbra, slum area grew by almost 35%, increasing from 12 sq km to 16.1 sq km between 2005-2022.Researchers also looked at the spatial density of slums , which they based on the distance between structures. Slum areas that had less than 10 metres distance between structures were categorised as high density, while those with gaps of up to 30 metres were considered low density.Across the region, researchers found the number of low-density slums doubled from 294 to 502 between 2005 and 2010, before dropping back to 266 by 2022.Conversely, the number of tightly packed, or high-density, slums declined slightly before 2010, from 988 to 964, before increasing to 1,359 by 2022.These findings seem to support local observations that slums in the city have grown vertically rather than horizontally in the past decade, and that any sprawl in informal settlements has shifted to outer areas of the metropolitan region.Interestingly, the study also found that slums close to waterbodies and railways reduced over the 17-year period. Slum area within 100 metres of waterbodies declined by 7%, or 1.8 sq km, between 2005 and 2022, and by 11.5% or 3.7 sq km within 100 metres of railway lines.This decline needs to be studied further, Friesen said, noting that the results might be different if they expanded the 100-metre buffer zone to 200 metres. The slum area beyond 100 metres near waterbodies and railways increased, the study found.","Land covered by slums in Mumbai region declined 8.6%, or 4.1 sq km, between 2005 and 2022, a new study has revealed.

India to seek early adoption of climate finance definition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-seek-early-adoption-of-climate-finance-definition/articleshow/115152797.cms,"BAKU: India will call for early adoption of the definition of climate finance to bring transparency in the process of its mobilisation and continue to engage constructively in all negotiations at the 29th session of UN climate conference (CO), beginning on Monday, said the country’s environment secretary Leena Nandan .“Transparency and predictability within climate finance mechanisms are paramount,” Nandan told TOI ahead of the 12-day mega climate talks, where over 190 countries are expected to adopt a new post-2025 finance goal to mobilise adequate finance for helping developing countries implement their updated climate actions — both mitigation and adaptation.The road to a new goal appears to be quite tough at this stage, specifically after Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential election as he had always been opposed to the Paris Agreement and any of the decisions taken by the Joe Biden administration under the pact.“It is important for us the discussion at CO adheres to certain principles during finalisation of the NCQG,” said Nandan while stressing on its alignment with principles of UN Convention (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement.Sharing the country’s broad strategy at CO, she said, “India will continue to engage positively and constructively in all negotiations while safeguarding its key interests, keeping in view common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) of developed and developing countries; flexibilities for developing countries; and consideration of foundational principles of the convention and its Paris Agreement.”Her remarks assume significance as it means India will be strongly opposed to any move of developed nations to dilute UN Convention’s basic principles that put bigger responsibilities on rich nations to not only substantially reduce their carbon emissions but also contribute to climate fund.","The road to a new goal appears to be quite tough at this stage, specifically after Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential election as he had always been opposed to the Paris Agreement.

Judges' vacancies lowest in southern high courts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judges-vacancies-lowest-in-southern-high-courts/articleshow/115152755.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: Why is it that high courts in the southern states have managed to bring down judges’ vacancies to as low as 4% of their sanctioned strength, while the largest ones in other parts of the country have as high as 49%?A TOI analysis shows the constitutional courts in southern states have reversed the trend of perpetual large vacancies of judges as against their counterparts in other states.Kerala HC, for instance, has managed to bring vacancies down to 4%, as on Nov 1, lowest among all big HCs. Others in the region like Madras HC has brought it down to 11% and Karnataka HC to 19%.In contrast, Allahabad HC, the country’s largest HC with a sanctioned strength of 160 judges, has 49% of its judges’ posts vacant, the highest among all 25 HCs. The situation is somewhat similar elsewhere with Orissa HC having 42% vacancies, followed by Calcutta at 40%, and 38% each in Punjab & Haryana, Delhi and Gujarat; and 27% in Bombay.The vacancy issue is a perennial problem troubling higher judiciary, and govt equally. One of the reasons often cited for not finding suitable candidates is the unwillingness of acclaimed lawyers to join the bench as they find the quantum of work too disproportionate to the remuneration offered.The other factor, which probably explains why HCs in the southern states have managed to bring down vacancies significantly, is timely recommendations by the collegium on appointment of judges.As per norms, the chief justice of HC concerned has to initiate a proposal for elevation of an advocate, or from among district judges, for judgeship of HC at least six months prior to the occurrence of the vacancy. However, this timeline is seldom followed, the law minister had said in a written response to a Parliament question during the last monsoon session.The law minister further said that as on July 19, govt had received only 219 recommendations, which were at different stages of processing, as against vacancies of 357 judges. For the 138 remaining vacancies, there were no recommendations made by the collegiums of HCs concerned. Though recommendations are made by a collegium of three senior-most judges of the HC concerned, the final appointment is made with the approval of SC collegium, after an independent vetting by IB. As on Nov 1, 25 HCs in the country had 352 judges’ posts vacant, which is 32% of their sanctioned strength of 1,114.","Kerala HC, for instance, has managed to bring vacancies down to 4%, lowest among all big HCs.

Pakistan Urges Sikh Pilgrims to Carry US Dollars Amid Currency Exchange Woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/pakistan-urges-sikh-pilgrims-to-carry-us-dollars-amid-currency-exchange-woes/articleshow/115098746.cms,"AMRITSAR: Grappling with a foreign exchange shortage, the Pakistan government has reiterated its advice through the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) for Indian pilgrims traveling to Pakistan to celebrate Parkash Purb (the birth anniversary of Sikhism’s founder Guru Nanak Dev) to carry US dollars instead of Indian currency during their pilgrimage, which begins on November 14.The advice was issued by PSGPC president Ramesh Singh Arora following the confirmation of the departure of the Indian jatha by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee.But many Indian devotees may not be able to arrange the foreign exchange for their pilgrimage, because the Pakistan high commission typically issues visas to devotees only on the eve of the Indian jatha’s departure, and often denies visa to several applicants.Without confirmation of the cross-border pilgrimage, devotees may find it difficult to arrange foreign exchange in advance. Unless the government facilitates currency exchange at the Attari border, where pilgrims could exchange their currency before crossing, many devotees may face challenges in obtaining the required foreign currency for their journey.Jagjit Singh Bhullar of Bhai Mardana Yadgiri Kirtan Darbar Society, which has applied for visas for over 800 devotees to visit Pakistan, expressed concerns about the difficulties pilgrims may face in arranging foreign exchange.He said: “I wonder how pilgrims could arrange foreign exchange when they are not even certain of receiving their visas. If visas are issued only a day before departure, many may struggle to obtain foreign currency in such a short time. The government should consider setting up currency exchange desks at Attari to assist pilgrims in this regard.”On the other hand, PSGPC president Ramesh Singh Arora said the committee had advised Indian devotees to carry internationally accepted currency, following numerous complaints regarding unfavourable exchange rates for the Indian currency in Pakistan during previous visits by the Indian jatha. Sources said that private money exchangers in Pakistan often arbitrarily set exchange rates, leading to significant losses for Indian devotees.On an average, an Indian devotee should receive PKR 3,300 for every Rs 1,000, but they are often exploited by money changers who offer rates ranging from PKR 2,600 to PKR 2,800. In the present case, when the Pakistani government itself is asking to bring foreign exchange, the money changers could further dip the exchange rate to around PKR 2,500, causing significant financial losses for Indian pilgrims.“The best solution would be to set up currency exchange desks at Attari to protect pilgrims from any kind of harassment or exploitation,” said Jagjit.",Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) reiterates its advice for Indian pilgrims traveling to Pakistan to celebrate Parkash Purb (the birth anniversary of Sikhism’s founder Guru Nanak Dev) The advice was issued by PSGPC president Ramesh Singh Arora following the confirmation of the departure of the Indian jatha.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115103722,imgsize-308277,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/115103722.jpg"

BENGALURU: A couple from the bustling central business district area of Sadashivnagar found themselves in trouble after an unexpected twist to their green thumb hobby: They took to social media to share a clip of their potted plants, unknowingly catching the attention of netizens who identified a pot in which ganja saplings were growing!Alerted by the online chatter about ganja being grown in the home garden, police swung into action and arrested the couple — 37-year-old Sagar Gurung and his wife Urmila Kumari. Hailing from Namchi in Sikkim, they moved to the city two years back, residing at MSR Nagar in Sadashivanagar. While Sagar is into an eatery business, his wife is a homemaker.Urmila, whose pastime is to watch videos and view photos online, recently chose to become active on social media. Apart from posting her own photos and putting out her thoughts, she started making videos. One such video she posted on Oct 18 was an introduction to the nearly two dozen plants being grown at her residence. However, in this leafy lineup were two ganja saplings, which netizens flagged.The police FIR read: ""After getting the basic information, we raided the couple's home on Nov 5 afternoon. Initially, they did not respond to our questions on the ganja saplings. We inspected and found signs of plants uprooted from two pots. On further questioning, the couple confessed to growing ganja in them and showed us the dustbin where they had thrown them. The saplings weighed 54 grams, and we seized them.""Police suspect that the couple spotted cops at their doorstep and hastily removed the saplings and tossed them into the dustbin in a bid to destroy evidence. They believe the couple grew ganja for commercial gains.Alongside the saplings, police seized Kumari's phone, which she had used to upload the now-infamous video. They now face charges under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act for allegedly intending to cultivate ganja for sale.","Sagar Gurung and his wife Urmila Kumari were arrested for growing ganja in their home garden.

CJI Chandrachud: Pressure on judges from private interest groups as well,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-pressure-on-judges-from-pvt-interest-groups-as-well/articleshow/115128910.cms,"Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud engages in a freewheeling conversation as TOI’s Guest Editor.

NEW DELHI: The pressure on judges comes not just from the political executive, but also from private interest groups , CJI D Y Chandrachud said, during an extensive and frank interaction as Guest Editor of The Times Of India on Saturday.Elaborating, the CJI, who demits office on Monday, said private interest groups use news TV and social media to create an atmosphere where a judge often feels pressured to go in a particular direction. The price of independence here, he pointed out, is to be subjected to heavy trolling. ""You will be trolled, you will be attacked,"" he said. On the larger issue of judicial independence , Justice Chandrachud said it's wrong to measure independence only by looking at judgments where the Supreme Court went against govt views. ""It's a reflection of the state of our polity today,"" he observed, arguing polarised views mean that each ""end of the spectrum"" judges SC's independence by whether the court concurs with it. ""I think I have tried to draw a balance,"" the CJI said. He added he's never tried to fit a judgment to a preconceived view, rather he's gone where his judicial reasoning took him.But the CJI and all high court chief justices need to work with govts on the administrative side, Justice Chandrachud said, recounting his efforts to improve judicial infrastructure , funds for which come from govts. Consultation with govts is also key to resolving court-executive differences , he said, illustrating his point with the SC collegium-Centre differences on selecting judges, an issue that has hit headlines many times.Read also: As CJI D Y Chandrachud bids adieu to Supreme Court, a look at his top 10 judgements ""I have always been candid with the govt,"" CJI said, referring to times when the govt has pushed back on a collegium decision. ""But all differences can't be resolved,"" he added frankly. On perhaps the best-known example of those differences - the govt not yet okaying collegium's decision to appoint lawyer Saurabh Kirpal as an HC judge - the CJI said his view is that neither a prospective judge's sexuality nor the fact that his partner is a foreign citizen can be held against him when assessing his fitness for the job.A CJI known for the clarity with which he writes his judgments, he was emphatic in saying judgments written in archaic or bad English did disservice to those seeking justice. And demonstrating he himself was not attached to stale custom, he said he's for both doing away with the stuffy attire lawyers have to wear in a hot country and simple architecture, not forbiddingly grand, when it comes to building courthouses.","Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud was Guest Editor of The Times Of India.

Industries and students have asked for longer internships.“All departments will now uniformly ensure that there is no core course during the sixth semester. Now, students can plan well ahead and take elective courses in earlier or following semesters to keep the sixth semester free,” said Prathap Haridoss , dean (academic courses), IIT Madras .The students can do courses online, as well.“They will have an eight-month window from mid-November to July. Students can do two internships, one long internship, or they can undertake projects in some universities or labs,” he added.IIT Madras has repositioned the curriculum and made it more compact.Prathap Haridoss said the initiative was taken after receiving feedback from the industry and the placement office.However, for students studying from the second year to the fourth year, it would be a little tougher. “They have to do a little extra work to get the larger window,” he added.Faculty members said the initiative would improve the pre-placement offers. “Companies will be able to assess students better in longer internships. More pre-placement offers will lead to less competition during campus placements,” said Sathyanarayana N Gummadi, dean (students), IIT Madras.Students will also get more time to evaluate the organisation.IIT Madras is planning to focus on placements and internship opportunities for PhD scholars, as well.“We are collecting details on skillsets and areas of interest.

US Election 2024: How Amish voters helped Donald Trump swing Pennsylvania,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-results-2024-why-amish-who-never-vote-voted-for-trump/articleshow/115144822.cms,"Members of the Amish community, Samuel Stoltzfus and his wife Lillian Stoltzfus, vote at a polling center at the Garden Spot Village retirement community in New Holland, Pa., Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. (AP Photo/Luis Andres Henao)

In the 2024 election, Donald Trump managed to expand his support across a broad demographic range, drawing in women, men, young voters, Black Americans, and Hispanics. But perhaps the most surprising new contingent of Trump supporters was the Amish, who typically avoid political engagement. For the first time in Pennsylvania, Amish voters registered to vote in “unprecedented numbers” to support Trump in this key battleground state.This shift came after a government raid at Amos Miller’s raw milk farm in Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania, last January. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture had received reports of illness linked to raw dairy products sold at the farm and subsequently launched an enforcement action. This event sparked widespread concern in the Amish community, which saw it as emblematic of government overreach into their way of life. Traditionally averse to modern politics, the Amish felt compelled to get involved in an effort to protect their livelihoods and traditional practices.Local conservative activist Scott Presler played a significant role in mobilising the Amish for Trump . He spent weeks in Pennsylvania's Amish regions, capitalising on the raid narrative to illustrate government interference in Amish agricultural practices. By highlighting Trump’s stance on limiting federal authority and advocating for religious and personal freedoms, Presler successfully connected with Amish voters who felt that their values and way of life were under threat.The “Amish for Trump” momentum went beyond this one community. Presler also reached out to other traditionally conservative groups, like union laborers and hunters, by emphasising Trump’s positions on job security and Second Amendment rights. However, the Amish alignment was especially striking, as it marked a rare moment when this insular community actively participated in national politics.Elon Musk, one of Trump’s high-profile allies during the campaign, underscored the importance of the Amish vote to Trump’s Pennsylvania ground strategy. In an interview with Tucker Carlson, Musk noted, “We paid significant attention to the Amish community. There was government overreach with the Amish farmers. They were upset, so we made sure they got out to vote.” This outreach effort helped secure Trump’s victory in Pennsylvania, a critical win on his path to the presidency.The “Amish for Trump” movement was more than an anomaly in voting behaviour; it was a testament to the Amish community’s commitment to safeguarding their traditions in the face of what they perceived as federal encroachment. This unexpected surge in support demonstrated the unique coalitions that Trump’s 2024 campaign built across diverse, and often overlooked, American communities.","For the first time in Pennsylvania, Amish voters registered to vote in “unprecedented numbers” to support Trump in this key battleground state.

"H-1B Visa: Amazon, Google and other American companies ramp up use reliance on H-1B visa holders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/amazon-google-and-other-american-companies-ramp-up-use-reliance-on-h-1b-visa-holders/articleshow/115122666.cms,"In recent years, leading American tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Meta have significantly ramped up their reliance on H-1B visa holders, while India’s top IT firms have moved away from these visas, according to an analysis by ET.Since 2016, the use of H-1B visas by American firms has surged by 189%, with Amazon taking the lead at a remarkable 478% rise, followed by Meta (244%) and Google (137%). In contrast, major Indian IT firms , including TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and HCL, have reduced their dependency on H-1B visas by 56%.The increasing reliance on H-1B visa holders by US tech giants over the past eight years contrasts with the approach of India’s IT companies, which have been reducing their dependence, according to the Economic Times analysis. This shift reflects how Indian firms, having established strong operations in the US, are now actively recruiting American workers and offering Green Card sponsorships to experienced professionals.The heightened demand for H-1B visas among American companies is seen as a response to a need for specialised talent across digital transformation, cloud computing, and AI sectors, according to Vic Goel, managing partner at US-based corporate immigration law firm Goel & Anderson. Goel notes that “US companies must rely on H-1B visas to fill roles with skills not easily found domestically, especially in emerging tech.”Meanwhile, the recently elected President Donald Trump’s anti-immigration stance could affect the issuance of new H-1B visas, renewals of existing visas, and the work eligibility of H-4 visa holders (spouses of H-1B holders). Founders of Indian origin, such as Aravind Srinivas of the AI start-up Perplexity, have also raised concerns about the challenges associated with obtaining Green Cards, sparking further debate on immigration difficulties.Immigration experts anticipate that Trump’s return to office could lead to substantial changes in the Immigration and Nationality Act, particularly concerning H-1B visas. Some suggest that country-specific quotas might be introduced, potentially benefiting India due to its diplomatic relationship with the US. Rusell A. Stamets, a partner at Circle of Counsels in Delhi, advises that Indian businesses with significant US ties should proactively deepen their understanding of US policies to positively influence their outcomes.Regardless of policy adjustments, experts foresee rising costs in hiring foreign talent due to increases in visa fees and wage requirements for H-1B positions. Rajiv Dabhadkar, founder of the National Organisation for Software and Technology Professionals, points out, “The original aim of the H-1B visa programme was to help US employers find talent not locally available, but recent increases in fees and prevailing wages have underscored this intent.”During Trump’s previous term, H-1B visa applications faced heightened scrutiny, with 34% requiring additional documentation. This created uncertainty for applicants and potentially impacted family stability, particularly if spouses lose work rights. Poorvi Chothani, founder of the immigration law firm LawQuest, warns that “existing H-1B holders may face greater professional and personal instability if wages don’t meet high standards and if H-4 visa holders lose their work eligibility.”In response, India’s technology sector, through industry body Nasscom, has invested $1.1 billion towards STEM development in the US, forming partnerships with over 130 colleges and universities and upskilling 255,000 employees. This initiative has contributed to over 600,000 jobs in the US, both directly and indirectly, demonstrating India’s commitment to the US talent ecosystem despite changing visa policies.","Since 2016, the use of H-1B visas by American firms has surged by 189%.

Vance and his family live between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Alexandria, Virginia, reflecting his commitment to both his home state and his political responsibilities. Vance’s mother, Beverly Aikins, has been a significant figure in his life. Raised in Middletown, she is now 10 years sober, a journey Vance often highlights in his speeches. Aikins has travelled with him on the campaign trail, sharing her story to inspire others facing similar challenges.Vance gained national recognition with his memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" published in 2016. The book offers a candid look at his turbulent childhood, including his mother’s struggles with addiction and the profound impact of his grandmother, whom he refers to as Mamaw. It has served as a lens through which many understand the socio-economic issues affecting the Rust Belt and Appalachia. The memoir was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard, starring Glenn Close and Amy Adams.Forbes estimates Vance's net worth at approximately $10 million, a substantial amount that highlights his rise from humble beginnings and positions him in circles that may have once felt uncomfortable to his younger self. According to his 2023 Senate financial disclosure, Vance earned about $55,000 in royalties from his memoir, with $121,000 reported in 2022. By July 2024, media reports indicated the book had sold nearly 2 million copies.Vance entered politics in 2022, securing a Senate seat in Ohio by defeating former Democratic Representative Tim Ryan. His relationship with Trump has changed over the years. Initially critical, he once compared Trump to ""America’s Hitler"" and was hesitant to support him in 2016. However, as he prepared for his Senate campaign, Vance reversed his position, deleted the controversial tweets, and began endorsing Trump, eventually earning his backing.As Vance helps Trump form his administration after the election, he is on track to become the nation's youngest vice president since 1953, when Richard Nixon, who was 40 just days before his inauguration, was sworn in as Dwight Eisenhower's vice president. The record for the youngest vice president is held by John C. Breckinridge, who was 36 when he assumed office in 1857 as James Buchanan's vice president.","JD Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, and spent summers in Jackson, Kentucky. After high school, Vance joined the Marine Corps and served as a public affairs officer in Iraq, adding a layer of depth to his political identity.

JD Vance Usha Chilukuri Love Story: Veg meets non-veg: How JD Vance fell in love with Usha,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/veg-meets-non-veg-how-jd-vance-fell-in-love-with-usha/articleshow/115054668.cms,"This story was originally published by our reporter Avijit Ghosh.

From Friendship to Marriage



A Resilient Partnership in Life and Politics



JD Vance and Usha Chilukuri come from markedly different backgrounds. Vance, the son of a mother struggling with addiction and raised by his grandmother in an economically challenged community in Ohio, faced considerable hardships. In contrast, Chilukuri, the daughter of Indian immigrants, grew up in California in a household that placed a strong emphasis on academic and professional achievements—her father an IIT-trained mechanical engineer and her mother a marine biologist. Despite their contrasting upbringings, their lives intersected at Yale Law School, where they collaborated on a significant writing project. As Usha noted, “We were friends first; I mean, who wouldn’t want to be friends with JD?”Their connection continued to grow, evolving from friendship into love. In Hillbilly Elegy , Vance describes his initial feelings for Usha as overwhelming. He recalls, “I thought about her constantly. One friend described me as ‘heartsick,’ and another said he had never seen me like this.” Once he learned that Usha was single, he didn’t hesitate to ask her out, beginning a relationship that gradually deepened.Navigating their personal differences and social challenges, Usha supported JD as he adjusted to unfamiliar environments. At one point, however, Vance’s struggle with handling stress within their relationship put their bond to the test. He recounts an incident in which he stormed out of a hotel room after a disappointing interview, only to later offer a heartfelt apology. Reflecting on Usha’s response, he said, “She calmly told me through her tears that it was never acceptable to run away.”JD and Usha married in 2014, and their intercultural relationship has proven to be a strong foundation for both of them. While introducing JD at the Republican National Convention , Usha remarked, “That JD and I could meet, let alone fall in love and marry, is testament to this great country.” She described JD as a “meat and potatoes guy” who, over time, learned to enjoy her vegetarian diet and even prepared Indian dishes for her mother.Their unique partnership has now propelled them to one of the highest platforms in the US, as JD, a venture capitalist and author, prepares to assume the role of Vice President-elect.","JD Vance and Usha Chilukuri come from markedly different backgrounds.

"‘Guns, gays, and god’: Nancy Pelosi on how Trump trumped Democrats in US Presidential Elections 2024",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/guns-gays-and-god-nancy-pelosi-on-how-trump-trumped-democrats-in-us-presidential-elections-2024/articleshow/115143741.cms,"1. “Guns, Gays, and God”: A Powerful Cultural Strategy



2. The Role of Gun Rights in the Political Divide



3. “Gays” and LGBTQ+ Rights: A Cultural Flashpoint



4. God and Religion: A Dividing Line in Morality Politics



5. The Working-Class Perception of the Democratic Party



6. Messaging Challenges and the Path Forward



7. Reclaiming the Working-Class Base



8. Moving Beyond “Anti-Trump” Rhetoric



In the aftermath of a difficult electoral defeat for the Democrats, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered a candid assessment of what went wrong and what lies ahead. Reflecting on Trump’s return as president-elect, a Republican Senate majority, and an uncertain House race, Pelosi acknowledged the setbacks but resisted claims that the Democratic Party had lost its core values. Key to her analysis was the idea that Democrats faced a cultural assault centered on divisive issues like guns, LGBTQ+ rights, and religion — a triad Pelosi referred to as “guns, gays, and God.” This phrase encapsulated her view that the Republican strategy successfully leveraged emotional issues to gain traction with certain voters, particularly among working-class and religious Americans.Pelosi argued that the Republican Party effectively redirected public discourse towards cultural issues. These “guns, gays, and God” topics have been foundational to a conservative agenda aiming to galvanise specific voting blocs. According to Pelosi, these themes serve as rallying points, distracting voters from economic and social issues in favour of intense, often emotional appeals to deeply held beliefs. The Republican approach, she suggested, helped frame the Democrats as out of touch with traditional American values, especially among rural and working-class voters.One major aspect of this cultural strategy, Pelosi noted, is gun rights. Gun ownership and Second Amendment rights are central to many Americans, especially in rural areas, where gun culture is both a lifestyle and a matter of personal freedom. The Democratic Party’s push for gun control and common-sense regulations has been met with opposition by the Republican narrative that casts these efforts as infringements on personal liberty. For many voters, the right to bear arms is not only a constitutional issue but also a symbol of resistance to perceived government overreach. Pelosi recognised that the Democrats’ stance on gun control likely alienated some voters who prioritise this issue, though she maintained that the party’s commitment to reducing gun violence remains strong.Another focal point of the Republican strategy, according to Pelosi, is the issue of LGBTQ+ rights. Although public support for LGBTQ+ rights, including same-sex marriage, has grown significantly over recent years, conservatives have continued to use this issue to draw a contrast between “traditional” and “progressive” values. Pelosi argued that the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals have been framed as a threat to traditional family values by some Republicans, particularly in states with strong religious influences. This framing, she suggested, alienates conservative-leaning voters and casts the Democratic Party as opposed to conventional family structures, despite Democrats’ advocacy for equal rights and protection for all citizens.The recent surge in anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, especially regarding trans rights and issues like gender identity, has become a divisive cultural flashpoint. Conservatives have argued that Democrats’ stance on transgender issues is out of step with mainstream values, leveraging this rhetoric to win over voters who view these issues as emblematic of an overly progressive agenda. Pelosi observed that this strategy has had some success, especially in more conservative areas, as it taps into voters' anxieties about societal change and traditional norms.Religion, particularly Christian nationalism, has also become a critical theme in the Republican cultural arsenal. Pelosi noted that Republicans have positioned themselves as the party aligned with religious values, often accusing Democrats of being secular or even hostile to faith-based beliefs. For some voters, Pelosi argued, the Democratic Party’s commitment to policies such as reproductive rights and separation of church and state are interpreted as direct challenges to religious doctrines. This framing casts the party as morally and culturally out of sync with many Americans, particularly evangelical and conservative Christian communities who see their faith as under attack.According to Pelosi, the use of “God” in the cultural narrative is especially powerful, as it appeals to Americans who feel their religious identity is threatened by progressive social policies. She warned that by exploiting these divisions, Republicans have managed to create a moral opposition to the Democratic platform, positioning themselves as protectors of a “Christian America.”Beyond these cultural issues, Pelosi acknowledged that some critics within her party, like Bernie Sanders , argued that Democrats had lost touch with working-class voters. Sanders suggested that the party’s focus on progressive cultural issues and social agendas alienated voters concerned with economic issues like inflation, jobs, and wages. Pelosi, however, refuted claims that the Democrats had abandoned working families, citing legislative achievements like the child tax credit, the Infrastructure Bill, and the CHIPS Act. Nonetheless, she admitted that the Democratic message may not have been communicated effectively, with cultural issues overshadowing economic accomplishments in the eyes of voters.Pelosi recognised the difficulty of competing with the emotional appeal of cultural issues, which often draw a sharper line than economic debates. She acknowledged that the Democrats’ message on economic achievements and social policies may not have reached certain segments of the electorate. In her view, the party’s challenge is to clarify its values and communicate its achievements in ways that resonate with everyday Americans, especially those drawn to the cultural appeals of the Republican message.In Pelosi’s assessment, the way forward for the Democratic Party involves shifting the focus back to its core mission: advocating for working families, addressing economic inequality, and ensuring a strong social safety net. She stressed that the party’s historical strength has been in representing the interests of those who work hard and seek fairness, contrasting this with the perception that the Republican Party primarily serves the wealthy elite. Pelosi urged her party to “organise, not agonise,” reaffirming its commitment to policies that benefit working families and challenging the narrative that has allowed Republicans to gain ground with cultural issues.Finally, Pelosi cautioned against letting the Democratic Party become solely defined as the opposition to Trump. While acknowledging the need to counter Trump’s policies and rhetoric, she argued that Democrats must also articulate a positive, aspirational vision that transcends merely being “anti-Trump.” By focusing on its achievements and future goals, the Democratic Party, she believes, can reclaim its identity as a force for progress and justice, rather than simply an antagonist to Trumpism.In closing, Pelosi underscored the need for the Democratic Party to connect with voters on both cultural and economic grounds, striving to bridge the divide that “guns, gays, and God” has opened. As the party prepares for future battles, Pelosi remains optimistic that a redefined message and unified strategy can help them win back support across diverse communities.","Pelosi argued that the Republican Party effectively redirected public discourse towards cultural issues.

(With inputs from agencies)

The Canadian police have arrested Arshdeep Singh alias Arsh Dalla, a Khalistani terrorist , in connection with a shootout in the country last month, according to several media reports on Sunday.Dalla, one of the India's most wanted criminal and a close aide of slain Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar , was arrested for his suspected involvement in a shootout on October 28 in Milton town, said the reports citing intelligence sources.In September this year, Dalla took responsibility for the murder of Congress leader, Baljinder Singh Balli, who was shot dead at his residence in Punjab's Moga district.Earlier in the day, Punjab Police arrested two key operatives of Dalla in connection with the murder of Sikh activist Gurpreet Singh Hari Nau in Faridkot district last month. The arrests were made in a joint operation by the State Special Operation Cell of Mohali, the Anti-Gangster Task Force, and Faridkot Police.Investigations revealed that the two arrested operatives were also involved in the killing of Jaswant Singh Gill, a man serving a life sentence in a 2016 murder case. Gill was shot dead in Gwalior district, Madhya Pradesh, on November 7, 2024, on the directions of Arsh Dalla.Dalla is the second close aide of Nijjar to be arrested by Canadian authorities in the past week.On November 8, Canadian police arrested a 35-year-old Brampton resident Inderjeet Gosal on charges of assault with a weapon during a violent demonstration at a Hindu temple in the city, authorities said.Gosal, is the Sikhs for Justice coordinator for Canada, Toronto Star reported. The US-based SFJ is banned in India.Gosal replaced Nijjar as the Sikhs for Justice's main Canadian organizer after the latter was gunned down in British Columbia in June 2023. He is considered to be the lieutenant of SJF's general counsel Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who is designated a terrorist by India.Gosal was released on conditions and is to appear at the Ontario Court of Justice in Brampton at a later date.The relations between India and Canada came under severe strain following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a ""potential"" involvement of Indian agents in Khalistan extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing.New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as ""absurd"".India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.","Arshdeep Singh alias Arsh Dalla, a Khalistani terrorist, arrested by Canadian police.

Tom Brady, the legendary quarterback of the football field has had his fair share of headlines not only concerning his football playing career but also some glamorous relationships. Probably the most publicized celebrity union has been his 2009 marriage to Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen. Brady and Bündchen finally announced their divorce at the end of 2022 after thirteen years. That ended a somewhat flashy chapter for both of them. Their very public split hasn't kept Brady from trying to keep some of it private as he now works toward a different life with Bündchen.Word just came that Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen is going to have a child with her new boyfriend, jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente. This was a shock to many people involved-most of all Brady, who supposedly is ""shocked"" by the news. Though sources say that being divorced does not make the news less emotional for Brady, it is considered a shock nonetheless. The news complicated an already public breakup as Brady contemplates this new chapter in Bündchen's life. Brady has termed the situation as ""unforeseen"", following as he copes with reality and especially as he sees his ex-wife move on in such a defining way.Also Read - How NFL Players Invest It has been reported that Tom Brady has chosen to step away from public affairs about his private life in general. Insiders have been saying that Brady ""is taking a break"" from speaking publicly about the case. After being on everyone's headlines for a couple of months after the engagement broke down, Brady is now keen to protect his private life and emotional vulnerability. This followed the pronouncement of his wife that she had fallen pregnant and thrown an assortment of changes into his life that makes him not privy to disclose more about his affairs to other people but to other matters.As Brady can be recognized to be very emotional at work, his ego remains largely with his children and plans for the future.

Michael Jordan’s career in film and television

Michael Jeffrey Jordan, better known by his initials, MJ, is an American businessman and former professional basketball player. He played for the Chicago Bulls in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1984 to 2003 for a total of fifteen seasons. He won six NBA championships during that time. Charismatic with brilliant athleticism and unmatched basketballing capabilities, he brought this sport and NBA around the globe during the 1980s and 1990s - making him a global cultural icon. According to the player profile on the NBA website, ""By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.”Also Read: Former NBA star Evan Turner let it slip that ticket prices for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour can be jaw-dropping Michael Jordan, despite retiring from professional basketball, remains one of the most financially successful athletes in history, with a net worth of $3.2 billion according to Marca , a testament to his legendary NBA career and business acumen. The financial success of Jordan is largely channeled from his long-standing partnership with Nike, which has eventually made Air Jordans one of the giants in the whole globe.A brand launched way back in the 1980s still maintains its momentum in terms of sales, and Jordan's initial deal with Nike was over what his campers considered a dream, thus giving signs that the Air Jordan legacy is not slowing down. He has been paid more than $1.8 billion by his corporate partners for endorsement deals during his NBA tenure, while he has earned $90 million during his NBA tenure.The riches for him, however, increased significantly from those business ventures that continue pouring in dough outside basketball. Another big decision of Michael Jordan in business is the purchase of the Charlotte Hornets in 2010. It boomed in value year after year. Even when he sold his minority stake in 2019, his Hornets were worth $1.5 billion, and this further only poured more dollars into his already good financial position.Michael Jordan made a cameo appearance as himself in the 1996 comedy film Space Jam. The movie received generally unfavorable reviews from the critics, but it did well at the box offices and collected over $230 million worldwide, and merchandising alone collected over $1 billion.In 2000, Jordan appeared in an IMAX documentary about his Chicago Bulls career, specifically the 1998 NBA playoffs, titled Michael Jordan to the Max.[383] Twenty years later, the same period in Michael's life was explored in much greater and personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning The Last Dance, a 10-part television documentary which premiered on ESPN in April and May 2020.The Last Dance made extensive use of some 500 hours of candid film of Michael's and his teammates' off-court lives which an NBA Entertainment crew had captured during the 1997–98 NBA season for use in a documentary. The movie was pushed back several years due to Jordan not granting the rights for the footage to be used. Jordan was interviewed at three locations related to filming and was not allowed to have cameras in his house or on his private plane, as the director, Jason Hehir, said ""there are certain aspects of his life that he wants to keep private"".Jordan allowed rapper Travis Scott to shoot his ""Franchise"" music video single at his Highland Park, Illinois home. 2022 miniseries The Captain is about the life and career of Derek Jeter, in which Jordan features.Also Read: ""I just wanted to win”: Lakers’ D'Angelo Russell appeared completely at peace with his benching against the Sixers","Michael Jeffrey Jordan, better known by his initials, MJ, is an American businessman and former professional basketball player.

Citizens' Complaints on

cVIGIL App

PUNE: The Election Commission's enforcement agencies' crackdown on poll-time inducements in both Maharashtra and Jharkhand yielded record seizures. Precious metals led the haul in Maharashtra, while freebies topped the charts in Jharkhand, ECI officials said late last week. Maharashtra's total seizures reached Rs 280.93 crore since the announcement of elections, with precious metals accounting for Rs 90.53 crore – the highest component.The data showed that Jharkhand reported total seizures worth Rs 158.7 crore, with freebies constituting a massive Rs 127.88 crore of the total haul.""These figures represent a three-fold increase from the 2019 assembly elections in both states,"" a senior EC official told TOI, attributing it to enhanced surveillance and enforcement measures. Agencies under the Election Commission seized Rs 558 crore worth of cash, freebies, liquor, drugs, and precious metals to stop any inducement of voters in ongoing elections in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, and by-polls. Combined seizures in the two poll-bound states marked a 3.5-time increase compared to the Assembly Election in 2019 when Maharashtra recorded seizures worth Rs 103.61 crore, while for Jharkhand, it was Rs 18.76 crore.CEC Rajiv Kumar earlier directed all officials on the ‘Zero Tolerance’ of the Commission towards any kind of inducements in elections. He also asked for joint teams from multiple agencies to clamp down on the distribution and movement of illicit liquor, drugs, freebies, and cash in both states. Recently, during a meeting with CS, DGP, Excise Commissioners, and enforcement agencies of the two poll-going states and their neighbouring states and UTs, he stressed close vigilance on movements across inter-state borders and also directed agencies to establish backward linkages of seizures for wider deterrence.Regular follow-ups and reviews with each district, the use of information technology, precise data interpretation, and the active participation of enforcement agencies led to this significant spurt in seizures, officials added. The real-time reporting of interceptions and seizures with the ECI’s Election Seizure Management System (ESMS) led to regular and precise reviews on expenditure monitoring by the Commission and agencies themselves. The election officials mapped out 110 Assembly Constituencies in the two states (Maharashtra - 91 & Jharkhand - 19), which are marked as Expenditure Sensitive Constituencies for more focused vigilance.The cVigil app has been an effective tool in the hands of citizens to flag election code violations . Since the announcement of the assembly elections and the by-polls, 9,681 complaints were resolved through the cVigil app, stated election officials from both states. The disposal rate of the complaints was over 98%, with over 83% of the complaints being resolved in under 100 minutes.By using this app, citizens can immediately report incidents of any election-related violations, and action is taken within a 100-minute timeline. Ahead of the polls, as many as 8,546 campaign requests came from Maharashtra, while 6,317 requests came from Jharkhand.","Election Commission's enforcement agencies' crackdown on poll-time inducements yielded record seizures.
