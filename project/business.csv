'Water bomb': China building world's most powerful mega dam in the Himalayas — how it impacts India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/water-bomb-china-building-worlds-most-powerful-mega-dam-in-the-himalayas-how-it-impacts-india/articleshow/126050335.cms,"India Speeds Up Visas For Chinese Businesses Amid Thaw In Ties; Beijing Calls It 'Positive Move'

China is pressing ahead with a massive hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet, a move that experts and Indian officials warn could seriously endanger water security, ecology and livelihoods downstream in India.As the river enters India as the Brahmaputra, any large-scale intervention upstream is seen as a direct risk to millions who depend on its natural flow. The proposed $168bn hydropower system will harness a steep 2,000 metre drop in altitude through an intricate network of dams, reservoirs, tunnels and underground power stations.For India, the concern is not just environmental but existential. Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu has warned that the project could be used as a “water bomb”, with China potentially controlling the timing and volume of water released into the Brahmaputra. Sudden discharges could trigger floods, while withholding water could dry out large stretches of the river during critical periods.Although much of the Brahmaputra’s water comes from monsoon rains and tributaries within India, experts say upstream manipulation can still disturb the river’s natural rhythm. Even limited changes could affect fertile floodplains, fisheries and groundwater recharge across Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, regions already vulnerable to climate stress.China has dismissed these concerns, as the Chinese foreign ministry has insisted that downstream countries will not be adversely affected. However, scepticism remains strong in India, partly shaped by China’s track record on other transboundary rivers.The technical scale of the project has also heightened fears. Brian Eyler, director of the Energy, Water and Sustainability Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, has described it as the most sophisticated hydropower system ever attempted, but also one of the riskiest.Any failure or miscalculation in such a seismically sensitive and ecologically fragile region could have cascading consequences downstream.Beijing’s management of the Mekong River has drawn repeated criticism from downstream nations, which accuse Chinese dam operators of worsening droughts by regulating water flow to suit power generation needs. While China denies these allegations, they have reinforced Indian fears about a similar approach on the Brahmaputra.The upstream developments have prompted India’s largest state-run hydropower company to push ahead with its own 11,200-megawatt project on the Brahmaputra, a move driven partly by fears of losing strategic and water security ground.Experts warn that competing mega projects on the same river system could worsen risks for both countries. Without cooperation and transparency, analysts caution, a dam-building race between India and China could undermine regional stability and place the future of the Brahmaputra and the millions who rely on it in jeopardy.","Proposed $168bn hydropower system will harness a steep 2,000 metre drop in altitude through an intricate network of dams, reservoirs, tunnels and underground power stations.

Ashwagandha gets global health focus at WHO summit in Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ashwagandha-gets-global-health-focus-at-who-summit-in-delhi/articleshow/126050368.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ashwagandha, a staple of Ayurveda and a familiar household remedy, moved into the global health spotlight at the 2nd WHO Global Traditional Medicine Summit, 2025, as international experts debated how traditional herbs can be safely integrated into modern healthcare.The summit was inaugurated on Wednesday at Bharat Mandapam by Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare J.P. Nadda, in the presence of Union Minister Prataprao Jadhav, marking the start of the three-day global scientific congregation being held from December 17 to 19. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is expected to grace the closing ceremony on December 19.Against this backdrop, a high-level side event organised by the WHO Global Traditional Medicine Centre in collaboration with the Ministry of Ayush brought Ashwagandha into sharp focus. Scientists, regulators and policymakers from across the world examined its growing international use for stress management, brain health and immunity, and discussed how centuries-old traditional knowledge can be aligned with modern scientific evidence.Addressing the gathering, Jadhav said India is steadily expanding international cooperation in traditional medicine through education, research and capacity building.He noted that India offers 104 scholarships annually to foreign nationals, has signed 26 country-level memoranda of understanding, collaborates with more than 50 institutions globally, and has set up Ayush Chairs in 15 universities and Ayush Information Cells in 43 countries. He added that collaborative research — including Ashwagandha trials in the United Kingdom, Guduchi studies in Germany and Ayurveda-based diabetes research in Latvia — is generating a growing body of scientific evidence.Speakers stressed that wider global acceptance of Ashwagandha depends on rigorous clinical research, standardised formulations and strong safety monitoring. While traditional use provides a strong foundation, experts cautioned that herbal products must meet the same quality and safety benchmarks as conventional medicines as their reach expands beyond India.International regulators shared how markets in Europe and the United States are evaluating Ashwagandha, underlining the need for clear dosage guidance and reliable quality testing to prevent misuse and misinformation.Participants agreed that sustained global collaboration is essential to ensure Ashwagandha’s benefits reach people safely without diluting the credibility of Ayurveda. The discussion reflected a broader shift in global health thinking — recognising traditional medicine as a credible, evidence-based partner in public healthcare rather than an informal alternative.","Ashwagandha moved into the global health spotlight at the 2nd WHO Global Traditional Medicine Summit, 2025.

SC takes exception to seeking info on suspension through RTI applications

New Delhi: In a surprise public acknowledgement of corruption in judiciary, a Supreme Court bench led by CJI Surya Kant on Wednesday said there is a growing trend of judges passing a series of orders for extraneous considerations on the eve of their retirements.While hearing a petition filed by a Madhya Pradesh principal district judge challenging his suspension 10 days prior to retirement, allegedly because of two judicial orders passed by him, the bench of CJI Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, ""Petitioner just before retirement started hitting sixes. It is an unfortunate trend. I do not want to elaborate on it.""Senior advocate Vipin Sanghi, appearing for the judicial officer, said he had an impressive career with very good rating in annual confidential reports. He was to superannuate on Nov 30 but was suspended on Nov 19, ostensibly because of two judicial orders. ""How can an officer be suspended for judicial orders which can be appealed against and rectified by higher judiciary?"" asked Sanghi.The bench said, ""Disciplinary proceedings cannot be initiated against a judicial officer for passing orders which are erroneous. He cannot be suspended for this. But if the orders are palpably dishonest?""The judicial officer was to retire on Nov 30. SC on Nov 20 directed the MP govt to postpone the retirement by one year as it had increased the retirement age of state employees to 62 years.The judicial officer would now retire on Nov 30, 2026. ""The judicial officer did not know, when he passed those two orders, that his retirement age had been increased by one year. There is a growing trend of judges passing so many orders just before retirement,"" the CJI said.The bench asked Sanghi as to why the judicial officer did not approach HC to challenge the suspension. Sanghi said that since it was a full court decision, the judicial officer thought it would be better to move SC for a fair hearing.The bench said, ""There are so many instances when full court decisions have been set aside by HCs on the judicial side."" The bench also took exception to the judicial officer seeking grounds for his suspension through RTI applications. ""He could have submitted a representation in this regard. It is not expected of a senior judicial officer to resort to the RTI route to get information. We see no ground to entertain the petition. The petitioner can make a representation to the HC for recall of the suspension order. The HC would decide his representation in four weeks,"" the bench said.","Supreme Court bench led by CJI Surya Kant said there is a growing trend of judges passing a series of orders for extraneous considerations on the eve of their retirements.

"7 years on, OBC list still to get Parliament's stamp",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-years-on-obc-list-still-to-get-parliaments-stamp/articleshow/126047962.cms,".

New Delhi: The Centre has not notified the central list of OBCs for the last seven years since it granted constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes, which mandated that the list of backwards will in the future be approved by Parliament as against the present practice of publishing it through an executive order.The indecision on the crucial list, well-placed govt sources said, is a result of the govt's apparent reluctance to touch the Rohini commission report on sub-categorisation of backward classes - halting the transition to the new path laid down by the 102nd constitutional amendment of 2018. As a consequence, the central list of OBCs has remained frozen since 2018, without any fresh inclusion or exclusion of communities.Sources said the central list has to be notified by Parliament in view of the 102nd constitutional amendment which put NCBC at par with the national commissions for SCs and STs, while laying down that the OBC list too would follow the notification process of parliamentary approval like the lists of SCs and STs. ""...A process that was initiated in 2019 was put in deep freeze,"" a source said.The seeming hurdle created by the Rohini commission is puzzling.Sources said the govt cannot simply replicate the existing OBC list through Parliament because it was found to have many discrepancies, like spellings, and had asked the Rohini panel to compile corrections. But the panel's main mandate was sub-division of the central list of OBCs, which emerged as the key political agenda of BJP a few years ago. But since then, the governing party gave up its push to divide the backward list because of apparently altered political sensitivity, and has kept the report confidential since July 31, 2023, when the commission finally submitted its report after 14 extensions over six years.""Moving to correct the OBC list would require opening the Rohini report,"" an official said. Amid the limbo, the list has remained frozen for seven years as the old system of inclusion/exclusion, NCBC Act of 1993, was repealed along with the promulgation of the 102nd constitutional amendment. The 1993 Act had the exclusive mandate of inclusion/exclusion. Sources said there are around 450 proposals for inclusion/exclusion at different stages of processing with the social justice ministry.",The Centre has not notified the central list of OBCs for the last seven years.

AQI Severe-Plus, Delhi’s Worst In More Than 1 Yr

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement, while the region continued to grapple with toxic air quality in the ‘severe-plus’ category. The deteriorating weather and pollution conditions also impacted air travel, prompting IndiGo Airlines to issue a travel advisory warning passengers of possible delays and urging them to plan their journeys with extra caution.Amid changing weather conditions, IndiGo Airlines on Monday issued a travel advisory for passengers as Delhi witnessed the first signs of winter fog this season, impacting visibility at the airport.In its advisory, the airline said visibility levels around the airport were currently reduced, and as a result, flight operations were being adjusted, with some departures likely to take longer than usual. IndiGo assured passengers that its teams remain available to provide support, acknowledging that travel plans, schedules, and connections are important.The airline also cautioned that road traffic could be slower due to foggy conditions and advised passengers to plan their journeys accordingly and allow additional time to reach the airport.IndiGo said it is closely monitoring the situation and will keep passengers informed, adding that departures will continue as conditions improve, with safety remaining the top priority.Similarly Air India issued a travel advisory for passengers; it said, ""Poor visibility due to dense fog is impacting flight operations in Delhi and parts of Northern India. Please check your flight status at: http://airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html before heading to the airport.""Earlier on Sunday, Delhiites could literally see poison in the air. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to 'severe-plus' category for the first time this year.The city's 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec - 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.On Sunday, atmospheric ‘inversion’ made the situation worse. This occurs when cooler air near the ground gets trapped under warmer air above, stopping pollutants from dispersing. Though meteorological conditions remained unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, local emissions continued to remain high.“This is a true depiction of Delhi’s local emissions because wind speeds are almost zero, meaning there is hardly any inflow or outflow of air. Vertical ventilation is confined to a column of just 600 metres, which means whatever remains in the box — Delhi — is largely its own emissions. Under these conditions, the contribution of dust is negligible. When dust is released from construction activity, it usually spreads to other areas due to wind, but with winds nearly calm, it cannot pollute places beyond the immediate site of release,” said Gufran Beig, founder of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and Chair Professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS).Of the total 39 active air quality monitoring stations, 38 saw ‘severe’ AQI while only Shadipur was placed in the ‘very poor’ category at 375. Of these, three stations — Wazirpur, Rohini and Ashok Vihar — maxed out at 500, while several others reported AQI above 490.This is the second spell of severe air days in Delhi this season. The city had recorded three consecutive severe days from Nov 11 to 13. In this winter season, the city has recorded five such days, when AQI surpassed 400.After air quality started rapidly deteriorating on Saturday, the Graded Response Action Plan’s stage III was imposed in the morning. Stage IV was invoked on Saturday evening as AQI showed no sign of improvement. Currently, all stages of GRAP are in force.Delhi’s highest-ever AQI of 497 was recorded on Nov 6, 2016. The second-worst air quality day followed on Nov 18 last year with AQI reaching 494.Experts said since winds are likely to rise only marginally post-noon, no significant respite from toxic air quality is expected on Monday. However, the Centre’s Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) stated that the AQI may dip to ‘very poor’ on Monday. “Delhi’s air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category from Dec 15 till 17. The outlook for the subsequent six days from Dec 18 is that AQI is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category,” said the EWS.The CPCB classifies AQI 050 as 'good', 51-100 as 'satisfactory', 101-200 as 'moderate', 201300 as 'poor', 301-400 as 'very poor', 401-450 as 'severe', and 451 and above as ‘severe plus.’ Meanwhile, the lowest visibility on Sunday morning was recorded at 200 metres at Safdarjung. It was 350 metres at Palam. “Safdarjung reported 300 metres at 5.30am but calm winds further reduced the visibility to 200 metres at 8am,” said a Met official.India Meteorological Department measures fog in terms of visibility. Visibility between 500-1,000 metres is considered ‘shallow’ fog. Fog is 'moderate' when visibility is between 200-500 metres, and ‘dense’ below 200 metres.The maximum temperature was recorded at 24 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The minimum stood at 8.2 degrees C. IMD has predicted shallow to moderate fog in the early hours of Monday.","A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday criticised Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi for his remarks on India’s manufacturing sector during his visit to Germany, accusing him of “insulting India from foreign soil” at a time when Parliament is in session.BJP MP Sambit Patra said the LoP carries a “huge responsibility” and needs to behave in a “responsible manner”, especially while travelling abroad.""LoP has a huge responsibility. The LoP has to behave in a really responsible manner, especially when the LoP is on foreign soil.

In 2025 manufacturing in the country has grown at a record 5.4 per cent.

The post added that he inspected several cars and motorcycles at the plant.“He was pleased to see TVS’s 450cc motorcycle, developed in partnership with BMW—a proud moment to witness Indian engineering on display,” the post read.In the same post, Rahul reiterated his criticism of the Centre's manufacturing policy. Congress quoted him saying, “Manufacturing is the backbone of strong economies. Sadly, in India, manufacturing is declining. For us to accelerate growth, we need to produce more - build meaningful manufacturing ecosystems, and create high-quality jobs at scale.”In a video shared by the party, Gandhi said, “India needs to start producing. Production is the key for the success of any country. And our manufacturing is declining which actually should be going up.”Rahul Gandhi is currently in Germany as part of an outreach programme and is scheduled to address the Indian diaspora in Berlin on December 17.","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticised Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi for his remarks on India’s manufacturing sector during his visit to Germany.

From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Wednesday gave its nod to the the nuclear energy bill called the ""Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill (SHANTI), 2025"". The bill was passed as opposition staged a walkout, during the ongoing Winter Session.The amended bill was tabled in the lower house, with introduction by MoS for department of atomic energy Jitendra Singh in the House on Monday, signifying a policy shift in the atomic sector operations. The bill allows entry of private players into the industry, something that was reserved for government enterprises till now. Singh said that it provides for “a pragmatic civil liability regime for nuclear damage and to confer statutory status to Atomic Energy Regulatory Board. ""The proposed legislation further aims to facilitate significant growth in nuclear energy and its applications across multiple sectors. This aligns with country's target to establish 100GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047. The law introduces fresh regulatory provisions encompassing updated safety protocols, a specialised nuclear tribunal for resolving disputes, and modifications to the nuclear liability framework to limit risks and encourage investments.The proposed legislation permits private enterprises and their collaborative ventures to seek authorisation for establishing and running nuclear facilities, as well as transporting nuclear fuel. However, crucial operations including uranium enrichment, spent fuel handling and heavy water manufacturing shall continue to be exclusively managed by the Central government. The Centre will maintain oversight of radioactive materials and radiation-producing apparatus to ensure proper safety standards.","The bill was passed as opposition staged a walkout, during the ongoing Winter Session.

Delhi Pollution: China Shares Playbook On How To Fix Air Quality Amid Politics Over Accountability

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday continued hearing matters related to Delhi’s air pollution crisis, with air quality remaining in the “severe” category in several areas of the national capital region.The court has orally observed that the measures taken by authorities so far have been a “total failure” in effectively curbing the rising levels of air pollution in the Delhi–NCR region. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant remarked that any meaningful reduction in pollution would require broader and long-term planning rather than ad-hoc responses.During the hearing, the court said, “Let us think of pragmatic and practical solution of the menace,” stressing the need for workable measures to address the pollution crisis.During the proceedings, the bench was also informed about another issue related to the MCD toll at Gurgaon, which allegedly causes traffic congestion for hours, leading to long queues of vehicles and adding to air pollution. The court directed the DMC to cooperate on the issue and consider suspension of nine toll plazas for a temporary period. It said a decision should be taken within one week and placed on record.CJI Surya Kant remarked, “we do not want income you generate, but you definately generate a lot of litigation from these tolls ...wewant to come out on a concrete plan for absolute no toll plaza till next year 31st January.""The court further asked the Delhi government to verify construction workers rendered idle by pollution curbs and ensure direct transfer of funds to their bank accounts, cautioning that the money should not “disappear, travel to another account”. It also asked the government to consider providing alternative work to affected workers.Responding to the court, the Delhi government said that around 7,000 construction workers have so far been verified out of nearly 2.5 lakh workers affected, and that money would be transferred into their bank accounts.With respect to various petitions highlighting the inadequacy of recent measures aimed at protecting children, such as the Delhi government’s directives to shut schools or allow them to function in a hybrid mode, the Court noted that these were merely temporary policy decisions taken to mitigate health risks.The bench refused to interfere with the Delhi government’s decision regarding school closures or hybrid operations. “The short-term measures are only to provide temporary protection to children and elderly persons. These are purely interim policy decisions. At best, they can be viewed as an extension of vacations, as schools are anyway scheduled to remain closed for 10 to 15 days during the winter,” the Court observed.The observations came as the top court reviewed the continuing impact of air pollution despite repeated directions issued over the years. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant, along with Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi, has been monitoring the situation as air quality continues to pose serious health risks.The bench has also flagged lifestyle choices of the affluent as a major reason behind poor implementation of pollution-control measures. The Chief Justice observed that the well-off continue to use large diesel vehicles, generators and other polluting equipment in violation of restrictions, even as vehicular emissions choke the region. The court noted that it is the poor and working classes who are the most exposed to hazardous air and suffer the worst health consequences.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) told the court last week that the transport sector contributes about 41 per cent of Delhi-NCR’s ambient air pollution load.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: A Goa court on Wednesday sent Saurav Luthra and Gaurav Luthra to 5-day police custody in connection with the devastating fire at an Arpora club venue. The Luthra brothers are the owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, which was engulfed in fire that claimed 25 lives.The brothers were produced before the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court after being brought back to Goa from Thailand. The court remanded them to police custody to allow investigators to question them about the circumstances leading to the blaze and alleged safety lapses at the club.Before being produced in court, the duo underwent multiple medical examinations. After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, around 10.45 am under police escort, they were first taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and later to the District Hospital in Mapusa for health check-ups.On court directions, they were again sent for a fresh medical examination before being presented before JMFC Puja Sardesai, who ordered five days of police custody.The fire broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling, triggering a massive blaze. 25 people, including tourists and staff, lost their lives, while several others were injured.Advocate Vishnu Joshi, appearing in the Goa nightclub fire case, said the court ordered multiple medical examinations of the Luthra brothers after they complained of back pain before deciding on police custody.“Today, the brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” Joshi said.According to the police, the brothers fled India within hours of the incident. They left for Thailand on December 7, even as rescue operations were under way and a criminal case was registered against them at the Anjuna police station.Goa Police subsequently launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issuing a lookout circular and seeking an Interpol Blue Notice.After their passports were suspended by the ministry of external affairs, Thai authorities detained the brothers in Phuket for illegal stay.They were later deported to India on emergency travel documents issued by the Indian embassy. The duo landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday, where they were arrested by Goa Police and produced before a Delhi court, which granted a 48-hour transit remand.Police have booked them under various provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence.Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","The Luthra brothers are the owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, which was engulfed in fire that claimed 25 lives.

NEW DELHI: As Delhi-NCR continues to grapple with rising air pollution, the Supreme Court orally observed that the measures implemented by authorities so far have been a “total failure” in effectively curbing the escalating levels of air pollution across Delhi and its neighbouring regions.In a separate development, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shared a video from inside the Lok Sabha, alleging that Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Kirti Azad was seen vaping in the Lower House during the ongoing parliamentary session.Meanwhile, India summoned Bangladesh High Commissioner Riaz Hamidullah to convey its “strong concerns” over the deteriorating security situation in Bangladesh, including threats directed at the Indian High Commission in Dhaka.The SC criticized authorities for failing to control Delhi–NCR air pollution, calling ad-hoc measures a “total failure.” It urged the government to implement practical solutions, including compensating construction workers rendered idle by pollution curbs and exploring alternative work.The bench also highlighted the contribution of affluent citizens’ lifestyle choices to poor air quality. Temporary school closures were upheld for child safety and the court directed suspension of nine MCD toll plazas to reduce traffic-induced pollution, emphasising the need for long-term, effective pollution control strategies.The BJP shared a video claiming that Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Kirti Azad was seen vaping inside the Lok Sabha during the ongoing Parliament session, triggering political controversy.BJP leaders, including its IT cell chief Amit Malviya, urged West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to clarify the matter, calling the conduct unacceptable and against parliamentary norms.The issue stems from an earlier complaint by BJP MP Anurag Thakur to the Lok Sabha Speaker about e‑cigarette use in the House.

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: Delhiites woke up to winter's first dense fog on Monday, with visibility dropping to zero in the city. There was havoc at Delhi airport as departures remained suspended for nearly five hours from 4am to 9am when visibility was below 100m.As many as 228 flights - 131 departures, 97 arrivals - were cancelled, over 800 delayed and five diverted to other airports, officials said. The ripple effect of delays continued long after the fog cleared around noon. At least 100 trains were running late.Safdarjung records zero visibility at 12.30am, things look up after 9amThe civil aviation ministry said dense fog conditions impacted flight operations at several airports in north India.According to India Meteorological Department, visibility began to dip sharply from Sunday night. “It dropped to 150 metres at 11.30pm. By 12.30am Monday, there was zero visibility at Safdarjung, the city’s base station. This continued till 2am and improved marginally to 100m by 2.30am. At Palam, the lowest visibility recorded was 50m at 4am,” an official said.Visibility started improving after 9am, touching 300m at Safdarjung by 9.30am and 700m by 10.30am, with the sun making an appearance.At Palam, visibility improved from 100m at 9am to 300m by 10.30am, and to 500m by noon.Flight operations were severely impacted at IGI Airport from 4am, when visibility dropped to 50m and low-visibility procedures were initiated. According to live flight tracking website Flightradar24, 260 arrivals and 400 departures were delayed till Monday evening. “Some flights arrived late at IGI due to weather conditions at the origin airport. Since they came late, these flights departed late,” said an airport official.Airport officials said pilots who are trained in CAT III procedures can make an aircraft land with a minimum visibility of 50m, while an aircraft can take off at a minimum visibility of 125m. “However, pilots who are not trained in CAT-III procedures wait at the taxiway after all formalities such as boarding are completed and take off when they get clearance as they need visibility of around 500m. This causes major flight delays,” an airport official said earlier.Apart from Delhi, flight operations were hit in many parts of north India. The civil aviation ministry posted on X, “In view of the prevailing situation, certain flights may be delayed, diverted or cancelled. Passengers are advised to stay in touch with their airlines for real-time flight updates, regularly check airport and airline websites/apps, and plan for additional travel time.”IndiGo, in a statement, said low visibility (below minima), due to dense fog, severely impacted operations at Delhi and other airports in northern India, “which is unfortunately beyond our control”. “While operations adjust to the prevailing weather, some flights may experience delays while a few others may be proactively cancelled through the day to prioritise safety and help minimise extended waiting at the airport,” said IndiGo.Air India said poor visibility due to dense fog hit operations of all airlines. “In the interest of safety and to avoid prolonged uncertainty, some flights have been cancelled,” it said on X.The civil aviation ministry said, “The Director General Civil Aviation has reviewed preparedness for fog conditions. Officers should monitor passenger inconvenience and ensure that airlines are facilitating operations and discharging responsibilities as per their respective SOPs and any directions issued.”","As many as 228 flights - 131 departures, 97 arrivals - were cancelled, over 800 delayed and five diverted to other airports.

End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

New Delhi: Announcing that protests against the move to end MGNREGA will start this week, civil society groups said Modi govt cannot use mere parliamentary majority to end a rural livelihood programme that resulted from extensive consultations across the board and forging of a national consensus that included BJP.Founding members of MGNREGA, intellectuals and advocacy groups associated with the scheme came together to slam the “VB-G RAM G” bill, arguing that provisions in the proposed legislation will mark the end of job guarantee and hurt the socially vulnerable groups that depend on it for sustenance.NREGA Sangharsh Morcha, comprising economists Jean Dreze, who was part of the Sonia Gandhi-headed NAC that played a key role in drafting the job scheme, Prabhat Patnaik and Jayati Ghosh, Annie Raja, Yogendra Yadav, B Venkat of All India Agricultural Workers Union, Mukesh Nirvasit, several NGOs and activists, addressed a press conference to express their concerns, while warning they will this week start nationwide protests against the abolition of MGNREGA. They said the shifting of financial burden to states has made the new programme uncertain as the states are cash-strapped.Patnaik said mere parliamentary majority cannot undo the national consensus that resulted in the enactment of MGNREGA, and the Modi govt needs to bring an “alternative consensus” to repeal MGNREGA. The new Bill takes away the “right-based approach” and makes the scheme a “gift” from the govt, Ghosh said.“We have seen the pattern ...Right to food is a right, but now we have ration bags coming with the PM's photo on it,” she said.Venkat said govt is trying to create a conflict between farmers and agricultural workers. “This provision to pause the scheme during peak agricultural seasons has been brought in just to please those who control the land.”Dreze said, “The Union govt would now have full power to decide when and where to implement the scheme, while the obligation is on the states. It is like saying I give a work guarantee, but don’t guarantee that the guarantee will be in place.”","Founding members of MGNREGA, intellectuals and advocacy groups associated with the scheme came together to slam the “VB-G RAM G’ bill.

'Paid Campaign': Nitin Gadkari Slams Criticism Of E20 Program; Calls It 'Politically Motivated'

New Delhi: Highway commuters won’t have to stop to pay user fee at national highway toll plazas by 2026-end as the govt rolls out the multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday. He added that the FASTag annual pass launched in Aug, which allows private vehicles to cross 200 plazas, has also come as a big relief for people.Gadkari said over 40 lakh private car owners have subscribed to the FASTag annual pass. “People will be rid of stopping or slowing down at toll plazas as we roll out the MLFF toll system. Cameras above the road will read the number plate and user fee will be automatically debited from the vehicle FASTag account. All this will happen even when someone is driving at a speed of 80 kmph. I made this announcement in Rajya Sabha today,” he said.Earlier in the day, he said in RS that the new system will help save fuel worth Rs 1,500 crore and increase toll revenue by Rs 6,000 crore. The system will make toll collection transparent and corruption-free, he said.Gadkari also said that a system is being put in place where vehicle owners will have to clear all dues, including pending toll fee and e-challans when they sell their vehicles or renew registration.On the next major focus of highway development in the country, Gadkari said that now there is more thrust on building greenfield highways, which is key to reduce logistics cost. “In India, earlier the logistics cost was 16%. But the latest study by IIM-Bangalore, IIT-Kanpur and IIT-Madras indicates that our logistics cost on road has reduced by 6%. The report was out three-four months back. So, I am confident that by now this logistics cost is in single digit at 9%,” he said.He said govt’s focus on infrastructure is driving India’s economic growth. “For the growth of any country, infrastructure is important. Roads, water, power, transport and communication, without developing this infrastructure, we can’t get capital investment in industry and trade & business. And, without investment, we cannot create jobs... Without jobs, we cannot eradicate poverty,” he added.","Gadkari said over 40 lakh private car owners have subscribed to the FASTag annual pass.

New Delhi: IndiGo was quizzed on Wednesday by a parliamentary committee over the misery inflicted on passengers by its mass-cancellation of flights, but it blamed a variety of factors, including system glitch and adverse weather conditions, while DGCA and the aviation ministry parried off criticism of their role in the fiasco.Some committee members termed replies of different stakeholders as ""unconvincing"" and aimed at washing their hands of the crisis, encapsulated by the response of a govt official that he first came to know of the unfolding ordeal through media reports.The panel, headed by JDU's Sanjay Jha, decided to wait for the report of an inquiry ordered by DGCA before coming to a conclusion and make its recommendation. It will hold another meeting and is expected to call these stakeholders again. The DGCA-ordered committee was constituted on Dec 5 and was asked to submit its report in 15 days.Captain Sam Thomas, president of Bengaluru-based Airline Pilots Association of India, created flutter at the meeting by alleging corruption in DGCA and was asked by members to refrain from making sweeping allegations without producing evidence. He alleged that one can commit any wrong, but stay safe if he touched right feet.A committee member said IndiGo, which has offered apology for the ordeal, was far from apologetic in its response before the panel.It told the panel that several factors combined to derail its operation, including a glitch in system, which needed rebooting, and adverse weather that had their pilots stuck in different zones.IndiGo was represented by its COO Isidre Porqueras, while officials of Air India, Akasa Air, Spice Jet and Air India Express appeared before the panel as well. Civil aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha and top functionaries of other stakeholders were part of the deliberations.Replying to a query, IndiGo said all luggage, except 52 which remained unclaimed, have already been delivered.The panel's meeting came against the backdrop of the suspicion, subject of investigation, that IndiGo remained resistant to the implementation of guidelines (Flight Duty Time Limitation) that allowed more rest for pilots in line with global norms aimed at ensuring flyers' safety.It has been accused of engineering the disruption, leveraging its market dominance, to force the ministry to roll back the regulation as implementing it would have required the airline to hire more pilots. Faced with chaos caused triggered by disruption of IndiGo's operations, DGCA had to relax the implementation of the guidelines.IndiGo management is reported to have denied allegation in meetings with ministry.","IndiGo was quizzed on Wednesday by a parliamentary committee over the misery inflicted on passengers by its mass-cancellation of flights.

Mumbai: Supreme Court this week stayed a Bombay high court order that enhanced a Mumbai family court's monthly interim maintenance to a wife by seven times. HC had raised the amount from Rs 50,000 to Rs 3.5 lakh for a woman in Pune and observed the estranged husband approached court with ""unclean hands and lack of credibility"" in a matrimonial dispute, reports Swati Deshpande.A bench of Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Justice K Vinod Chandran Monday directed the husband to pay, in four weeks, up-to-date arrears as per the family court's interim order dated Feb 24, 2023, in a divorce petition filed in 2015.The husband challenged HC's Nov 10 order before apex court, contending the HC erred in enhancing the maintenance.SC heard senior counsel Madhavi Divan for the husband and Kamini Jaiswal for the wife and posted the matter for Jan 20.

Bangladesh Leader’s Seven Sisters Remark Triggers Diplomatic Row, India Summons Envoy Issues Warning

Expect you to ensure safety of our posts, missions, India tells B’desh interim govt

New Delhi/Dhaka: India summoned Bangladesh high commissioner Riaz Hamidullah on Wednesday to express strong concerns at the deteriorating security environment in Bangladesh. In a statement, MEA said its attention was drawn, in particular, to activities of some extremist elements who have announced plans to create a security situation around the Indian mission in Dhaka, report Sachin Parashar & Ahsan Tasnim.In Dhaka, hundreds of protesters, under the banner of ""July Oikya (July Unity)"", began a march towards the Indian High Commission on Wednesday afternoon, raising anti-India slogans and pressing several demands, including prevention of ""anti-Bangladesh conspiracies"" and the return of former PM Sheikh Hasina.Former PM Sheikh Hasina had fled Bangladesh last year following the “July Uprising” against her govt.Hamidullah was also told that India expects the interim govt to ensure the safety of missions and posts in Bangladesh in keeping with its diplomatic obligations.Officials in Dhaka said the protest march was stopped and security around the high commission strengthened.Earlier in the day, the Indian Visa Application Centre in Dhaka suspended its operations from the afternoon due to the prevailing security situation.Indian govt also completely rejected as false the narrative sought to be created by extremist elements regarding certain recent events in Bangladesh. “It is unfortunate that the interim govt has neither conducted a thorough investigation nor shared meaningful evidence with India regarding the incidents,” said the ministry.India reiterated it has close and friendly relations with the people of Bangladesh rooted in the liberation struggle, and strengthened through various developmental and people-to-people initiatives.“We are in favour of peace and stability in Bangladesh and have consistently called for free, fair, inclusive and credible polls, conducted in a peaceful atmosphere,” it said.Bangladesh foreign adviser Touhid Hossain, however, said summoning the high commissioner was a “normal diplomatic practice”. The Indian high commissioner had been summoned a few days earlier, he told reporters. “It is better to accept the reality that from the beginning of the interim govt till today, there has been tension with India”, but the govt is trying to build a good working relationship with India, he said.He also said Bangladesh does not want advice from India on how its elections should be conducted. The govt is committed to holding free and fair election, Hossain said, adding, “We know we will hold a fair election, and we will do so.” Referring to Hasina’s tenure, he said India did not issue similar calls for fair elections over past 15 years.","India summons Bangladesh high commissioner Riaz Hamidullah on Wednesday to express strong concerns at the deteriorating security environment in Bangladesh.

Delhi Pollution: China Shares Playbook On How To Fix Air Quality Amid Politics Over Accountability

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday modified its earlier order restraining Delhi and NCR authorities from taking coercive action against ""end-of-life"" vehicles - 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles - and said the reprieve would apply only to BS 4 or BS 6 emission norm-compliant vehicles.This order will impact over 14.7 lakh BS 1 compliant cars, three-wheelers, two-wheelers, buses and goods carriers; more than 38.7 lakh BS 2 compliant ones; and another 53.7 lakh BS 3 vehicles. A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi passed the order on an application by Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM).Need to restrict plying of vehicles on basis of BS standards: CAQMOn Aug 12, an SC bench led by then CJI B R Gavai had said, “We direct that no coercive steps be taken against owners of vehicles on the ground that these are 10 years old (in case of diesel) and 15 years old (in case of petrol).”Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said BS 1, BS 2 and BS 3 vehicles have completed 24 years, 20 years and 15 years, respectively, and are a major cause of air pollution in Delhi-NCR. The CAQM said a BS 1 diesel vehicle produces 5.4 times more CO (BS-2 two times more and BS-3 1.28 times more), 12.13 times more NOx (BS-2 8.75 times more and BS-3 6.25 times more) and 31.11 times more PM (BS-2 18 times and BS-3 2.3 times more) than a BS 4 compliant diesel vehicle.Agreeing to modify its Aug-12 order that had asked the authorities not to take coercive measures against end-of-life vehicles, the bench said only vehicles which are BS 4 and BS 6 compliant would not be proceeded against if they are older than 15 years.The CAQM, in its affidavit, said, “One of the criteria determining the fitness of a vehicle is its emissions. The emissions of any vehicle are tested against its BS standard category. Thus, an otherwise fit vehicle would still be emitting pollutants as per its BS standard. Since Delhi-NCR faces an extraordinary situation, especially during the winter season due to poor dispersal of pollutants on account of unfavourable meteorological conditions, there is a need to restrict the plying of polluting vehicles based on emission standards in Delhi-NCR. ”In compliance with orders of SC and National Green Tribunal, CAQM had issued a directive on July 8 mandating retail outlets to refuse fuel to all end-of-life vehicles with effect from Nov 1 this year in Delhi and from April 1, 2026, in five high-vehicle-density districts contiguous to Delhi, besides other actions in accordance with law.","The Supreme Court modified its earlier order restraining Delhi and NCR authorities from taking coercive action against ""end-of-life"" vehicles. The reprieve would apply only to BS 4 or BS 6 emission norm-compliant vehicles.

Later in the day, the labour department issued an advisory reiterating the restrictions, adding that ""non-compliance is punishable under sections 15 and 16 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and other applicable laws"".The WFH provisions will not apply to essential services, including hospitals and health services, fire services, prison administration, public transport, electricity services, pollution control departments, forest department and Delhi Jal Board.The govt also announced that it will pay 10,000 to each of the registered construction workers in Delhi because of the 16-day halt in construction work due to Grap provisions aimed at curbing air pollution.In response to worsening air quality, Delhi govt has imposed Grap 4, the highest and strictest stage of Delhi-NCR's pollution control plan. Under Grap 4, construction and demolition activities have been banned, diesel trucks not carrying essential goods have been barred from entering Delhi and govt has announced it will not give fuel to non-PUC compliant vehicles.Mishra said in addition to making 50% WFH mandatory, offices are also being encouraged to adopt flexible working hours.During the period of Grap restrictions last month, construction activities in Delhi were suspended, which adversely affected the livelihoods of daily-wage construction workers. ""Taking this concern into account, Delhi govt has decided to compensate workers for the loss of income caused by the suspension of construction work. Accordingly, financial assistance of 10,000 will be provided to registered and verified construction workers,"" Kapil Mishra said. As of Dec 17, Delhi has 2,57,244 workers are registered with Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare. The registrations are a continuous process.","Delhi govt has mandated offices in the capital to function with a maximum of 50% of their employees in the workplace and the rest working from home starting Thursday.

Yogi Adityanath Targets Nehru Over Kashmir, Links Historic Blunder To India’s Long Terror Crisis

New Delhi: Asserting that “51 cartons of Jawaharlal Nehru papers” were formally taken back by the “family” in 2008 from Prime Ministers’ Museum and Library (then Nehru Memorial Museum and Library), culture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat lashed out at Congress asking its senior leader Sonia Gandhi “why have these papers not been returned despite multiple reminders from PMML including the recent reminders in January and July this year”.Pointing out that Gandhi herself has acknowledged in writing that these papers are with her and promised to ""cooperate"" on the matter, Shekhawat sought that Gandhi honour her commitment and return these papers to PMML.Shekhawat’s sharp rebuke came a day after Congress spokesman and senior leader Jairam Ramesh asked “will there be an apology forthcoming” citing the govt’s reply to a question in Lok Sabha that no papers relating to Jawaharlal Nehru were found missing in the annual inspection of PMML.“In reality, 51 cartons of Jawaharlal Nehru papers were formally taken back by the family in 2008 from PMML (then Nehru Memorial Museum and Library). Their location is known. Hence, they are “not missing”,” Shekhawat said in a post on X.“These are not private family papers. They relate to the first Prime Minister of India and form part of our national historical record. Such papers belong in public archives, not behind closed doors,” Shekhawat said in a post on X.The ministry of culture cited a April 29, 2008 letter wherein it was requested that Gandhi wished to take back all of the private family letters and notes of former PM Jawahar Lal Nehru. Accordingly, the papers were sent to Gandhi.“I respectfully ask Sonia Gandhi ji to explain to the country: What is being withheld? What is being hidden?,” Shekhawat asked and said that the “excuses” being given by Sonia for not returning these papers are “not tenable”.“History cannot be curated selectively,” Shekhawat said and added that “transparency is the foundation of democracy and archival openness is its moral obligation which Mrs Gandhi and the “family” need to uphold”.Shekhawat in his reply to Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh’s post said, “The truth placed before the Lok Sabha is clear and on record"". ”The Nehru Papers were taken out in 2008, during the UPA period, when public institutions were often treated as family preserves,"" he said.“In fact it would be more appropriate for you to urge Sonia Gandhi to honour her commitment and return these papers to PMML so that scholars, citizens, and the Parliament can access these crucial historical records and the truth of ""Nehruvian"" times can be examined objectively,” Shekhawat said to Ramesh.","Culture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat lashed out at Congress.

Coal’s share in India’s electricity mix likely to fall from over 70% in 2025 to about 60% by 2030: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coals-share-in-indias-electricity-mix-likely-to-fall-from-over-70-in-2025-to-about-60-by-2030-report/articleshow/126043648.cms,".

New Delhi: Coal’s share in India’s electricity mix is projected to fall from over 70% in 2025 to about 60% by 2030, even as the country’s overall coal demand is expected to rise 17% over the next five years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).IEA said India’s total coal consumption in 2025 is likely to record a marginal year-on-year decline of 1.2%, driven mainly by a 3% drop in coal-fired power generation. Higher hydropower output following an early and strong monsoon, lower electricity demand for cooling and the continued expansion of renewable energy capacity have contributed to the decline.In 2024, India’s coal production rose 7% to an all-time high of 1,082 million tonnes (MT). While most of the output was thermal coal, India also produced lignite and metallurgical coal. IEA said production growth outpaced demand growth by two percentage points, supporting India’s strategy of cutting coal imports, strengthening energy security, and avoiding supply shortages and price spikes.The report — Coal 2025: Analysis and Forecast to 2030 — said coal remains central to India’s electricity system, with coal use for power generation in 2025 estimated at around 940 MT, accounting for nearly 72% of total coal consumption of 1,297 MT.India’s total installed power generation capacity stood at 495 GW in Aug 2025, comprising 253 GW of coal-fired capacity, including 30 GW of captive plants, 123 GW of solar, 52 GW of wind, and 42 GW of hydropower, along with smaller contributions from gas, nuclear, and other sources.While the govt continues to expand non-fossil generation capacity in line with its 500 GW target for 2030, India commissioned or began trial operations at 20 new coal-fired power plants totalling 14 GW in 2025, with additional capacity under construction, the report said.Madhura Joshi, programme lead for global clean power diplomacy at E3G, said India has made remarkable progress on renewables, with 2025 expected to be a record-breaking year. She said the decline in coal demand alongside rapid renewable growth signals positive momentum for India’s energy transition. Sustaining this pace of renewable and storage expansion, she said, would help India meet its development, growth, energy security and climate goals.IEA noted that non-power coal demand has emerged as the main source of growth in 2025. Industrial coal use is being driven by strong infrastructure activity and steady expansion in the cement and steel sectors. India, the world’s second-largest cement market, is expected to see cement demand grow 5%–6% in 2025 and remain elevated over the medium term.Capacity expansion by major cement producers, rising steel output — particularly through coal-based direct reduced iron — and coal gasification projects are reinforcing coal’s role in India’s industrial growth, underscoring the continued importance of both thermal and metallurgical coal.India’s non-power coal consumption is projected to reach 356 MT in 2025 and rise further to 470 MT by 2030. Overall coal demand is expected to increase 17% by the end of the decade, reaching 1,522 MT, the report said.China, however, remains the dominant force in global coal markets, consuming about 30% more coal than the rest of the world combined.","India’s total coal consumption in 2025 is likely to record a marginal year-on- year decline of 1.2%, driven mainly by a 3% drop in coal-fired power generation.

"India to have at least 5 indigenously designed, developed small modular nuclear reactors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-have-at-least-5-indigenously-designed-developed-small-modular-nuclear-reactors/articleshow/126042827.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is expected to have at least five indigenously designed and developed small modular reactors (SMRs) under the Nuclear Energy Mission by 2033.In a written reply in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, Union minister Jitendra Singh said the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre has already initiated design and development work on the 200 megawatt electrical (MWe) Bharat Small Modular Reactor (BSMR-200), the 55 MWe Small Modular Reactor (SMR-55), and a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor of up to 5 MW meant for hydrogen generation.The minister said Rs 20,000 crore has been allocated in the 2025-26 budget for research, design, development and deployment of SMRs, which is aimed at supporting India’s objective of developing and operationalising at least five indigenously designed SMRs by 2033.He said from the current installed nuclear energy capacity of 8.78 GW, India aims at reaching 100 GW by 2047, of which public sector undertakings of the department of atomic energy (DAE) are expected to contribute about 58-60 GW. The rest is likely to be set up by public and private sector companies.While the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) is setting up four reactors with a capacity of 4 GW in cooperation with the Russia, he said NPCIL plans to set up another 17.6 GW of capacity with foreign cooperation as part of its roadmap to reach about 54 GW by 2047. The National Thermal Power Corporation has also entered into a joint venture with NPCIL named Anushakti Vidhyut Nigam Limited to take up nuclear power generation and associated activities, and has approved the Mahi Banswara project (four units of 700 MW).At present, there are 24 nuclear power plants in commercial operation with a total capacity of 8,780 MW, while eight nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 6,600 MW are at various stages of construction and commissioning, and 10 reactors (7,000 MW) are under pre-project activities, Singh said.","India is expected to have at least five indigenously designed and developed small modular reactors (SMRs) under the Nuclear Energy Mission by 2033.

Amid Flight Meltdown, IndiGo Chairman Denies Claims of Rule Manipulation and Crisis Engineering

NEW DELHI: JDU MP and Parliamentary Standing Committee Chair Sanjay Jha on Wednesday said the panel has heard IndiGo’s side on last week’s flight disruptions, but the inquiry is still ongoing.“There was a disruption at the airport involving air traffic control, and a detailed presentation on it was given today… The pilots' association, airline operators, and the Ministry also gave detailed presentations… We have heard their side of the story. However, the inquiry is still ongoing. After that, maybe we will sit again,” Jha said.It comes after IndiGo’s Chief Operating Officer (COO) Isidro Porqueras appeared before the committee, along with officials from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Federation of Pilot Associations.When asked by reporters about the recent nationwide IndiGo flight cancellations, Porqueras declined to comment publicly.""Sorry, no comments today,"" the IndiGo COO said.IndiGo, India’s largest airline, faced disruptions since last week following the second phase of revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms, which reduced the number of night landings allowed for pilots.While all airlines adjusted to the new norms, IndiGo was the worst affected due to a smaller pilot buffer.The airline cancelled hundreds of flights, affecting thousands of passengers and triggering panic at major airports.A senior airline official said the disruptions arose from multiple simultaneous issues. “We will need a root cause analysis, which will obviously take time... the disruptions happened due to a combination of factors and which factor played how much role will be known after the root cause analysis.” He insisted that there was no question of inadequacy, describing the episode as a “learning experience.”The DGCA has earlier issued show-cause notices to IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and COO Isidro Porqueras seeking explanations for the operational failures.The ministry of civil aviation also directed senior officials to conduct on-ground inspections at airports including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune, Guwahati, Goa and Thiruvananthapuram to assess passenger hardships and airline functioning.Union civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu told the Rajya Sabha that the disruptions were not linked to the Aircraft Maintenance and Scheduling System (AMSS) but resulted from the airline’s internal crew rostering and operational planning. He emphasized that consultations on FDTL were held with all stakeholders and that passenger safety remains non-negotiable.To stabilise operations, the DGCA has directed IndiGo to cut 5% of its daily schedule, equivalent to around 110 flights. The airline, which normally operates about 2,300 flights daily, gradually resumed services and expects full operational stability by December 10.","JDU MP and Parliamentary Standing Committee Chair Sanjay Jha says panel has heard IndiGo's side on last week's flight disruptions.

Lok Sabha passes bill to open civil nuclear-sector to private players amid opposition walkout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ls-passes-bill-to-open-civil-n-sector-to-private-players-amid-opposition-walkout-govt-says-the-bill-retains-strong-safety-and-liability-safeguards/articleshow/126042604.cms,"From Vande Mataram To Shared Roots: Highlights Of PM Modi's Historic Speech In Ethiopian Parliament

NEW DELHI: : Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the nuclear energy bill that seeks to open the civil nuclear sector to private players, even as opposition members strongly opposed it in its present form over safety and liability concerns while seeking its further scrutiny. The govt, however, defended the proposed legislation, saying it retains ""strong safety and liability safeguards"".The bill was passed by voice vote amid a walkout by most of the opposition members with Union minister Jitendra Singh during his reply assuring the House that the proposed legislation seeks to ""modernise India’s nuclear framework in line with contemporary technological, economic and energy realities, while retaining and strengthening core safety, security and regulatory safeguards that have been in place since the Atomic Energy Act of 1962"". He emphasised that private participation is needed to meet India's 2047 clean energy goals.Removal of the clause related to liability of suppliers of nuclear equipment was the main concern of most of the opposition members as they argued that the omission of such liability would prove to be harmful for India in case of a nuclear disaster.Singh, however, said the bill - Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill - does not dilute compensation to victims and the operator liability has been rationalised through graded caps linked to reactor size to encourage newer technologies such as small modular reactors, while ensuring that full compensation is available to affected persons through a multi-layered mechanism.He maintained that supplier liability was removed after detailed consideration of global practices and advances in reactor safety, while negligence and penal provisions remain enforceable under the law.Referring to the opposition members' concerns, the minister clarified that private entities will not have control over sensitive materials, and that spent fuel management will continue to be handled by the govt, as has been the practice for decades.Noting India's efforts to move towards non-fossil fuel energy sources, Singh said the scaling up of nuclear energy is essential to meet rising demand from sectors such as data processing, healthcare and industry, alongside renewables. The bill, he said, enables responsible private and joint venture participation to bridge resource constraints, shorten gestation periods and support the national goal of 100 GW nuclear capacity by 2047, without compromising national security or public interest.Though most of the opposition members from the Congress and other parties walked out of the House when the minister moved the bill for passing, TMC MPs remained inside with party veteran Saugata Roy moving certain amendments, which were eventually negated by voice vote.During the discussion, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor described the bill as a “dangerous leap into privatised nuclear expansion” with inadequate safeguards. “We cannot allow the pursuit of capital to override the non-negotiable requirements of public safety, environmental protection and victim justice,” the MP from Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram said.Another Congress MP Gaddam Vamsi Krishna accused the Centre of shirking accountability and endangering national security by handing over critical responsibilities to private players. He termed as ironic the name “SHANTI” for a bill that he said has “very dangerous” implications for national safety.“Who will be liable when an accident or incident happens in the nuclear space,” he asked, even as he questioned privatisation of the nuclear sector by underlining that countries like France, Russia, China and South Korea maintain state-owned nuclear sectors.","Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the nuclear energy bill that seeks to open the civil nuclear sector to private players.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday arrived in Muscat, Oman for a two-day visit, kickstarting his third and final leg of his three-nation tour to the Middle East and Africa.He was received at the airport by Oman’s deputy PM for defence affairs Sayyid Shihab bin Tariq Al Said, and was accorded a guard of honour. The visit is at the invitation of Sultan Haitham bin Tarik of Oman and marks PM’s second trip to the Gulf nation as well as 70 years of diplomatic relations between both countries.Upon landing in Oman, the PM said in a post on X, “Landed in Muscat, Oman. This is a land of enduring friendship and deep historical connections with India. This visit offers an opportunity to explore new avenues of collaboration and add fresh momentum to our partnership.”PM was welcomed by the members of Indian diaspora as he arrived at the hotel of his stay.During the visit PM Modi will hold talks with the country's top leadership and is expected to sign a comprehensive trade agreement aimed at deepening bilateral ties.New Delhi has indicated that it is “very optimistic” about finalising the comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) during the visit. The proposed free trade agreement was approved by the Union cabinet last Friday.Negotiations for the CEPA formally began in November 2023 and were concluded this year. “We are all very optimistic about it.

From Vande Mataram To Shared Roots: Highlights Of PM Modi's Historic Speech In Ethiopian Parliament

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said portraits of soldiers from the British era at Rashtrapati Bhavan have been replaced with those of India’s own heroes. The change comes with the inauguration of the Param Vir Gallery, which honours Param Vir Chakra awardees and marks a move away from colonial-era symbols.In a post on X, the Prime Minister shared photographs from the gallery and highlighted the tribute to the nation’s defenders.“O Supreme Warriors of India. Salutations to you, O Radiant Heroes! This nation is grateful for the sacrifices. For the honors of Mother India!,” his post read.Explaining the significance of the gallery, he said: “In the Param Vir Gallery of Rashtrapati Bhavan, these portraits of the country's indomitable heroes are a heartfelt tribute to our nation’s defenders. Those heroes who protected the motherland with their supreme sacrifices, who gave their lives for the unity and integrity of India... the nation has expressed its gratitude to them in yet another form.”PM Modi highlighted that the dedication of the gallery was made in the presence of the families of two Param Vir Chakra awardees and other gallantry award recipients, which, he said, made the occasion “even more special”.In another post, the Prime Minister said the change reflects India’s effort to move away from a colonial mindset.“For a long period, portraits of soldiers from the British era were displayed in the gallery of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Now, in their place, portraits of the country's Param Vir Chakra awardees have been installed,” he said, adding that the Param Vir Gallery is “an excellent example of the campaign to move away from the mentality of slavery and connect India with a new consciousness”.He also recalled that the government had earlier named several islands in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands after Param Vir Chakra winners as part of the same initiative.Highlighting the gallery’s message for future generations, PM Modi said it would serve as a source of inspiration for the youth.“These images and this gallery serve as a vibrant site for our young generation to connect with India's tradition of valor. This gallery will inspire the youth that self-confidence and determination are essential for the nation's purpose,” he wrote.Expressing hope for its long-term impact, the Prime Minister added that he hoped the Param Vir Gallery would become “a vibrant pilgrimage site for the spirit of developed India.”","Portraits of soldiers from the British era at Rashtrapati Bhavan have been replaced with those of India’s own heroes.

Mamiko Tanaka's net worth in 2025 and what is known about her career earnings

Shohei Ohtani and Mamiko Tanaka's combined net worth in 2025

Shohei Ohtani remains one of the most discussed athletes in world sport, and in 2025, attention around him is not limited to baseball alone. His record contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, combined with his global endorsement presence, has kept his finances in focus. Alongside him, Mamiko Tanaka has also drawn interest, particularly around how their individual careers translate into shared wealth.The couple has kept their personal life private since their marriage. There have been no public financial disclosures or interviews addressing money. Still, estimates based on career earnings provide a broad picture of where they stand in 2025.Shohei Ohtani’s net worth in 2025 is estimated at around $150 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. The figure is based on his baseball income and endorsement earnings rather than the full value of his Dodgers contract. In December 2023, Ohtani signed a 10-year, $700 million deal with the Dodgers, the largest contract in professional sports history.The contract is heavily deferred. Ohtani earns only $2 million in total salary over the 10 years, with the remaining amount scheduled to be paid out in annual installments from 2034 to 2043.Because of this structure, the contract does not immediately inflate his net worth.Ohtani’s primary income during this period comes from endorsements. He earns an estimated $40 to $50 million per year through sponsorships and brand deals, particularly in Japan and the United States. These deals make him one of the highest-earning athletes globally outside of salary.Mamiko Tanaka’s net worth is less clearly defined. In 2024, several estimates placed her net worth at around $70 million, based on her professional basketball career in Japan.

Endorsements, branding and lifestyle choices

Rhea Ripley quietly forms one of pro wrestling's most lucrative pairings with Buddy Matthews. They are seasoned mainstay in-ring performers at the pinnacle of the industry, Matthews being a focal performer in AEW, and Ripley establishing herself as a lynchpin of WWE programming.Neither promotion releases contract details, but industry estimates and reported earnings paint a clear picture of their place in 2025. Together, Ripley and Matthews are estimated to be worth somewhere in the $6 million to $8 million range combined, making them one of the richest couples on the AEW roster (or WWE roster) when it comes to salary, with earnings supplemented by bonuses, endorsements, and security offered by longer-term contracts.Rhea Ripley’s rise in WWE has paralleled her financial success. Since moving to the main roster from NXT, she has been one of the most recognizable women in the company, often in title programs and in premium live events. Her base salary is said to be mid-six figures, but the number is greatly inflated by performance bonuses, merchandise royalties, and major-show appearances.A long-term contract extension that WWE signed Ripley to in order to keep her with the company for several more years highlighted her value to the promotion.The deal demonstrates her in-ring reliability as well as her crossover appeal, and is another example of WWE's need for the kind of stars who can act as brand ambassadors on various platforms. This means Ripley herself is personally worth between $1 million and $3 million, with room for upside as her role grows.Buddy Matthews came to AEW as one of the smartest in-ring wrestlers of his generation. His AEW deal is described in wrestling circles as hitting the sweet spot financially, where he is being compensated based on both his extensive experience and his status as a regular TV-featured talent. And while his exact salary is not publicly known, Matthews has spent a lot more time in major promotions compared to most of his contemporaries, and that adds up to a considerably higher overall net worth.Mathews has a wrestling contract but also has income incentives in merchandise sales, independent appearances, and digital side-hustles like gaming and streaming. These additional revenue streams go a long way to explain his estimated net worth of $5 million in 2025.Ripley is marketable, well beyond the ring. Her image has become a commercial asset as she has partnered with fitness, gaming, and collectible brands. While he has thrust his profile higher than it ever has been, Matthews has stayed a little more grounded and continues to monetize his platform through brand work and community-driven platforms.Also Read: WWE Hall of Famer Kevin Nash calls Rhea Ripley ‘bigger than life’, compares her to Hulk Hogan","Rhea Ripley and Buddy Matthews are estimated to be worth somewhere in the $6 million to $8 million range combined.

Delhi Pollution: China Shares Playbook On How To Fix Air Quality Amid Politics Over Accountability

NEW DELHI: How did Beijing go from being the ‘smog capital of the world' to footnotes in research papers on tackling air pollution? China has lessons for India.In a series of posts on X, spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in India, Yu Jing laid out the path that Beijing followed to drastically improve air quality.""Both China and India know the struggle with air pollution amid rapid urbanization. While the challenge remains complex, China's sustained efforts over the past decade have delivered noticeable improvements..."" Jing posted.Beijing's annual PM 2.5 average in 2013 was 101.7 ug/m3. In 2024, it stood at 30.9 ug/m3.In her posts that followed, Jing spoke about the steps taken in transport and industry sectors that led to better air.""How did Beijing tackle air pollution? Step 1: Vehicle emissions control. Adopt ultra-strict regulations like China 6NI (on par with Euro 6). Phase-out retired old, high-emission vehicles. Curb car growth via license-plate lotteries and odd-even / weekday driving rules. Build one of the world's largest metro and bus networks. Accelerate the shift to electric mobility. Work with the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region on coordinated emissions cuts.Cleaner air doesn't happen overnight—but it is achievable,"" she said.Addressing air pollution from industry, Jing said, ""Step 2: Industrial Restructuring. Shut down or remove 3000+ heavy industries. Relocating Shougang, one of China's largest steelmakers, alone cut inhalable particles by 20%. Transform vacated factories into parks, commercial zones, cultural and tech hubs. Example, the former Shougang site became the 2022 Winter Olympics venue. Relieve non-capital functions by relocating wholesale markets, logistics hubs and some educational and medical institutions. Coordinate regional integration by shifting general manufacturing to Hebei, while retaining high-value R&D and services in Beijing.""These interventions are not unheard of in India. Cleaner fuel for vehicles as well as industry, a curb on growth of private vehicles and robust public transport have been part of discussions for at least a decade.According to experts, the difference is in the scale and seriousness of the action.""In China, action was not taken just in Beijing but in 26 cities and towns to tackle the problem, which is regional. The first lesson is that the actions they took were urgent, stringent, and at a large scale. They took deep to enable massive energy transition, like getting rid of coal not only in industry but also in household use. Beijing also capped the number of cars that can be sold in a year even as it created infrastructure for public transport. We will find similarities in our plans for Delhi-NCR but the scale is missing,"" said Anumita Roy Chaudhuri, Executive Director, Research and Advocacy, Centre For Science and Environment.She also said action in Delhi is taken only during air emergencies.""We can't have just emergency measures. The implementation of these actions has to be round-the clock,"" she said.Sunil Dahiya, Founder and Lead Analyst at the think tank EnviroCatalyst, said, ""We already have BS6, which is equivalent to Euro 6, and the latest decision on not allowing BS VI or below vehicles in Delhi seems to be in the right direction. All the steps suggested for vehicular pollution were tried in India, but they didn't work only because there wasn't a political will.""On industrial pollution, Dahiya said shifting or removing all industries to a different region might be difficult as we are dealing with the livelihood of people residing in several states. ""We can instead come up with better facilities. For instance, small and medium enterprises or manufacturing units mostly use undesignated fuel and lack air pollution control devices. We can introduce better mechanisms with common pollution control devices, emission control devices, and restructuring industrial clusters,"" he said, adding that since 2019, no strict measures have been taken against power plants.","Beijing's annual PM 2.5 average in 2013 was 101.7 ug/m3.

(AI image)

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana: Eligibility, Minimum Balance

The Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana account holder must be a resident Indian citizen. The account can be opened by a parent or legal guardian in the name of a girl child who is below 10 years of age at the time of opening.

A family can open accounts for a maximum of two girl children. More than two accounts are allowed if twins or triplets are born in the first or second birth order, supported by an affidavit and birth certificates. This exception does not apply if the first birth itself results in two or more surviving girl children. Each girl child can have only one account under the scheme.

The account is operated by the guardian until the girl turns 18 years old. After attaining 18 years, the account is operated by the girl child herself after submitting the required documents.

The account can be opened with a minimum deposit of Rs 250. Every financial year, the account holder must deposit at least Rs 250. The maximum deposit limit is Rs 1.5 lakh. Deposits must be made in multiples of Rs 50 and can be paid as a lump sum or in multiple installments.

An SSY account holder can make deposits for 15 years from the date the account is opened.

holder can make deposits for 15 years from the date the account is opened. If the account holder fails to deposit the minimum Rs 250 in any financial year, the account becomes defaulted. A defaulted account can be regularised within the 15-year deposit period by paying a Rs 50 penalty per default year, along with the minimum deposit for those years.

Deposits made in the account are eligible for tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act under the old income tax regime. Deposits can be made in cash or by cheque at a post office, or online via NEFT/RTGS or the India Post Payment Bank app.

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana: Account Maturity, Withdrawal Rules, Premature Closure

The SSY account normally matures 21 years from the date of opening.

It can be closed earlier for the account holder’s marriage, provided that a written declaration is submitted on non-judicial stamp paper and the proof of age confirms the girl will be at least 18 years old at marriage. Early closure for marriage is allowed only between one month before and three months after the marriage date.

Up to 50% of the account balance (as of the end of the previous financial year) can be withdrawn for education purposes. Withdrawal is allowed after the girl turns 18 years old or passes Class 10, whichever happens earlier.

The amount can be taken as a lump sum or in installments, with only one withdrawal per year, for a maximum of five years. The withdrawal amount must match the actual education expenses, supported by admission letters or fee receipts from the institution.

If the account holder passes away, the account is closed immediately after submitting Form-2 and the death certificate. The full balance, along with interest up to the date of death, is paid to the guardian. Interest from the date of death till closure is paid at the Post Office Savings Account rate.

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana: Top Points

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana Calculator : Interest Earnings & Final Corpus

The account earns interest at a rate notified by the Ministry of Finance every quarter. At present this rate is 8.2%.

The interest is calculated monthly on the lowest balance between the 5th day and the last day of the month. Interest is credited once every financial year.

The interest earned is completely tax-free under the Income Tax Act.

Assuming you contribute the maximum amount of Rs 1.5 lakh per annum, over a period of 15 years your total invested amount would be Rs 22.5 lakh. On maturity at 21 years, the final corpus would be Rs 71,82,119/- which is over Rs 71 lakh.

Is Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana the best investment option for your girl child?



Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana vs Other Investments

What works in favour of

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana?

It’s a government‑backed scheme, hence a risk‑free instrument; the interest rate is closely linked to G‑sec yields.

It ensures investment discipline via lock‑in and girl child-specific purpose, which protects funds from any premature withdrawals.

What doesn’t work for it?

From an asset class risk perspective, it’s a purely fixed‑income instrument; for a 15–20 year goal. The expected returns factoring in inflation could be very less than a well‑constructed equity portfolio, Mohit Gang tells TOI.

The rates are reviewed by the government quarterly, which means that they can decrease, impacting the maturity value.

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana vs Mutual Funds

What are the alternatives to Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana?

Equity Mutual funds: A portfolio combining SSY with equity mutual funds could generate much better returns as compared to SSY, considering long term horizon, Mohit Gang says.

PPF: PPF comes with a lower return of 7.1% but comes with the same tax treatment as that of SSY and the lock-in is of 15 years thereby making it comparatively flexible, he notes.

Balanced/ Aggressive Hybrid Funds: For investors who want to go with a safety cushion instead of pure equity, hybrid equity funds would be a good option, he advises.

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana Compared To Other Options

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana or SSY is a popular post-office savings scheme for the girl child, first introduced over ten years ago as part of the government’s Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign. The Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is a fixed income investment avenue for the future of your girl child - aimed at providing a corpus for higher education or marriage.SSY accounts currently offer an 8.2% annual rate of interest.The interest earned annually on the account balance and the final amount received upon maturity - 21 years from account opening - or premature closure for the girl's marriage/higher education is completely exempt from income tax.Given the lucrative interest rate and the tax benefits, is Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana an obvious savings choice for your girl child or are better options available? We take a look at the key features of the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana scheme and how it compares to other investment options such as Public Provident Fund and mutual funds:Experts say that while SSY offers government-backed returns which are also tax exempt, returns from other investment options may outweigh the benefits of Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.Experts are of the view that tax-saving equity mutual funds and NPS are likely to earn better returns than on SSY for such a long duration.Prableen Bajpai, Founder of FinFix believes that Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is a “wonderful product” in the fixed income space. In fact, given the interest differential with the Public Provident Fund, Prableen is of the view that it is a preferred option for investment for the future of the girl child. However, she notes that starting early is key and the maturity at 21 years can restrict the available liquidity for education purposes. Also, other investment avenues offer better returns so one should not solely depend on it, she tells TOI.Mohit Gang - Co-Founder & CEO Moneyfront says, “Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is a very good fixed‑income, tax‑efficient product for a girl child, but cannot necessarily be a “no-brainer” because long‑term goals like education/marriage usually need an equity component to beat inflation meaningfully.”According to Gang, combining the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana along with an equity component in the portfolio would prove to be beneficial in the long term.Rohit Shah, a Certified Financial Planner and Founder of Getting You Rich points out that while Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana offers safe, tax-free returns, the lock-in period is high and the returns are lower compared to other investment avenues.“Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana offers a safe, guaranteed 8.2% return—completely tax-free. You also get a tax benefit of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh annually. The government backs it 100%, so your money is completely secure. It's perfect for parents of a girl child who want guaranteed safety,” Rohit Shah tells TOI.However, he notes that the investment gets locked for 18-21 years. You cannot access it for emergencies during this period, he says.“More importantly, 8.2% is much lower than alternate options like equity mutual funds for those who have suitable risk appetite - it may generate upwards of 11-12%. Over 21 years, this gap may be huge.”“With education costs rising 8-10% yearly, SSY alone may not be enough. Today's college fees (Rs 12-20 lakh) will become Rs 60-100 lakh in 2043. Also, you can only open SSY for girls under 10 years old. With the new income tax regime gaining traction, Section 80C savings like SSY are also losing ground,” he concludes.",Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana offers a lucrative interest rate and tax benefits. The account can be opened by a parent or legal guardian in the name of a girl child who is below 10 years of age at the time of opening. A family can open accounts for a maximum of two girl children.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126040653,imgsize-56796,width-400,resizemode-4/sukanya-samriddhi-yojana.jpg"

Paul Heyman’s estimated net worth in 2025 and income sources

Marla Heyman’s financial profile and the combined net worth question

Paul Heyman has been one of wrestling's most influential people, shaping eras in ECW and WWE. With his consistent presence both on-screen and behind the scenes on WWE programming, interest in his finances has been rekindled in 2025, raising questions regarding his own wealth and whether or not he even has a combined net worth with his previous wife, Marla Heyman.While entertainment finance outlets regularly estimate Paul Heyman’s earnings, his wife, Marla Heyman, has been able to keep her life quite private, and there are no financial records available to review. Therefore, any conversation about a joint net worth is based on confirmed reporting for Paul Heyman, and the lack of available information is not representative of Marla.According to entertainment finance trackers like Celebrity Net Worth, Paul Heyman's net worth is around $10 million. While not officially verified by WWE or Heyman himself, these numbers are frequently referenced in wrestling media circles.That fortune he has accumulated is largely down to his deep ties to WWE. Wrestling observers associated outlets have covered the subject of Heyman's WWE salary, which was recently reported to be as high as about $2 million per year based on both his onscreen character as well as his offscreen creative prowess.His association with The Bloodline storyline over the past few years has increased this company's cash cow status.Part of Heyman's legacy includes his earlier years with Extreme Championship Wrestling, but not in a good way. Quotes about ECW from court records and wrestling business historians have reported that ECW had declared bankruptcy in the early 00s while also holding a large sum of debt. Though WWE would subsequently purchase ECW's video library and intellectual property and later reinstate the brand's historical significance, this did not equate to a massive paycheck for Heyman personally at the time.Marla Heyman is still not prominent in public financial disclosures. Biographical databases and celebrity background websites have never made clear what her career entailed and what her sources of income were, so assigning an accurate net worth is not possible.Therefore, any assertions of Paul and Marla Heyman's net worth in 2025 should be taken with a grain of salt. Given the reporting available, the only reasonable conclusion is that Paul Heyman has an independently estimated net worth of around $10 million in addition to whatever Marla Heyman has.Also Read: Paul Heyman reveals his new WWE nickname","According to entertainment finance trackers like Celebrity Net Worth, Paul Heyman's net worth is around $10 million.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

How Leon Draisaitl built his wealth and invested in luxury real estate



Revealed! Leon Draisaitl, Wife, Lavish Lifestyle & Net Worth 2025

Leon Draisaitl, the German NHL star and one of the league’s highest-paid players, has silently created a lifestyle that depicts both financial might and personal seclusion. Draisaitl is known for keeping his life outside the rink very much in the background; therefore, he has also invested his winnings into luxury living, high-end real estate, and a carefully managed public image. From Europe to North America, the selection of his residences and lifestyle is are core sign that top sportsmen are able to have the best of both worlds—their fame, and the softness and safety of life that come with it.Draisaitl's net worth was steadily growing, albeit slowly, due to his NHL contract for many years and guaranteed income, while salary, signing bonuses, and endorsements were the main sources of his income. However, like other prominent athletes, Draisaitl does not want to impress the world through his living standard that is different from the rest of the public. He is more interested in quality, privacy, and long-term value. The player has invested in real estate, and his lifestyle choices are such that they lead one to think of a player looking for a stable, long-term investment and financial planning rather than just enjoying luxury.As of 2025, the estimated net worth of Leon Draisaitl is between $50 million and $68 million. His eight-year, $112 million NHL contract, which includes a hefty signing bonus, is the main contributor to this amount. Draisaitl's annual salary is approximately $14 million, which makes him one of the highest-paid players in the NHL.Draisaitl regularly moves back and forth between Edmonton, Canada, and Cologne, Germany.

NEW DELHI: The air quality remained very poor for the second straight day on Wednesday, though the air quality index (AQI) marginally improved from 354 a day earlier to 334, helped by strong winds flowing into the city.No respite is likely with the air predicted to hover within the same category until Dec 20. It may deteriorate to severe in the last week of this month, the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said.According to Decision Support System, which estimates local and regional sources of pollution in Delhi's air, emissions from Haryana's Jhajjar were recorded at 16.53%, followed by the city's own vehicular emissions at 16.32%. Industries in the city and its periphery accounted for just over 8% of pollutants. ""Though westerly winds briefly blew at 8-10kmph during the day, a layer of shallow fog trapped the pollutants,"" said an official.Owing to the fog, a visibility of 800 metres was recorded at Palam at 8 am and 700m at Safdarjung, the city's base station, at 8.30 am, said an official of India Meteorological Department (IMD).Though visibility was relatively better than the previous days, 24 flights were cancelled and over 200 delayed.""Some flights were cancelled in advance. Others were impacted due to low visibility at other airports,"" an official said.On Tuesday, more than 500 flights were delayed and over 100 cancelled at IGI Airport. On Monday, over 800 flights faced delays, more than 200 were cancelled and five diverted.The Met department forecast shallow fog will continue in the region until Dec 20. Moderate fog will envelop isolated pockets. A yellow alert was issued for moderate to dense fog on Dec 21 and 22.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 24.7 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal.

Flight operations under low visibility procedures

CAQM flags road dust, waste

NEW DELHI: Large parts of Delhi were engulfed in a dense layer of toxic smog, sharply reducing visibility and causing discomfort for residents. RK Puram was particularly affected, with an AQI of 374, placing it in the 'very poor' category, according to CPCB data.Areas around Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium were also blanketed in thick smog, with the AQI reported at 349, again categorised as 'very poor'. Najafgarh recorded a slightly lower AQI of 284, but the area remained shrouded in hazardous haze.In response to the deteriorating air quality, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoked all Stage-IV measures of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR to rein in pollution.The smog was not confined to the capital. A thick layer of fog also covered Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, reducing visibility there as well.For reference, AQI categorisation is as follows: 0-50 ‘good’, 51-100 ‘satisfactory’, 101-200 ‘moderate’, 201-300 ‘poor’, 301-400 ‘very poor’, and 401-500 ‘severe’.The Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) issued a passenger advisory on Thursday morning amid dense fog, warning that Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) were in force even as flight operations continued normally.In the travel advisory posted at 4.30 am, airport authorities informed passengers that foggy conditions had reduced visibility levels, prompting the implementation of LVP to ensure safe aircraft operations.Officials clarified that there was no major disruption to flight services at the airport at the time of the advisory. “Low-visibility procedures are in progress at Delhi Airport. All flight operations are presently normal. Passengers are requested to contact the airline concerned for updated flight information,” the advisory stated. Airport authorities urged travellers to stay in touch with their respective airlines for the latest updates on departures and arrivals.Earlier this month, CAQM deployed 19 teams for a road-inspection drive on December 12, as part of ongoing monitoring and enforcement under the statutory framework and provisions of GRAP. A total of 136 road stretches within the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) jurisdiction were inspected.The compiled data showed that 15 stretches had high visible dust levels, 38 had moderate dust, 61 recorded low dust intensity, and 22 stretches showed no visible dust. Accumulation of municipal solid waste (MSW) and construction & demolition (C&D) waste was observed on 55 and 53 stretches, respectively. Evidence of MSW or biomass burning was reported at six stretches.“These observations clearly indicate gaps and recurring negligence in the maintenance of the affected stretches,” the release said. It stressed the need for the DDA to enhance operational efficiency and implement prompt corrective measures through consistent and timely dust-mitigation interventions. The agency also needs to improve compliance across all road stretches for MSW and biomass burning.The commission noted that such incidents significantly impact particulate matter levels in Delhi. It emphasised the need for strengthened on-ground action, including regular mechanical sweeping, timely disposal of collected dust, maintenance of road shoulders and central verges, deployment of water-sprinkling and dust-suppression systems, and focused efforts to prevent open burning across all stretches maintained by the DDA.","RK Puram was particularly affected, with an AQI of 374, placing it in the'very poor' category.
