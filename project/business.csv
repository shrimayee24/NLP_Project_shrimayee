DEHRADUN: In a cluster of high-altitude villages near the India-China border in Uttarakhand's Uttarkashi district , households are shaped by absence. Across eight settlements - Harsil, Mukhba, Bagori, Dharali, Sukhi, Purali, Jhala and Jaspaur - the presence of young women and children has steadily thinned. The migration hasn't been forced, nor has it followed economic distress. It stems from a quieter reckoning: the recognition that local schools cannot meet the expectations families now place on education. In response, women have moved with children to towns like Dehradun and Uttarkashi, leaving behind men to manage apple orchards and tourism businesses.Anupriya Rawat, who once lived in a border village near Harsil, now resides in Dehradun with her child. Speaking to TOI, her voice held no resentment, only resignation. ""Ideally, I would not like to stay in a city away from my husband, but we are forced to make this sacrifice for the future of our children,"" she said. ""Several other women also left the village for their children's sake.""At the heart of this shift lies education - or the lack thereof. Across the eight villages, there is only one inter-school. Many of the settlements have a single primary school, but Bagori doesn't even have that. In those that do, the same two teachers are often responsible for all subjects, across all grades. Villagers said the schools fail to meet basic standards.""The schools are fraught with issues like lack of hygiene and absence of teachers,"" said Asha Panwar, a resident of Dharali who left years ago to raise her children in Uttarkashi. Her husband continues to live in the village, but she remains in town with her children, now 16 and 11. ""Almost all our villages are emptied due to this problem. You will not find any young daughter-in-law or school children back there,"" she said.Despite this dislocation, the families are not necessarily broken. Many are economically secure, even prosperous. Apple farming remains a strong source of seasonal income, and the pilgrimage economy surrounding the Char Dham route brings in consistent earnings. The men manage their lands and lodges, either alone or with elder relatives.""It's no doubt tough staying apart from one's wife and kids, but the silver lining is that we are getting economic independence by staying back in our villages,"" said Madhvendra Rawat, a resident of Harsil. ""Sometime back, one of our villagers hired a chopper to ferry his father to a private hospital during a medical emergency, which reflects prosperity. However, staying sans family has its own fallout, especially during medical emergency and festivities.""Officials acknowledge that the shift to towns has been happening, but claim education facilities in the villages are not to blame. ""The availability of teachers, school infrastructure and other facilities in govt schools in the region is not below par,"" said Harsha Rawat, block education officer, Bhatwari, Uttarkashi. ""These are 'vibrant villages' wherein special funds are being provided for the upkeep of facilities, yet families are migrating because they can afford education in towns. The community needs to show inclination towards their native places too rather than getting drifted.""A source in the education dept recalled a visit by education minister Dhan Singh Rawat to Bhatwari in Oct 2024. ""He expressed apprehension regarding the closure of the intermediate school in Harsil given the rampant migration of mothers and children from the area,"" the source told TOI. ""People have to understand migration is not the solution.""Still, for mothers who pack up their lives and take their children down to the towns, that argument may ring hollow. Back in the hills, the sound of school bells may echo, but classrooms remain half-empty.","Across eight settlements, the presence of young women and children has steadily thinned.

Mumbai residents show 'will to pay' for mangrove conservation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-residents-show-will-to-pay-for-mangrove-conservation/articleshow/119779108.cms,"Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with EID Wishes, Messages and quotes !

Mangroves contribute to Mumbai in a host of ways. They protect the city from storm surges, nurture fish breeding grounds, absorb air pollution, and help filter coastal waters. But these services rarely find a place on balance sheets or cost-benefit analyses - in part because they aren't easy to quantify.Now, a new study tries to do precisely that. According to an analysis by IIT Bombay researchers, benefits provided by mangroves are worth at least Rs 1,700 crore a year to Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). For Greater Mumbai alone, mangroves provide Rs 1,155 crore worth of services annually, the study found.The findings highlight the economic value of these ecological systems, says researcher Naman Gupta. ""It allows us to consider mangroves as not just a barrier to development, but as assets.""The MMR is home to some 22,300 hectares of mangrove, while Mumbai hosts about 6,522 hectares, according to some estimates.Gupta interviewed 150 households across rural (Vasai), semi-urban (Uran), and urban (Navi Mumbai) settings - and asked whether they would be willing to pay to conserve them. About 80% of rural and urban respondents said they would be willing to pay to conserve mangroves. That willingness was lowest among the semi-urban residents in Uran (58%). However, the actual amount these Uran residents were willing to pay was the highest of the three sites - an average Rs 214 a month compared with Rs 154 among rural residents and Rs 146 among urban respondents. The willingness to pay was used to arrive at an economic valuation.Semi-urban residents might have been willing to pay more, researchers suggest, due to an increase in wealth from compensations received for acquisition of land for infrastructure projects. Many also saw how mangroves shielded their lands from cyclones .According to researchers who interviewed households across rural, semi-urban and urban settings in MMR and conducted discussions with officials and community leaders, people understood the importance of mangrove conservation and when educated about their benefits, were willing to pay to conserve them.Over half of the 150 households the researchers spoke to were aware of the protective role of mangroves against climate change as well as other benefits. This awareness was highest in rural areas where 83% of interviewees showed knowledge of climate change and 70% knew of the protective role of mangroves. About 80% of rural and urban respondents said they would be willing to pay some money every month toward conserving mangroves. That willingness was lowest among semi-urban residents in Uran (58%). However, the actual amount these semi-urban residents were willing to pay was the highest of the three sites - an average of Rs 214 a month.One reason semi-urban residents might have been willing to pay more, researcher Naman Gupta suggests, is an increase in wealth in recent years due in part to compensations received for acquisition of land for infrastructure projects. They had the highest mean income among the groups. Also, many residents in Uran saw how mangroves shielded their lands from cyclones Nisarga and Tauktae.Rural residents were willing to pay the second highest amount per month - Rs152 - despite averaging the lowest incomes, the survey found, perhaps reflecting the greater impact of weather change on rural livelihoods. ""Rural communities working in fisheries and farming are able to make the connection between climatic changes and their own lives,"" says Gupta. By contrast, urban residents were willing to pay the least amount, the survey found. Residents interviewed in Navi Mumbai were aware of the importance of mangroves, but felt the govt should be doing the job of conservation. ""Many of them said the govt has the resources and we shouldn't have to contribute,"" said Gupta.However, urban residents were willing to volunteer more time for conservation - an average of ten hours a month compared with five hours offered by rural respondents and less than an hour a month by semi-urban residents.These differing responses show there can be no single strategy in mangrove conservation, Gupta says. She hopes her assessment will provide a reference point for policymakers or spur them to undertake a detailed assessment.","Mangroves protect Mumbai from storm surges, nurture fish breeding grounds, absorb air pollution, and help filter coastal waters.

India now 2nd-largest host of international schools as parents seek to future-proof kids’ future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-now-2nd-largest-host-of-international-schools-as-parents-seek-to-future-proof-kids-future/articleshow/119777823.cms,"MUMBAI: Once a rarefied choice for the elite few, international schooling in India has quietly become a national conversation. Today, India hosts the second-largest number of international schools worldwide — not just in name with a tag, but in affiliation with global education boards.Over the past decade, middle-class families from every corner India have found themselves at a crossroads: Should their children follow the familiar path of Indian boards or chart a new course with a foreign curriculum?At the turn of this century, the school education sector was rather different: there were merely eight institutes offering the IB programme , and the count of schools offering the Cambridge course ( IGCSE ) was so insignificant that the board did not even have records of its presence in India in 2000. By 2011-12, the two boards - Cambridge International and International Baccalaureate - had 197 and 99 schools respectively.Fresh data from ISC Research, a think-tank that tracks the world's international schools' market, shows that India, home to 884 schools in 2019, now in Jan 2025 has 972 schools, reflecting a five-year growth trajectory of 10%. For comparison, the total number of international schools grew by 8% in this time frame and now stands at 14,833. Maharashtra now leads with 210 schools aligned with IB or IGCSE programmes. Karnataka follows, while Tamil Nadu and Telangana are quickly catching up.""More Indian families, expatriates, and NRIs are choosing international schools, which is why cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Delhi are seeing more investment from international school chains. Parents now have higher incomes, and they see global curriculums as a way to future-proof their children's careers, making sure they study in systems that match Western universities and open doors to global opportunities,"" said Abishek Pandy, ISC Research field research manager, India.What's striking is the in-roads these boards have made - reaching far beyond the cities where they first landed. International schools now dot the map in places like Hatkanagale in Sangli, Tholahunse in Davangere, and Sonaghati in Betul. ""Every year, Cambridge is adding 100 schools, and 30 to 40 new schools of IB are coming up each year. The aspiration of the middle class is at an all-time high. The phenomenon is not limited to metro cities but tier 2 and 3 cities, where the major growth now is coming from,"" said Mahesh Srivastava, former regional director (South Asia), Cambridge Assessment International Education.""The global exposure and the rising income are in short the two reasons why Indians are opting for the international boards,"" added Srivastava, capturing the dual engine driving this shift: aspiration and access.But it is not only the destination that draws them - it is also the design. Former IB representative for South Asia, Farzana Dohadwalla, believes that what draws parents in is the architecture of the learning itself.""Personalised learning, which is the smaller class sizes, is one of the main reasons according to me that parents are demanding international schools. Most schools have 25-30 students to a class. Additionally, very different strategies of teaching-learning take place; it is not didactic where a teacher stands in the front and teaches students,"" she said.Added Kunal Dalal, managing director, JBCN Education, ""The international curriculum emphasises inquiry-based learning, interdisciplinary thinking, and real-world application, fostering essential skills for future career aspirations. Furthermore, international education places a strong emphasis on experiential learning, global perspectives, and learner-led initiatives, empowering learners to become proactive problem-solvers and changemakers."" It is not just the syllabus that has changed - it is the structure, the culture, and the people. What began as a foreign transplant has rooted itself firmly in Indian soil. ""Now, 60%-70% of students who study in an international school pursue their college education in India itself,"" said Dohadwalla.The faces at the front of the classroom are also changing. Where once foreign heads guided these institutions, today it is largely Indian educators - trained, upskilled, and attuned to both global standards and local sensibilities - who are shaping the direction. International schooling may have once stood apart from India's educational tradition; today, it has become part of the tapestry, said most experts.But in the quiet calculus of modern education, perception also outweighs pedagogy for many. Educationist Francis Joseph captures this shift with candour: starting an international school, he explained, simply makes strategic sense. The process of affiliation is smoother, the branding more aspirational, and the tuition - strikingly higher - is met with little resistance. ""Will a parent pay four lakhs a year for a CBSE school? No,"" he said. ""But give it the international tag, and no one blinks.""It's not just about curriculum - it's about optics too. ""In a world where educational institutions are also real estate investments, international schools align neatly with the land-and-building models of private owners. They're more than schools; they're signals of status, carefully constructed to appeal to ambition and aspiration,"" said Joseph.Also, what began as a quiet experiment has now become a full-fledged business model - one that echoes the playbook of consumer giants. Much like FMCG companies learned to tailor their products for every price point, schools too are learning to segment their offerings for a layered marketplace like India. The result? A surge in institutions offering multiple curricula under one roof.""As cities expand and stratify, the expectations of parents evolve just as quickly,"" said Joseph. ""With spending power fluctuating , schools have learned to adapt. Dual boards - once a novelty - are now a strategic staple. A national curriculum runs alongside an international one, often within same campus, designed to appeal to families across socioeconomic spectrum.""",India hosts the second-largest number of international schools worldwide. Maharashtra now leads with 210 schools aligned with IB or IGCSE programmes. 60%-70% of students who study in an international school pursue their college education in India itself.

India boosting covert warfare capabilities of special forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-boosting-covert-warfare-capabilities-of-special-forces/articleshow/119775174.cms,"NEW DELHI: From midget submarines, loiter munitions and nano drones to specialised weaponry, surveillance and communication equipment, India is progressively strengthening the capabilities of its Special Forces to undertake covert warfare deep behind enemy lines as well as counter-terrorism operations .The upgrade in the gruelling combat training, which will include “augmented reality/virtual reality mission planners and simulators” in the near future, as well as “specialised equipping” of the Special Forces in the Army, IAF and Navy is part of an ongoing process, sources told TOI.There are now 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions (each has around 620 soldiers) in the Army, 27 `flights’ of around 1,600 Garud commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.A major shortcoming, however, is the lack of a full-fledged Special Operations Command, which would bring the disparate Special Forces together under a unified command and control structure for planning and executing strategic operations instead of merely tactical ones.Nevertheless, the creation of a truncated Armed Forces Special Operations Division (AFSOD) has somewhat addressed the issue of “jointness and synergy” among the Para-SF, Garuds and Marcos.The induction of advanced software-defined radios, including manpack versions, and satellite-communication systems, for instance, have ensured “uninterrupted and seamless” long-range communications for joint operations among the three forces, the sources said.The Special Forces already have a wide array of specialized weapons, ranging from Finnish Sako long-range sniper rifles, American M4A1 carbines and Israeli TAR-21 Tavor assault rifles to Swedish Carl Gustaf lightweight rocket launchers, Russian VSS suppressed sniper rifles and Italian Beretta pistols with silencers.“The induction of loiter munition systems has boosted the precision-targeting capabilities of Para-SF units. Similarly, remotely-piloted aerial vehicles, nano drones, surveillance copters and lightweight drones with FLIR (forward-looking infra-red) payloads have been inducted for advanced short and medium-range surveillance up to 10-km,” a source said.With stealth being paramount for insertion behind enemy lines, advanced indigenous `combat free-fall parachute systems’ and other such equipment have been inducted, while procurement of new `integrated combat diving kits’ is also underway. “Guided aerial delivery systems are now available to ensure commandos can operate independently behind enemy lines for longer durations,” another source said.Given their maritime role, the Marcos in turn have midget submarines or sea chariots, underwater scooters, remotely-operated underwater vehicles for explosive disposal, open-circuit diving equipment and air-droppable rubberized inflatable boats, among other such things.Also read: Op Brahma: India's first relief package lands at Myanmar The selection and training for the Para-SF, Marcos and Garuds, which have a rejection rate as high as 70-80%, also remains a major focus area. The training, in which the volunteers are stretched to their physical and mental limits, includes operations for surgical strikes, hit-and-run missions, strategic and tactical surveillance of vital enemy targets, intelligence-gathering, laser-designated bombings and other such clandestine tasks.The Army’s first vertical wind tunnel to enhance ‘combat freefall’ skills of its Special Forces and others is fully operational at the Special Forces Training School at Bakloh in Himachal Pradesh. “Simulators are now increasingly being used. The plan is to also induct AI-based systems soon to make the training more realistic and economical,” a source said.","There are now 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions in the Army, 27 `flights’ of around 1,600 Garud commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.

This is not just an organisation; it is a force of national consciousness.""Modi praised the RSS's grassroots service initiatives, including Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram and Ekal Vidyalaya for tribal education, and Seva Bharati, which supports underprivileged communities. He recalled how RSS volunteers provided relief during natural disasters, such as floods and earthquakes, and played a key role in organising the recent Netra Kumbh.Reflecting on India's spiritual resilience, Modi credited the country's survival through centuries of challenges to its deep-rooted cultural consciousness . He recalled the contributions of saints like Sant Tukaram and Sant Dnyaneshwar in unifying society and noted Swami Vivekananda's role in rekindling national confidence during times of crisis.""India's cultural consciousness has remained unwavering, and RSS has been instrumental in keeping this spirit alive,"" he stated.","PM Narendra Modi hailed RSS as'modern akshyavat (indestructible banyan tree)' of India's eternal culture.

Pay traffic e-challan or lose driving licence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pay-traffic-e-challan-or-lose-driving-licence-draft-rules/articleshow/119776785.cms,"NEW DELHI: Those who do not pay their traffic e-challan (fine) amount within three months could soon find their driving licences suspended by law enforcement agencies, while those who have accumulated three challans - for jumping red signal or dangerous driving - in a financial year, could see their licences confiscated for at least three months.These are part of a series of measures govt plans to implement to rein in errant drivers after it was found that there was barely 40% recovery of e-challan amounts and large-scale non-compliance. Sources said govt has also prepared a strategy to link higher insurance premiums, if one has at least two pending challans from the previous financial year.The details have been worked out following a Supreme Court order directing 23 states and seven UTs to file compliance reports indicating the implementation of electronic monitoring as provided in Central Motor Vehicles Act.

NEW DELHI: Maintaining status quo, Centre on Sunday declared the entire state of Manipur - excluding areas within the jurisdiction of 13 police stations across five districts - as 'disturbed' under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (Afspa) for an additional six months.The move comes when the state has not seen any major or prolonged bout of ethnic violence for the past seven months, contrary to the trend of recurrent clashes between its two dominant ethnic groups since May 2023. Also, the political landscape has changed since the last notification under Afspa was issued on Nov 14, 2024, with CM N Biren Singh having stepped down in Feb, followed by the imposition of President's rule in the state.In separate notifications that also maintain status quo, Centre Sunday extended the validity of Afspa in parts of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh until Sept 30, 2025, ""unless withdrawn earlier"". As per the notification with respect to Nagaland, eight districts and 21 police stations spread over five other districts would continue to remain in the 'disturbed areas' list. Similarly, Afspa will continue to apply in Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts as well as areas falling within the jurisdiction of three police stations in Namsai district.According to home minister Amit Shah, there is now a semblance of normalcy in Manipur, with shops and markets having opened and prices kept in check, and talks between the sparring ethnic groups also on track, with one round already held at the level of the home ministry and another expected soon.In the last Afspa notification for Manipur issued on Nov 14, 2024, six police stations across the state's five districts were declared as 'disturbed' till March 31, 2025, barely one-and-a-half months after they were included in the notified list of 19 police stations kept out of Afspa purview. In a break from the usual practice of the state govt notifying the 'disturbed areas' under Afspa, the notification was issued by Centre.The move to declare six additional police stations as 'disturbed' in Nov had bucked the trend since 2014; for the first time since Modi govt assumed office at Centre, the area under Afspa within a state was being expanded.Now extending Afspa validity further till Sept 30, ""unless withdrawn earlier"", Centre Sunday notified the entire state as 'disturbed area' except 13 police stations.","Maintaining status quo, Centre on Sunday declared the entire state of Manipur as 'disturbed' under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (Afspa) for an additional six months.

Medical colleges, which save crores each year by not paying MBBS interns any stipend or paying a stipend much lower than what govt colleges in the state pay, have been threatened with a penalty of Rs 50,000 by National Medical Commission. NMC issued a public notice on Friday about the penalty for not submitting details of stipend paid to MBBS interns.According to the notice, the commission had issued four public notices in Nov and Dec last year asking medical colleges to submit details of stipends paid to MBBS interns and resident doctors for the financial year 2023-24. This notice, more than three-and-a-half months after the last one, comes a week before the next hearing of the case on payment of stipends in the Supreme Court on April 8.The notice stated that the information was sought on the directions of the Supreme Court which ordered NMC in Sept 2023 and on April 1, 2024, to submit details of stipends paid to medical interns and residents. NMC first issued a notice seeking this information on April 16, 2024. A year later, NMC is still issuing notices and threatening a penalty of Rs 50,000 for not submitting the information. Incidentally, the Undergraduate Medical Education Board, the autonomous board of NMC issuing these notices, doesn't have a single member since the tenure of all members ended months back.A large number of private medical colleges and some govt ones, which have not submitted the information till now, have been given one more chance. ""It has been observed that in spite of four public notices issued through the NMC website, some medical colleges are yet to fill up the Annual Declaration Form on the portal. This has been viewed seriously by the Competent Authority at NMC,"" stated the public notice. NMC secretary has written to the principal/dean of all the colleges and marked copies to principal secretaries and medical education departments of all states informing them about the ""extension of date of submission"" of the information from April 1 to April 10, ""along with penalty of Rs 50,000 (including GST)"".Section 8 of the Maintenance of Standards of Medical Education Regulation of 2023 deals with penalties if ""a medical institution has failed to comply with any statutory provision, regulations framed thereunder or has not complied with the Minimum Standards of Requirements as prescribed by their respective Boards, or has conducted themselves in any manner which is not in accordance with the goals of medical education and practice"".

NEW DELHI: West Bengal leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari on Friday wrote to external affairs minister S Jaishankar urging him to prevent future foreign visits by chief minister Mamata Banerjee in her official capacity. Adhikari accused Banerjee of undermining India on the international stage and bringing shame to the country during her recent visit to the United Kingdom.In his letter, Adhikari claimed that Banerjee’s remarks in London displayed ""devotion and admiration for the colonial masters,"" which he described as ""unthinkable"" for a Bengali. He cited her speech at a business event in the UK, where she said, ""I love UK because we have an emotional relation, historical relation... From the heritage point of view, ours and from yours also. 190 years, you ruled in India. You ruled Bengal... So we forget that? Always India remembers you, and Bengal also remembers you.""Adhikari condemned her remarks, saying that Bengal had been at the forefront of the independence movement, resisting British rule. He said that praising the colonial past amounted to ""public renunciation of the sacrifices made by our freedom movement revolutionaries.""The letter also criticised Banerjee for her statements at Oxford University's Kellogg College, where she appeared to ""downplay"" India’s economic growth. When a speaker highlighted that India had overtaken the UK as the world's fifth-largest economy and was projected to become the largest by 2060, Banerjee disagreed, saying, ""I will differ that.""Adhikari called her response ""simply treasonous"" and an ""embarrassment for every Bengali and Indian."" He alleged that Banerjee had ""deliberately tarnished India’s reputation on foreign soil"" and accused her of opposing the country's economic rise.The BJP leader further urged the external affairs ministry to conduct a ""thorough probe"" into her remarks and ensure she is not granted permission for official foreign visits in the future. He referenced existing guidelines that require the ministry of external affairs to approve such visits and suggested that her remarks should be considered grounds for disqualification.Banerjee's visit to the UK was marred by controversy, as she faced protests from a group of demonstrators at Kellogg College. Protesters held placards questioning her stance on election violence in West Bengal and the RG Kar College case. BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a video of the incident, criticising Banerjee for her comments on India's economic future. ""West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has a problem with India becoming the world's largest economy... This is truly shameful,"" he posted on X.Union minister Giriraj Singh also slammed Banerjee, saying, ""Hiding the truth and insulting India, both are done by Mamata Banerjee. Today, the whole world is seeing and respecting our growing economy, but unfortunately, when Mamata Banerjee and the 'tukde-tukde gang' go abroad, they insult India. This is unfortunate.""Banerjee, however, responded to hecklers during her speech, saying, ""Please don’t do politics here on this stage. That you can do with me in my state, not here.""

Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren-Gautam Adani meet gives ammo to BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/india-bloc-defends-cm-adani-meet/articleshow/119722239.cms,"RANCHI: A meeting over mining rights between Gautam Adani , chairman of Adani group with Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren at the latter's residence in Ranchi late on Friday, left the BJP questioning the grand old party's stand on the sudden bonhomie with the industrialist, whom it had earlier targeted during polls.""The two-hour closed-door meeting centred around commercial mining in Adani's two coal blocks in Gondulpura (Hazaribag) and Godda, which is pending due to land acquisition and other mandatory statutory clearances, besides deliberations on future investment opportunities,"" a source said.While the two met to discuss land acquisition and pending clearances for the Adani's two commercial coal mining blocks in the state, the opposition BJP questioned whether ""jibes and allegations'' against Adani by INDIA bloc during twin elections last year was only to score political mileage.The meet comes a few days after Congress MLA and leader of its legislative party, Pradeep Yadav, demanded a review of the land acquisition done by Adanis for its 1,600 MW Godda thermal power plant, which is supplying power to Bangladesh.After he made claims that it was done in ‘violation' of Santhal Pargana Tenancy (SPT) Act, the coalition govt led by Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) announced formation of a special committee led by chief secretary Alka Tiwari to probe into it.Notably, Adani is among the first companies to bag coal blocks in the state for commercial coal mining, but the projects are stuck due to pending statutory clearances. In Gondulpura, the company is also facing resistance from the locals in land acquisition.Pratul Shahdeo, BJP spokesperson said, ""Meetings are good, but such meetings should also be taken as lessons. The way CM accorded a red carpet welcome to Gautam Adaniji, it seems that his and his party's jibes against the industrialist was only political to mislead people so far.""Hitting out at the Congress, he added, ""The party whose leader Rahul Gandhi's only job day in and out is to attack Adani and Ambani must explain its stand now at the meeting.""Both JMM and Congress defended the meeting. ""Our criticism wasn't person specific, but against the BJP led govt in the Centre on its ways to appease specific bunch of capitalists at the sake of countrymen, poor farmers, tribals etc. Any right investments for the state is always welcome to create jobs, and development,"" said JMM spokesperson Manoj Pandey.Speaking to TOI, Yadav, who had been vocal against Godda power plant for many years said the Congress was never against good and positive investment, but the fight has always been against concentration of everyone to specific groups, which the BJP led govt's approach has been since coming to power in 2014.The sudden meeting however raised eyebrows in the state Congress camp as many said they were in the dark. Congress has four ministers in the Hemant led coalition govt while RJD has one.""None of our ministers were even aware about the visit. Even though it's chief minister's prerogative, having representation of ministers from finance and Industry, which is with Congress and RJD respectively would have given the meeting more depth for proper deliberations,"" said a senior Congress office bearer.While Adani group didn't come up with any official communique, an official said that the meeting was long due and pre-planned. ""It was to take place earlier soon after the Hemant govt returned to office after 2019 polls but got delayed due to various reasons. About a week back, the meeting got finalised,"" said a source, adding that the chairman's office had directly coordinated everything with CMO.""As an industrial group, such meetings are natural as we have our operations in Jharkhand too. While land acquisition for Godda power plant was done during erstwhile BJP govt, but one should recognise that the plant actually came into formal operation during Hemant govt's earlier tenure between 2019-2024,"" he added.","The two-hour closed-door meeting centred around commercial mining in Adani's two coal blocks in Gondulpura (Hazaribag) and Godda. The meet comes a few days after Congress MLA and leader of its legislative party, Pradeep Yadav, demanded a review of the land acquisition done by Adanis for its 1,600 MW thermal power plant.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119736013,imgsize-61076,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/119736013.jpg"

He pressured her into talking to him.When she eventually refused further contact, Kumar began blackmailing her, claiming he had voice recordings of her and threatened to send them to her husband.He extorted Rs 10 lakh from her at CMR Central Shopping Mall in Maddilapalem, Vizag city.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

A history of delays

What travellers need to know

American travellers are in a last-minute rush to secure a Real ID-compliant driver’s licence or identification card as the deadline is fast approaching. After the deadline, 7 May, individuals flying domestically will need either a Real ID, a passport, or another approved form of identification to board a plane.Despite previous delays to enforcement, federal officials insisted that this time, the deadline is firm. In response, department of motor vehicles (DMV) offices across the country are seeing an unprecedented surge in demand, forcing them to extend operating hours and add hundreds of new appointment slots.However, the influx of applicants has led to hours-long queues stretching around buildings in states such as Tennessee and Pennsylvania.With long wait times at DMV locations, many Americans turned to social media to vent their frustrations and exchange tips on where to find the shortest queues.One Facebook user from New Jersey complained, “The whole state is booked!” while another user on Reddit asked, “What are my options?” after struggling to find a way to fly their son home after his university term.Those unable to secure appointments until the summer have resorted to posting in local online groups, hoping for cancellations that would allow them to move up their appointments.Meanwhile, authorities in Miami-Dade County have uncovered a network of scalpers booking free DMV slots and reselling them for profit, MSN news reported.According to the transportation security administration (TSA), around one in five travellers currently passing through US airports do not have a Real ID or another compliant form of identification. This is despite the requirement having been in the pipeline for decades and states issuing Real IDs since the 2010s.Many travellers have put off obtaining a Real ID due to repeated deadline extensions. The US government postponed the requirement three times, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, leading some to assume it would be delayed once again.Adding to the confusion, some states, such as California and New York, continue to issue both standard licences and Real IDs, meaning many people did not upgrade their IDs when renewing. Mixed messaging from different authorities has further complicated matters.Airports now display signs urging passengers to get “Real ID ready,” and the department of homeland security’s website featured a countdown timer for the deadline. However, states overwhelmed by demand have tried to ease concerns. The Illinois secretary of state’s website reassures residents with the message, “Don’t Rush the Date. Real ID Can Wait.”Illinois has responded to the surge by introducing “DMV Real ID Saturdays” and opening a dedicated walk-in centre in Chicago. Yet, the state government reminded residents that they can still travel with a valid US passport.The percentage of Real ID-compliant licences varies greatly by state. Texas, which exclusively issues Real id-compliant driver’s licences, boasts a 98% compliance rate, according to the Texas department of public safety.Pennsylvania, however, offered multiple types of licences and has an opt-in rate of just 25.6% for Real IDs, according to the state’s transportation department. In response to rising demand, Pennsylvania extended DMV hours on select Mondays.From 7 May, all travellers aged 18 and over must present a Real ID-compliant document to fly domestically on a commercial flight, enter certain federal buildings, or access nuclear power plants.Real IDs are easily identifiable by a special marking at the top of the card, often a gold star. Travellers without one must ensure they carry a valid passport or another approved form of identification when flying within the US.To help manage the surge in applications, some AAA branches, such as those in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, are now processing Real ID applications for members through partnerships with local DMVs.As the deadline draws near, Americans who haven’t yet secured their Real ID, face limited options, either brave the queues and hunt for last-minute cancellations, or ensure they have an alternative form of identification in time for their next flight.","From 7 May, travellers aged 18 and over must present a Real ID-compliant document to fly domestically on a commercial flight, enter certain federal buildings, or access nuclear power plants.

Why does the Fram2 mission stand out?



CNN

SpaceX is gearing up for a historic mission, set to launch the first human spaceflight over Earth's polar regions. The privately funded Fram2 mission will carry four astronauts on a four-day orbital journey.The launch is scheduled from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with the crew aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule atop a Falcon 9 rocket, with the launch window opening at 9.46 pm ET (0146 GMT).The mission, named ""Fram2,"" is inspired by the famous 19th-century Norwegian ship used for Arctic and Antarctic expeditions,reported.During the flight, astronauts will conduct groundbreaking experiments, including taking the first X-ray in space and studying how mushrooms grow in microgravity.The mission will last three to five days and end with a splashdown off California’s coast.The crew comprises Wang, a Maltese adventurer and crypto company founder (f2pool and skatefish), alongside vehicle commander Jannicke Mikkelsen from Norway, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge as pilot, and Australian polar explorer Eric Philps as medical officer.The crew underwent eight months of training, including an Alaskan wilderness expedition to experience living in confined spaces under challenging conditions.The research aims to help future long-term space missions, including trips to Mars.""With the same pioneering spirit as early polar explorers, we aim to bring back new data and knowledge to advance the long-term goals of space exploration,"" said mission commander Chun Wang.During the mission, astronauts will study how their bodies react to weightlessness and motion sickness, a common issue in space.After returning to Earth, they will try to exit the spacecraft without medical help, testing how well astronauts can perform basic tasks after spaceflight.According to, Fram2 stands out because it involves a unique trajectory over Earth's poles, a route that has never been undertaken by human spaceflight.This polar path demands significantly more fuel compared to conventional equatorial orbits, making it a technically challenging endeavour.The International Space Station's orbit prevents observation of Earth's polar regions. The previous record holder, Soviet mission Vostok 6 in 1963, achieved a 65-degree inclination, while Fram2 targets 90 degrees.SpaceX's private astronaut missions now total five, including three ISS missions with Axiom Space and two Earth-orbital flights: Inspiration4 (2021) and Polaris Dawn, featuring the first private astronaut spacewalk.","SpaceX is gearing up for a historic mission, set to launch the first human spaceflight over Earth's polar regions.

Trump’s tariff shock may boost Indian auto parts exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-tariff-shock-may-boost-indian-auto-parts-exports/articleshow/119768940.cms,".

The author has an IIT-IIM education and over 20 years of experience leading auto parts and manufacturing companies in India and abroad.

Spoiler alert—the 25% tariff imposed on auto and auto parts is likely to have little negative impact on India. Automobile tariffs would take effect from April 3, and tariffs on auto parts would take effect ""no later than May 3, 2025,"" according to MEMA, the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association of the USA.Firstly, on automobiles, India’s total exports to the US, at around $10 million, would roughly equate to a rounding error in Japan’s automobile exports to the US and is completely insignificant.On automobile parts, India is a more serious contender, with $2.2 billion in exports to the US, comprising nearly 30% of India’s total automobile component exports. But placed in context, this is under 3% of the US' total automobile parts imports. This is not really what Donald Trump is targeting but could become collateral damage in his assault on the big exporters of parts to the US—Canada, Mexico, China, and others.However, the likelihood of being collateral damage is minimal. The 25% tariff is being applied uniformly to all countries, so every nation’s competitive advantage is impacted equally. Auto parts companies in India do not fear being underpriced by competitors on this account. What they do fear is pressure from importers to absorb at least a part of the cost, thereby eroding profitability significantly. Some companies anticipating this possibility have already started a cost-reduction drive.The other possible threat is local manufacturers in the US using this shield of 25% to set up production in the US and outprice imports. This is probable against high-cost countries like Germany, Japan, and Canada, which would lose out completely to US manufacturers. However, the equation is different in the case of low-cost countries like India, Vietnam, China, and some East European nations. Even with the 25% advantage, US manufacturers would find it challenging to match the prices of components from low-cost nations.Also read: India caught in crossfire as Donald Trump's 25% auto tariffs roil global supply chains The reason is that the cost advantage enjoyed by low-cost countries due to labour arbitrage is not in percentages but in orders of magnitude. While a worker in auto components is paid Rs 30,000 to 40,000 per month in India, a typical US worker would be paid at least $4,000 per month. This translates to a 10:1 cost advantage in labour, but the wage advantage is offset by higher productivity in the US. This could be anywhere between 2:1 and 3:1. This is not because workers in the US work three times as quickly as Indians. Human productivity due to physique is a factor, and machine speed is another, but what is significant in the productivity difference is automation. This results in man-machine ratios that could be 1:2 or 1:3 in the US versus 1:1 in India.Additionally, Indian companies tend to employ larger numbers of indirect labour compared to the US, where material movement and other indirect activities have a larger element of automation. This extends even to factory staff. Factory management productivity is higher in the US due to leaner organisations. Indian factory managements typically tend to have more supervisors and middle management. However, even after offsetting the productivity advantage of the US, India would have a labour advantage versus the US, with total human costs being anywhere between 300% higher or more.After this, there is the consideration of what percentage of the total cost the human cost comprises to determine the impact on total cost. In this, we need to club all three categories—direct labour, indirect labour, and staff salaries. All this put together would normally be at a minimum of 12–15% of the total cost, even in material-intensive products. If the total labour cost advantage is 300%, then the total cost advantage would still be 45%. This can be calculated for illustration as follows: The Indian product would be 85+15, versus the US product’s 85+60, so Indian products have some cushion against US products even after the 25% tariff.This calculation is only for illustration, as there are cases where the total human cost is as much as 40%, making it well-nigh impossible for local US companies to compete. However, if there is a double whammy in terms of very low labour content and abysmally low productivity, then that company could lose out, as the OEMs would expect at least a 10% advantage for importing products versus buying locally. However, in most cases, the 25% advantage, even clubbed with the 10% cost differential sought by OEMs, can be overcome by Indian companies.Another factor that should make Indian exporters comfortable is that US manufacturers would be wary of setting up capacity to take on Indian products, not knowing how far we can go in dropping prices. This is in addition to the fact that these low-cost imports represent a relatively smaller slice of the market. Local manufacturers would first look at the low-hanging fruit, i.e., large volumes of high-cost imports from high-cost nations.However, instead of looking at this defensively as to how we can protect our position, the administration should be looking at how this situation can be used as an opportunity to aggressively expand our exports to the US by striking a deal. Why this should be a difficult exercise, given the above cost factors, is baffling. Even if the duties on every single manufactured product from the US were reduced to zero, US products could not outprice Indian products.US products will be bought for value, not price. If the duty on a Harley-Davidson, for instance, is reduced to zero, there is unlikely to be even one buyer of a TVS Apache or Bajaj Pulsar who would switch to a Harley. Similarly, even the lowest model of a Tesla couldn’t compete on price against Indian cars. The same is true for every other product I know of. The government's tariffs are not meant to protect Indian manufacturers but to generate revenue from the “rich” buyers of these products (“If someone wants a Harley, he will pay twice the price to get it”). Soaking the rich in this context is outdated thinking from the Nehru era, which has no place today, either in economics or, as here, in geopolitics.Also read: Trump announces 25% tariffs on imported cars: Musk's Tesla takes a hit, but could still win In conclusion, while the 25% tariff poses little threat to Indian auto component makers, it provides an opportunity the government should seize and capitalise on. The question is whether they will rise to the occasion. From 1947 to 1990, India saw the dark ages until the P V Narasimha Rao-Manmohan Singh government. They were up against the wall but used the crisis well to liberalise the economy.India then saw an inflection point. We can hope that the present government will do the same under compulsion. It should, as it has taken several steps to promote Indian manufacturing in the past. As Winston Churchill (or Rahm Emanuel) said, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” So, Trump’s tariffs could well be good news and another inflection point for the Indian economy.","Donald Trump's 25% tariff on auto and auto parts is likely to have little negative impact on India. India's total exports to the US, at around $10 million, would roughly equate to a rounding error in Japan’s automobile exports to US. The reason is that the cost advantage enjoyed by low-cost countries due to labour arbitrage is not in percentages.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119768835,imgsize-627197,width-400,resizemode-4/119768835.jpg"
Pakistan citizens to bear higher taxes as IMF approves $1.3 billion loan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-citizens-to-bear-higher-taxes-as-imf-approves-1-3-billion-loan/articleshow/119580815.cms,"A bustling market in Pakistan (AP file photo)

IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme | Dawn News English

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector. Dawn newspaper reports that a reduction in power rates is expected, funded by reallocating the existing petroleum levy.Senior officials familiar with the SLA and MEFP indicated that the prime minister would announce an approximate Rs 7 per unit reduction in average electricity rates, effective from April 1, 2025.The implementation of new measures - carbon levy, water pricing and automobile sector reforms - will commence from July 1, 2025. Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection. These measures require cabinet approval before implementation through the finance bill 2025-26.The authorities aim to achieve an FY25 underlying primary surplus of 1% of GDP minimum, maintaining consolidation in FY26. The focus remains on revenue mobilisation, spending efficiency and tax base expansion.Pakistan has committed to maintaining strict monetary policy to keep inflation within the SBP's 5-7% target range and preserve foreign exchange market functionality while building reserves.The RSF programme includes strengthening public investment processes, improving water resource management, enhancing disaster financing coordination, addressing climate-related risks, and promoting environmental-friendly transportation to reduce pollution impacts.",IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme.

Clocks in UK to 'move forward' by one hour: What is daylight saving time?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/clocks-in-uk-to-move-forward-by-one-hour-what-is-daylight-saving-time/articleshow/119740976.cms,"File Photo: London's iconic Big Ben clock tower

When do the clocks go forward?

Why is the time changed?

Who proposed

daylight saving time

?

How many countries follow daylight saving time?

British Summer Time (BST) is back, which means that clocks in the United Kingdom will move forward by one hour, before Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is restored in October.At 1 am on Sunday, the official time will instantly become 2 am. Each year, BST comes into effect on the last Sunday of March, while GMT is restored on the final Sunday of October.Accordingly, GMT will return on October 26. The corresponding dates for 2026 and 2027 are March 29/October 25 and March 28/October 31.Similarly, last year's dates were March 31 and October 27.According to BBC, the aim is to make better use of daylight during the summer months. By shifting the clocks forward, we squeeze in more usable daylight into the evenings for activities such as after-work strolls and evening sport.Often, this is incorrectly attributed to Benjamin Franklin. It was actually an idea of George Hudson, an insect enthusiast from New Zealand, who proposed it in 1895. Apparently, Hudson wanted more daylight after his shift work to collect insects.Of the world's 195 countries, daylight saving time is observed only in around 70. Major countries like Japan, India and China do not change time.Daylight saving time was first officially introduced by Germany in 1916, during the First World War. The UK followed suit weeks later, as did several other countries involved in the conflict.","British Summer Time (BST) is back, which means that clocks in the United Kingdom will move forward by one hour.

'She doesn’t flinch'

NEW DELHI: A huge uproar erupted in the packed auditorium of Kellogg College at Oxford University as West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee delivered her maiden speech.She was speaking on ' Empowerment of Women in Bengal and its Success', following an invitation from the institution.The chief minister was interrupted suddenly by a group of protesting students, who tried to disrupt her speech by raising the issue of post-poll violence and the RG Kar College rape-murder case .""Please speak clearly. You have the right to speak, this is a democracy,"" she responded.""Love you, brother. If you want to do politics, go tell your party in my state.

This case is with the central government and is sub judice. Do not do politics here,"" she told the protesters.Another person asked the West Bengal chief minister whether she was ""anti-Hindu.""She replied, ""I work for everyone.

She also stressed the importance of inclusive development and stated that division in society is counterproductive.""If I die, before my death, I want to see unity. Unity is our strength, and division leads to our fall. This was Swami Vivekananda's belief. Keeping unity is a difficult task, but dividing people takes only a moment. Do you think the world can sustain such a divisive ideology?"" she asked.""When I am in the chair, I cannot divide society. I have to look after the weaker sections and the poor.
