He unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Azamgarh against Akhilesh Yadav but later won the 2022 bypolls from the same constituency.Chhath Puja , beginning Saturday, sees widespread celebrations across Bihar, Jharkhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh, and parts of Nepal.Devotees perform Vedic rituals and offer prayers to the Sun God and Chhathi Maiya. Central to the festival are traditional folk songs known as Chhath Geet, which carry blessings for family and loved ones. Legendary folk singer Sharda Sinha is remembered for popularising these melodies across generations.Ahead of the festival, PM Modi encouraged citizens to share Chhath songs on social media, saying: ""The grand festival of Chhath, dedicated to nature and culture, is approaching. Devotees across Bihar and the entire country are immersed in preparations with full devotion. The songs of Chhathi Maiya enhance the grandeur and divinity of this sacred occasion. I request you to share Chhath Puja songs with me. I will share them with all fellow countrymen over the next few days. ""Remembering Sharda Sinha, the Prime Minister added: ""When it comes to worshipping Chhathi Maiya, it's natural to remember Sharda Sinha. She was the daughter-in-law of Begusarai. We honoured her first with the Padma Bhushan and then this year with the Padma Vibhushan. She is no longer with us, but her songs will always be remembered.""While rooted in Bihar, Chhath Puja is also observed in Jharkhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh, and Nepali communities, highlighting the festival’s shared cultural heritage across the eastern subcontinent. Cities and towns are preparing riverbanks and public spaces for rituals, reflecting the festival’s enduring social and spiritual significance.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his wishes to citizens for Kharna Puja, a key ritual of the four-day Chhath festival.

The New Rules of Study Abroad 2025 | Managing finances and mistakes

NEW DELHI: The Centre is preparing a five-year plan for higher education with five main goals: raise enrolment (GER), improve employment and apprenticeships, build international links, upgrade quality and strengthen digital systems. The plan relies on ""big-ticket"" projects, state-wise targets and performance-linked funding.The quality measures include clearer accreditation bands, so that students can compare programmes easily and programmes that remain weak face closure; a national apprenticeship and placement exchange that will be integrated with campuses; and Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) targets being set for each state. Financing will separate capital spending (buildings, labs, servers) from operational spending (faculty, maintenance, software), with officials indicating a tilt towards results-based grants, wherein funds are released after verification of milestones.As per the internal report accessed by TOI, stronger institutions will support nearby campuses through mentor-mentee clusters, sharing teachers, labs and lesson plans to help lift outcomes quickly. Funding will be tied to performance on learning and placements and not just inputs such as infrastructure. ""Clear goals, clear owners, clear data - that's the approach,"" a senior official with education ministrysaid.To connect education with employment, the National Apprenticeship and Placement Exchange will be integrated with campus ERPs, so employers can post openings and students can apply, track interviews and receive offers on one platform. ""Degrees must connect to jobs. A single exchange stitched into campus ERPs will cut friction for students and recruiters,"" the official added. For international students, a single window will handle visa, FRRO registration and housing to reduce paperwork and make Indian campuses easier to join.","The Centre is preparing a five-year plan for higher education with five main goals.

"Gujarat, Maharashtra fishermen lead in installing space-tech transponders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-maharshtra-fishermen-lead-in-installing-space-tech-transponders/articleshow/124820867.cms,"Representational image

NEW DELHI: Gujarat and Maharashtra have taken the lead among 13 coastal states and Union Territories in installing indigenous transponders, a tracking device guided by space technology, in marine fishing vessels. The devices are being used for transmitting real-time weather alerts and disaster warnings such as cyclones, monitoring, control and surveillance.The effectiveness of the high-tech transponders in saving lives and properties of thousands of fishermen was proved successfully when it guided 686 marine fishing vessels of Tamil Nadu back to safe harbour during two well-marked low-pressure systems early this week.Disaster management authorities are now confident of saving lives of fishermen during any future cyclonic events, including the upcoming one - cyclone named 'Montha' - that is predicted to hit Andhra Pradesh coast on Oct 28. Its first successful test-case in a limited way was, however, in Odisha where the alerts sent through the transponders had saved the lives of many fishermen who were out in the high seas during Cyclone Dana in Oct last year.More than 41,700 transponders have been installed in marine vessels across all coastal states/UTs ever since the installation began in Aug last year with Gujarat installing the highest number at 15,486 followed by Maharashtra (8,773), Tamil Nadu (3,884), Karnataka (3,773), Andhra Pradesh (3,490), Odisha (1,707) and Kerala (1,551) as on Oct 24. Govt is supplying these devices free of cost to the fishermen with a 60: 40 funding pattern between Centre and states, and 100% central share for UTs.""The transponders, developed by ISRO using its vessel communication and support system (VCSS) and operationalised by NewSpace India Ltd, are also quite critical from a security point of view as they can track routes of fishing vessels, enabling fishermen to understand the limits of legal fishing areas clearly. In case of any suspicious activities, the security agencies will be able to inspect the vessels,"" said an official.It's a two-way communication system enabling fishermen to send short messages using their phone while fishing up to 200 nautical miles from the coast covering entire Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In case the fishermen cross Maritime Boundary Line, alerts are sent to avoid unintentional transgression. Information related to Potential Fishing Zones is also made available on their mobiles.A national fisheries application named as 'Nabhmitra' is being used to push real-time, targeted advisories and mass alerts directly to vessels equipped with transponders. It has been designed to provide access to all features in the regional languages. It also has efficient harbour management tools like a token system for entry and exit of fishing vessels for voyages enabling the boat owner to enter crew and vessel details.""In view to establish traceability of fish catch, which is essential for compliance to international guidelines of 'illegal, unreported and unregulated’ (IUU) fishing, provisions for entry with geolocation are also being made,"" said the officialCurrently, a few EU nations, China, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, South Africa and Chile are using such high-tech transponders on fishing vessels to enhance safety, improve monitoring, and combat illegal fishing.“The successful use of indigenous transponders during the recent twin low-pressure systems stands as a shining example of how India’s technological ingenuity can directly safeguard lives at sea. By blending space-based innovation with grassroots connectivity, the VCSS has transformed how coastal safety is managed-turning real-time data into decisive action,” said the official.","Gujarat and Maharashtra have taken the lead among 13 coastal states and Union Territories in installing indigenous transponders in marine fishing vessels.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

CHANDIGARH: Justice Surya Kant, the most senior Supreme Court judge, is poised to assume the office of Chief Justice of India (CJI) next month. Few are aware of the extraordinary journey that brought him to the nation's highest judicial position.Unlike many who come from families with strong legal background, Justice Kant's journey began in Petwar - a nondescript village in Haryana's Hisar. He grew up far from privileges often associated with corridors of power. The first time he saw a city was when he travelled to Hansi, a small town in Hisar, for his Class X board exam.Until Class VIII, he studied in a village school that had no benches. As a student, he shared everyday responsibilities of rural life - working in fields during his spare time to support his family like any other rural boy. His father was a teacher.On formal confirmation, he will be the first Haryanvi to become CJI. He is expected to take over as 53rd Chief Justice of India on Nov 24, and slated to serve until Feb 9, 2027.Those who have worked closely with him describe Justice Kant as a jurist of deep learning and measured wisdom, admired for his balanced judgments and unwavering commitment to justice. Having served for over 14 years in Punjab and Haryana HC before his elevation as Himachal Pradesh HC Chief Justice and later as SC judge, he has consistently demonstrated a keen sensitivity toward matters concerning protection of public resources, land acquisition and compensation, victims' rights, reservation policies, and broader balance of constitutional principles.Sometime ago, while visiting his alma mater, Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak, Justice Kant spoke about his early life and modest beginnings. Electricity was a rarity in Petwar, he recalled and fondly remembered studying at night with friends, huddled under dim lamps, driven by hope of securing a govt job - a goal, he said, inspired him to persevere through every hardship.Born on Feb 10, 1962, Justice Kant completed his early education from Petwar and LLB in 1984 from MDU. He started as a lawyer at Hisar district court before moving to Chandigarh to practice at Punjab and Haryana HC.Justice Kant became the youngest advocate general of Haryana at 38. In 2004, aged 42, he was elevated as a judge of Punjab and Haryana HC. Even then, he continued his academic pursuits, securing first-class-first in his master's degree in law in 2011 from Kurukshetra University's directorate of distance education.After serving as HC judge for over 14 years, he was elevated as Himachal Pradesh HC CJ on Oct 5, 2018. On May 24, 2019, he became SC judge.In his 14-year stint as HC judge in Chandigarh, Justice Kant passed several landmark judgments, including right of jail inmates to have conjugal visits or artificial insemination for progeny.He also passed an order in a case where a husband had killed his wife. While punishing the guilty, he noticed the accused had four daughters. He personally spoke with a college principal, requesting free education for the eldest daughter.In Punjab and Haryana HC, he was part of the full bench that ordered sanitisation of Dera Sacha Sauda in 2017 following violence after imprisonment of the Dera chief in rape cases and directed a central probe into financial irregularities inside it. He served as a member of governing body of National Legal Services Authority from 2007 to 2011. In SC, he was part of benches that passed several landmark judgments.As CJ of Himachal Pradesh HC, he focused on administrative reforms and improving judicial efficiency. He reaffirmed access to basic amenities constituted an integral part of the fundamental right to life enshrined in the Constitution.",Justice Surya Kant is the most senior Supreme Court judge. He is expected to take over as 53rd Chief Justice of India on Nov 24. He will be the first Haryanvi to become CJI.

In Khagariya, Amit Shah Frames Bihar Poll As Choice Between NDA's Five Pandavas And RJD's Jungle Raj

PATNA: Union home minister and top BJP campaigner Amit Shah Saturday urged voters in Khagaria to ensure that Bihar remains free from lawlessness and emerges a developed state.""I pray to Chhathi Maiya that our Bihar always remain free from jungle raj, that law and order stay strong, our sisters and daughters remain safe, and Bihar becomes a developed state in the years ahead,"" he said. Chhath, which begins today, is a revered festival in Bihar and eastern UP.Shah, who also addressed rallies in Munger and Nalanda, said, ""This electoral fight is not to make someone an MLA, a minister, or CM. This election will decide whether to bring back jungle raj or usher in an era of development. Tell me - do you want kidnapping, extortion, murder, ransom, abduction, jungle raj?""Shah said if NDA returns to power, the next Bihar assembly elections will be held in a single phase. ""Elections in Bihar had once required multiple phases because of security concerns during the regime of RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi,"" he added.Referring to Nalanda's historic legacy, he said PM Modi had ""revived the cultural and academic heritage of Nalanda by rebuilding the world-famous Nalanda University, which was destroyed by Bakhtiyar Khilji in the 12th century"".In Nalanda, Shah said, ""This is the NDA govt now. Even if 100 Bakhtiyar Khiljis come, no one can touch Nalanda University.PM Modi has pledged to ensure both development and heritage. A new era of AI and data science is about to begin in Bihar. Many new factories and agro-processing industries are being set up, which will raise farmers' income and accelerate industrial growth.""Taking a swipe at RJD neta Tejashwi Yadav, he said, ""Tejashwi is talking about murder, robbery, and ransom in Bihar. This is like 'the cat going to Hajj after eating hundreds of rats'. In the last 20 years, murder cases have declined by 20% compared to 2005, robbery and ransom cases have fallen by 80%, and not a single heinous massacre has taken place under the Nitish govt. During Lalu's rule, murder, robbery, ransom, kidnapping and massacres were a daily occurrence. Lalu drove away industries, made Bihar a backward state.""Appealing for a landslide mandate, Shah said voters should ""strengthen the hands"" of Nitish Kumar and Narendra Modi . ""NDA has ensured education in schools and colleges, timely medication, irrigation in fields, and tap drinking water supply to every household. The number of teachers has increased from 2 lakh to 6 lakh. The education budget has gone up 18-fold, the number of engineering colleges has risen 19-fold, and engineering seats have increased 31-fold. Literacy rate has reached 80% and clean drinking water is available in 96% of households. ""He accused INDIA bloc of ""snatching jobs from youth by promoting cross-border infiltrations"". ""Rahul Gandhi can hold as many 'Save the Infiltrators' rallies as he wants, but he will not be able to save them.""","Shah: ""This election will decide whether to bring back jungle raj or usher in an era of development"" He said if NDA returns to power, the next Bihar assembly elections will be held in a single phase.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has said that judges yielding to intimidation or pressure from lawyers and recusing themselves from cases only fuels ""browbeating, forum shopping, and attempts to influence the bench"".Justice Niral Mehta made the remark while quashing two recusals by Ahmedabad benches of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and two subsequent transfer orders by NCLT president in New Delhi that shifted a high-stakes corporate dispute to Mumbai.The case involved ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Ltd (AM/NS) and a few creditors of Essar Steel India Ltd, whose resolution plan was approved in 2019. Lawyers representing the creditors allegedly pressured NCLT Ahmedabad-1 to move the matter. On Jan 9, 2024, that bench recused itself.

GBMES will provide round-the-clock electronic intelligence of enemy emitters. HMVs, in turn, will significantly improve logistical support in diverse geographical terrains,” the official said.Apart from LPDs, the Navy will also get 30mm surface guns at a cost of Rs 1,200 crore for low-intensity maritime operations and anti-piracy roles; advanced light-weight torpedoes for anti-submarine warfare; electro-optical infra-red search and track systems; and smart ammunition for 76mm super rapid gun mounts on warships.","The biggest project to get the “acceptance of necessity’ (AoN) was for the construction of four large amphibious warfare ships or “landing platform docks (LPDs) Another mega project to be cleared was the acquisition of a large number of surface-to-air missiles -- with ranges of 120, 200, 250 and 380-km -- for the S-400 Triumf air defence systems.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124770554,imgsize-717429,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
Louvre museum heist: Detectives suspect inside job after chainsaw thieves steal $100 million crown jewels — Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/louvre-museum-heist-detectives-suspect-inside-job-after-chainsaw-thieves-steal-100-million-crown-jewels/articleshow/124820951.cms,"Louvre Robbed, Then THIS: France Stunned as Maison des Lumières Museum Looted in Back-to-Back Heists





In a twist to the Louvre museum robbery case, investigators have uncovered new lead that no one saw coming.French detectives now believe the jaw-dropping $100 million robbery of the nation’s crown jewels may have been an inside job — with digital evidence linking one of the museum’s own security guards to the chainsaw-wielding thieves.According to The Telegraph, the guard allegedly passed on sensitive details about the museum’s security setup, giving the robbers the perfect blueprint for their audacious daylight raid on October 19.Digital forensic evidence showed a member of security at the Louvre was in contact with individuals thought to be the perpetrators prior to the brazen daylight robbery on Oct 19, the Telegraph reported Saturday.“There is digital forensic evidence that shows there was co-operation with one of the museum’s security guards and the thieves,” a source told the Telegraph.“Sensitive information was passed on about the museum’s security, which is how they were aware of the breach.”The daring thieves were able to get in and out of the museum in mere minutes using a second-floor balcony that was not recorded by security cameras and made off on scooters with eight pieces of France’s crown jewels.Though investigators are apparently closing in on the burglars, they are not optimistic about recovering the jewels, which have likely been broken up for sale, that outlet reported.A wealthy collector could be responsible for orchestrating the entire operation, one Parisian prosecutor claimed.“We’re looking at the hypothesis of organised crime,” Laure Beccuau told BFM TV, adding that the group could be professional criminals commissioned by a scheming collector.Just hours after the massive heist, 2,000 gold and silver coins—worth more than $100,000, were swiped from the sieve-like museum.The Louvre’s director, Laurence des Cars, was called in front of the French Senate on Saturday where she offered her resignation.In the wake of the shocking robbery, the most precious national jewels stored at the Louvre were transferred to the Bank of France.The loot that was stolen included a sapphire diadem, necklace and a single earring from a set linked to 19th-century Queens Marie-Amelie and Hortense.Heisters also absconded with an emerald necklace and earrings tied to Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife.Empress Eugenie’s diamond diadem and her corsage-bow brooch were also boosted. Eugenie’s emerald-set imperial crown, which contains more than 1,300 diamonds, was later found outside the museum in a damaged, but recoverable, state.","Digital evidence links one of the museum's own security guards to the thieves.

Industry reactions





Several major US employers have paused or limited the sponsorship for H-1B visas after the Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee for new applications.The fee, aimed at new applicants, does not affect current visa holders or renewals.The administration said that the reform is intended to attract highly skilled foreign workers while preventing misuse of the programme to undercut American wages. However, critics argue the fee could deter companies from hiring international talent and reduce America’s competitiveness in technology and innovation, Newsweek reported.The US chamber of commerce has filed a lawsuit challenging the fee, describing it as “cost-prohibitive for US employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses.”The fee applies only to applicants outside the United States who do not hold a valid visa. Current H-1B holders, renewals, and those changing visa types, such as moving from an F-1 student visa to H-1B, are exempted.Mark Koestler, US head of business immigration at law firm HSF Kramer, told Newsweek, “In simple terms, the super fee will not apply to individuals in the United States in valid status (as long as the H-1B filing for them requests a change of status, extension of status, or amendment).”“It will, however, apply to those who are outside the United States without a valid, current US immigration status,” the agency further cited.Some firms, like Nvidia, will continue sponsoring H-1B applicants. CEO Jensen Huang confirmed in a memo that the company will “continue to sponsor H-1B applicants and cover all associated fees.”Neil Bradley, executive vice president at the US chamber of commerce, told Newsweek, “The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for US employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the US.”Immigration attorney Divij Kishore also warned, “Over time, this policy could narrow the diversity and skill depth of the US workforce. Companies will hire fewer foreign professionals and shift more high-value work abroad, leaving fewer opportunities for knowledge transfer within the US.""Kishore further told Newsweek that the move risks creating a workforce that is less globally integrated and ""less equipped to compete in emerging technologies where international collaboration has always been America’s edge.""","Several major US employers have paused or limited the sponsorship for H-1B visas after the Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee for new applications.

Read full Letter from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella

“Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:

Fifty years after our founding, Microsoft is once again at the heart of a generational moment in technology as we find ourselves in the midst of the AI platform shift. More than any transformation before it, this generation of AI is radically changing every layer of the tech stack, and we are changing with it.

Across the company, we are accelerating our pace of innovation and adapting to both a new tech stack and a new way of working. We are delivering our current platforms at scale while building the next generation, always striving to create more value for our customers, our partners, and the world.

Striking this balance is hard work, and few companies over the years have been able to do it. To succeed, we must continue to think in decades but execute in quarters, approaching each day with the humility and curiosity required to continuously improve, while being guided by our bold vision for the future.

Financially, it was a year of record performance. Revenue was $281.7 billion, up 15 percent. Operating income grew 17 percent to $128.5 billion. And Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue for the first time, up 34 percent. These results reflect the growing demand for our platform and the trust customers are placing in us. We take neither for granted.

We must earn our permission to operate every day, in every country, every community, and every customer interaction. That's why we remain grounded in our mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

Imagine a world where every person can get help from a researcher, a coder, or an analyst on demand. Not just information, but deep, contextual expertise paired with action. Or where every organization, no matter its size or sector, can reinvent employee experiences, reimagine customer engagement, reshape business processes, and bend the curve on innovation for their people, businesses, and industries. This is the new frontier and how we will unlock the next level of productivity and growth for the world.

But it is not some far off vision—we are already seeing what's possible when AI reaches the frontlines of human potential, helping small businesses become more productive, multinationals more competitive, nonprofits more effective, governments more efficient, and improving healthcare and education outcomes.

To share just a few examples across industries: Mercy, one of the largest health systems in the US, has saved caregivers over 100,000 hours by automatically documenting physician-patient encounters. As one physician put it: ""the best thing to happen to my practice in 10 years."" A grandmother in Japan, who lost her hearing at age two, can now communicate with her voice, thanks to an AI app. A judge in Colombia is using Copilot to expedite due process and help tackle a backlog of court cases. Barclays Bank is putting AI in the hands of 100,000 employees, transforming the employee experience by simplifying how they access information and get things done. Ralph Lauren is helping customers find the perfect look for any occasion, thanks to a new conversational shopping experience. Carvana has reduced inbound calls per sale by 45 percent, freeing its staff to focus on complex, high-value support.

These examples, and so many others like them, are made possible by our clear focus on our priorities, our responsibility, and our culture.

OUR PRIORITIES

To deliver on our mission, we remain focused on three core business priorities as our North Star: security, quality, and AI innovation.

Security and quality are non-negotiable. Our infrastructure and services are mission critical for the world. This year, we made significant progress across both our Secure Future Initiative (SFI) and Quality Excellence Initiative (QEI), but we recognize our work here is never done. We must continuously raise the bar for ourselves and our customers.

Security

Through SFI, we have dedicated the equivalent of 34,000 full-time engineers to our highest-priority security work. We strengthened identity protections, secured our networks and systems, enhanced threat detection and response, and embedded security-by-design practices across everything we build.

Quality

With QEI, we created frameworks that increase accountability and accelerate progress against our engineering objectives to ensure we deliver durable, high quality-experiences at global scale. This includes improvements to change management, incident management, platform resiliency, and service health.

Together, these initiatives are laying the foundation for a renaissance of our engineering culture, where we build planet-scale systems that power the world, with the security and quality they require.

AI innovation

At the same time, we have made major advances in AI innovation, including across two foundational areas: our Cloud and AI infrastructure, and our family of Copilots and agents.

Our Cloud and AI infrastructure

We continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave. We opened new datacenters across six continents and now operate more than 400 datacenters in 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. This year alone, we added over two gigawatts of new capacity. Every Azure region is now AI-first and can support liquid cooling, increasing the fungibility and the flexibility of our fleet. And just last month, we announced the world's most powerful AI datacenter, Fairwater in southeastern Wisconsin, which will deliver 10x the performance of the world's fastest supercomputer today.

We are also driving and benefiting from compounding improvements in silicon, systems, and models to improve performance and efficiency. And we continue to invest in sovereign cloud offerings to meet the unique data residency needs of governments and industries worldwide.

We have made meaningful progress on the next frontier in cloud systems: quantum. We announced Majorana-1, the first quantum chip with a topological core, and announced the world's first operational deployment of a Level 2 quantum computer in partnership with Atom Computing.

In data and analytics, Microsoft Fabric is becoming the unified platform for the AI era. It is now our fastest-growing analytics product ever, with 25,000 paid customers. OneLake spans all databases and clouds, including Power BI semantic models, making it the best foundation for building enterprise AI applications.

We also introduced Azure AI Foundry, a platform to design, customize, and run powerful AI apps and agents. Foundry includes access to more than 11,000 models from partners like OpenAI, Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and others, ensuring our customers can choose from the best frontier and open models in one place. Already, 80 percent of the Fortune 500 use Foundry for their AI workloads.

And this fall we introduced our first two in-house models: MAI-Voice-1, a super-efficient natural voice generation model that can generate a minute of audio in less than a second on a single GPU, as well as MAI-1 preview, our first foundation model trained end-to-end in-house.

Copilots and agents

Our Copilot family of products is helping people thrive at home, at school, and at work. This year, we surpassed 100 million monthly active users across both commercial and consumer.

We rolled out a major update to Microsoft 365 Copilot this spring, bringing together chat, search, create, notebooks, and role-specific agents like Analyst and Researcher into a single experience. And earlier this month, we announced Agent Mode, which allows you to start with a simple prompt and then work iteratively with Copilot—steering it as it orchestrates multistep tasks to deliver high-quality Office documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

Give Copilot a prompt like, ""Run a full analysis on this sales data set. I want to understand some important insights to help me make decisions about my business. Make it visual."" Agent Mode gets to work deciding which formulas to use, producing new sheets, and creating data visualizations. It's pretty remarkable.

Copilot Studio continues to grow as well, with more than 230,000 organizations using it to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot or to build their own agents using no-code/low-code tools.

In software development, GitHub Copilot now has more than 20 million users and has evolved into a peer programmer, capable of executing tasks on our behalf asynchronously. In healthcare, Dragon Copilot is being used to document millions of clinical encounters, saving precious time that healthcare providers can spend on patients, not paperwork. And in security, we were the first in the industry to introduce AI agents that help defenders autonomously manage high-volume security and IT tasks.

On the consumer front, Copilot is now integrated across Bing, Edge, GroupMe, MSN,

Windows

, and

Xbox

. We also refreshed our Copilot consumer app this year as a more natural, conversational, and personal AI companion. One highlight is Copilot Mode in Edge, which lets you chat directly with your open tabs.

More broadly, we continue to expand our reach with consumers. LinkedIn is now home to 1.2 billion members, and we are bringing AI agents into the core workflows of sales, hiring, and learning. And across gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY

At Microsoft, we have always believed that we do well when the world around us does well. We demonstrate this, year after year, by making progress on our commitments to create technology that benefits everyone on the planet, along with the planet itself.

This means that as we drive the AI economy, we are also providing the skills and opportunities for everyone to participate in it. That's why we launched Microsoft Elevate this year, an initiative that unites our technology, skills, research, and philanthropic investments, so AI can benefit every classroom, community, and cause. Over the next five years, we will invest $4 billion in cash and AI cloud technology to schools, community and technical colleges, and nonprofit organizations. And we will partner with organizations like UNICEF, Code.org, and more to extend AI skilling opportunities to people around the globe.

Our skilling initiatives will help 20 million people earn AI credentials over the next two years, from foundational fluency to advanced technical training. And to support our work with deeper research and policy insights, our new AI Economy Institute will explore how AI is reshaping education and work, helping us bridge the gap between technological innovation and societal impact.

We are also focused on empowering teachers and students with the latest AI tools, making Microsoft 365 Copilot Personal free for 12 months for every college student in the United States. And we're introducing new LinkedIn courses for teachers and students, enabling them to earn LinkedIn certifications that will help boost their resumes and open doors.

Across all of this, one thing is clear: People want technology they can trust. That's why we are committed to driving responsible AI innovation and building safe and secure technology. As we do, we are guided by our values of respect, integrity, and accountability. They are built into the design of our software and services, the security of our data, our privacy protections, and our engagement with employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and governments around the world.

As a multinational company, we remain dedicated to creating jobs, promoting economic opportunities, and strengthening cybersecurity, digital stability, sovereignty, and resilience globally. In Europe, we announced five commitments to strengthen digital stability this year. They start with an expansion of our cloud and AI infrastructure, so every country can compete in the global economy. And they include a promise to uphold Europe's digital resilience regardless of geopolitical and trade volatility.

Responsible business practices are embedded across our operations and supply chain. Following the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we've strengthened our due diligence processes, expanded stakeholder engagement, and launched new governance mechanisms to ensure accountability. Our second annual Responsible AI Transparency Report highlighted our work to build and deploy AI responsibly. This includes developing new AI tools and resources to help our customers innovate within evolving regulatory requirements.

Another key component of earning trust is contributing to a safer online ecosystem, including protecting those who use our services from illegal and harmful content and conduct. We continue to take new steps to advance safety, especially for children, while balancing our commitments to free expression and privacy. Over the past year, we've focused on addressing risks related to abusive AI-generated content and partnered with StopNCII.org to detect victim-reported imagery in Bing.

Our solutions, partnerships, and programs reach people and organizations of all abilities to help them thrive. More than 5 million people have participated in our AI Skilling programs focused on accessibility. We launched new technology to help people with disabilities play, work, and live—through an Adaptive Joystick for Xbox, sign language detection in Teams, low-vision keyboards for Surface, and AI-powered visual descriptions in Windows.

2025 also marked the midpoint in our journey to become a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company, and to protect more land than we use. We are on track to meet many of our targets and continue to accelerate progress for others.

Our renewable energy procurement increased from 1.8 GW in 2020 to 34 GW in 2024, and we contracted nearly 30 million metric tons of carbon removal—playing a pivotal role in scaling the carbon removal market. We provided more than 1.5 million people with clean water and sanitation and plan to replenish more than 100 million cubic meters of water around the world. We are getting closer to zero waste through new Circular Centers, which contribute to the reuse and recycling of nearly 91 percent of servers and components decommissioned from our datacenters. And we've reached nearly 95 percent recyclability in our product packaging.

We are learning how to make AI more sustainable by design and improve AI-powered solutions. Platforms like our Planetary Computer and our AI for Good Lab are helping us find new ways to address the world's most pressing challenges.

Making progress on these commitments takes time. But here, too—we are guided by a bold vision, thinking in decades and executing in quarters.

OUR CULTURE

Amid this rapid progress, our culture is more important than ever. The AI platform shift is reshaping not just our products and business models, but how we work.

Our growth mindset is essential to our ability to continue leading this AI era. It enables us to innovate both within Microsoft and with those we serve. We must be learn-it-alls, willing to experiment, guided by evaluations, and committed to continuous improvement. I am continually impressed by how our people do just that.

We are focused on being Customer Zero, applying AI to reduce toil and improve flow in our own work while creating a playbook we can share with the world.

We're also embracing a new way of working—one that expands job scopes, reduces handoffs, and gives teams tools to scale productivity in nonlinear ways. This isn't just about driving efficiency. It's about empowering our people to dream bigger and get to ""job complete"" faster, with less friction and greater impact than ever before.

Our employees also continue to find ways to bring their purpose and passion to the causes and communities they care deeply about. This year, they volunteered over 1.2 million hours and gave $263 million (including company match) to 37,000 nonprofit organizations in 110 countries.

In July, after we reported our earnings results—including surpassing $75 billion in annual Azure revenue for the first time—I shared a reflection with all employees. Fifteen years ago, when we set out on our cloud journey, we had a bold vision, and we persisted through all the ups and downs.

I asked our team: What are you working on today that, 15 years from now, you will look back on and say, ""we got it right""? Hundreds of answers poured in spanning near-term priorities and long-term ambitions alike:

""Helping the world be safe from cybercrime"" ""Speech is now a standard human-machine interface"" ""Using AI to improve the lived experience for people with disabilities"" ""We changed the way people learn"" ""Access to millions of agents powered by orders of magnitude larger models"" ""Medical knowledge has become ambient, embedded in clinical workflows""

""We helped billions become skilled in AI""

These responses and so many others reflected a deep sense of purpose and belief in what's possible. And that is precisely what is needed for us to succeed. Microsoft has an immense opportunity and responsibility—not just in building these futures, but in helping shape the world's future. And I'm confident that together, we can continue to think in decades and execute in quarters on this journey to empower us all.

From STEM-focused to problem-finding roles, Cognizant’s approach to hiring graduates









Cognizant is ramping up entry-level hiring as artificial intelligence reshapes the workforce, with CEO Ravi Kumar S telling Fortune the company is bringing on more school graduates this year than ever before—and he's looking beyond traditional tech majors to liberal arts colleges and community colleges.Kumar's unconventional hiring strategy stems from his belief that AI will widen the base of corporate employment rather than shrink it. ""I can take a school graduate and give them the tooling so they can actually punch above their weight,"" he told Fortune. ""AI is an amplifier of human potential. It's not a displacement strategy.""The CEO of the 350,000-employee IT consulting firm is actively recruiting non-STEM graduates, including anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and journalists. His rationale: as expertise becomes accessible at everyone's fingertips through AI, specialisation loses its premium. ""Intelligence is not the asymmetry. Applying intelligence is the asymmetry,"" Kumar explained.He urged students to ""start to focus on interdisciplinary skills,"" citing examples like historians blending computational skills to become futurists or biology majors using AI to crack drug development cycles.According to Kumar, the corporate pyramid is becoming ""broader and shorter,"" with faster paths to expertise for those who can leverage AI tools effectively.Kumar sees AI handling the ""middle"" work—the execution and problem-solving—while humans focus on the beginning (prompting, conceptualising, finding purposeful problems) and the end (validation and verification). This shift means companies need more ""problem finders"" rather than just problem solvers, opening doors for disciplines traditionally outside tech's core.The shift extends beyond hiring. Cognizant has launched apprenticeship programs in 30 states and partnered with Merit America for mid-career shifts, offering a ""work, earn and learn"" model. Kumar acknowledges a critical caveat: AI's benefits must be ""distributed equitably"" rather than concentrated among a few to truly boost productivity and create wage distribution.""As people are living longer, the life of their skills is getting shorter,"" Kumar noted, emphasising that future workers will need multiple careers in one lifetime—making adaptable, interdisciplinary skills more valuable than narrow expertise.","Cognizant is hiring more school graduates this year than ever before.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky expressed interest in integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the travel platform but noted that the technology isn’t yet up to par. Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” recently, Chesky said the current software development kit “wasn’t quite robust enough for the things we want to do. ” Said to be a close friend of OpenAI founder Sam Altman , Chesky added that Airbnb would “probably” incorporate ChatGPT in the future.Airbnb already leverages 13 AI models, including those from OpenAI and Google, to power its service bot. However, Brian Chesky’s remarks underscored a growing trend: open-source AI models, which developers can customize, are gaining ground against proprietary systems like OpenAI’s. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and DeepSeek are driving this shift, releasing advanced, cost-effective open-source AI systems. At Alibaba’s recent Apsara conference, the company reported hosting over 300 open-source AI models, supporting more than 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem.Alibaba’s Qwen 3 series, launched in May, supports over 100 languages, earning praise for its natural multilingual capabilities. In a report by South China Morning Post, Nicolas de Cameret, founder of BotBot Robotics, called Qwen’s models the best for such applications.Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai argued that AI success hinges on rapid adoption, not just building the most powerful models.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students.

Justin Trudeau dating Katy Perry: Where is his ex-wife Sophie?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/justin-trudeau-dating-katy-perry-where-is-his-ex-wife-sophie/articleshow/124821950.cms,"Katy Perry Confirms Justin Trudeau Romance? ‘48 Hours Ago’ Comment Stuns Fans

The Life After “Sunny Ways”





The Rise of Roar and Order





The Sophie Question





The Optics of Affection





The Liberal Love Arc









There’s an old rule in politics: you can lose an election, but never lose the plot. Justin Trudeau , the man who once embodied Canada’s moral optimism and salon-ready hair, seems to have followed that advice with evangelical zeal. While Canada debates the price of maple syrup and the future of liberalism, the former prime minister is busy trending for something far more cinematic—his rumoured romance with Katy Perry Yes, that Katy Perry, the pop deity who once sang “I Kissed a Girl” and made an entire generation of millennials question their playlists and sexuality. In a twist that sounds like it was storyboarded by Netflix’s marketing team, she’s apparently been welcomed into the Trudeau household with open arms. His kids, the tabloids coo, are “smitten.” The insiders murmur that Justin is “serious.” The headlines scream “wedding bells. ”But before we cue the fireworks and champagne, there’s an obvious ghost at this glossy banquet: Sophie Grégoire Trudeau.Sophie Grégoire wasn’t just Justin’s partner in photo-ops; she was his emotional translator, the one who made the Trudeau brand human. A former TV presenter with a yoga-teacher calm and a charisma that could sell both self-care and social reform, she stood beside him through the selfie years, the scandals, and the slow-motion implosion of Canada’s liberal fairy tale.When they announced their separation in August 2023, the statement was painfully Canadian in its politeness: “After many meaningful and difficult conversations, we have made the decision to separate.” No vitriol, no tell-all memoir, no courtroom drama—just the quiet unravelling of a modern marriage conducted under fluorescent political light.Since then, Sophie has retreated from the paparazzi and leaned into purpose. She published a wellness-themed book, Closer Together, in 2024, half memoir and half meditation on mindfulness, and became a sought-after speaker on empathy and mental health. In short, while Justin’s life turned into an internet soap opera, Sophie quietly reinvented herself as the kind of grounded, post-marital heroine Oprah would applaud.Her most recent social media post captures that evolution perfectly. “Real love isn’t about carrying it all. It’s about learning when to give, when to receive, and when to simply be,” she wrote, in a caption that reads more like a closing chapter than a cryptic comment. “Reciprocity means allowing space for both people to grow, to rest, to rediscover themselves within the relationship. Because love that breathes is love that lasts. ” It’s the sort of message that could only come from someone who has made peace with both endings and beginnings.Meanwhile, Justin’s post-political evolution has been less meditative and more MTV Unplugged. Enter Katy Perry: global superstar, part-time activist, and full-time headline magnet. The two were reportedly first seen together in Montreal this summer, later photographed on a California yacht, laughing, cuddling, and giving the internet enough serotonin to last three news cycles.“Justin loves how easily Katy fits in with the family,” said one insider, presumably between spin classes. “His kids adore her.” Another claimed he’s “serious about building something lasting.” The narrative practically writes itself: the widowed prince of progressivism finds solace in the queen of empowerment pop.It’s hard to ignore the political irony. Trudeau, once roasted for being too performative, has now become the star of his own romantic reboot. The man who apologised for blackface, bad pipelines, and budget overruns is finally living in technicolour, and the world can’t look away.So, what did happen to Sophie? The answer, it turns out, is refreshingly normal. She’s thriving—privately. Her social media remains measured and warm, filled with reflections on love, self-worth, and balance. Friends describe her as “at peace.” There’s no bitterness, no back-channel sniping, no quiet PR war.In a culture that monetises every breakup, Sophie’s restraint feels almost radical. She isn’t auditioning for relevance or competing with Perry’s glitter. She’s doing what many political spouses dream of but rarely achieve: reclaiming her narrative.Her latest Instagram post, now viral for its understated grace, seems to say it all: love isn’t ownership; it’s space. A philosophy that, in retrospect, might be the most sophisticated response to her ex-husband’s new chapter.Still, the Perry-Trudeau affair raises a few questions. Not moral ones, but cinematic ones. How does a former world leader date a pop star without turning it into a trailer? What happens when diplomacy meets choreography? Does she serenade him with “Unconditionally” before bedtime? Does he counter with an apology drafted in both English and French?It’s hard not to see the symbolism. Trudeau’s political brand was always part rock concert, part sermon. Perry’s music, too, thrives on idealism and spectacle. Together, they’re a duet of self-reinvention, two brands trying to age gracefully in a world that devours sincerity.And yet, there’s something deeply human here. Two middle-aged public figures, both famous for their performance of authenticity, may have finally stumbled onto the real thing. Perry, who has weathered the exhaustion of pop fame and the chaos of past relationships, reportedly finds Trudeau “grounding.” He, in turn, finds her “vital.”Maybe that’s all it is: two people meeting at the intersection of burnout and belief, trying to write a new story away from the noise.As for Sophie Grégoire, she’s no longer part of that story, but she’s certainly no footnote. If anything, she’s proof that grace after heartbreak is the rarest form of charisma.So what happened to Trudeau’s ex-wife?She moved on—quietly, intelligently, and without hashtags.And that, in the age of yacht selfies and engagement rumours, might just be the most Canadian ending of all.","Sophie Grégoire Trudeau and Justin Trudeau announced their separation in August 2023.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Trump’s FULL Air Force 1 Presser: ‘Love China’s Help’: US Pres. On Putin, Canada, ‘Nuclear’ N. Korea





US President Donald Trump left Friday for Asia and high-stakes trade talks with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping -- adding that he would also like to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on his trip.The US said it held ""very constructive"" discussions with China after the first day of trade negotiations as Chinese and American officials met in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday for a new round of talks.A spokesperson for the US Treasury gave a brief description of the exchange and said it will resume Sunday, without elaborating. The Chinese delegation made no public remarks after the 5.5-hour-long meeting at Merdeka 118, the world's second-tallest building. Vice Premier He Lifeng led the Chinese side and was joined by trade representative Li Chenggang and vice finance minister Liao Min. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent headed the US team.During his Asia visit, Trump will look for deals that will help unlock the region's resources to create more reliable supply chains for industries, contribute to global growth and secure more investments in the US, according to officials who briefed reporters Friday before the president's departure.But they did not offer any specifics.Malaysia is in discussion for a potential critical minerals deal with the US, investment, trade and industry minister Zafrul Aziz said on Saturday.Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One Friday that he and Xi have ""a lot of things to discuss"".

'Not bulletproof': FATF warns Pakistan against terror funding; greylist exit does not shield from scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/not-bulletproof-fatf-warns-pakistan-against-terror-funding-greylist-exit-does-not-shield-from-scrutiny/articleshow/124798444.cms,"FATF Issues Warning to Pakistan on Greylist Exit, Says Islamabad Still Vulnerable To Terror Funding

Terror funding for attacks in India









The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Saturday cautioned Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo in a press briefing said, “Any country that is on the greylist or has exited it is not bulletproof against criminal actions, whether by money launderers or terrorists. We invite all jurisdictions, including those who have been delisted, to continue their good work to prevent and deter crimes.”Madrazo emphasised that all countries, including those recently delisted, must continue tightening safeguards against illicit financial activities. Her remarks come amid reports that Pakistan-based terror groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammad, have been using digital wallets and crypto channels to fund terror operations while masking financial flows.While Pakistan met key compliance benchmarks to exit the FATF greylist, it remains under follow-up by the Asia Pacific Group (APG), as the country is not a FATF member. The follow-up ensures Islamabad continues aligning with FATF’s global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terror financing (CTF) standards.The greylist, formally known as the list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, identifies countries with “strategic deficiencies” in curbing financial crimes and terror funding. India’s National Risk Assessment 2022 has highlighted Pakistan as a high-risk source of terror financing, citing persistent threats despite formal FATF compliance. A recent FATF report also noted rising instances of state-sponsored terrorism and flagged Pakistan’s National Development Complex as a proliferation risk in South Asia.In July this year, the global terror funding watchdog reported that explosives used in terrorist attacks in India were procured through e-commerce platforms. The revelation came in connection with attacks in Pulwama and at the Gorakhnath temple in Uttar Pradesh.Digital platforms, including social media, messaging apps, and crowdfunding sites, are increasingly being exploited for terror financing. Reported forms of support range from direct financial contributions to logistical or material assistance, as well as the provision of training.The Pulwama attack in 2019, planned and carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed, saw transfer of large quantities of explosives in the country. A massive amount of the components used in the explosive devices used in the attack was acquired via electronic commerce platforms.The agency also said that the Pahalgam terror attack also could not have taken place without financial backing and without any route to transfer funds between terrorists and supporters.The FATF wrapped up its fourth plenary session in Paris under Madrazo’s presidency, attended by delegates from over 200 jurisdictions. The session approved the first mutual assessments under FATF’s new risk-based framework and removed Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa from the greylist after completion of their action plans.Reaffirming FATF’s global mission, Madrazo said, “FATF remains committed to strengthening standards and ensuring implementation so we can protect people by reducing terrorist financing worldwide.”","FATF warns Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.

Tomato prices in Pakistan surge over 400%: What’s driving the spike? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/tomato-prices-in-pakistan-surge-over-400-whats-driving-the-spike-explained/articleshow/124776793.cms,"AI image for representational purpose

'World Has Not Forgotten': India Blasts Pakistan’s Double Game on Terror at UN, Reminds Of Pahalgam

Why tomato prices are spiking





Impact of past trade trends





Why the border is closed





What this means for Pakistanis









Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram, following the closure of border crossings with Afghanistan.The move comes after clashes erupted between the two neighbours earlier this month, marking the worst fighting along their shared frontier since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.The closure of all trade and transit routes since October 11 has created severe shortages of fresh produce, grains, dairy, and other essentials. Khan Jan Alokozay, head of the Pak-Afghan Chamber of Commerce in Kabul, told Reuters, “With each passing day, both sides are losing around $1 million.”Tomatoes, a staple in Pakistani kitchens, have been particularly affected. About 500 containers of vegetables meant for export are spoiling daily due to the blockade, Alokozay said. In total, around 5,000 containers are stranded on both sides of the border, according to a Pakistani official at the Torkham crossing in northwest Pakistan. The official added that apples and grapes, largely imported from Afghanistan, are also in short supply.The disruption comes at a critical time when fresh produce from Afghanistan and northern Pakistan would normally enter local markets. The blockade has severed a trade route that contributes significantly to the $2.3 billion annual trade volume between the two countries, which includes fruit, vegetables, minerals, medicine, wheat, rice, sugar, meat, and dairy products.The price surge in tomatoes is also partly linked to longstanding cross-border trade dynamics. According to a PTI report, in 2011, Indian traders capitalised on higher tomato prices in Pakistan, sending trucks laden with produce across the Attari-Wagah border. Truckloads of tomatoes from Delhi and Nashik entered Pakistan daily, pushing up domestic prices in Indian markets. Experts noted that floods in Sindh and other Pakistani producing regions often exacerbate local shortages, further driving up prices.Currently, Pakistani consumers are facing a similar pattern, as reduced local supply coincides with the absence of imports due to the border closure. According to R P Gupta, director of the National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation, key producing regions such as Nashik, Pune, and Ahmadnagar in India usually cater to northern markets during this period. The absence of cross-border supplies intensifies the domestic price pressure in Pakistan.The recent clashes along the 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control militants who attack Pakistan from Afghan territory. The Taliban has denied harbouring such groups. Although a ceasefire brokered in talks hosted by Qatar and Turkey last weekend has largely held, the border remains closed. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for October 25 in Istanbul.Consumers in Pakistan are now paying significantly higher prices for basic staples. The scarcity of tomatoes, apples, and grapes is compounded by perishable stock spoilage, and there is growing concern over rising costs for other essentials. The commerce ministry has not issued a comment on the matter, leaving traders and residents to cope with soaring prices and limited availability.As the border closure continues, analysts warn that the inflationary impact on essential food items may persist, straining household budgets and local markets across Pakistan.","Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram.

Jaish-e-Mohammed Launches Online Jihad Course For Women In Pakistan, Targets Mass Recruitment





Days after Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) announced the formation of its first-ever women’s wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, the group has now launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women, according to media reports.The digital course, namely ‘Tufat al-Muminat’ aims to attract as many women as possible to the outfit’s network. The initiative is being led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of JeM chief Masood Azhar Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed in Operation Sindoor on May 7, when armed forces targeted JeM’s headquarters at Markaz Subhanallah in Bahawalpur.Sources said that Masood Azhar’s sisters, Sadiya and Samaira Azhar, will conduct 40-minute online classes daily, beginning November 8, using meeting platforms to teach women about their “duties” from the perspectives of jihad, religion and Islam.Each participant enrolling in the course is reportedly being asked to pay a donation of PKR 500 and fill out an online form.Intelligence sources indicate that the program is part of JeM’s broader effort to rebuild its base and financing network following significant losses in airstrikes during Operation Sindoor earlier this year.The announcement comes weeks after JeM publicly introduced its women’s brigade on October 8, followed by an event titled ‘Dukhtaran-e-Islam’ held in Rawalakot, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, on October 19 to mobilise women supporters.Security officials say JeM’s decision to involve women marks a major shift in its operational strategy.The organisation, along with others such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, had previously avoided using women in active combat roles.Sources suggest that this move is viewed as a potential signal that JeM could begin training female suicide attackers, similar to tactics employed by groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas and LTTE.The development also underscores Pakistan’s continued tolerance of terror infrastructure on its soil. Despite Islamabad’s claims at global platforms of being a victim of terrorism and its assertions of compliance with FATF regulations, JeM and other banned groups reportedly continue to operate and collect donations openly through their network of markaz (centres).In September, Masood Azhar was also reported to have made a public appeal for funds during an address at Markaz Usman O Ali in Bahawalpur.Meanwhile, intelligence inputs suggest that JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen have shifted their bases to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to avoid Indian airstrikes after Operation Sindoor.According to media reports, JeM has additionally launched an online fundraising campaign via EasyPaisa, seeking to raise Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new centres across Pakistan.'","Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) has launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women.

China helps Pak launch satellite: Third such mission this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/china-helps-pak-launch-satellite-third-such-mission-this-year-what-is-remote-sensing-satellite/articleshow/124686660.cms,"Representative image

China Breaks Silence on Border Clash, Follows India To Tell Pakistan, Afghanistan to End Crisis

What is a remote sensing satellite?

Poll Do you believe space collaborations between countries are beneficial for advancement in technology? Yes No





China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday, accompanied by two of its own satellites, underscoring the deepening space collaboration between the two long-time allies.A Lijian-1 Y8 carrier rocket carrying three satellites—the Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite (PRSS-2) and China’s AIRSAT 03 and 04—was launched from a commercial aerospace innovation pilot zone in northwest China. The launch successfully placed all three satellites into their planned orbits, according to state-run Xinhua news agency.A remote sensing satellite is equipped with specialised sensors and cameras that observe and measure the physical characteristics of the Earth or other areas from space.It collects data on things like forest fires, temperature changes in oceans, cloud patterns, volcanic activity, urban growth, farmland changes, and the topography of the ocean floor. This helps scientists and researchers monitor large-scale environmental and geographic changes over time, according to USGS.This mission marks the third Pakistani satellite China has helped launch this year, following PRSS-1 in July and PRSC-EO1 in January.In recent years, China has played a key role in expanding Pakistan’s space capabilities, including the launch of a multi-mission communication satellite last year.Back in 2018, China also deployed two Pakistani satellites: PRSS-1, Pakistan’s first optical remote sensing satellite, and PakTES-1A, a smaller observation satellite.","China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday.

Bangladeshi generic version slashes rare disease drug’s price by 96%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshi-generic-version-slashes-rare-disease-drugs-price-by-96/articleshow/124785805.cms,"Representaive image





Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder. US-based Vertex, which holds the patent for this therapy, charges $325,300 for a year’s treatment while the generic will slash the price by 96% to just $12,775 for adults and about $6,390 for a child per year.Patients of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder, and their families launched a community-run buyers’ club on Thursday to help patients around the world access the new generic version of the drug.Vertex’s monopoly is estimated to have generated almost $30 billion in profits over ten years just from the sale of the medicine for cystic fibrosis. A 2022 study on production costs of the medicine estimated that it could be produced for $5,700 per patient per year. Beximco is launching the generic version of the triple combination (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) listed as an essential medicine by the WHO . It is also launching a generic version of ivacaftor, one of the components, as the treatment consists of two tablets of the triple combination and one tablet of ivacaftor every day for adults.“This is a historic moment. We’ve watched children suffer and die while a treatment sat on the shelf, priced out of reach. Today, that changes. We’ve proven that patient power can change what billion-dollar corporations refuse to. Governments must act fast to take all the necessary steps to make this life saving drug available for every eligible patient,” said Gayle Pledger, who leads the global Right to Breathe campaign, which has been working to make this medicine accessible for cystic fibrosis patients.Cystic fibrosis disrupts mucus production in multiple organs, particularly the lungs and digestive system, leading to debilitating symptoms, such as serious chronic respiratory issues and malnutrition. Delayed diagnosis and lack of treatment contribute to an average life expectancy of less than 20 years.Tanya Takewani, mother of a child in India with cystic fibrosis, pointed out that 14 children died in 2024 waiting for treatment. “This drug has been available for more than six years. How many more children must have died in these years? There are 600 patients of cystic fibrosis identified in India. But only 50 of them get treatment under the Patient Assistance Programme. The development of a generic gives us hope,” said Takewani.Chetali Rao, a scientific researcher with Third World Network (TWN), a nonprofit that has been helping to make medicines accessible, said, “When a medicine costs more than life itself, it stops being an innovation, it becomes an exclusion. Trikafta can transform a life-threatening disease like cystic fibrosis into a manageable condition. It must be available and we were determined to find a way to make it affordable. ”This urgency drove TWN, together with patient groups Just Treatment in the UK and Right to Breathe, to approach Beximco with the proposal to develop an affordable generic alternative.","Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder.

Explained: What is the BritCard Digital ID controversy?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/explained-what-is-the-britcard-digital-id-controversy/articleshow/124806132.cms,"The Big Picture

What the Government Says



The Backlash



The Road Ahead

The Bottom Line





When Prime Minister Keir Starmer stood before cameras on 26 September 2025 to unveil Britain’s first national digital ID, he called it a “modern solution for a modern country.”The BritCard, a voluntary digital identity for everyone over 16, was meant to simplify daily bureaucracy — applying for jobs, renting homes, opening bank accounts.Within hours, it had done something else entirely: trigger a nationwide debate about surveillance, data rights and state overreach in a country that famously scrapped its last ID card plan fifteen years ago.The BritCard Digital ID is designed to serve as a single digital credential for identity verification.It builds on the GOV.UK One Login programme and will be free for all citizens and residents with the right to live and work in the UK.Starmer argued the system would reduce paperwork and save up to £85 in private verification fees. But the plan’s link to employment verification — BritCard will be required for all new jobs and housing rentals — has blurred the line between voluntary and mandatory use.Polls now show public support slipping to -14%, with over 1.4 million online engagements dominated by scepticism.The digital ID’s rollout follows Labour’s broader attempt to modernise governance and tighten control over illegal migration.Officials claim BritCard will cut fraud, speed up background checks and create a secure, encrypted system without a centralised database.However, the scheme’s announcement was met with social media backlash.Community notes on X (formerly Twitter) challenged Starmer’s claims on verification costs, while privacy campaigners accused the government of “rebranding the old ID card under a digital label.”The BritCard revives one of Britain’s most divisive policy ideas — national identity verification — in a new digital form.The UK’s last attempt, under Tony Blair in the 2000s, was scrapped in 2010 after concerns about surveillance and cost overruns.Critics say the BritCard risks repeating that history.They warn of function creep, where a voluntary system quietly becomes required for access to essential services, echoing fears around China’s social credit model or India’s Aadhaar before reforms introduced stronger privacy rules.Civil liberty groups like Big Brother Watch warn BritCard could create a “checkpoint society,” allowing the state to track everyday activities.Cybersecurity experts say connecting multiple databases under one digital identity increases the risk of breaches and identity theft.People without smartphones or reliable internet could face new barriers in employment and housing.Opposition MPs, including former minister David Davis, argue that “voluntary today” could become “compulsory tomorrow,” especially once integrated with other services.Downing Street insists BritCard is secure, optional, and citizen-centred.Officials emphasise there will be no single national database and that the system will rely on encrypted credentials stored by users.The government claims the project will “restore trust in identity,” streamline background checks, and support law enforcement in tackling illegal working and benefit fraud.A Home Office spokesperson said the plan will “make life simpler for the law-abiding majority and harder for those exploiting the system.”Public sentiment remains sharply divided.On X, hashtags like #NoToBritCard and #StopDigitalID trended within hours of the launch.Civil rights groups have filed petitions urging Parliament to halt the rollout, warning it would “normalise constant verification.”Polling by Ipsos shows 57% of Britons back ID cards in theory, but only 38% support a purely digital version.Critics argue that the scheme’s success depends less on technology and more on trust, something successive British governments have struggled to maintain after multiple data scandals.The government plans a phased rollout starting with veterans and select public sector workers in 2026, before expanding nationwide.BritCard credentials could eventually integrate with driving licences, NHS records and tax accounts under the planned GOV.UK Wallet.The Home Affairs Committee has opened an inquiry into the proposal’s privacy, cybersecurity and equality implications.Its findings will likely shape how far and how fast the system proceeds.For Starmer, BritCard represents efficiency, innovation and control.For opponents, it symbolises state overreach dressed up as digital progress.The next year will test whether Britain’s digital identity revolution can convince citizens that convenience does not have to come at the cost of freedom.",The BritCard is a voluntary digital identity for everyone over 16.
