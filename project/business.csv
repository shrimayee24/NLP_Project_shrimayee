NEW DELHI: Flights between the West and India, mainly Delhi and Mumbai, will get even longer following the Iranian airspace closure on Friday after Israel attacked the country's nuclear sites. Sixteen Air India (AI) flights were impacted Friday, with the majority diverting and the others returning to origin.AI had resumed overflying Iran shortly after Pakistan had closed its airspace to Indian carriers on April 24 to partially mitigate the longer route its flights had to take since then. While AI will have to take longer routes to and from the West, IndiGo between Delhi and Tbilisi and Delhi and Baku will become one-stop flights now. With both Pakistan and Iran no-go areas, Indian carriers will have to take really longer routes to reach Central Asia. ""We are studying the situation and some AI flights may become one-stop after closure of Iran airspace,"" said sources.Also, if and when Iran retaliates, the airspace of countries near Israel, like Jordan and Lebanon, also be impacted.

Talks are underway to access the electricity bill database which will make it more convenient.UIDAI chief executive officer Bhuvnesh Kumar told TOI that a new app has been developed by the agency and around 2,000 of the one lakh machines have now moved to the new tool. ""You will soon be able to do everything sitting at home other than providing fingerprints and IRIS,"" he said. This will include updating addresses, phone numbers, name change and even rectification of a wrong date of birth.The move to allow QR code-based mobile-to-mobile or app-to-app transfer of Aadhaar is seen to be crucial to check against misuse and is proposed to be used for several purposes - from checking in at hotels to identity verification on a running train.

A special drive is planned so that the eight crore missing details for the first update (for kids between five and seven years) and 10 crore second update can be completed.Separately, UIDAI is also working with various players, such as security agencies, hotels, for covering entities that are not mandated to use Aadhaar.","By November, you will not be required to visit Aadhaar centres to update address and submit other details.

The monumental gain propelled the 80-year-old billionaire to the second spot on Forbes’ real-time billionaires list, surpassing Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, with a total fortune now standing at $243 billion just behind Elon Musk’s $407 billion.

The massive single-day gain catapulted the 80-year-old tech mogul to the second position on Forbes’ real-time billionaires list,. According to the reports,, placing him just behind Elon Musk, who leads the list with a net worth of $407 billion.The leap in Ellison’s wealth was fueled by Oracle’s impressive earnings report, which exceeded Wall Street expectations and sparked a wave of investor confidence. With the stock hitting record highs, Ellison reaffirmed his dominance in the tech industry, not just as a business leader but as one of the wealthiest individuals in modern history, surpassing even the GDP of several small countries.The jump in Ellison's wealth followed Oracle's after-earnings rally that pushed its stock to an all-time closing price of $200. During the Wednesday afternoon announcement, Oracle logged better-than-expected quarter-ending financial results. The company had $1.70 of adjusted earnings per share and $15.9 billion of revenue, beating Wall Street estimates. Although it dipped 13% briefly after the report's release, investor confidence returned strongly, powering the upward path.According to the ET reports, Ellison's net worth today is not only staggering in comparison to single billionaires but it surpasses the total GDP of a number of nations, the IMF suggests in its 2025 estimates. These are the countries whose economies fall short of Ellison's wealth:Such a comparison puts Ellison in a fiscal league more similar to that of sovereign states than corporate bosses.Ellison, Oracle's co-founder in 1977, has been a household name in the tech industry for decades. From 2018 to 2022, he was a member of the board of directors at Tesla, aligning himself with the largest Silicon Valley names.His own business enterprises are equally impressive.

In January, he stood at the side of the US President Donald Trump when he unveiled Stargate, a strategic AI effort supported by Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI. The venture aims to grow the US's competitive advantage in artificial intelligence by developing scalable next-generation infrastructure.","Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison witnessed a staggering $ on Thursday, June 12, driven by a sharp rally in Oracle's stock price.

In June 2020 the America's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) designated two Chinese companies -- Huawei Technologies Company (Huawei) and ZTE Corporation (ZTE), as well as their parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries -- as covered companies for purposes of the agency’s November 2019 ban on the use of universal service support to purchase equipment or services from companies posing a national security threat. America has also placed SMIC and some of its subsidiaries on the US entity list, which has significantly limited the companies' ability to acquire foreign technology.Citing Taiwan’s regulations, the report noted that the new restrictions could significantly limit Huawei and SMIC’s access to Taiwan’s plant construction technologies, materials, and equipment critical for producing AI semiconductors, such as those manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) for companies like Nvidia. The updated list also includes Huawei’s units in Japan, Russia, and Germany.In 2023, Bloomberg News reported that several Taiwanese firms were assisting Huawei in developing a covert network of chip plants in southern China. This latest move by Taipei may disrupt those efforts, further constraining the Chinese companies’ semiconductor ambitions.The report highlighted that Taiwan had previously imposed blanket bans on exporting chipmaking equipment, such as lithography machines, to China but had not targeted specific Chinese tech firms on its entity list until now. TSMC, a key supplier for Apple and Nvidia, halted supplies to Huawei in 2020 due to U.S. export controls.Huawei and SMIC made headlines in 2023 by unveiling a 7-nanometer chip made in China, surprising U.S. policymakers. Despite global restrictions, the companies remain China’s best hope for bridging the AI chip gap left by limited access to Nvidia’s advanced semiconductors.The restrictions come amid escalating tensions, with Taiwan President Lai Ching-te earlier this year labeling China a “foreign hostile force” and introducing measures to counter infiltration, Bloomberg reported. China, which claims Taiwan as its territory and has threatened unification by force, has not yet responded to the new measures.","Taiwan has blacklisted China's Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.

GFCCA then demanded it be given a plot in the city's west, in areas like Satellite, Bodakdev, and Makarba. After AMC's estate department showed GFCCA several options, a 5,601 sq. m plot in Makarba's TP Scheme No. 84 (B) was finalised.AMC then valued both plots, its valuation committee putting the Asarwa plot's total value at Rs 43.72 crore at Rs 42,700 per sq m. The Makarba plot was valued at Rs 42.65 crore, at Rs 76,150 per sq m.It was decided to give GFCCA the Makarba plot in exchange for the Asarwa plot, with the fisheries association paying the difference of Rs 1.07 crore to AMC.This plot exchange proposal was presented before the standing committee in Oct 6, 2022, but has not been approved since.

What Anthropic CEO said on AI

Anthropic on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's statement

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Amodei, in a recent Axios interview, had warned that AI could disrupt half of entry-level office roles and urged policymakers to prepare for economic impacts. Huang countered that while AI will transform jobs, it will also create new opportunities, citing increased productivity as a driver for hiring. “Some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs are going to be created,” he said.In response, an Anthropic spokesperson clarified to Fortune that Amodei has never claimed only Anthropic should build AI. “Dario has advocated for a national transparency standard for AI developers … so the public and policymakers are aware of the models’ capabilities and risks,” the statement read. The spokesperson reaffirmed Amodei’s concerns about AI’s economic impact and his commitment to addressing them.Anthropic, founded in 2021 by Amodei and other ex-OpenAI researchers, prioritizes safety in AI development, a focus rooted in the founders’ reported concerns over OpenAI’s direction. The public clash between Huang and Amodei highlights ongoing debates in the AI industry about its societal and economic implications.","Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris.

Air India crash linked to Boeing whistleblower warning

“shoddy work practices and poor oversight”

Air India death toll rises to 279

India’s New AC Rule: Cooling Between 20°C–28°C Explained

In a social media exchange in May 2024, a Twitter user responded to a post by Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticizing Boeing ’s management style. The user Gunther Eagleman @GuntherEagleman replied pointedly to the post saying:Musk responded to the user in a joking tone:the user further replied.But, the online conversation took a dark turn when another user followed up with:While Elon Musk did not publicly respond to this last comment, the thread has resurfaced after an Air India Dreamliner 787-8 aircraft crashed minutes after taking off from Ahmedabad airport on June 12. The deadly crash killed 241 of 242 people onboard the London-bound flight.In the original tweet, Elon Musk highlighted Boeing’s $4.2 billion investment in the Starliner spacecraft, contrasting it with SpaceX ’s (owned by Elon Musk) $2.6 billion for the Dragon 2, which completed four years earlier despite a near-complete redesign.He said: “Although Boeing got $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX only got $2.6 billion, SpaceX finished 4 years sooner. Note, the crew capsule design of Dragon 2 has almost nothing in common with Dragon 1. Too many non‑technical managers at Boeing.”The resurfaced conversation has gained further urgency after a recent report claimed that the Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was one of the same 787 Dreamliners that late Boeing whistleblower John Barnett had warned regulators about. Barnett, a former quality manager worked at Boeing for over 30 years. He had alleged serious flaws in the manufacturing of the 787 jets, citingat the company’s South Carolina plant. He claimed that Boeing prioritized speed over safety and even said he refused to fly on the Dreamliner. Barnett was found dead in March 2024 from an apparent suicide, shortly after testifying in a legal case against Boeing — a death that sparked widespread conspiracy theories. He is one of several whistleblowers whose warnings have resurfaced in light of recent safety incidents.The June 12 plane crash is being termed as one of the deadliest air disasters in decades. The total toll rose to 279 people killed, including 241 onboard the flight and 38 others on the ground. The lone survivor, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh said even he could not explain how he survived. ""Initially, I too thought that I was about to die, but then I opened my eyes and realised that I was still alive,"" Ramesh told national broadcaster DD News from his hospital bed.Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has directed all Boeing Dreamliner 787/9 fleet of Air India equipped with Genx engines to undergo additional maintenance and safety checks with immediate effect in coordination with the concerned regional DGCA offices.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to a Twitter user criticizing Boeing ’s management style.

Intel to begin laying off factory workers in July; here's what the company said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-to-begin-laying-off-factory-workers-in-july-heres-what-the-company-said/articleshow/121854413.cms,"Representative Image

What Intel said about laying off factory workers

Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro Review: Built for Real Work

Intel is set to begin laying off factory workers at its Silicon Forest campus in Oregon starting mid-July. The initial round of layoffs is expected to be completed by the end of the month. However, the chip-making company has indicated that further reductions may be implemented if deemed necessary. According to a report by Oregon Live, Intel informed its employees of this decision this week. An internal message sent to staff at Intel's production facilities outlined a restructuring within the Intel Foundry manufacturing group. This reorganisation aims to shift the group's focus more towards engineering and technical roles, implying a reduction in middle management positions.While specific figures for the number of affected employees have not been provided yet, the company's message suggests that the decision is official. Intel noted that these measures are a necessary step to enhance its financial position.In a statement sent to Tom’s Hardware, Intel wrote: “As we announced earlier this year, we are taking steps to become a leaner, faster and more efficient company. Removing organisational complexity and empowering our engineers will enable us to better serve the needs of our customers and strengthen our execution. We are making these decisions based on careful consideration of what is needed to position our business for the future, and we will treat people with care and respect as we complete this important work.”In December 2024, Intel’s employee headcount stood at 108,900, about 15,000 fewer than under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s cuts last year, the report notes. The company’s Oregon sites were no exception, which cut roughly 3,000 jobs but retained about 20,000 employees.Intel has not specified how many roles will be trimmed at Intel Foundry. However, staff in other divisions told Oregon Live that they anticipate similar cuts, with each unit free to implement layoffs independently as long as they meet their cost-reduction goals.Intel’s Oregon site hosts the company’s D1X and D1D fabs, which, despite heavy automation, depend on engineers, technicians, operators, analysts, and support staff. Critical roles like process engineers and high-skill technicians for EUV lithography are vital and may not be eliminated, the report adds.","Intel to begin laying off factory workers at its Silicon Forest campus in Oregon starting mid-July.

Poll Do you think AI coding assistants can fully replace human developers in startups? No, human expertise is essential Yes, they can replace developers

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke warned startup founders at VivaTech in Paris that while AI coding assistants can help launch companies, scaling them requires human developers and technical expertise . Speaking at Station F startup campus , Dohmke said bootstrapped startups built predominantly with AI coding tools ""doesn't have much value"" to investors and would struggle to justify funding rounds without complex systems built by skilled developers.The Microsoft-owned platform's CEO explained that non-technical founders increasingly use "" vibe coding ,"" natural language prompts that generate code, to build products with small teams and minimal funding. However, this approach creates a crowded market where investors question why they should choose one AI-built startup over another. ""The investors would ask, 'Why would I invest in you instead of the 10 other people?'"" Thomas Dohmke said, emphasizing that startups need deeper understanding of their systems to attract serious investment.Thomas Dohmke observed a dramatic shift in AI adoption over the past two years, from companies needing convincing to widespread ""FOMO"" in the market. While AI tools have democratized startup creation, he stressed that successful scaling requires developers who can build sophisticated systems. ""A non-technical founder will find it difficult to build a startup at scale without developers because they can't build a complex system to justify the next round,"" he explained.The GitHub CEO, whose platform serves over 150 million users worldwide, acknowledged the excitement around AI-driven engineering but maintained that coding skills remain essential. He previously stated that ""every kid, every child, should learn coding"" because knowing when to rely on personal coding abilities versus AI assistance is crucial. Dohmke emphasized that software engineers need ""willingness to learn"" about AI prompts while understanding when not to use them, noting that using prompts for tasks you can already do yourself ""is a waste of time.""","GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke warned startup founders at VivaTech in Paris that while AI coding assistants can help launch companies, scaling them requires human developers and technical expertise.

Why rejection of all 13 investor proposals at AGM is good news for Google

Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google, announced in a regulatory filing on June 12 that shareholders rejected all 13 investor proposals presented at its annual meeting on June 6. The proposals, which spanned corporate governance, artificial intelligence oversight, environmental policies, and child safety measures, failed to gain sufficient support from shareholders, reinforcing the company’s existing strategic direction.The annual meeting saw robust support for Alphabet’s leadership, with all ten board nominees re-elected to serve until the next annual meeting or until their successors are duly elected. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai secured 12.36 billion votes in favor, with only 149 million against. Co-founder Larry Page garnered 10.12 billion votes in support, though he faced 2.38 billion votes in opposition, reflecting some shareholder dissent. Other directors, including co-founder Sergey Brin, Nobel laureate Frances Arnold, and former Stanford University President John L. Hennessy, also retained their seats with strong backing. “The ten nominees were elected to Alphabet’s Board of Directors and will continue to guide the company’s vision,” the filing stated.Shareholders also overwhelmingly approved the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as Alphabet’s independent auditor for fiscal year 2025, with 12.57 billion votes in favor and 557.7 million opposed. This decision underscores confidence in the firm’s financial oversight as Alphabet navigates a competitive tech landscape.The rejected proposals covered a wide array of issues, reflecting growing shareholder interest in governance, ethical AI, and social responsibility. One high-profile proposal sought to allow shareholders to act by written consent without a formal meeting, a move that would enhance investor influence. It received 756.5 million votes in favor but was defeated by 11.73 billion votes against. Another measure, which proposed linking executive compensation to financial performance metrics, garnered only 165 million votes in favor, with 12.33 billion opposed, signaling shareholder trust in Alphabet’s current compensation framework.Environmental and social governance proposals also faced significant resistance. A climate-focused measure requesting enhanced sustainability reporting received 1.02 billion votes in favor but was outvoted by 11.45 billion against. A proposal urging transparency in Alphabet’s charitable partnerships secured just 48.5 million votes, with 12.43 billion opposing it. Another measure questioning Alphabet’s participation in the Corporate Equality Index, a benchmark for LGBTQ+ workplace policies, received 60.4 million votes in favor and 12.43 billion against.Alphabet’s dual-class share structure, which grants Class B shareholders—primarily company insiders like Page and Brin—ten votes per share, remained a point of contention. A proposal to establish equal voting rights for all shareholders drew 3.83 billion votes in favor but was defeated by 8.66 billion votes, preserving the structure that gives Alphabet’s founders disproportionate control.Several proposals focused on Alphabet’s leadership in artificial intelligence, a critical area as the company competes with rivals like OpenAI and Microsoft. One measure calling for greater oversight of AI-related data usage received 1.54 billion votes in favor but was outvoted by 10.9 billion against. Another proposal addressing potential discrimination in generative AI technologies garnered only 57 million votes in favor, with 12.41 billion opposed. A third AI-related measure, focused on the human rights implications of AI-driven advertising, secured 1.78 billion votes in favor but fell short against 10.69 billion votes.Other proposals addressed broader societal concerns. A measure urging human rights due diligence in conflict zones received 562 million votes in favor but was defeated by 11.9 billion against. Two proposals focused on child safety—one addressing lobbying activities and another on online child protection—received 655 million and 1.16 billion votes in favor, respectively, but were both rejected by wide margins. A final resolution, introduced from the floor, proposed pre-installing AI applications on Android devices to boost user adoption. It received a mere 342 votes in favor, with 12.51 billion against, reflecting minimal support for the idea.All proposals were non-binding, meaning Alphabet’s board is not obligated to act on them even if they had passed. The voting included both Class A and Class B shareholders, with the latter’s enhanced voting power likely influencing the outcomes.The rejection of these proposals comes as Alphabet faces increasing scrutiny over its dominance in search, advertising, and AI. The company reported $307 billion in revenue in 2024, driven by its Google services, cloud computing, and AI innovations like the Gemini model. However, Alphabet is also navigating legal challenges, including antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. and Europe, which allege monopolistic practices in digital advertising and search. These pressures highlight the stakes of shareholder proposals aimed at reshaping governance and accountability.Analysts note that the dual-class share structure continues to insulate Alphabet’s leadership from external pressures, allowing Pichai and the founding team to prioritize long-term innovation over short-term shareholder demands. Alphabet’s next annual meeting is expected in mid-2026, where similar debates over governance, AI ethics, and corporate responsibility are likely to resurface.","Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google, announced that shareholders rejected all 13 investor proposals presented at its annual meeting on June 6.

Markets will be severely impacted only if Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz triggering a huge spike in crude. This appears to be a low probability event now. ”“Past experience tells us that times of uncertainty and risk-off are buying opportunities for long-term investors. The difference this time is that the risk-off has not triggered big selling in equities making their valuations attractive.The market scenario characterised by sustained retail buying and fund flows into mutual funds will ensure valuations remaining high for an extended period of time.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

As the world marks World Blood Donor Day on June 14, a quiet but powerful movement in Dubai is being celebrated for its life-saving impact. Founded by a small group of Indian expatriates in 2015, the Kindness Blood Donation Team has now grown into one of the emirate’s most impactful volunteer initiatives, having helped save more than 25,000 lives throughover 250 donation campaigns.The Kindness Blood Donation Team was launched by Shihab Theruvath, Anwar Wayanad, and Salam Kanyappady, three Indian expats united by a shared sense of social responsibility. “We realised that many people didn’t know how many lives they can save, and even though they knew, many didn’t know where or how to do it regularly,” said Shihab Theruvath, who works in Dubai’s health sector, in an interview with“That’s when we felt we had to do something to create a simple way for people who wanted to donate to actually get the chance to do it,” he added.In 2015, they began by launching small donation drives, gradually expanding their network by using WhatsApp groups based on location. These groups made it easier to mobilise donors quickly, helping bridge the gap between blood need and availability.“Work schedules often held people back from donating. So, we brought the drives to them, organising campaigns in different parts of the city. The response has been overwhelming,” said Anwar Wayanad, also from the health sector.The team soon grew, attracting volunteers from diverse backgrounds, including:These volunteers, mostly from the Indian state of Kerala, continue to drive the message:The true resilience of the Kindness Team was tested during the COVID-19 pandemic, when strict lockdowns and public fear severely impacted blood donation rates. At a time when blood banks struggled, the team took action.“It was a time of fear, but it was also a time when we saw the best of humanity,” recalled Salam Kanyappady, a finance manager and entrepreneur, who regularly donates blood with his wife, Riyana Salam.In close partnership with the Dubai Blood Donation Centre and supported by the Dubai KMCC Kasargod District Committee, the team managed to sustain a series of safe, well-coordinated drives. Their trusted presence helped reassure the public and maintain critical blood supplies.Following the pandemic, the team expanded its outreach further, collaborating with community groups and alumni associations to run even more organised campaigns across Dubai.The impact of the group’s efforts has been recognised officially. Shihab Theruvath was recently awarded a certificate of appreciation by the Dubai Blood Donation Centre, a testament to the group’s unwavering commitment.As Anwar told, “Over the years, we have received overwhelming support from donors of various nationalities. In close coordination with the Dubai Blood Donation Centre, we have been organising regular, well-structured blood donation campaigns, covering different areas of Dubai and making it convenient for donors to participate.”He added, “We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Dubai Blood Donation Centre under Dubai Health for their unwavering support in helping us turn our vision into a reality, as well as to the dedicated team of volunteers and our committed donors who continue to drive this mission forward.”To mark World Blood Donor Day 2025, the team launched a youth-led campaign titled: “Give Blood, Give Hope: Together We Save Lives.” The drive, held on Friday, brought in student volunteers in a bid to inspire younger generations to become regular donors.Many of the group’s volunteers and supporters have now taken the next step by donating platelets and red cells, highlighting the campaign’s growing sophistication and awareness outreach.Blood donation in the UAE is a strictly regulated process to ensure the health and safety of both donors and recipients. Here's what donors should be aware of:According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one unit of donated blood can save up to three lives, as blood can be separated into red cells, plasma, and platelets, each serving different critical medical needs.Celebrated every year on June 14, World Blood Donor Day (WBDD) was established in 2004 to raise global awareness about the importance of safe blood donation. It commemorates the birth of Karl Landsteiner, the scientist who discovered blood groups, and serves as a tribute to voluntary blood donors worldwide.","The Kindness Blood Donation Team was launched by Shihab Theruvath, Anwar Wayanad, and Salam Kanyappady, three Indian expats united by a shared sense of social responsibility.

Strong Compliance Reflects UAE’s Humanitarian Values

Poll Do you support the Midday Work Ban in the UAE? Yes, it's essential for worker safety. No, it disrupts work schedules.

Active Inspections and Supportive Measures for Worker Safety

Exceptions, Monitoring, and Penalties





Starting Sunday, June 15, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratization (MoHRE) will enforce the Midday Work Ban, a regulation prohibiting outdoor work under direct sunlight between 12:30 PM and 3:00 PM. This ban, which continues through September 15, aims to prevent heat-related illnesses and injuries during the hottest months of the year.The Ministry’s website highlights that this marks the 21st consecutive year of the ban’s implementation, underscoring the UAE’s commitment to global occupational health and safety standards. The initiative is a crucial part of creating safer work environments across the country during summer’s peak heat.According to Mohsen Al Nassi, Assistant Undersecretary for the Inspection and Compliance Sector at MoHRE:“The Midday Work Ban has achieved an outstanding compliance rate of over 99% for consecutive years, which highlights the deep-rooted social and humanitarian values within the UAE’s business community and private sector. It also reflects an advanced level of awareness regarding the importance of safeguarding human capital, which is a company’s most valuable asset.Moreover, it underscores the humane and progressive nature of UAE labour laws, particularly in relation to occupational safety and health. ”Similarly, Dalal Al Shehhi, Acting Assistant Undersecretary for the Labor Protection Sector, pointed out that:“The Midday Work Ban has become a leading example of partnership between the Ministry, the private sector, and members of the community. This is reflected in the way partners have developed initiatives for workers during the ban period, thereby promoting the concept of social responsibility and highlighting the success of awareness strategies and the entrenchment of humanitarian values in the UAE’s work environment. ”The UAE, home to more than 200 nationalities, continues to align this regulation with the broader “We the UAE 2031” vision, fostering a thriving and inclusive society.MoHRE conducts regular field inspections at worksites and workers’ accommodations to raise awareness and enforce compliance with the ban. These visits help prevent heat exhaustion and sunstroke by reinforcing the importance of adhering to safety standards.Many private companies support this initiative by providing fully equipped rest areas during the banned hours. These spaces include shaded areas, fans, sufficient drinking water, hydrating salts approved by local authorities, and first aid kits. Such measures ensure workers can rest and recover safely before resuming their duties.The ban allows exceptions for critical work that cannot be paused, such as asphalt laying, concrete pouring, and emergency repairs affecting utilities or traffic. However, these activities require authorization from relevant government authorities and must be completed promptly.To ensure strict compliance, MoHRE encourages public reporting of violations through its call centre (600590000), official website, and mobile app. Companies violating the ban face fines of AED 5,000 per offending worker, with a maximum fine of AED 50,000 for multiple violations.MoHRE continues to strengthen awareness campaigns and inspections in collaboration with both public and private sectors to maintain a safe and healthy work environment during the summer months.","UAE enforces Midday Work Ban from June 15 to September 15, banning outdoor work from 12:30 PM to 3:00 PM, with 99% compliance and fines up to AED 50,000.

Why a Statutory Inquiry Matters

Demand the release of classified documents and internal reports;

For many survivors, this is the first time they feel their voices might lead to actual accountability.

What Happens Next



Musk’s involvement, while controversial, showed how digital platforms can force action on long-ignored issues.

Starmer’s government is now under pressure to implement swift reforms and offer compensation to survivors.

The political debate has sharpened, with opposition parties vowing to make grooming gangs a central issue in the next election.

Final Word







After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs and institutional failures that enabled decades of child sexual exploitation.The decision, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer on June 14, marks a dramatic shift in tone for his administration—one that had previously resisted demands for a public investigation into what many see as one of Britain’s worst safeguarding scandals.The tipping point? A perfect storm of political pressure, survivor testimony, community backlash—and unusually, a global spotlight powered by Elon Musk , who used his platform, X (formerly Twitter), to repeatedly target Starmer’s record on grooming gangs.The term “grooming gangs” refers to loosely organised groups of men who exploited underage girls—typically white, working-class, and often in care—in towns across northern England from the early 1990s onwards.The 2014 Jay Report on Rotherham, commissioned after investigative journalism exposed widespread abuse, identified over 1,400 victims between 1997 and 2013. Similar patterns were later uncovered in Rochdale, Telford, Oxford, and Oldham.What made the cases especially sensitive was the ethnic background of many offenders—in several high-profile cases, the perpetrators were men of Pakistani Muslim heritage. However, the official framing used the broader term “Asian grooming gangs”—a euphemism that triggered resentment among British Indians, Sikhs, and East Asians who said their communities were being unfairly implicated.British-Indian communities, especially Hindus and Sikhs, have long objected to the blanket use of the term “Asian grooming gangs.” Their frustration boiled over in January this year when Starmer, in response to criticism from Elon Musk, once again used the phrase during a televised interview.Community leaders issued sharp statements denouncing what they called an ethnic smear. “Why should we be classified as part of these gangs?” asked Jay Shah, spokesperson for Friends of India Society International UK. “Asian means Vietnamese, Sri Lankan, Japanese, Indian, etc. When it comes to grooming gangs, we are Asian. When it comes to Kashmir, we are Indian.”The Hindu Council UK called Starmer’s wording a “whitewash of heinous atrocities,” noting that Hindu and Sikh girls had also been among the victims. Sikh Youth UK, which has documented grooming cases involving Sikh victims for over 15 years, said it had worked with thousands of families and even caught perpetrators outside Sikh schools. The Network of Sikh Organisations described Starmer’s comments as “extremely disappointing” and accused politicians of “protecting perpetrators rather than victims.”Both the Hindu Council UK and INSIGHT UK have since backed Conservative calls for a national inquiry—arguing that political correctness has too often silenced honest debate about ethnicity and crime.The turning point came not from Westminster but from Silicon Valley.In early 2025, Elon Musk—whose X platform has grown into a global political amplifier—began posting repeatedly about grooming gangs. Quoting survivor testimonies, reposting historical reporting, and tagging British officials, Musk accused UK authorities of “turning a blind eye to organised rape” and suggested that political leaders, including Starmer, were “cowards unwilling to confront the truth.”One post from March read: “If these were elite London girls being trafficked, the BBC would talk about nothing else. But poor northern girls? The state looked away.”While the tone of Musk’s commentary sparked debate—especially among British politicians who viewed it as inflammatory—it undeniably brought renewed international attention to the issue.By May, Musk’s X account had posted or amplified over 150 messages about grooming gangs, triggering renewed media coverage, a spike in search interest, and thousands of public responses. Hashtags such as #JusticeForRotherham, #GroomingGangsInquiry, and #StarmerFailedUs trended across the UK and US.The growing visibility added fuel to a debate already brewing in Parliament.In January, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper had quietly commissioned Baroness Louise Casey to conduct a “rapid review” into previous investigations—including Oldham and Rochdale—after persistent claims that public officials downplayed or ignored evidence of abuse.Casey’s report, delivered in May, was damning. It found that multiple public bodies “failed in their duty of care” and that in some cases, victims were dismissed or even blamed. Crucially, it called for a full statutory public inquiry with the ability to compel testimony and evidence.Simultaneously, Conservative MPs, Reform UK leaders, and victim advocacy groups demanded action. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, a long-time critic of the “Asian gangs” terminology, stated that Starmer had “run out of excuses.” Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the lack of a national inquiry “a betrayal of Britain’s daughters.”On June 14, Keir Starmer announced the establishment of a judge-led inquiry under the 2005 Inquiries Act, which gives it full legal powers. He said the investigation would “examine past failures, hold institutions to account, and ensure this can never happen again.”Starmer, who previously served as Director of Public Prosecutions, defended his record, pointing to a rise in grooming-related prosecutions during his tenure. But critics argue that his earlier reluctance to endorse a national inquiry allowed the issue to fester—and exposed Labour to accusations of institutional denial.“There is no more denying the scale of failure,” Starmer said at a press conference. “This inquiry is about justice—for survivors, for their families, and for the country.”Unlike previous reviews—many of which lacked transparency and enforcement—this inquiry has legal teeth. It can:The inquiry will take several months to set up, with hearings likely to begin in early 2026. Its findings could reshape the way Britain handles child protection, race relations, and public accountability. But in the short term, it’s already had an impact:This is not just a story of abuse—it’s a story of institutional failure, political caution, and the new ways power is exercised across borders and platforms. Whether the inquiry delivers justice remains to be seen. But for the thousands of girls whose pain was ignored—and for the communities wrongly smeared along the way—this is a reckoning long overdue.","After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs.

TOI correspondent from London: Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects whilst the laws to protect them are being diluted and not implemented properly, Adivasis told a global press briefing on Monday.“They say India has got freedom. But I think Adivasi people have not yet got freedom,” J C Shivamma, from the Jenu Kuruba tribe, said at the online event organised by Community Network Against Protected Areas.She is among the 52 households who reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.“Some of our family members died when in the plantations, but our sacred deities, our graveyard, everything that concerns us, is still in the village, so we used to go back to bury our people in our ancestral land, but it was always a fight with the forest department toconduct rituals. We consider our ancestors to be on the lands, they become deities and this way we were tortured. If we have to die, we will die on our ancestral land,” she said.Shivu JA recalled how their houses were burnt and elephants brought to destroy their fields when they were evicted from Karadikallu. “This land is ours. It's not any tiger project or scheme of the govt for tiger conservation,” he said.“Our elders are very happy now.We are having our food, we are going for honey collection. We have our own water resource. We sit together in the evening, and they are teaching us songs. All these songs and lessons were silenced for 40 years.""“The forest department keeps saying that only after your rights are recognised, you can live on this land. We already have these rights,” he said.The Jenu Kurubas are filing a case against the Forest Department under the SC/ST Atrocities Act for withholding their rights and filing an appeal against 39 rejected forest rights claims.“Why are their rights not being recognised despite the notification of central legislation such as the Forest Rights Act 2006,” asked scholar Nitin Rai.“People across the country in different states are fighting the same battles. It is important to find a way to raise a collective voice for what is happening all over,” said lawyer Lara Jesani.","Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects. 52 households reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.

What's particularly notable about spring 2025 is the combination of record warmth and sunshine, alongside very low rainfall.""""This spring shows some of the changes we're seeing in our weather patterns, with more extreme conditions, including prolonged dry, sunny weather, becoming more frequent,"" she said.The recent weather's dominant feature had been the persistent high-pressure systems, often coming from the Azores or mainland Europe.These had lingered over the UK since late February and blocked the usual flow of Atlantic weather fronts, allowing high pressure to dominate, the Met Office said.Last month, the Environment Agency (EA) called a meeting of its national drought group after it said levels in reservoirs were ""exceptionally low"".In the meeting, the EA's deputy water director, Richard Thompson warned that ""changing climate means we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades"".The agency added that, while there was no official drought yet, there was a ""medium risk"" of a summer drought without sustained rainfall.The UK government has said it would step in to fast-track the building of two new reservoirs.According to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, no new water reservoirs have been built since 1992.Scientists warn that extreme and fluctuating weather events are becoming increasingly common as planet-heating fossil fuel emissions keep rising.","The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years.
