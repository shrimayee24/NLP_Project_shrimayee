NEW DELHI: Getting into the Yuletide spirit could prove expensive for an Air India pilot who was to operate a Vancouver-Delhi (via Vienna) flight on Dec 23, 2025. A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle. She reported this Boeing 777 pilot to the Canadian authorities who conducted a breath analyser test on him which he flunked and then he was detained.Luckily for passengers, Air India managed to quickly find a replacement. The ultra long haul, to be operated by four pilots or two sets (one captain and a co-pilot in each set) in turns, supposed to leave at 3 pm local time did so with just a two-hour delay. The aircraft then landed in Vienna from where another set of crew operated it to Delhi.“AI has taken a very stern view of this matter. The pilot was flown to Delhi a couple of days later and is being probed. The issue has been reported to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which is also examining the same,” said people in the know.While some sources say the pilot had inadvertently sipped an alcoholic drink at the airport and a staffer at duty free saw him doing so, others said he smelled of alcohol when buying a bottle.It is not yet known which of the two really happened, staffer reported the matter to Canadian authorities who then used CCTV footage to find out the pilot in question was to operate with flight. They managed to trace him to the AI aircraft.In a statement, AI said: “AI 186 from Vancouver to Delhi on Dec 23, 2025, experienced a last-minute delay after one of the cockpit crew members was offloaded prior to departure. Canadian authorities raised concerns regarding the pilot’s fitness for duty, following which the crew member was taken for further inquiry. In accordance with safety protocols, an alternate pilot was rostered to operate the flight, resulting in the delay. ”""Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers and is fully cooperating with the local authorities. The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations. Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy. Safety remains Air India’s highest priority at all times,” the airline statement added.Pilots operating international sectors usually do not have pre-flight breath analyser (BA) tests and the same is conducted on arrival as liquor is available on board these flights. This is to ensure they have not taken a sip or two during the flight. On domestic flights, pre-flights BA tests are conducted as alcohol is not served/sold on flights within India.While rules don’t mandate this, AI on its own has enforced a policy of conducting random pre-flight BA at international stations. The airline frequently keeps sending its doctors on international flights who then conduct these checks on pilots who are to operate the return flight to India.Pilots are surprised at this case. ""Forget drinking, we don’t even use after shaves, perfumes, mouth wash or homeopathic medicines some hours before operating a flight. There have been multiple instances of teetotallers failing BA tests because of the alcohol in their breath because of using toiletries with alcoholic content. We look for these items without any alcohol, except homeopathic medicines where possibly there’s no option,” said a captain. The reason: Failing BA test thrice means losing flying license.","A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle.

Where Tigers Get Caught Between Faith And Tourism | I Witness

Testing human tolerance

In early 2025, a motion-sensor camera high on the hills of Purulia district, West Bengal, blinked to life. The image it captured was unremarkable in isolation: the grainy silhouette of a tiger crossing scrubland. But for residents and forest officials, it was extraordinary. Purulia had never yielded a tiger sighting before. No camera traps, no spoor, no local memory of the big cat. The photograph was more than a record; it was a signal - that the landscape had begun to shift in ways people were only beginning to comprehend.Within weeks, researchers traced the animal's path through a series of camera traps: March 2024 in Chhattisgarh's Balrampur forest division; summer sightings in Jharkhand's Palamau Tiger Reserve; and by January 2025, in Bengal's Purulia and Jhargram. The tiger had wandered roughly 500 km through human-dominated terrain, crossing administrative and ecological boundaries in search of space.The tiger's journey is not an anomaly. It is part of a pattern. India's wild tiger population, once on the brink of collapse, has surged from 1,411 in 2006 to approximately 3,682 in the latest estimate - almost 75% of the world's wild tiger population. This rebound, often hailed as a conservation landmark, is the centrepiece of Project Tiger's story.Conservationists and forest staff took pride in the numbers, even as they now grapple with the consequences of unprecedented success.Scientists at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) estimate that nearly 30% of these 3,682 tigers - more than 1,100 animals - now roam outside notified tiger reserves, sharpening the challenge of coexistence. WII director GS Bhardwaj told TOI that a dedicated Tiger Outside Tiger Reserves (TOTR) project has already been initiated from 2025, with the focus on conserving both tigers and people. The project targets forest divisions that host dispersing tigers, aims to mitigate human-tiger conflict linked to TOTR, and envisages strengthening protection regimes beyond reserve boundaries.But there is a paradox embedded in that success: Project Tiger became ""a little too successful"", as an expert said. As core reserves fill, tigers disperse farther - into buffers, across states and into human landscapes, fuelled by instinct, not intention. Tigers are inherently territorial; adults typically range across tens to hundreds of square km depending on prey and habitat. Studies in Indian landscapes have shown female home ranges between 30 and 64 sq km, with males sometimes exceeding 170 sq km. The average, even in prey-rich forests, often approaches 90 sq km.Bhardwaj said WII has advised all states to strengthen wildlife protection outside tiger reserves and carry out intensive monitoring of tigers moving beyond them, so that encounters do not escalate into human casualties or retaliatory killings.In the central Indian landscape - the broad swath of forests, hills and plateaus that includes Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and surrounding states - pressure is particularly acute. Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, for instance, has one of the highest tiger densities in the country. A state-level review found territorial fights to be a major cause of death among tigers there between 2021 and 2023, reflecting intense competition for space and mates. With older males holding core territories, younger animals are pushed into buffer zones and near villages, raising the frequency of conflict. Bandhavgarh registers more than 2,000 cattle kills annually - a stark indicator of how tigers are pressed against the edges of ecological and social boundaries.Not all reserves exhibit the same degree of crowding though. In Uttarakhand, Corbett and Rajaji tiger reserves are approaching saturation, but nearly half of India's reserves remain below what scientists describe as their ecological capacity. Forest officials in the state have reported that Corbett can support about 20 tigers per 100 sq km, while eastern Rajaji's capacity is around 14 per 100 sq km - figures that help explain why animals increasingly stray outside protected areas.As tigers move beyond core forests, their presence ripples through local communities in palpable ways. In early 2025, in several villages in Uttar Pradesh's Pilibhit region, a prowling tiger caused schools to be closed. Children stayed home. ""Exams are coming,"" said a Class 5 student from Khalispur had then said, ""but we haven't even completed the syllabus."" Teachers refused to hold evening sessions. Parents stopped letting children walk alone. Tigers in Pilibhit often establish temporary bases in sugarcane fields, drawn by wild boars that feed on the sweet crop. Boars attract tigers. Sugarcane draws both. And between them lies the village.Elsewhere, the consequences have turned fatal. In Gadchiroli district of eastern Maharashtra, tiger numbers grew from zero to nearly 30 in five years - a startling shift in a landscape long considered tiger-scarce. With 12,000 sq km of forest, it appears generous on paper. But in practice, only about 7,000 sq km in two forest divisions is occupied. Human settlements, encroachments, and patchy prey base have constrained the actual carrying capacity. In 2024, 25 villagers died in tiger attacks across the Wadsa and Gadchiroli divisions. Two problem tigers were captured. A tigress was spared because she had cubs. Though technically capable of holding far more - by some estimates, up to 300 tigers - Gadchiroli cannot even accommodate 25 without triggering conflict.In one forest-fringe home in Jharkhand, a tiger entered a family's hut, settled on a wooden cot, and waited. The family, stunned, watched in silence from a corner of the room. The tiger had wandered far from mapped territory. Its entry was a mistake. Its departure, hours later, was quiet. Nobody was hurt. The event became a story of awe and fear.These tigers are no longer sentinels of wilderness. They are migrants. Monarchs in exile. Each one a ghost of ecological success, walking into fields, hamlets and homes - not out of aggression, but because the forests behind them are full.In some landscapes, officials speak of ""social carrying capacity"" - not how many tigers the habitat can sustain, but how many human communities are willing to tolerate. In parts of Uttarakhand, tiger-inflicted fatalities have surpassed leopard attacks for the first time in years. In response, village volunteers called Bagh Mitras have been trained to monitor tiger movement and alert forest departments. Some report sightings through mobile apps. Others simply listen for silence - the kind that descends before a tiger appears.Translocation - moving tigers from dense parks to underpopulated reserves - has been tried. Odisha attempted it in 2018, without success. Intra-state efforts show more promise, but officials now lean toward corridor consolidation. Movement is safer when it's natural. But for that, corridors must exist - not just on policy maps, but on the ground.In the Terai Arc, at least 10 critical corridors are under threat from habitat loss and development. In central India, linear infrastructure - railways, highways, power lines - cuts across migration routes. And yet, some reserves offer hope. In Tadoba, tiger density rose 30% over a decade, with buffer populations expanding as prey base improved. In Sundarbans, the reserve is being expanded by more than 1,000 sq km to create space for 101 tigers now crowding its mangrove heartland.India now has more than 50 tiger reserves. Some are full. Others still hold ecological potential, if prey can be restored. The key lies not just in creating new habitat, but in connecting the old - allowing dispersing tigers to move without triggering conflict.Perhaps the tiger today is not just an emblem of wilderness, but a kind of refugee of success - displaced by recovery. The Purulia tiger's trek is both a biometric trail and a metaphor. It is the story of a tiger with nowhere to go, walking east until the land gave way to politics and fear.In the empty classrooms of Pilibhit, in the living room of a Jharkhand family, in the cattle sheds of Bandhavgarh, and in the forests of Gadchiroli now marked by claw and memory, India's national animal is no longer confined to the forest. The tiger has returned. The question is - where can it stay?","India's wild tiger population has surged from 1,411 in 2006 to approximately 3,682 in the latest estimate.

New Labour Codes: The Ministry of Labour has pre-published draft rules under new labour codes on Wednesday. These draft rules are open for public consultation, and stakeholders have been invited to submit objections and suggestions within 45 days (30 days for Industrial Relations Rules). The government has clarified that during the transition period, existing rules will continue to apply until new rules are notified under the Labour Codes, as long as they are consistent with the Codes.Why are the new labour codes important? There are changes in the way provident fund contributions, wages, gratuity are calculated, along with a host of other measures. A uniform definition of “wages” now applies across all four Labour Codes and includes basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance, with a 50 percent cap on allowances. Any allowance, excluding gratuity and retrenchment compensation, that exceeds 50 percent of total remuneration will be added back to wages for statutory calculations, while items such as performance incentives.Puneet Gupta, Partner, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India says that the draft central rules under the four labour codes provide clarity on several operational aspects that employers have been awaiting.“For instance, the Code on Social Security Rules specify that gratuity will be calculated on ‘wages’ last drawn, excluding components such as annual performance-linked pay, medical reimbursements, stock options, and meal vouchers. This clarification will help organizations estimate their gratuity liability more effectively,” he says.“Similarly, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Rules introduce important provisions on overtime and working conditions. Workers will now be entitled to double wages for any work beyond 48 hours in a week, and employers must ensure substituted rest days without exceeding ten consecutive working days. These measures aim to balance productivity with employee well-being,” he adds.According to Puneet Gupta, other notable provisions include annual medical check-ups for employees above 40 years in specific sectors such as factory, dock, mine, building & other construction work, creche allowances of at least Rs 500 per child where creche facilities are not provided, and journey allowances for inter-state migrant workers.Apart from the draft rules, the government has also published a list of FAQs on what the new labour codes mean, definition of wages, gratuity calculation etc.As per the provisions of Section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1897, old rules will remain in force till final notification of new rules under the Code, to the extent these are in line with Codes.The definition of “Wages” covers:As mentioned in Section 2(y) of Code on Wages, 2019, leave encashment is not a part of allowances.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.

‘Worst Is Behind Us’: IndiGo CEO Says Airline Back on Track After Operational Crisis

NEW DELHI: Flight travel across India remained disrupted for another day on Monday with several flights cancelled and many cancellations set for Tuesday as well.As per the IndiGo's cancelled flight data, 59 flights, scheduled for December 30 have now been cancelled. 116 flights were cancelled on Monday, majorly due to bad weather while 5 were due to operational reasons.Earlier in the day, ministry of civil aviation had also issued an advisory warning of possible delays. ""Due to fog conditions across parts of Northern India, flight operations at select airports may be impacted, leading to possible delays. Passengers are advised to stay updated through official airline communication channels, allow additional time for airport arrival and check-in procedures, and plan their travel accordingly,"" it had said.Air India also issued its advisory during the day saying, ""Weather forecast continues to indicate dense fog for tomorrow morning with significantly reduced visibility at Delhi and parts of northern India. This will affect flight schedules to and from Delhi with cascading effects likely across our network. We are closely monitoring the situation and have taken proactive steps to minimise disruptions . In the event of unexpected delays, diversions or cancellations resulting from fog, please rest assured that our ground teams are available at key touchpoints in the airports to extend assistance to you.We understand how frustrating such disruption to travel plans can be and are making every possible effort to minimise the inconvenience,"" it said, while explaining its ""FogCare initiate"" to help the passengers.Under DGCA fog operations (CAT-IIIB) norms, airlines are required to mandatorily roster pilots trained for low-visibility operations and deploy aircraft that are compliant with CAT-IIIB standards.Category-III refers to an advanced instrument landing system that enables aircraft to operate in foggy conditions. Category-III-A is a precision approach and landing system that allows operations with a runway visual range (RVR) of up to 200 metres, while Category-III-B permits landings when the RVR drops below 50 metres.","116 flights were cancelled on Monday, majorly due to bad weather while 5 were due to operational reasons. 59 flights, scheduled for December 30 have now been cancelled.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit. It grants long-term security and operational freedom. It is not tied to a single employer and does not impose requirements. Key features include full work freedom, self- employment, business ownership, and freelancing without sponsorship.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126234204,imgsize-648989,width-400,resizemode-4/bahrain-golden-residency.jpg"

'India Will Be 3rd Largest Economy': PM Modi Sounds Warning To Trump, Says World is Betting on Delhi

India Becomes Fourth Largest Economy

High Growth, Low Inflation - The Goldilocks Situation

In a major feat, India has moved past Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy in nominal GDP terms, according to the government’s year-end economic review. Not only that, the Indian economy is set to overtake Germany to become the third largest after the US and China in the coming years. A final confirmation will depend on the data released by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in the first half of 2026 when the final figures for 2025 will be released.“With GDP valued at $4.18 trillion, India has surpassed Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy and is poised to displace Germany from the third rank in the next 2.5 to 3 years with projected GDP of $7.3 trillion by 2030,” the government release said.India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now. The size of its economy has doubled in the last ten years, and it is now eyeing the position of being the third largest in the world.A government economic note issued late Monday highlighted that India remains one of the fastest-expanding major economies globally and is well placed to maintain its growth pace.IMF forecasts for 2026 value India’s economy at $4.51 trillion, slightly above Japan’s projected $4.46 trillion.The government’s optimistic outlook comes even as the economy faces headwinds following the imposition of steep US tariffs in August linked to India’s purchases of Russian oil.Recent high-frequency data signals that economic momentum is holding firm. Inflation has stayed below the lower bound of the tolerance band, joblessness is easing, and exports are showing steady improvement, the government review noted.Financial conditions also remain supportive, marked by healthy credit expansion to businesses, while demand continues to be resilient, aided by a further pickup in urban consumption.India’s real GDP expanded by 8.2% in the second quarter of FY 2025-26, accelerating from 7.8% in the preceding quarter and 7.4% in the final quarter of FY 2024-25. This growth was driven by strong domestic demand, even as global trade and policy uncertainties persisted. Real gross value added rose 8.1%, underpinned by solid performance in the industrial and services sectors.The Reserve Bank of India raised its growth projection for FY 2025-26 to 7.3%, up from 6.8% earlier. The upward revision factors in sustained domestic demand, rationalisation of income tax and GST, softer crude prices, an early push in government capital spending, and accommodative monetary and financial conditions, all supported by contained inflation.“Ongoing reforms are likely to further enable growth prospects. The present macro-economic situation presents a rare “goldilocks period” of high growth and low inflation,” the review said.CPI inflation stood at 4.26% in January and gradually moderated over the first half of the year, before declining further to multi-year lows during the latter half. Headline inflation continued to soften and touched historic lows of around 0.25% in October. This sharper-than-expected disinflation was primarily driven by a correction in food prices.RBI has cumulatively cut the repo rate by 1.25% this year, down from 6.5% to 5.25%. The move reflected a balanced approach between supporting growth and managing inflation, aided by a favourable outlook for both headline and core inflation.India’s external position continues to display considerable strength. Supported by healthy growth in services exports and a steady rise in overseas remittances, the current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 1.3% of GDP in the second quarter of FY 2025–26, down from 2.2% in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, the government release said.Remittance inflows rose by 10.7% year-on-year during the quarter, reinforcing external stability. With services exports maintaining momentum and remittance flows remaining strong, the CAD is expected to stay contained through 2025–26.“India’s growth outlook remains buoyant, with global and domestic institutions upgrading their assessments on the back of strong economic fundamentals. Reflecting broad-based momentum across key sectors, the Reserve Bank of India revised its GDP growth projection for FY 2025–26 upward from 6.8% to 7.3%,” the review said.","India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now.

Throwback 25: Five Indian Weapons That Crushed Terror And Dominated Pakistan in Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: India welcomed the New Year 2026 with vibrant celebrations across the country, as people gathered in large numbers to mark the occasion with joy and festivity on Thursday night.Cities came alive with fireworks, cultural events, live music performances, and themed decorations as the nation stepped into another year.The outgoing year, 2025, was remembered for India’s focus on reforms, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.“What makes the reforms of 2025 significant is not only their dimension but also their underlying philosophy. We modernised institutions, simplified governance, and strengthened the foundations for long-term inclusive growth,” he added, noting that his government prioritised collaboration over control and facilitation over regulation “in the true spirit of a modern democracy.”President Droupadi Murmu also extended New Year greetings to citizens in India and abroad, calling the occasion a symbol of renewed energy, positive change and fresh beginnings.“May the year 2026 bring peace, happiness and prosperity into our lives and infuse new energy to build a stronger and more prosperous India,” she said.In Delhi, popular spots including India Gate, Hauz Khas, Connaught Place were bustling with revelers celebrating the arrival of 2026.Ahead of the festivities, the Delhi Police shared a humorous social media post warning against drunk driving, saying, “Kuch Tests me Zero lana hi best hota hai.”In Bengaluru, large crowds of people gathered at the bustling intersections of Mahatma Gandhi Road and Brigade Road.Around five youths, who allegedly misbehaved with women revellers and later with police who questioned them, were detained at Church Street little before midnight. Another youth, in an inebriated condition and seen arguing heatedly with a police inspector at MG Road, was also detained and taken away from the spot.In Punjab, people gathered at the Golden Temple in Amritsar to welcome the New Year, while Mumbai saw large crowds at Juhu Beach, Chowpatty Beach, and Carter Road in Bandra. Marine Drive also drew many visitors eager to watch the spectacular fireworks display.","The outgoing year, 2025, was remembered for India’s focus on reforms, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.

US and India Stand Strong Against China: The Real Geopolitical Dynamics Unveiled,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-us-china-relations-strategic-altruism-keji-mao-trumps-second-term-shift-on-india-india-and-china-relations/articleshow/126273059.cms,"TL;DR: Driving the news

""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump

Why it matters: No more US “Strategic altruism” for India

The core claim of Mao, an analyst at China’s International Cooperation Center and founder of the South Asia Research Brief, starts with history. Since the late 1990s, he argues, Washington practiced what many Chinese scholars label “strategic altruism” toward India-absorbing real diplomatic costs to integrate New Delhi into the global order. The most visible example was the civil nuclear deal that carved out an exception to global nonproliferation norms. The logic: A rising democratic India would eventually help balance China in Asia.

That logic, Mao says, has broken down. During Donald Trump’s second term, the US imposed steep tariffs on Indian goods, raised visa fees, tightened outsourcing rules, and adopted rhetoric towards New Delhi that often sounded dismissive. Many Western observers, Mao notes, wave this away as a “Trump anomaly.” He rejects that view.

For Mao, the driver is structural. “The root driver is US anxiety over its declining strength, which now outweighs concern about external geopolitical threats.” In this frame, Washington is cautious with hard retaliators like China and Russia, but tougher on allies. His most vivid line captures the shift: Allies become “blood bags”, with the US preferring to squeeze partners for immediate gains over paying uncertain costs for long-run strategic contests.”

India, Mao argues, is especially exposed. It “has enjoyed US indulgence but lacks the industrial/economic heft of Japan, Europe or Korea to make major concessions-and is less willing to bend-so it is cast as ‘conspicuously ungrateful’.” Over time, he suggests, this friction could reduce tensions between Beijing and both Washington and New Delhi, paving the way for a realignment favorable to China.

The big picture

Zoom in: American decline, exaggerated

China’s numbers

Between the lines: Political turbulence in Beijing

Geography still matters

Why India won’t stay in China’s shadow

What next

Then as the Economist wrote, ""hubris haunts the Communist Party and in 2026 Mr Xi will be tempted to assert China’s interests more aggressively. That creates a risk of dangerous overreach in three areas: trade, Taiwan and new Chinese-run global rules.""

Bottom line

A new narrative about upcoming geopolitical upheaval is taking shape in a section of strategic analysts. As per this: China is destined for the top spot, while the United States and India slide into a “battle for second place. ”The argument is gaining traction among Chinese strategists and analysts, including Keji Mao, who says Washington’s long bet on India has soured and US decline anxiety is reshaping alliances.Mao’s logic is coherent-and comforting for Beijing. It fits a long-running Chinese conviction that American decline is destined and China’s rise is inevitable and durable. But it rests on assumptions that are far more fragile than they appear.However, the nature of power in the twenty-first century is not one-dimensional. It is a mosaic of capabilities-technological, financial, military, demographic, institutional-spread across domains and regions. In some, China will lead. In others, the US remains preeminent. India is carving out a distinct pole that neither mirrors China nor fully aligns with Washington.Framing the future as a simple race for first and second place flatters hierarchy but obscures how influence actually accumulates-and how constraints bite.The first weak link in Mao’s thesis is its linear view of US decline. History suggests a more cyclical pattern.From the Sputnik shock of the 1950s to Vietnam, from Japan’s rise in the 1980s to the 2008 financial crisis, predictions of American eclipse have been routine. Each time, internal dysfunction and polarization produced dire forecasts. Each time, scale, innovation, institutions, and alliances enabled adaptation.Trump can be read less as proof of terminal decline than as a backlash phase-an ugly but familiar spasm in democratic systems under stress. Democracies and market economies are messy, but they self-correct in ways centralized systems struggle to replicate.Nor does current evidence show a US retreat from Asia. Even amid trade disputes, Washington has deepened security cooperation with Japan, Australia, and the Philippines; reinforced ties with South Korea; expanded technology controls aimed squarely at China; and maintained a robust Indo-Pacific military posture. These are not the actions of a power resigning itself to second place.Also read: India–US ties: US embassy shares key moments of 2025; eyes stronger year ahead



Mao’s confidence also leans heavily on assumptions about China’s economic trajectory. Recent data complicate that story.As Bloomberg has reported, China’s economy looked resilient on the surface in 2025. Exports surged, growth hovered near the official target, and Beijing avoided a “bazooka” stimulus. Manufacturers moved up the value chain, and the trade surplus widened.Beneath the headlines, however, momentum has softened. Investment is heading for its first annual contraction since 1998. Retail sales growth has slowed to its weakest pace outside the pandemic. New home prices continue to fall, extending a property crisis with no clear end. To stabilize growth, Beijing has pledged broader fiscal support in 2026-targeting advanced manufacturing, technology innovation, and human capital.None of this signals collapse. But it does question the notion of effortless, linear ascent-and highlights the difficulty of rebalancing an economy while demographics worsen and political control tightens.Economic stress is compounded by political anxiety. Bloomberg reports that Xi Jinping probed a record number of senior officials for corruption in 2025, following earlier purges of top generals. With jockeying intensifying ahead of the next Communist Party congress, questions are emerging about governance quality and elite cohesion.As Alfred Wu of the National University of Singapore told Bloomberg, “For China, there is much more turbulence domestically.” Anti-corruption drives consolidate control, but they also raise uncomfortable questions about military readiness and decision-making in a system increasingly centered on a single leader.These internal stresses matter because they constrain how aggressively China can translate ambition into action abroad.GDP is not destiny. Geography and geopolitics remain powerful constraints-and here, China faces enduring disadvantages.China shares land borders with 14 countries and maritime boundaries with several more. It has unresolved disputes or strained relations with many of them, from India and Japan to the Philippines and Vietnam. That creates a neighborhood defined less by deference than by hedging and quiet balancing.Former Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan captured this reality in Foreign Policy: “No country will ever shun China. Every country wants as good a relationship with China as possible. But China’s overall geopolitical situation is not favorable.” He asks which states would “meekly acquiesce to China occupying the apex of a regional hierarchy.”For Japan, the Koreas, and Vietnam, national identities have long been defined in opposition to China’s civilizational pull. Subordination would require a wrenching redefinition of identity-making almost any alternative more attractive.This limits Beijing’s ability to convert economic weight into political dominance, a lesson the Soviet Union learned at great cost.Mao is right that India is not China in manufacturing-yet. But the leap from that observation to a future of permanent second place misses the dynamics of India’s rise.India’s strengths lie in demographics, services, digital public infrastructure, and strategic geography. Unlike China, India does not face the same pace of demographic aging. Its market size and political pluralism make it attractive to firms and governments seeking diversification away from China.India’s geography matters too. Sitting astride key Indian Ocean sea lanes and bordering China, it cannot be sidelined by Washington or easily coerced by Beijing. This gives New Delhi leverage-even when relations with the US are tense.US–India frictions under Trump are real. But friction is not rupture. Structural interests-balancing China, securing supply chains, cooperating on defense and technology-continue to pull the relationship back together. India’s rise does not depend solely on American indulgence; it rests on domestic reform, market scale, and a global environment eager for alternatives to China.For Beijing, the danger lies in mistaking temporary US–India strains for a permanent realignment. Overconfidence risks miscalculation-especially at a moment when domestic headwinds are rising and neighbors are wary.If Xi decides to invade Taiwan, whether in 2026 or 2027, China may get entangled in a protracted and unwinnable war. According to some calculations, even a blockade of Taiwan would lead to 7-9% decline in Chinese GDP. This may severely impact China's superpower aspirations.For Washington and New Delhi, the path ahead will be uneven. Trade disputes, immigration politics, and industrial competition will generate friction. But shared strategic interests and mutual leverage argue against a clean break.The more likely future is prolonged, contested coexistence: China rising but constrained; the US adapting rather than fading; India carving out a larger, more independent role.American decline is not destiny. India’s limitations are not permanent. And China’s rise-while real-is neither frictionless nor uncontested. The world they inhabit is too complex, too crowded, and too dynamic for any single power to conduct the orchestra alone.","Keji Mao: US anxiety over its declining strength now outweighs concern about external geopolitical threats. In this frame, Washington is cautious with hard retaliators like China and Russia, but tougher on allies. Mao’s logic is coherent-and comforting for Beijing. But it rests on assumptions that are far more fragile than they appear.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126274142,imgsize-1075489,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

NEW DELHI: BJP president J P Nadda on Wednesday accused Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge of spreading “falsehood” against the Narendra Modi government and said it was surprising that the main opposition party continued to peddle “lies” despite repeated electoral defeats.Nadda’s remarks came in response to a post by Kharge on X earlier in the day, in which the Congress president alleged that the BJP’s “loot, corruption and misgovernance” dominated the country in 2025.Hitting back, Nadda asked whether the Congress had anything left to do other than “spreading lies”.“The Congress lost in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and it was also completely wiped out in Delhi and Bihar. Mr. Kharge, in 2025, the people of the country rejected all of your lies. Despite this, you are still not giving up on spreading falsehoods,” Nadda said in a post on X.“There is no ground left beneath your feet, yet the amazing thing is that you still don't believe it,” he added, taking a swipe at the Congress through a Hindi couplet.The BJP chief urged Kharge to introspect instead of being “self-obsessed” and accused him of continuing to spread “lies”.In a point-by-point rebuttal of Kharge’s 14 allegations, Nadda rejected claims related to welfare schemes and election processes. On the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, he said, “You lied about MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), claiming it had been abolished and that the poor had been deprived of their right to work, while the truth is that it has been expanded and strengthened, with the number of workdays increased to 125 and payment guaranteed within 15 days. ”“And it has been linked to village empowerment. Incidentally, your leader was meeting anti-India people at George Soros-funded Global Progressive Alliance when the discussion was happening on it [Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill (VB-G RAM G)],” Nadda said, asking Kharge, “Isn't that right?”On allegations of “vote chori”, Nadda questioned how many petitions the Congress had filed before the Election Commission.“You once again lied about the SIR (Special Intensive Revision) and the BLO (booth level officer), claiming that people's right to vote was snatched away and that the BJP's vote-chori was caught. Mr. Kharge, it was the people of this country who caught your lies and your falsehoods were also rejected in court,” he said.Referring to Bihar, Nadda added, “What happened in Bihar, Mr. Kharge? How many of your booth level agents (BLAs) actually went to the ground? There was no theft of people's votes. They exercised their right to vote and shut down your shop of 'booth-theft and lies'.”Responding to Kharge’s criticism of the economy, Nadda said India was now the world’s fourth-largest economy and the fastest growing amid global uncertainty, contrasting it with the UPA years when the country was counted among the “fragile five”.“India's foreign exchange reserves are at a record high today, but you won't see it because you intend to defame the country,” he charged.On Kharge’s remarks on Aravalli mining, Nicobar, Hasdeo and Mumbai mangroves, Nadda accused the Congress of “hypocrisy” and spreading “falsehood”.“During the Congress rule, the hills were openly plundered. The Congress systematically destroyed the Aravalli range through extensive mining. Your government didn't save the Aravallis; instead, it sold them off. We, on the other hand, imposed a ban and limited mining in accordance with the court's decision,” he said.Nadda also targeted the Congress over its stance on the judiciary, alleging that no party had damaged its reputation as much.“When a judgment didn't go your way, you brought an impeachment motion against the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Now you've brought an impeachment motion against a judge of the Madras High Court. You insulted two Chief Justices while they were still in office,” he said.","BJP president J P Nadda accuses Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge of spreading “falsehood” against the Narendra Modi government.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

NEW DELHI: Days after Isro launched its heavy-lift rocket LVM3 carrying US BlueBird Block-2 satellite, rocket debris, suspected of the Indian space rocket, washed ashore on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka. The rocket part was found on Sunday evening along the Malai Munthal sea stretch near Trincomalee. Local residents and fishermen first spotted the object after it was pushed ashore by strong ocean currents, prompting alerts to Sri Lankan authorities.Experts suspect the fragment is a portion of the payload fairing, the protective shell that houses satellites, which typically detaches during the rocket's ascent. The payload fairing is five metre in diameter and 10 metre long. Following the spotting of the debris, Lankan naval officials were deployed to secure the site. This is not the first such incident in the region. In the past, debris from rockets launched from Sriharikota had occasionally been recovered in the waters of Sri Lanka and the Maldives.In the past, parts of Indian rocket debris were also found on the Australian coast. On July 31, 2013, officials had identified an object found on a beach in Western Australia to be a part of a rocket launched by Isro. The Australian Space Agency had then said it was likely debris from the “expended third-stage of a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle”.","The rocket part was found on Sunday evening along the Malai Munthal sea stretch near Trincomalee. The fragment is a portion of the payload fairing, the protective shell that houses satellites, which typically detaches during the rocket's ascent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126278699,imgsize-43208,width-400,resizemode-4/suspected-lvm3-rocket-debris.jpg"

SC handled 75k cases in 2025, unmatched by any top court

NEW DELHI: CJI Surya Kant has devised four categories of cases to prioritise listing and hearing of petitions filed by socially, physically, and financially disadvantaged people.The new categories of cases relate to those filed by disabled people and acid attack survivors, by senior citizens above 80 years, persons who are below poverty line and those who have approached the court through legal aid services that provide free advocate assistance to poor litigants.The new categorisation was needed as their cases used to get lost in the crowd of 800-odd cases that get listed on Mondays and Fridays, the two days in a week when 16 benches of SC entertain fresh petitions and determine whether these require longer hearing.A circular by the SC registry said, ""Members of the Bar, parties-in-person and all stakeholders are required to invariably mention the relevant head... under which the matter actually falls, in all the fresh petitions to be filed... and submit an appropriate application/letter along with the documentary proof issued by an appropriate govt authority in this regard.""Further, all concerned are also requested to provide the said details in pending matters/cases to enable the registry to appropriately update the matter under the respective head.This will enable the registry to prioritise listing of such cases,"" it said.The humongous volume of cases handled by the highest court of the country is unmatched by any country's Supreme Court, by a huge margin. In 2025, as many as 75,280 cases were filed in SC - 51,357 civil and 23,923 criminal. It decided 65,403 (87% of the total filing), 42,793 civil and 22,610 criminal.In contrast, though thousands of cases are filed every year in US Supreme Court, it accepts only 70-80 cases for arguments. Till Dec 29, UK Supreme Court had received little over 200 cases and gave judgments in around 50 cases. Their Indian counterpart gave 1,400 lengthy judgments and thousands of orders to dispose of cases.SC, which saw three CJIs in 2025 in Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B R Gavai and Surya Kant, will not see a new CJI till Feb 2027, when Justice Kant retires.In 2027, SC will see a record four CJIs - Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath (from Feb to Sep), BV Nagarathna (for 37 days) and PS Narasimha.","SC handled 75k cases in 2025, unmatched by any top court in the world.

Terror, Tariffs, Polls: PM Modi’s Mic-Drop Moments That Set The Agenda In 2025

NEW DELHI: The Pragati-led ecosystem for monitoring of projects and flagship schemes has helped accelerate projects worth more than Rs 85 lakh crore in the past decade, PM Modi said Wednesday while chairing the 50th Pragati meeting online with secretaries and chief secretaries.Modi described the milestone as a symbol of the deep transformation India has witnessed in the culture of governance over the last decade. In a statement, the PMO said Modi shared clear expectations for the next phase, outlining his ""vision of reform, perform and transform, saying reform to simplify, perform to deliver, transform to impact"". He said reform must mean moving from process to solutions, simplifying procedures and making systems more friendly for 'ease of living and ease of doing business'.It added the PM spoke how outcome-driven governance has been strengthened through Pragati. He also said transformation must be measured by what citizens actually feel about timely services, faster grievance resolution and improved 'ease of living'.""The PM underlined that when decisions are timely, coordination is effective and accountability is fixed, the speed of govt functioning naturally increases and its impact becomes visible directly in citizens' lives,"" it said.On Wednesday, the PM reviewed five infrastructure projects across sectors, including road, railways, power, water resources and coal, with a cumulative cost of more than Rs 40,000 crore.During a review of the PM SHRI scheme, Modi said that the scheme must become a national benchmark for holistic and future-ready school education and added that implementation should be outcome oriented rather than infrastructure centric. He asked all chief secretaries to closely monitor the scheme and asked them to make efforts to see that PM SHRI schools become benchmark for other schools of state govts.He suggested senior officers should undertake field visits to evaluate the performance of PM SHRI schools.Recalling the origin of Pragati, PM said as Gujarat CM, he had launched the technology-enabled Swagat platform (State Wide Attention on Grievances by Application of Technology) to understand and resolve public grievances with discipline, transparency and time-bound action. Building on that experience, after assuming office at the Centre, he expanded the same spirit nationally through Pragati, bringing large projects, major programmes and grievance redressal onto one integrated platform for review, resolution, and follow-up.","Modi described the milestone as a symbol of the deep transformation India has witnessed in the culture of governance over the last decade.

Australia, US And UK Raise Alarm Over Fake Rabies Vaccine As India Pushes Back On Claims

NEW DELHI: The Centre has banned the manufacture, sale and distribution of all oral formulations of nimesulide above 100 mg in immediate-release form, citing risk to human health and the availability of safer alternatives.In a notification issued on Dec 29 and published in The Gazette of India, the health ministry said it was satisfied that continued use of higher-dose nimesulide was ""likely to involve risk to human beings"" and that the prohibition was necessary in public interest.Nimesulide is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used for pain, inflammation and fever. The ban applies only to oral formulations above 100 mg in immediate-release form and takes effect immediately. Lower-dose formulations are not covered.The order has been issued under Section 26A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, after consultation with the Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB), and bars manufacturers, distributors and sellers from producing or supplying the banned formulations.Nimesulide has been under regulatory scrutiny for over a decade. In 2011, the central govt prohibited six drugs, including nimesulide, following DTAB recommendations, and barred its use in children below 12 years amid concerns over liver toxicity.Earlier this year, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) also flagged safety concerns, recommending restrictions on nimesulide use in patients below 18 years and above 60 years, and advising that formulations above 100 mg be banned. In India, the drug is sold under brands such as Nimulid, Nimtex and Nicip, with Nise among the largest-selling brands.Welcoming the move, Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine, Max Hospital, Saket, said, ""This is a prudent and timely decision taken by govt. The restriction on high-dose immediate-release nimesulide addresses a long-standing safety concern, especially when misused or taken without supervision. With safer NSAID alternatives readily available, limiting exposure to higher doses is clearly in the interest of patient safety.

NEW DELHI: A Kolkata-based businessman weaved a web of 60 shell companies with drivers, house-keeping staff, office boys, junior staff and relatives as directors and created a fictitious turnover of thousands of crores in iron & steel manufacturing, all on paper with no real business activity involved, and swindled a consortium of govt banks of more than Rs 6,200 crore, with the head of one of the lead banks playing accessory.The scam was scripted by Sanjay Sureka, who created dozens of shell entities and with the help of S K Goel, then CMD of Uco Bank, managed to get loans of Rs 6,200 crore. ""Against loans of over Rs 6,200 crore, the company's liquidation value barely reached Rs 600 crore, and assets sold so far have realised only Rs 434 crore,"" ED has said in its investigation report.The entire operation was unearthed with Goel's arrest by ED on May 16 at his residence in New Delhi. The agency later identified properties worth over Rs 106 crore associated with family members and aides and attached them. Sureka and his associates were arrested in Dec 2024, as the agency started probing money laundering based on a CBI FIR against them.According to an ED investigation report, at the centre of this scam was Concast Steel & Power Ltd (CSPL) - once a flagship iron & steel group with plants across West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh - which was taken over by Sureka in 2008.Sureka conjured up the shell entities and with the help of Goel, who served as CMD of Uco Bank between 2007-2010, managed to get a total of Rs 6,200 crore in loans without interest and penalty.This money was laundered by the accused and quid pro quo to Goel was transferred in the name of shell companies that purchased properties on the bank CMD's behalf with the ownership of these firms later being transferred to Goel's family members.""It is a case study in how an entire financial ecosystem can be manipulated through fake turnover, circular transactions and system-wide blind spots, ultimately leaving public sector banks poorer by more than Rs 6,210.7 crore, excluding interest,"" a senior official said.The official further said 60 shell companies sprang up under the directorship of drivers, office boys and junior staff to help Sureka justify massive flows of funds.ED's investigation unearthed fake sales, purchases and transport billings where CSPL ""pretended to buy and sell iron and steel products"" with associated entities, backed by forged invoices, ledger entries, and transport documents. ""Fake transportation receipts were prepared to show trucks carrying goods between factories and shell companies, even though no truck ever moved, no goods were loaded, and no delivery was made. Yet on paper, CSPL looked like a bustling, high-volume operation with continuous production and sales,"" a source said.The probe further revealed that neither sale proceeds nor payments for purchases were made through banks, 99% of the transactions were merely book entries. Yet, during the entire operation lasting several years, it did not raise any alarm bells in the banks, which continued lending.""This meant Concast was essentially selling to itself and then realising these payments through accounting fiction. By 2017, the deception hit its peak - 99% of all sales to these entities were settled through book adjustments, not a single real rupee flowed in through the banking system,"" sources said.Purchases tell the same story. Over 50% of all raw material sourcing came from the same web of related-party entities. And just like sales, almost 90% of payments to these ""suppliers"" were made through internal adjustments - no real cash outflow, no genuine material movement, just rotating entries to manufacture expenses, inflate working capital needs, and justify massive fund withdrawals, the probe report said.","The scam was scripted by Sanjay Sureka, who created dozens of shell entities.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

NEW DELHI: Isro has started the process to develop a third launchpad at the Sriharikota spaceport as it gears up for future launches of heavy satellites.The agency is currently identifying right vendors for it, a senior scientist said. To move ahead with its plan of placing bigger satellites, weighing over 12,000-14,000 kg, in various orbits in space, Isro requires bigger launch vehicles, Padmakumar ES, director and distinguished scientist of Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, said. To serve this purpose, Isro is planning a third launchpad, he said. “We plan to develop, install and commission a third launchpad in four years. Activities are going on for that,” he recently told the media.On Jan 16, 2025, the Union cabinet had approved the establishment of the third launchpad (TLP) at the Sriharikota launch complex, spread over about 175 sq km and located around 135 km east of Chennai. Worth Rs 3,984.8 crore, the launchpad project is targeted for completion within four years, with full operational readiness projected by March 2029. Critical milestones include civil works by May 2028, fluid and propellant systems by July 2028, and launch facility integration by Sept 2028.The TLP will cater to Next Generation Launch Vehicles and will support as standby launchpad for the existing two launchpads — first launchpad (serving PSLV and SSLV missions since 1993) and second launchpad (operational since 2003 for GSLV and LVM3 missions), significantly expanding launch frequency and redundancy.The TLP will be realised with maximum industry participation fully utilising Isro’s experience in establishing earlier launchpads and maximally sharing existing launch complex facilities. It will position India among leading spacefaring nations with advanced infrastructure capable of supporting next-generation rockets. This has far-reaching implications for commercial launch services, space exploration and international partnerships.","Isro has started the process to develop a third launchpad at the Sriharikota spaceport.

From Missiles To Torpedoes, DRDO Outlines India’s Big Defence Push For Near-Term Battlefield Edge

Pralay missile

NEW DELHI: Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) on Wednesday morning successfully conducted a salvo launch of two ‘Pralay’ missiles in quick succession from the same launcher at the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur, off the coast of Odisha.Defence minister Rajnath Singh has complimented DRDO, IAF, Indian Army, defence PSUs and the industry on the successful launch of the missiles in quick succession. The completion of the salvo launch (simultaneous firing) of Pralay has established the reliability of the missile, he said. Pralay is an indigenously developed solid propellant quasi-ballistic missile employing state-of-the-art guidance and navigation to ensure high precision. The missile is capable of carrying multiple types of warheads against various targets.The Pralay test came just a day after India conducted the first flight test of the Pinaka Long-Range Guided Rocket, also from Chandipur, on Monday and test-fired a 3,500-km range K-4 ballistic missile from the nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Dec 23. India is developing an array of missiles to reinforce its defences against hostile forces and be ready for counter-attacks.According to a defence ministry’s statement, the flight test around 10.30 am was conducted as part of user evaluation trials. Both missiles followed the intended trajectory and met all flight objectives, as confirmed by tracking sensors deployed by the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur. The terminal events were confirmed by telemetry systems installed on board the ship, deployed near the impact points.DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat has congratulated the teams involved in the successful flight-tests and stated that the achievement indicates imminent readiness of induction of the system with the users.The missile has been developed by Research Centre Imarat, Hyderabad, in collaboration with other DRDO laboratories. For the tests, the systems were integrated by two development-cum-production partners.Pralay is equipped with an advanced Inertial Navigation System (INS), complemented by a radio frequency seeker to ensure accurate guidance throughout its flight. These systems enable the missile to maintain a precise trajectory and achieve a high level of target accuracy. Officials said the latest user trials were aimed at validating the missile’s navigation and precision strike capabilities under operational conditions in order to prepare it for induction into the armed forces.",Pralay is an indigenously developed solid propellant quasi-ballistic missile employing state-of-the-art guidance and navigation to ensure high precision.

HYDERABAD: Gig workers unions have renewed their demand for the removal of 10-minute delivery options and the restoration of earlier payout structures, ahead of a nationwide strike scheduled on Wednesday.The Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU) president, Shaik Salauddin, said the fast-delivery model was placing unsafe pressure on workers, while changes in payment systems had reduced earnings.He said thousands of workers across the country were preparing to participate in the protest, which could disrupt delivery services during peak hours.“Our demand to the platform companies was that our old payout structure be reinstated and that the 10-minute delivery option be removed from all platforms. We had called for a strike on the 25th and 31st, and on the 25th, 40 thousand workers across India came out in support of it. We are ready to discuss and talk about it. We request the state and central government also to interfere in this,” Salauddin told ANI.According to the union, the protest has already begun in phases. Salauddin said that on December 25, around 40,000 workers across India joined demonstrations, leading to delays in more than half of deliveries.“On the 25th, around 40,000 workers across India joined the protest, due to which 50 to 60 per cent of orders were delayed. What happened on December 25 was just the trailer; the real picture will be seen on December 31,” he said.The strike is being organised under the banner of the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT), which represents delivery workers and drivers associated with companies such as Swiggy, Zomato, Zepto and Amazon.“People can see that we have been continuously raising our demands with platform companies. We have placed five key demands before them. Our first demand is that the old payout structure should be restored. Earlier, during festivals such as Dussehra, Diwali, and Bakrid, fair payments were made. That system must be implemented again regularly,” Salauddin said.The union leader also criticised what he described as opaque, algorithm-driven management systems, alleging that workers’ incomes had suffered as a result.“The algorithm controls workers' businesses. Incentives are not being paid properly, and there is no clarity. We also want a proper grievance redressal mechanism and social security benefits,” he added.Salauddin claimed the movement had the backing of more than 1.5 lakh workers nationwide and accused aggregator companies of attempting to intimidate those participating in the protest.“Workers are being threatened. Bouncers are being deployed near warehouses, and IDs are being blocked through team leaders and area managers. This kind of pressure will not work,” he said.In Patna, the constant hum of motorcycles has become one of the city’s defining sounds. But this isn’t the noise of convenience or leisure—it’s the soundtrack of work under extreme pressure.Thousands of delivery riders are racing against digital timers that dictate not just their pay, but also their safety and dignity.For 25-year-old Kishan Kumar, the pressure is unrelenting. Each delivery comes with a 15-minute window, after which penalties are applied automatically, ratings drop, and incentives vanish. “We don’t drive recklessly by choice. It’s a desperate tactic to survive peak traffic hours. When roads are clear, we often hit 80-90 km/h because the app only recognises speed as performance,” Kishan explained. He admits to frequently riding on the wrong side of the road, fully aware that one slip could be fatal—all to deliver a single grocery order on time.India’s first women-led national trade union for gig and platform workers, the Gig & Platform Services Workers Union (GIPSWU) has also called a nationwide strike.Workers across the country are expected to switch off the apps they use to deliver food, groceries, and other services, bringing operations to a halt.Nirmal Gorana, GIPSWU’s national coordinator, said the strike follows a successful digital action on December 25, when about 5,000 workers in Delhi NCR went offline.“Gig workers nationwide are now showing solidarity through the December 31 strike, highlighting the sector’s collective strength and the economy’s dependence on their labour,” he added.The strike draws attention to persistent challenges faced by gig workers, including lack of basic labour rights, harassment, discrimination, and unsafe working conditions. GIPSWU is urging central and state governments to address key demands in line with labour laws.These include setting minimum per-kilometre rates, ensuring workplace safety for women, providing maternity and emergency leave, and legally recognising platform workers as “workers” under labour law.","Gig workers unions have renewed their demand for the removal of 10-minute delivery options and the restoration of earlier payout structures.

'Want approachable people's courts'

Justice Surya Kant, Known For Article 370 Ruling And Pegasus Scrutiny, Takes Oath As India’s New CJI

Now, lawyers can't argue for days in high-stake cases

NEW DELHI: If a citizen faces a legal emergency or is threatened with arrest by probe agencies at unearthly hours, the person will be able to seek a hearing from constitutional courts even in the dead of night for protection of fundamental rights and liberties, the Chief Justice of India said.""My endeavour is and will be to make the Supreme Court and high courts people's courts which can be approached at any time beyond working hours in legal emergencies,"" CJI Surya Kant told TOI.The CJI said one of his priorities is to set up as many constitution benches as possible to deal with pending petitions raising several important constitutional issues - like the one thrown up by a bunch of petitions challenging validity of special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, which started from Bihar and is now being carried out in a dozen states. The bench on SIR would take up the issues after conclusion of the countrywide updation of electoral rolls.CJI Kant said he would also examine the feasibility of setting up a nine-judge bench to decide many petitions that articulate the clash between religious freedom and women's rights. The issue arises in three categories of cases, including petitions seeking review of the SC order allowing women of all ages into Sabarimala temple.By custom, women of menstruating age were barred from going inside Sabarimala shrine. Another set of pleas challenge the practice of female genital mutilation among Dawoodi Bohra Muslim community and the ban on entry of women into mosques, and, the third set question denial of entry into Agiary (Zoroastrian temple) of Parsi women who marry outside the community.In another significant development, it would no longer be permissible for renowned lawyers to argue for days together in high-stake matters. CJI Surya Kant has decided to enforce strict timelines for advocates to complete arguments.""The constitutional courts will function like hospitals with emergency wards. In case of a legal emergency, a citizen, irrespective of status, can knock on the doors of Supreme Court even at midnight to seek redress of an urgent grievance and seek protection of individual rights and liberty,"" CJI Kant said.There will never be another case like the one arising from settlement dispute between Ambani brothers in which lawyers argued for 26 days in SC. ""This is to ensure that poor litigants not only get free legal assistance but also an equal share of court time during hearing of their cases,"" the CJI said.Apart from mandatory submission of written submissions not exceeding five pages at least three days prior to the hearing, SC has issued a circular saying, ""Senior advocates, arguing counsel and/or advocate-on-record, shall submit the timelines for making oral arguments in all post-notice and regular hearing matters, at least a day prior to the commencement of the hearing of the case.""To speed up hearing in pending cases, the CJI said, ""Various special categories have been identified for priority listing to send a message that Supreme Court is a people's court.""",Chief Justice of India Surya Kant wants constitutional courts to be 'people's courts' Citizens will be able to seek a hearing from constitutional courts even in the dead of night. Lawyers can't argue for days in high-stake cases.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126261365,imgsize-26276,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court-chief-justice-surya-kant.jpg"

The combined net worth of Trea and Kristen Turner in 2025





There is not a group of shortstops of the modern world who have combined the concepts of speed, reliability and market longevity in the same manner that Trea Turner has done. In 2025, the Philadelphia Phillies star has become one of the best in baseball, not only because of his offering on the field but also due to the financial framework that he has undertaken over the last 11 years in the league.Timing has been one of the major factors that have led to the success of Turner, as the company has managed to capitalize on its short-term prospects to create long-term stability through consistent production. With him is his wife, Kristen Turner, whose own athletic background and long time history have tampered insidiously at the personal front of his career. Their joint net worth is a sign of patience, planning and longevity.By 2025, the MLB salaries have made Trea Turner have a net worth of about $40 million, which is virtually all the net worth. His financial zenith came in December 2022, when he opened a deal with the Philadelphia Phillies of 11 years and a total of 300 million dollars, driving his yearly income to 27 million dollars.Turner had negotiated his way through the arbitration years before that deal, with his market value steadily increasing with a series of one-year contracts.That, along with a signing bonus of $2.9 million at the start of his career and a one-year contract with the Dodgers in 2022 worth $21 million, contributed to him making approximately $45 million in salary alone in the first 6 seasons in his career in the MLB. The Phillies contract subsequently made security long-term.Kristen Turner, who used to be known as Kristen Harebedian, has not yet publicly disclosed her net worth. She was a native of Flemington, New Jersey, and a starred gymnast, with state and national competitions in high school, and a competitive career at North Carolina State University. She had a high level of discipline and competitive experience as she had numerous EAGL All-Tournament and All-Conference awards in her collegiate career.Despite no longer being an active professional, her sports experience and constant presence have been one of the components of the off-field support system of Turner since they met in college and got married in 2018.As of 2025, Trea and Kristen Turner have an estimated net worth of about $40 to $41 million in common. Although the number is motivated, first of all, by the MLB contracts of Turner, it also represents a career of a patient and stable man outside the subsidiary. The combination of their financial profile is a story of a modern successful MLB which is based on an established consistency and is not about a one-time fortune.","Trea Turner and his wife Kristen have a combined net worth of $40 to $41 million in 2025.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Meet Google executive 'responsible' for Sam Altman sending 'Code Red' to OpenAI employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-google-executive-responsible-for-sam-altman-sending-code-red-to-openai-employees/articleshow/126187250.cms,"Google's Josh Woodward has jolted OpenAI, forcing a 'code red' with his Gemini app's rapid success. Gemini's user growth and image generation capabilities have challenged ChatGPT's dominance, leading to a significant shift in the AI landscape. Woodward's ability to cut through bureaucracy and his team's innovative approach are credited for Google's AI resurgence, impacting Alphabet's stock and OpenAI's strategic plans.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The numbers tell a brutal story for ChatGPT

The secret weapon: Breaking Google's legendary bureaucracy





Josh Woodward isn't a household name in Silicon Valley, but the 42-year-old Google veteran has accomplished what seemed impossible just months ago—he's made the world's most powerful AI company sweat. The executive leading Google's Gemini app triggered such alarm at OpenAI that CEO Sam Altman declared an internal ""code red"" in early December, forcing the startup to abandon lucrative projects and scramble to defend its eroding market position.Woodward's impact has been devastating for OpenAI. Since taking charge of the Gemini app in April while simultaneously running Google Labs, he's orchestrated a comeback that's transformed Google from AI afterthought to existential threat. His team's viral Nano Banana image generator crashed Google's own infrastructure in August, generating so much traffic that the company's custom AI chips nearly ""melted,"" according to CNBC reports from a November all-hands meeting.Google's resurgence under Woodward's leadership has fundamentally rewritten the competitive landscape. Gemini's monthly active users grew from 350 million in March to 650 million by October, coming close to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly users. By September, Gemini had dethroned ChatGPT atop Apple's App Store after generating 5 billion images.The impact runs deeper than raw user counts. Data from Similarweb reveals that Gemini has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months, surging from 5.4% to 18.2%.This gain came directly at ChatGPT's expense—OpenAI's flagship product plummeted from commanding 87.2% market share to just 68%, a staggering 19-point drop.The blow came in late November when Google announced Gemini 3, a LLM model that outperformed OpenAI's flagship products on industry benchmarks and sent Alphabet's stock soaring. Within days, Altman issued his ""code red"" memo, delaying OpenAI's planned advertising business, e-commerce expansion, and AI agent development to pour resources into improving ChatGPT's core experience. The desperation was palpable—this was OpenAI's most decisive admission yet of the competitive pressure threatening its $500 billion valuation.Woodward's success stems from an unusual talent in Google's notoriously slow-moving culture. Colleagues told CNBC he's mastered the art of demolishing bureaucratic barriers through systems like ""block,"" where employees flag roadblocks for his team to immediately resolve. Former Google Labs co-lead Clay Bavor says Woodward's ability to ""move fast, break down barriers and execute"" has landed him ""right at the center of the most important work at Google. ""His track record speaks volumes. NotebookLM became an instant hit after its July 2023 launch. His quarterly newsletter grew so influential that Google executives routinely seek his reading recommendations. He responds directly to user complaints on X and Reddit, bringing feedback to engineers for rapid fixes—a level of user engagement that's helped Gemini gain trust and momentum.OpenAI fired back earlier this month with GPT-5.2, claiming benchmark superiority once again. But Woodward holds structural advantages that terrify OpenAI: Google's massive cash reserves, custom AI chips, and nine products with over 1 billion users each. While OpenAI burns through funding rounds to survive, Woodward's operation runs on profits from YouTube and search. Alphabet's 62% stock surge in 2025 outpaced all megacap peers—a dramatic reversal from its brutal first quarter that vindicated Woodward's strategy.","Google's Gemini app has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months.

Gold and silver price prediction:

Gold and silver prices are likely to maintain their bullish trend with dips and consolidation phases in between, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

He shares his views on gold and silver:

MCX Gold Outlook

Target: 140000

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

MCX Gold has retreated toward its breakout zone after marking an all-time high of 140,465. With the broader trend still positive, we view this correction as a buying opportunity. As long as prices hold above the breakout support, the overall outlook for MCX Gold remains bullish.From a technical perspective, immediate support is placed around the 132,000 level, which marks the breakout from the prior swing high. Any retracement toward this area is expected to attract fresh buying interest, thereby capping near-term downside. Holding this support level keeps the bullish structure intact.On the upside, MCX Gold is poised to advance toward the 140,000 level in the upcoming sessions. This projected target is well aligned with the broader bullish trend and reflects the underlying strength of established market momentum.Furthermore, a decisive and sustained breakout above intermediate resistance level could attract additional buying interest, thereby reinforce the positive sentiment and extend the upward move further.Overall, MCX Gold is expected to maintain its positive bias unless there is a clear and decisive break below the 132,000 support level. The broader technical structure remains constructive and continues to favour trend continuation. Provided that momentum indicators and overall market sentiment continue to remain supportive, the precious metal is expected to experience further upside potential in the coming sessions.MCX Silver has recorded an all-time high, followed by a subsequent correction from those levels. Despite this pullback, prices continue to trade with a positive bias, and we expect consolidation around the recent highs. Such consolidation phases generally signal a temporary balance between buyers and sellers, and a breakout from the current formation may trigger an accelerated price move as momentum builds and the prevailing trend resumes.From a technical standpoint, a rebound from the support level signals renewed strength in the trend and raises the probability of further upside. As long as prices hold above the weekly support levels, the bullish bias is likely to remain intact. The immediate key support is identified near the 221,000 level, which now acts as a strong base.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"'Elections are taking place after 9 years': 227 seats, 2,516 aspirants; what led to rush for BMC poll tickets",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/elections-are-taking-place-after-9-years-227-seats-2516-aspirants-what-led-to-rush-for-bmc-poll-tickets/articleshow/126282299.cms,"The BMC polls saw an intense scramble for tickets, with 2,516 candidates filing nominations for 227 seats, 84% on the final day

'Batenge Toh Katenge': Uddhav & Raj Thackeray Unite For Mumbai Civic Polls | Shiv Sena (UBT) | MNS

MUMBAI: In the days leading up to the nomination deadline for the BMC polls, the frenzy for tickets was unmistakable. From political heavyweights pushing family members into the fray, to grassroots karyakartas staking their claim, and recent turncoats seeking immediate political rehabilitation, every party saw intense pressure to accommodate aspirants.The numbers reflect this scramble. For the 227 seats on offer, 2,516 candidates filed nomination forms, of which 2,122—nearly 84% of the total—were filed on the final day, December 30, clearly pointing at both the high stakes and last-minute negotiations that defined this election cycle.TOI spoke to senior politicians, election analysts and political researchers to understand what is driving candidates to the contest beyond sheer political ambition.Sanjay Patil, research assistant, department of civics and politics, University of Mumbai; who authored a report ‘Contesting municipal elections-Motivations & Strategies (A Study of BMC election 2012 And 2017),’ points to a convergence of political and economic factors driving the unprecedented scramble for tickets this time.“Municipal elections in Mumbai are taking place after a gap of nine years, which makes them crucial entry points into formal politics for many aspirants,” Patil said.“Additionally, splits within major political parties such as the Shiv Sena and NCP have sharply expanded political ambition, with more factions and claimants seeking space.”Patil added that Mumbai’s evolving political economy has further fuelled the rush. “Over the past two decades, redevelopment and cluster development have significantly altered the city’s power structure. Control over municipal decision-making offers access to policy, resources and influence, making the civic body an attractive platform for those looking to advance both political and personal agendas,” he said.His research also revealed a gender dynamic. According to Patil, several male politicians strategically marry women with Other Backward Class (OBC) certificates to enable their wives to contest from reserved wards. “Even today, it remains difficult for women to break into the electoral fray independently,” he said. “Reservation offers them an entry point, but it also compels them to prepare, perform and prove themselves at the same electoral level once elected. ”Other analysts pointed out that several heavyweight politicians have secured tickets for family members as a way of safeguarding and extending their political legacy. The latest round of ticket distribution, they said, clearly reflects a preference across parties for keeping power concentrated within political families.“Across party lines, the message is clear: leaders want their homes to remain power centres,” said political analyst Surendra Jondhale. “Fielding family members is a way of ensuring continued representation and influence within the municipal corporation.”Jondhale added that holding an elected position also brings an informal layer of protection and access. “Corporators are in constant touch with multiple power centres—from the police and wardlevel municipal machinery to, in some cases, city-level authorities. For prominent corporators, this access significantly strengthens their political leverage,” he said.A senior BJP leader said the party’s strong electoral performance in recent years has further fuelled the rush to contest civic polls, with many aspirants viewing this as the most opportune moment to enter the fray.“Our strike rate in successive elections has been exceptionally high, which has encouraged not just party workers but also leaders from other parties to join us with the expectation of securing a ticket,” the leader said.He added that ticket distribution, however, was far from automatic. “The party conducted internal surveys and sought detailed feedback from core committee members at multiple levels before finalising candidates. Those who failed to perform in the previous election were denied tickets this time,” the leader said, underscoring the BJP’s emphasis on winnability and performance.","The BMC polls saw an intense scramble for tickets, with 2,516 candidates filing nominations for 227 seats, 84% on the final day.
