Actor lost money to cyber fraudster for the second time in less than four months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/actor-lost-money-to-cyber-fraudster-for-the-second-time-in-less-than-four-months/articleshow/109850129.cms,"MUMBAI: A fraudster fraudulently transferred a total of Rs4.98 lakhs from the nationalised bank account that is jointly owned by Bollywood and television actor Rakesh Bedi (69) and his wife Aradhana (59) on Friday. The Oshiwara police , who registered the case, stated that it was a single transaction carried out to siphon the money.The fraudster successfully transferred the funds without requiring a one-time password ( OTP ) or any link shared with Bedi's wife.""We have got in touch with the bank's nodal officer to block the account to which the money was credited after siphoned from Bedi's account. The cyber wing of the police station is attempting to trace the money trails to all the banks where it has been credited,” said a police officer from the Oshiwara police station.The officer mentioned that this is a distinctive method of operation where the fraudster did not acquire any data through links, remote access, or OTP to commit the fraud. Bedi's spouse, Aradhana, did not answer the call from TOI, while the actor mentioned that he would respond later.In the complaint, Bedi's wife said: ""I was at my Andheri (West) home when I received at least five calls from an unknown number at 7.15 pm on Friday. But, I did not respond to the calls. Finally, I attended the sixth call and the caller informed that his account has been wrongly credited with Rs4,98,694.50 that was debited from account. The person informed that an OTP has been sent to my mobile and asked to share the same. I immediately disconnected the call suspecting something amiss.""An officer from Oshiwara police mentioned that the wife of the actor examined her text messages on the mobile and observed an OTP notification. ""She immediately logged into netbanking and noticed Rs4.98 lakhs has been debited from the joint account despite not sharing any details. The situation is unique because the fraudster managed to transfer the funds without the actor's wife sharing any confidential banking information or OTP,” said the officer.In December 2023, Bedi was deceived of Rs85,000 by an individual who falsely claimed to be a member of the army and expressed interest in purchasing his Pune flat valued at Rs87 lakhs. The individual requested Bedi to transfer the funds under the pretense of transferring double the amount, citing restrictions on direct fund transfers from an Army account. The Oshiwara police filed a case on December 30 after Bedi discovered that he had been deceived.",A fraudster fraudulently transferred a total of Rs4.98 lakhs from the nationalised bank account that is jointly owned by Bollywood and television actor Rakesh Bedi (69) and his wife Aradhana (59) The fraudster successfully transferred the funds without requiring a one-time password ( OTP ) or any link shared with Bedi's wife.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109850152,imgsize-14298,width-400,resizemode-4/109850152.jpg"

Minor & Erred: Doing right by the juveniles in Bengaluru

Mahadesh, 33, turned to theft for survival, caught, and sent to juvenile special home. Kiran's copper wire theft reflects undiagnosed youth mental health issues. Farooq's drug addiction tale leads to theft.

New Delhi: Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud on Saturday expressed concern over growing footprint of juveniles in cybercrime and suggested that countries and their agencies should cooperate to deal with the problem.Speaking at a National Symposium on Juvenile Justice organised in Nepal, Justice Chandrachud said that specific training programmes should be evolved by incorporating principles of trauma-informed care and by emphasising sensitivity and empathy towards juvenile offenders who may have experienced adverse experiences in life.“The changing nature of crimes, particularly with the increasing prevalence of digital crime, poses new challenges for juvenile justice systems globally. Recent data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in India, unveiled last month, paints a concerning picture regarding cybercrimes. In 2022, the reported number of cases (involving juveniles) surged from 345 to 685 compared to 2021, nearly doubling within a year,” the CJI, who is the first CJI to visit Nepal in his official capacity, said.He said there is a need for proactive measures to educate and safeguard young individuals in the digital age.

55% Covidshield recipients had mild side effects: AMCH study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/55-covidshield-recipients-had-mild-side-effects-amch-study/articleshow/109845602.cms,"GUWAHATI: A study conducted by physician-scientists from Assam Medical College Hospital (Dibrugarh), supported by ICMR-recognised multidisciplinary research laboratory, has revealed that 55% of Covishield vaccine recipients experienced only minor side effects like fever and headache. These symptoms occurred within a week of getting inoculated with the first dose.Researchers confirmed no long-term adverse effects after a year.“In our study, we found that 55% experienced minor adverse events such as fever, headache, body ache and pain at the injection site. The remaining 45% of the recipients had no adverse events at all. After the second dose, only 6.8% showed minor adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). Most importantly, no participant showed any major adverse events during the entire one year period of study,” said associate professor of pathology at AMCH, Gayatri Gogoi, the principal investigator of the study done in Assam’s Dibrugarh district.The major (serious and severe) adverse events were defined as disabling, rare life-threatening conditions that may lead to long-term problems. “The young individuals had more minor adverse events than the elderly individuals. What is also intriguing to note is that those who had comorbidities or other health conditions showed less adverse events,” she added.The study was conducted from July 2021 when the first Covishield vaccine for the public was introduced and participants were followed up till June 2022 after receiving the approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee to conduct the same. This data of research findings was recently accepted for publication in a well-known PubMed indexed journal named Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.The doctor-research investigators felt the need of sharing the real-time research data from Dibrugarh district, led by Gayatri Gogoi, who is also a renowned cancer researcher, along with Dr Gourangie Gogoi, professor of community medicine at AMCH, Dr Bhupendra Narayan Mahanta, professor of medicine (currently posted at Lakhimpur Medical College Hospital) and Dr Mithu Medhi, professor of microbiology (currently posted at Kokrajhar Medical College Hospital) after completing a study on Covishield vaccine effectiveness and AEFI or side effects. The study design was done in consultation with Dr Biswajyoti Borkakoty, head of Regional Viral Research & Diagnostic Laboratory, Regional Medical Research Centre-NE Region (ICMR), Dibrugarh as nodal officer from this region for the pandemic time.The researchers said during the peak of the Delta variant wave in June 2021, it was found that 61% of the participants had been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The remaining 39% were sero-negative, meaning they had not contracted the virus and had received the Covishield vaccine.Regarding the effectiveness or antibody development, 93% remained positive and the antibody level was much higher in case of the vaccinated. Among those participants previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus, the first dose of Covishield vaccine acted as booster dose and was enough to enhance high rise of antibody titre in contrast to SARS-CoV-2 uninfected participants. “The final inference was that natural virus infections confer stronger immune responses than Covishield vaccine alone,” said Gogoi.","55% of Covishield vaccine recipients experienced only minor side effects like fever and headache.

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary (communications) Jairam Ramesh on Friday said the party’s position on Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) was clearly stated in its manifesto where it promised to “review and change all anti-people laws” brought by BJP govt. However, he refused to explicitly say whether the contentious law would be repealed.Senior Congress politician P Chidambaram had said last month that CAA would be scrapped once the INDIA bloc was voted to office.Notably, CAA did not find a mention in the party’s manifesto, which was drafted under Chidambaram’s chairmanship.Asked whether the party would repeal CAA, Ramesh told, “I am not commenting on what Chidambaram said. What he said is his personal view. I am going by the manifesto approved by him as chairman of the committee and approved by Congress prez and the party’s working committee. I am stating the party position. The word CAA does not figure in the manifesto.” He, however, said Congress believed that making religion the basis of reservation and citizenship was unconstitutional.“We opposed CAA in Parliament on the ground that it gives citizenship on the basis of religion. Our Constitution doesn’t provide for reservation or citizenship on the basis of religion,” Ramesh added.Congress manifesto said, “We promise that all anti-people laws passed by the BJP-NDA without proper parliamentary scrutiny and debate, especially those relating to workers, farmers, criminal justice, environment and forests and digital data protection will be thoroughly reviewed and changed.”","Congress general secretary (communications) Jairam Ramesh on Friday said the party’s position on Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) was clearly stated in its manifesto.

QUOTA DILEMMA

BEGGING BANS

CONCERNS ABOUT VIOLENCE

W hen Shreegauri Sawant petitioned the Supreme Court to recognise the rights of transgender people a decade ago, she did not have much hope. To her surprise, the Nalsa (National Legal Services Authority) judgment became the bedrock of her community’s civil liberties in India — recognising the sex-gender distinction, creating a legal third gender category and issuing directives to state and central governments to ensure fundamental rights for trans people.Today, she, yet again, is not feeling much hope. “The visibility that trans people have is because of us, not the government. Class is such a big factor — people with coloured hair in big companies may be better off, but the trans people who were at red lights ten years ago are still at red lights,” says the activist who runs the NGO Sakhi Char Chowghi Trust .The landmark Nalsa judgment, which came on April 15, 2014, defined gender as ‘the innate perception of one’s gender,’ opening doors for self-determination. Lawyer Tripti Tandon, deputy director of the Delhi-based Lawyers Collective, says, “As someone who was part of the legal process in Nalsa, it was a monumental win. Before, there was some sporadic litigation, but transgender people were non-existent legally. Courts were not even an avenue they could access.” She remembers a client who would always carry a print-out of the judgment to remind people of where the Supreme Court stood. Another’s family accepted their identity after the judgment.Its directives to state and central government fell largely under three buckets — one, self-determination of one’s identity. Two, it asked governments to ensure inclusion in social welfare schemes and third, to create a system of reservations for admission in educational institutions and for public appointments.Muskan Tibrewala, assistant director, Law and Marginalisation Clinic at the Centre for Justice, Law and Society, who provides pro-bono legal services to trans people, argues that while the momentous judgment led to normative recognition of the community, efforts over the last 10 years to turn that into substantial impact have been lacking. “There are clampdowns on begging, transgender state boards are not working in many states and only two states have set up transgender protection cells in police stations as directed. An activist in Haryana had to go to court to make that happen,” says Tibrewala. Others agreed that while Nalsa created systems to access social change, trans people are still having to fight each step on the way. As Sawant puts it, “It’s like inviting someone to your house for dinner but saying you can only come if you bring a silver plate and golden spoon.”The judgment, and The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 that stemmed from it, have spoken of self-identification of gender. “That is the part of Nalsa that has got the most implementation. Before this, you would have to get sex reassignment surgery, but now there are two certificates. You can self-identify as trans legally, but if you want to legally identify as a man or woman you need some kind of medical procedure like HRT or a psychiatric evaluation,” says Tibrewala. “The problem is that the process on the ground is badly implemented.”Activist Vyjayanti Vasanta Mogli, who was also a petitioner in last year’s marriage equality case, points out the many hurdles. “Firstly, one has to get a transgender ID card through the National Transgender Portal. But, in Telangana where I work, there is a backlog of almost one and a half years. Collectors and district magistrates are not sensitised, and neither are clinical psychologists and psychiatrists whose evaluation is needed for certificates. They still search for pathological causes of our identity,” says Mogli. Tandon has heard from clients that officials had no idea trans men existed.Reservation is the sphere that has seen least progress, says Tandon. “It’s worked out in states like Karnataka, but it’s been left to states and local activists to see if they can get this demand moving.” Plus, the judgment treats being transgender as a caste identity, so if you’re a transgender person who is Dalit, you have to choose which identity is affording you reservations, Tibrewala points out. The community calls for horizontal and interlocking reservations, which account for the caste heterogeneity of India’s trans people.Recently, Pune police banned begging by the trans community. “It’s easy to say, don’t beg, but are we getting a single penny to survive? Are we getting jobs? No one is begging because they want to,” says Sawant. Kalki Subramaniam, who serves on the National Council for Transgender Persons, adds, “Without opportunities of education, entrepreneurship or instating livelihood initiatives, how can the system boycott trans people from begging? We are excluded from our families, leaving no choice but to beg or do sex work.”Mogli says the 2019 Act is “a joke” when it comes to provisions for atrocities against transgender people. “The legislation was in response to the mandate enshrined in NALSA. However, the sentence is 6 months to two years, and perpetrators can get police station bail — they don’t even have to go to court for that.”","The landmark Nalsa judgment, which came on April 15, 2014, defined gender as ‘the innate perception of one’s gender,’ opening doors for self-determination.

Union minister said that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) introduced by PM Narendra Modi-led govt showcases India’s welcoming approach.On April 2, Biden had said the “xenophobic” nature of India, China, Japan and Russia is responsible for their economic troubles and argued that America’s economy is growing because it welcomes immigrants to its soil.He made the statement while campaigning for his re-election at Washington fundraising event and argued that Japan, along with Russia and China, would perform better economically if the countries embraced immigration more.“Why? Because we welcome immigrants. We look to — the reason — look, think about it. Why is China stalling so badly economically? Why is Japan having trouble? Why is Russia? Why is India? Because they’re xenophobic . They don’t want immigrants,” Biden said.EAM said, “First of all, our economy is not faltering.”“India is always... India has been a very unique country... I would say actually, in the history of the world, that it's been a society which has been very open... different people from different societies come to India,” he said.He said, “That’s why we have the CAA, which is to open up doors for people who are in trouble...

Centre lifts onion export ban as Maha readies for LS polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-lifts-onion-export-ban-as-maha-readies-for-ls-polls/articleshow/109846525.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt on Saturday lifted the ban on onion exports after five months, in a move that is likely to bring huge relief to farmers and traders in Maharashtra ahead of the remaining phases of Lok Sabha polls in this key producing state. But the move comes with conditions. Traders can ship out onion at a minimum export price (MEP) of $550/tonne and pay another 40% export duty on this price, which translates to Rs 64,000 per tonne or Rs 64 per kg.The decision comes just before the next phases of polls, particularly in Maharashtra’s onion belts including Nasik, Ahmednagar and Shirdi. Onion growers in many parts of Maharashtra have been protesting against the export ban alleging it has hit their earnings as mandi prices at Lasalgaon are ruling around Rs 15/kg, which barely covers the cost of production.Market players, however, said lifting the ban may not bring much benefit to traders. “The condition of 40% export duty on MEP will make it difficult to export onions,” said Jaydutt Holkar, director, Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), Lasalgaon.Govt officials said the decision was taken after assessing crop volume, arrival of onions at mandis, prevailing market conditions, and to avoid storage loss. Consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare said estimated Rabi crop (2024-25), which has a share of around 60% of total annual onion output, is around 191 lakh tonnes. She said this is “reasonably comfortable” considering that monthly domestic onion consumption is around 17 lakh tonne.“With a good Kharif prospect with ‘above-normal’ monsoon forecast, availability of onion is comfortable till arrivals of Kharif output. Since onion is a perishable crop, it has to be consumed either domestically or through export within 5-6 months of harvesting and holding on to Rabi stock beyond shelf life will only result in more storage loss,” she said. The secretary added that storage loss increases significantly after three months.DGFT director general Santosh Kumar Sarangi said, “effectively” onion shipments are being allowed at a minimum price of $770 per tonne and added that MEP and export duty have been arrived at considering recent price trend of govt-to-govt supply and prevailing international price of kitchen staple.Sources said availability of onion is expected to increase in international markets with removal of export ban by Egypt following a 300% rise in production and Pakistan too removing its export restrictions.","Traders can ship out onion at a minimum export price (MEP) of $550/tonne and pay another 40% export duty on this price, which translates to Rs 64,000 per tonne or Rs 64 per kg.

NEW DELHI: Air India economy class domestic flyers opting for lower fare brackets will now have a check-in baggage allowance of 15kg — instead of 25kg earlier. All big Indian carriers offer 15kg check-in to domestic flyers (without extra charge) and AI’s generous allowance used to be its USP for economy flyers within India that will somewhat make up for the long-awaited improved cabin product on the airline’s old planes.An AI spokesperson said: “We introduced a menu-based pricing model or branded fare families last year in line with global airline industry norms.Air India’s fare families, named ‘comfort’, ‘comfort plus’, and ‘flex’ are groupings of fares that offer different levels of benefits and fare restrictions at different price points. The fare families are designed to let our guests choose the kind of fare and services that best suit their requirements.”“Bundled fares offer a lot more value and greater choice to guests for less. For example, price difference between ‘comfort plus’ and ‘flex’ fares would typically be about Rs 1,000 on a domestic sector like Delhi-Mumbai, with ‘flex’ fare providing value of nearly Rs 9,000, including 10kg extra baggage, zero change or cancellation fees, more loyalty points, greater choice of free seats to choose from.”Now on domestic routes in economy class, both ‘comfort’ and ‘comfort plus’ fare families offer 15kg baggage allowance, while ‘flex’ provides 25kg allowance. Business class baggage allowance on domestic routes ranges from 25kg to 35kg.

Vajpayee's Atal Legacy & Connect With Lucknow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/vajpayees-atal-legacy-connect-with-lucknow/articleshow/109850662.cms,"‘Haar nahi manunga, raar nayi thanunga; kaal ke kapaal pe likhta mitata hoon, geet naya gaata hoon (I will not give up, I will blaze new trails; I write on the forehead of time, I sing a new song every time).” These iconic lines of his firebrand poem perhaps best define Atal Bihari

’s tryst with Lucknow.

VAJPAYEE'S ELECTORAL JOURNEY IN LUCKNOW

A CONNECTION BEYOND REALM OF POLITICS

Perhaps it was this relentless and unbending spirit that helped him win the Lucknow seat for five consecutive terms - the very seat that had once denied him entry to Parliament on two previous occasions.For Vajpayee, the road to the PM 's office went through Lucknow. Not surprisingly, it became his 'Karmabhoomi' until his retirement from politics. Even 20 years after he contested and won from Lucknow, the aajat-shatru (the one without enemies) of Indian politics is all-pervasive in elections Be it Lalji Tandon returning with Vajapyee's 'khadau' (slippers) before contesting from Lucknow in 2009 to Rajnath Singh not missing a moment to talk about his enduring legacy that started and ended with Lucknow, political analysts say that no political speech is complete without invoking Atal's name.Vajpayee's initial encounter with Lucknow did not bode well for him electorally. While he was making positive strides in forging new bonds and amassing a support base, he failed to pose any significant challenge to Congress' Sheorajvati Nehru and finished third in the 1955 bypoll. He had then contested on Jana Sangh ticket.In 1957, Jana Sangh again fielded Vajpayee. This time from three seats-Lucknow, Balrampur, and Mathura. While he won from Balrampur, he finished runner-up in Lucknow with over 33% vote share and lost his deposit in Mathura. Five years later, Vajpayee again tried his luck in Lucknow and managed to increase his vote share to over 37%. But he failed to win the seat and was declared runner-up. This time he lost from Balrampur, too, by 2,000 votes. He, however, reclaimed Balrampur in 1967.Thereafter, he went on to contest and win from different Lok Sabha seats such as Delhi and Gwalior until he lost the latter to Congress' Madhav Rao Scindia in the 1984 elections.It was in 1991 when Vajpayee again turned to Lucknow. LK Advani's Ramjanmabhoomi movement had bolstered the prospects of the saffron camp in the Hindi heartland. Besides, his personal credibility among the new aspirational class also added to his advantage. He came to the city with a clarion call: ""Lucknow is my home so I am back again here and this time you have to make me an MP from here.""Lucknow didn't disappoint him this time. Vajpayee secured nearly 51% votes and Congress' Ranjeet Singh was no match and ended up a distant second with just 20% votes. And thus began the invincible Vajpayee era in Lucknow. He was elected MP from the seat for five consecutive times-a feat no other political leader has achieved to date. In 1996, Vajpayee again won with a thumping majority and went on to become the PM.During Vajpayee's tumultuous years, from 1996 to 1999, in Delhi trying to stitch a majority govt, Lucknow stood behind the Gandhian-socialist like a rock. Parliament was dissolved twice and three elections were held in less than three years. Each time Lucknow sent Vajpayee to Parliament with a thumping majority and played a critical role in making him the first non-Congress PM to last full term in office. Seeing Vajpayee's formidable hold on Lucknow, many opposition tried to field high-profile and celebrity candidates like filmmaker Muzaffar Ali, actor Raj Babbar, andKaran Singh, but none came close to challenging Vajpayee.Vajpayee's Lucknow connection extended beyond the realms of politics. Be it his early days in student politics or later as a seasoned statesman, several veterans in the city remember him for his personal connect and liberal values.""His simplicity in clothing, words, and dealing with the people at large earned him many admirers across the political lines. He listened to their people and strived to forge amicable bonds. Nobody ever expected him to make disparaging remarks even against his staunch critics,""pointed out an old timer and sociologist, Akhilesh Kumar.From stormy political discussions at his home in Aminabad's 'Kalantri Niwas' to culinary retreats and poetic rendezvous, Lucknow remained the nerve centre of his personal and professional life. His impression over the literary circle in the city was so deep that in 2004 several poets came together to campaign for him.He entered Parliament when Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister and worked with the majority of current lot of politicians, many of whom have now turned adversaries of the BJP. Political analysts attest that he was a man of open mind and progressive ideas; the Bhishma Pitamah of Indian politics (as put by former PM Manmohan Singh) who commanded admiration even from his principal opponents for the sheer show of grace, decency, and benevolence-virtues that are exceedingly drying up in the political landscape of recent times.""He was unabashedly honest in words and deeds. He was open about his relationships and personal choices and didn't have double standards. He practised the politics of morality. He had his weaknesses but never did he opt for ignoble means to grab power. He was a kind and amiable man who was never shy of admitting his shortcomings or learning from his mistakes,"" said city-based political observer Anand Vardhan SinghThe unofficial curtain drew on his political career when the party faced a rude awakening after its grandiose India Shining campaign failed to fetch Vajpayee another term in the Prime Minister's office in 2004.""I couldn't sense the mood of the people in 1957 when I was young, I couldn't do it now,"" with this Vajpayee accepted his fate, displaying a venerable magnanimity in the most devastating defeat of his political life. Although he served the full term as the Lucknow MP to pay a final homage to the city that had seen the rise and fall of a poet and statesman, he hung his boots and never returned to the political arena again. But his legacy endures and keeps reaping juicy dividends to the saffron party.","Vajpayee's initial encounter with Lucknow did not bode well for him electorally. Even 20 years after he contested and won from Lucknow, the aajat-shatru (the one without enemies) of Indian politics is all-pervasive in elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109850705,imgsize-128247,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109850705.jpg"

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Hundreds rescued from flooding in Texas as waters continue rising in Houston,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hundreds-rescued-from-flooding-in-texas-as-waters-continue-rising-in-houston/articleshow/109849496.cms,"HOUSTON: High waters flooded neighborhoods around Houston on Saturday following heavy rains that have already resulted in crews rescuing more than 400 people from homes, rooftops and roads engulfed in murky water. Others prepared to evacuate their property.A wide region was swamped from Houston to rural East Texas, where game wardens rode airboats through waist-high waters rescuing both people and pets who did not evacuate in time.One crew brought a family and three dogs aboard as rising waters surrounded their cars and home.A flood watch was in effect through Sunday afternoon, as forecasters predicted additional rainfall Saturday night and the likelihood of major flooding.""It’s going to keep rising this way,” said Miguel Flores Jr., of the northeast Houston neighborhood of Kingwood. “We don’t know how much more. We’re just preparing for the worst.”Husband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.Water could be seen flowing into parts of the couple’s subdivision, but Aron Brown said he wasn’t worried because their home is at a higher elevation than others in the neighborhood.Brown, who had driven from his home in a golf cart, said the flooding wasn’t as bad as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. He pointed to nearby power lines and said that flooding during Harvey had reached the top of the lines.RESIDENTS IN LOW-LYING AREAS ASKED TO EVACUATEFriday's fierce storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes. Officials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.“A lull in heavy rain is expected through (Saturday) evening,” according to the National Weather Service. “The next round of heavy rainfall is expected late (Saturday) into Sunday.”Up to 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of additional rain was expected, with up to 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) possible in isolated areas.Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said more rain was expected Sunday, and if it’s a lot, it could be problematic. Hidalgo is the top elected official in the nation’s third-largest county.ONGOING RAIN HAS LEFT PARTS OF TEXAS DRENCHED, RESIDENTS TRAPPEDMost weekends, Miguel Flores Sr. is mowing his huge backyard on a 2.5-acre (1-hectare) lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family were loading several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.Water from the San Jacinto River had already swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise — what was about 1 foot (30 centimeters) high in the yard Friday measured about 4 feet (1.2 meters) the following day.“It’s sad, but what can I do,” Flores said. He added that he has flood insurance.For weeks, drenching rains in Texas and parts of Louisiana have filled reservoirs and saturated the ground. Floodwaters partially submerged cars and roads this week across parts of southeastern Texas, north of Houston, reaching the roofs of some homes.More than 21 inches (53 centimeters) fell over a five-day period through Friday in Liberty County near the city of Splendora, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Houston, according to the National Weather Service.Hidalgo said Saturday that 178 people and 122 pets have been rescued so far in the county. Scores of rescues took place in neighboring Montgomery County. In Polk County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of Houston, officials said they have done over 100 water rescues in the past few days.HOUSTON IS ONE OF THE MOST FLOOD-PRONE METRO AREAS IN THE USAuthorities in Houston have not reported any deaths or injuries. The city of more than 2 million people is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country and has long experience dealing with devastating weather.Hurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.Of particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River, which was expected to continue rising as more rain falls and officials release water from a full reservoir. Hidalgo issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for people living along portions of the river.The weather service reported that the river was at nearly 74 feet (22.6 meters) late Saturday morning after reaching nearly 78 feet (23.7 meters). The rapidly changing forecast said the river was expected to fall to near flood stage of 58 feet (17.6 meters) by Thursday.Most of Houston’s city limits were not heavily impacted by the weather. Officials said the area received about four months' worth of rain in about a week’s time.The greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers) — a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous that drain into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.The system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city’s growth and bigger storms.","A flood watch was in effect through Sunday afternoon, as forecasters predicted additional rainfall Saturday night and the likelihood of major flooding.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: In the serene pastures of rural America, a seemingly whimsical activity has gained popularity: cow cuddling . This unique form of agritourism, where visitors pay to spend time with cattle, offers more than just a novel experience; it has become a crucial economic activity for many small farmers . These interactions, often highlighted on social media, not only provide city dwellers with a taste of country life but also offer therapeutic benefits to participants.""Agritourism has become a significant economic boon for small farmers who have carved out a niche for themselves,"" said Curt Covington, Senior Director of Institution Credit at AgAmerica Lending.Farmer Luz Klotz straightened the brightly striped hair bow on Reba, a 1,600-pound heifer lounging on the ground under twinkling fairy lights. Teenager Joey Pachl, hoping to impress his girlfriend with an invitation to the high school prom, had paid $75 for an hour-long cow cuddling session at the farm.Pachl successfully wowed animal loving girlfriend Emma. For Luz and husband Dan Klotz, such visitors have become key to covering the feed bills and keeping their small farm running.However, the pastoral tranquility of such farms is currently under threat from an unexpected source—the outbreak of bird flu in dairy herds across several US states. The presence of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, in dairy cattle poses significant risks not only to the livestock but also potentially to human health. This development has prompted urgent responses from both state and federal agricultural departments, urging farmers to limit public access to their farms to control the spread of the disease.In Michigan, the state's agriculture department responded swiftly with an emergency order to implement new sanitation measures and limit public access to farms. ""Now is not a good time to cuddle cows,"" said Tim Boring, the department's director, emphasizing the need to protect both animal and human health.The restrictions, while necessary, pose significant economic risks to small family farms that depend on agritourism. For places like the De Vor Dairy Farm and Creamery in northern Michigan, where bookings are made weeks in advance, the financial implications are particularly severe. As the industry navigates these challenging times, the resilience of these small enterprises and the adaptability of agritourism will be critically tested.","Cow cuddling is a unique form of agritourism where visitors pay to spend time with cattle.

Pakistan to block over 5 lakh SIM cards of tax evaders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-block-over-5-lakh-sim-cards-of-tax-evaders/articleshow/109762651.cms,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to enhance tax compliance , the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led govt has directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and other telecom companies to block the mobile phone SIMs of over 500,000 people who have not submitted their tax returns.The development came a day after Shehbaz Sharif pledged at the closing plenary session of the World Economic Forum (WEF) special conference in Riyadh to enact significant austerity measures and implement long-lasting reforms in order to steer his country out of its current economic crisis.On Tuesday, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) had directed the PTA and all telecom operators to ensure compliance with the Income Tax General Order (ITGO) with immediate effect. “The FBR has taken decisive action by issuing an order to disable mobile phone SIMs associated with 506,671 individuals ... who are not appearing on the active taxpayer list but are obligated to file income tax returns ,” the FBR said in a statement, adding that telecom operators are mandated to furnish a compliance report to the FBR by May 15 to provide transparency and accountability in the enforcement process.“Through enforcement measures and collaboration with relevant stakeholders, the FBR aims to strengthen the tax base and promote a fair and equitable tax system for the benefit of the nation,” the FBR handout read.“Until the FBR or the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, whichever has jurisdiction over the individual, restores the mobile SIMs for the aforementioned individuals, they will remain blocked,” it added.For the tax year 2023, so far only 4.5 million people have filed their annual returns as against 5.9 million filers for tax year 2022.Sharif’s government had also launched a compulsory tax registration scheme to bring in about 3.2 million retailers who remain outside the tax net. It had given one month to these retailers to voluntarily register with the tax machinery, a deadline that lapsed Tuesday.Till the last date, only 75 retailers got registered with the FBR, officials said. This demonstrates stubbornness on the part of retailers refusing to comply with tax rules. The FBR has declared that it will take legal action against retailers who have managed to evade taxes.",The development came a day after Shehbaz Sharif pledged at the closing plenary session of the World Economic Forum.

IMF approves last tranche of $3-billion loan to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-approves-last-tranche-of-3-billion-loan-to-pakistan/articleshow/109738150.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism Tuesday regarding release of IMF ’s final $1.1 billion tranche of a $3 billion bailout to the country, saying it would bolster economic stability . Pakistan is now eyeing a new, longer and larger economic bailout package, but economists cautioned against the country’s continued reliance on overseas financial assistance, warning of potential dire consequences.IMF approved the immediate release of the tranche following a key meeting of the global lender’s executive board in Washington late Monday night.All board members favoured releasing the funds, except India, which abstained.Pakistan has been reeling from a severe economic crisis for more than two years, with its inflation at one point shooting up to nearly 38% and its foreign currency reserves depleted to $3bn in Feb 2023, enough to cover less than five weeks of imports.Last year, the global lender had approved a nine-month standby arrangement with Pakistan “to support its economic stabilisation programme”. The approval had allowed for an immediate disbursement of $1.2bn, with the rest phased over the programme’s duration — subject to two quarterly reviews.The IMF bailout proved important to save the country from default, the state broadcaster quoted PM Sharif as saying.Leading economist Qaiser Bengali expressed scepticism about the perceived stability, highlighting the temporary nature of the current situation and underscoring the necessity of meaningful reforms to address long-term economic challenges.“If the so-called stability was due to a rise in exports or better inflow of dollars, that would have been meaningful, but that is not happening,” Bengali said, adding that the economy cannot run on a policy of getting new loans to pay past loans.Pakistan’s external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.","PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism regarding release of IMF ’s final $1.1 billion tranche of a $3 billion bailout to the country.

From spring offensive to charm offensive: The Taliban are working to woo tourists to Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/from-spring-offensive-to-charm-offensive-the-taliban-are-working-to-woo-tourists-to-afghanistan/articleshow/109713887.cms,"KABUL: Around 30 men are crammed into a Kabul classroom, part of the debut student cohort at a Taliban-run institute training tourism and hospitality professionals.It's a motley crew. One student is a model. Another is 17 and has no job history.The students vary in age, education level and professional experience. They're all men - Afghan women are banned from studying beyond sixth grade - and they don't know anything about tourism or hospitality.But they are all eager to promote a different side of Afghanistan . And the Taliban are happy to help.Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife.And yet, foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence, increased flight connections with hubs like Dubai, and the bragging rights that come with vacationing in an unusual destination. The numbers aren't huge - they never were - but there's a buzz around Afghan tourism.In 2021, there were 691 foreign tourists . In 2022, that figure rose to 2,300. Last year, there were 7,000.Mohammad Saeed, the head of the Tourism Directorate in Kabul, said the biggest foreign visitor market is China because of its proximity and large population. Afghanistan also has advantages over some of its neighbors.""They've told me they don't want to go to Pakistan because it's dangerous and they get attacked. The Japanese have said this to me also,"" Saeed said. ""This is good for us.""But there are disadvantages, too.Visas are difficult and expensive to access. Many countries severed ties with Afghanistan after the Taliban returned to power, and no country recognizes them as the legitimate rulers of the country.Afghan embassies either closed or suspended their operations. There's an ongoing power struggle between Afghanistan's embassies and consulates staffed by people from the former Western-backed administration, and those under the Taliban administration's full control.Saeed concedes there are obstacles for Afghan tourism to develop but said he was working with ministries to overcome them.His ultimate aim is to have a visa on arrival for tourists, but that could be years away. There are problems with the road network, which is half-paved or non-existent in some parts of the country, and airlines largely avoid Afghan airspace.The capital Kabul has the most international flights, but no Afghan airport has direct routes with major tourist markets like China, Europe, or India.Despite the challenges, Saeed wants Afghanistan to become a tourism powerhouse, an ambition that appears to be backed by the Taliban's top leaders.""I have been sent to this department on the instructions of the elders (ministers). They must trust me because they've sent me to this important place.""The students also have aspirations. The model, Ahmed Massoud Talash, wants to learn about Afghanistan's picturesque spots for Instagram posts and its history for media appearances.Business school graduate Samir Ahmadzai wants to open a hotel but thinks he should know more about tourism and hospitality first.""They hear that Afghanistan is backwards, poverty and all about war,"" said Ahmadzai. ""We have 5,000 years of history. There should be a new page of Afghanistan.""Classes include Afghan handicrafts and anthropology basics.An unofficial subject is how to interact with foreign women and how their behavior or habits could clash with local customs and edicts. Examples might be women smoking or eating in public, to mixing freely with men who are not related to them by blood or marriage.The Taliban have imposed a dress code for women and requirements for them to have a male guardian, or mahram, when they travel. Dining alone, traveling alone, and socializing with other women in public have become harder. With gyms closed to women and beauty salons banned, there are fewer places where they can meet outside the home.In a sign that the country is preparing for more overseas visitors, the country's only five-star hotel, the Serena, has reopened its women's spa and salon for foreign females after a monthslong closure.Foreigners must show their passport to access services. Women with ""born in Afghanistan"" on their ID are barred.The restrictions on Afghan women and girls weigh on overseas travel companies, who say they try to focus on the positive aspect of cultural interactions by making donations, supporting local projects or only visiting family-run businesses.Shane Horan, the founder of Rocky Road Travel, said visiting Afghanistan should not be seen as an endorsement of any particular government or political regime.""Ultimately, the goal should be to support responsible tourism practices that contribute positively to the local economy and foster mutual respect and understanding, while also remaining cognizant of the broader political context in Afghanistan.""He said there was no input from authorities about what tour groups saw or did, and that the company worked closely with a women's rights organization in Afghanistan. A percentage of the tour cost went into supporting this organization's programs, Horan added.There are no women at the Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management. The students don't mention it. But an official at the Tourism Directorate does.""It's a heartbreaking situation,"" said the official, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. ""Even female family members ask if they can study here. But there was a change in policy with the change in government. The women who were studying before (the takeover) never came back. They never graduated.""","Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife. But foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109714068,imgsize-1602274,width-400,resizemode-4/109714068.jpg"

In February, when Charles was diagnosed, Harry flew from California to see him but was only granted a brief 30-minute meeting. Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on any private meetings.Despite the strained relationships, Charles is expected to invite Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle , along with their children Archie and Lilibet, to Balmoral Castle in Scotland this summer. On the day of Harry's event, Charles has a busy schedule, including his weekly audience with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and attending the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season, pending medical advice, according to the Telegraph.Harry and Markle are set to travel to Nigeria later this month for a tour related to the Invictus Games. Contrary to rumors, the trip will not be recorded for a new Netflix project.During their visit to Nigeria, the Sussexes are expected to meet with officials, veterans, and athletes participating in the Invictus Games. Their itinerary includes visits to military rehabilitation centers and sports facilities, as well as meetings with local organizations supporting veterans' welfare. The Nigerian government is reportedly covering the cost of their security during the trip.","Prince Harry has invited his family members to attend the Invictus Games 10th anniversary celebration.
