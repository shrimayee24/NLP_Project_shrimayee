Karnataka govt favouring big fish with links to ministers: Contractors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-govt-favouring-big-fish-with-links-to-ministers-contractors/articleshow/120186509.cms,"BENGALURU/CHITRADURGA: Days after Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah's economic adviser, Basavaraj Rayareddi, caused a flutter by claiming the state was ""No 1 in corruption"" before retracting the statement, the Congress govt has faced further embarrassment.The Karnataka State Contractors' Association has now alleged growing interference by middlemen in govt departments, accusing the administration of favouring big influential contractors while sidelining small and medium ones.In a letter addressed to Siddaramaiah, his deputy DK Shivakumar, public works minister Satish Jarkiholi, and minor irrigation minister NS Boseraju, association president R Manjunath and general secretary GM Ravindra have demanded an official meeting to discuss the crisis. ""In the last 3-4 months, middlemen are spoiling the system,"" the association said in its representation to the CM.Manjunath told TOI pending dues to contractors have crossed Rs 32,000 crore. ""Govt should maintain the seniority list to clear pending bills. However, there are middlemen - described as 'invisible hands' - in each dept, and they help some influential contractors, doing injustice to the small and medium-level contractors.""The association alleged that while departments like PWD, four irrigation corporations, and minor irrigation continue to withhold payments ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, special letters of credit (LoCs) are being selectively used to benefit contractors with political backing. These LOCs, intended for emergencies such as health issues or family events, are reportedly being misused.Contractors working with BBMP in Bengaluru have also alleged that bribe-demanding middlemen influence bill clearances in the city, favouring those with deeper pockets.At a press conference in Chitradurga, Manjunath claimed interference by ministers' relatives and aides in department functioning. ""While relatives of ministers have gained undue influence across departments, ministerial interference has increased in recent months. The ministers establish proper payment schedules, but intermediaries alter these arrangements to facilitate selective disbursement.""Despite raising these issues in a meeting with DK Shivakumar on Dec 3, Manjunath said their concerns remain unresolved. ""Substantial amounts of Rs 100-150 crore are being allocated to influential parties, while smaller contractors face neglect,"" he said, adding, ""The water resources department suspended payments while, in minor irrigation, minister Boseraj's son's involvement raised concerns regarding grants and payments.""","The Karnataka State Contractors' Association has now alleged growing interference by middlemen in govt departments.

Mumbai market tries to erase memory of Headley office 26/11 plotter helped build,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-market-tries-to-erase-memory-of-headley-office-26/11-plotter-helped-build/articleshow/120185638.cms,"MUMBAI: The Immigration Law Centre 's former location at Tardeo's AC Market has become virtually untraceable amidst the building's numerous commercial establishments. The history of this office, which was used as a cover by David Headley with the help of Tahawwur Rana in plotting one of India's most devastating terror attacks, remains a sensitive topic with occupants of various premises in the market.From this office space, the Law Centre, established through Rana's financial support and Headley's planning, operated under the guise of helping workers obtain visas for North American countries. The premises were strategically chosen to facilitate Headley's surveillance activities across Mumbai and other Indian cities.Rana, who operated an immigration services office in Chicago, US, as a cover for terrorist activities, established a Mumbai branch here at the suggestion of his childhood friend Headley two years before the 26/11 attacks , following directives from their Pakistani handlers.According to Headley's court testimony, Rana provided financial backing for the office. Headley had hired a local woman to manage the office, who testified before the court later about Rana's visit to the office with a woman before the terror attacks.While the immigration office was opened ostensibly to help skilled and unskilled workers get visas for the US and Canada, Headley used it as a cover to visit India, meet his contact and do recce of the possible targets.Currently, the AC Market houses various commercial establishments, including advocates' chambers and those of immigration consultants. The building's narrow corridors lead to compact office spaces, with some units having just enough space for basic furniture.The office's operations began on Nov 1, 2006, following a formal agreement with the landlord by Headley. Financial transactions between Rana and Headley were conducted through IndusInd Bank's Nariman Point branch, with multiple transfers used for setting up the office and for the recce of possible terror targets.Present-day occupants of the AC Market offices, including new staff members and the society manager, maintain minimal knowledge about the tainted office's controversial past. Renovation of nearby office spaces and a regular turnover of tenants have contributed to the gradual erasure of this contentious past from local memory.Prior to the 26/11 attacks, Rana and his wife undertook extensive travels across India, visiting multiple cities including Delhi, Agra, Kochi, Ahmedabad and Mumbai. Headley's last documented interaction at the premises was on July 16, 2008, when he secured an extension for the office licence.","The Immigration Law Centre's former location at Tardeo's AC Market has become virtually untraceable.

However, a brief but intense spell of rain accompanied by strong winds in the evening offered much-needed respite.The winds, gusting up to 50 kmph in parts of the city, brought the mercury down by a significant 6-10 degrees across most areas, said India Meteorological Department (IMD). The Met department predicted very light rain or drizzle on Friday and Saturday, with heatwave conditions unlikely till April 16.Parts of Delhi reeled under heatwave conditions for the fourth consecutive day. The maximum temperature at Safdarjung, the city's base station, reached 39.6 degrees Celsius on Thursday, five degrees above normal, down from Wednesday's 40.5 degrees Celsius. While Safdarjung didn't register heatwave conditions, Ayanagar (40.2 degrees Celsius) and Ridge (40.9 degrees Celsius) were under the grip of a heatwave. The heat index for Delhi was between 40 and 50 degrees Celsius.The city saw the second consecutive warm night. The minimum temperature at Safdarjung stood at 25.9 degrees Celsius, six degrees above normal. It was also 0.3 degrees higher than Wednesday's minimum temperature, making it the highest minimum temperature in April in three years. It was last exceeded in April on April 14, 2022, at 26.2 degrees Celsius.A warm night is declared when the maximum temperature is above 40 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature is at least 4.5 degrees above normal.

However, under the influence of a western disturbance, Delhi received very light rain in parts of the city on Thursday evening. Strong winds caused significant temperature reduction,"" said a Met official.Krishna Kumar Mishra, a scientist at IMD, said the mercury dropped at Lodhi Road from 36 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees between 5.30pm and 6.30pm post-thunderstorm. However, Mayur Vihar experienced a decline from 37 degrees Celsius to 27 degrees Celsius during the same period due to more activity over eastern Delhi, said Mishra.According to IMD, base station Safdarjung did not record any rain between 5.30pm and 8.30pm while Mayur Vihar logged 5mm rainfall during the same period. Pitampura received 1mm rain.""The maximum temperature is likely to fall by 3-5 degrees Celsius during the next three days and gradually rise by 2-4 degrees Celsius thereafter,"" said IMD.

Krishnan will be assisted by a team including special prosecutor Narender Mann, an experienced criminal lawyer, who earlier represented CBI in Delhi HC, sources said.Krishnan, sources said, was instrumental in Rana's extradition proceedings as well and his team presented irrefutable evidence to the US judiciary, culminating in the dismissal of all of Rana's pleas and appeals. Krishnan was closely working with NIA when the extradition process began in 2019-20. He and his team also accompanied NIA to the US to present India's case, sources said, adding that he was assisting the team in an unofficial capacity due to US laws.""He was instrumental in segregating the offences to establish that India's case was different from what the US had prosecuted Rana for,"" said an NIA officer.In 2012, Krishnan was appointed as the special public prosecutor by Delhi Police for the trial in Nirbhaya gang rape-murder case.

"Tahawwur Rana arrested on arrival in India, appears before NIA court, sent to 18-day custody",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tahawwur-rana-arrested-on-arrival-in-india-appears-before-nia-court-sent-to-18-day-custody/articleshow/120177280.cms,"NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Hussain Rana , who played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives, was arrested by NIA here on Thursday after his arrival from US on a special flight.The Pakistani-Canadian terrorist was produced before special NIA judge Chander Jit Singh, who held an in-camera hearing on NIA counsel and special public prosecutor Narender Mann's plea for a 20-day remand. Rana was represented by Piyush Sachdeva, provided to him by Delhi Legal Services Authority. After the hearing, the court sent Rana to 18-day NIA custody.Rana's extradition process was nothing short of a nail-biter with fears of sabotage looming till the flight touched down at Palam airport's technical area. The home ministry and the office of NSA, along with Intelligence Bureau, constantly monitored the flight ferrying Rana, taking precautions to thwart any attempt to stop him from landing in the grasp of Indian agencies.Exercising utmost caution in extraditing Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a dummy code was generated for the chartered aircraft, a Gulfstream G550, ferrying him to India to avoid detection on public flight trackers and alleviate threats of an attack. The aircraft took off from Los Angeles in the early hours of Wednesday and landed in New Delhi around 6 pm, after a pit stop in Romania.Rana, along with his close school friend and fellow jihadi Daood Gilani aka David Coleman Headley, had left Mumbai on Nov 19, 2008, just a week before a gang of jihadi terrorists belonging to and motivated by LeT and trained by serving officers of Pakistan army landed on the Worli shore to carry out an attack in which 166 people were killed and which left the nation traumatised. The massacre marked the execution of a plan that Rana and Headley helped draw by selecting the targets to be struck.As Rana stepped on the tarmac in prison browns with NIA personnel clinging to him, he looked far from the unassuming businessman he had posed as when he checked into a Powai hotel in Mumbai in 2008. He had also visited Agra, Hapur, Kochi and other cities during this trip, supposedly to promote his immigration business, though NIA suspects the trips may have been a cover to scout for potential terror recruits for LeT.Rana, for long a strategic asset for Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistan's military intelligence complex, was placed under arrest at the airport, made to undergo a medical examination and whisked to court through a green corridor amid heavy security comprising a 20-vehicle cavalcade and SWAT commandos.On the plane back to India, Rana was seated in the middle with NSG commandos on all seats surrounding him, followed by senior NIA officials. Just after touchdown, the NIA acknowledged the assistance of US Sky Marshals who are assigned with secure transportation of federal prisoners, including inmate transfers via air.In a statement, the NIA termed Rana a key conspirator and confirmed his extradition. ""Rana was being held in judicial custody in the US pursuant to proceedings initiated under the India-US extradition treaty. The extradition finally came through after Rana exhausted all legal avenues to stay the move. The district court for the Central District of California had ordered his extradition on May 16, 2023. Rana then filed multiple litigations in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, all of which were rejected,"" it said.Extradition proceedings were initiated between the two countries after India eventually secured a surrender warrant for the wanted terrorist from the US govt.The extradition finally came through after Rana's various litigations and appeals, including an emergency application before the US Supreme Court, were rejected with the active assistance of the US department of justice's Office of International Affairs, US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, US Marshals Service, FBI's Legal Attache Office in New Delhi, and US department of state's Office of the Legal Adviser for Law Enforcement, the NIA said.For NIA investigators, the challenge will be to get Rana to reveal more than what he has already told US authorities. His interrogation will be aimed at getting to the bottom of the Mumbai attack conspiracy and exposing the role of Pakistan-based LeT masterminds like Hafiz Saeed, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and others in planning and remote-controlling one of the deadliest terror strikes against India.","Tahawwur Hussain Rana played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives.

To allay the worries, the school management issued a note saying that ""no decision has been taken regarding the school becoming co-ed"".What was meant to be an internal discussion about a potential shift to co-education, quickly snowballed into a public controversy, prompting school authorities to clarify that the message sent by headmaster Jagpreet Singh on March 17 to the school's governing body was not a declaration, but an invitation to deliberate, reconsider, and reimagine what the future of the school might look like.Accompanying the headmaster's memo was a four-page document, outlining the rationale for exploring a co-ed model. Citing research that challenged the academic benefits of same-sex education, the memo acknowledged a changing educational landscape and called for feedback to help navigate a possible transition.""Over the years, many schools have made the transition to co-education,"" the document noted. ""Researchers claim that there is no significance of same-sex education on academic performance.""However, even before a dialogue could take shape, the memo had moved beyond its intended audience. Alumni, many of whom see The Doon School as not just as a place, but as a part of personal identity, responded with unease. Sensing this disquiet, the school management issued a follow-up communication on April 7 from Anoop Singh Bishnoi, chairman of the board of governors, to IPSS members, most of whom are alumni.""The document and communication in question were intended solely as a discussion note, shared internally with members of IPSS,"" Bishnoi wrote. ""The purpose was simply to initiate preliminary thought, invite inputs for discussion and dialogue among the members."" Offering reassurance, he added: ""I want to personally assure you that no decision has been taken regarding the school becoming co-ed. Further, having received your valuable feedback, we will not be taking any decisions in this regard unless it finds favour with most of you.""While the idea of admitting girls has surfaced in conversations around the school for years, there has never been a public plan or timeline - only murmurs and conjectures.The document also raised questions: how to build infrastructure to accommodate female students, how to ensure their safety and wellness, and how to fund these changes.",A memo meant for trustees at The Doon School has stirred up a hornet's nest.

"Tobacco use leading to heart ailments, causing sudden deaths, say doctors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tobacco-use-leading-to-heart-ailments-causing-sudden-deaths-say-doctors/articleshow/120182655.cms,"NEW DELHI: The death of a 28-year-old Air India Express pilot due to cardiac arrest, shortly after landing his flight in Delhi on Wednesday, and that of a 23-year-old woman while dancing at a wedding in Madhya Pradesh in Feb, has put the spotlight on rising incidents of sudden cardiac deaths among young people. Social media is flooded with videos of people collapsing and dying suddenly while dancing, singing or just taking a walk, either due to cardiac arrest or heart attack - the conditions becoming more common in the under-40 age group.Recently at AIIMS, Dr Ambuj Roy, a senior cardiologist at the hospital, treated a 26-year-old man after he suffered a massive heart attack. He was physically fit and there was no history of any chronic illness but doctors found that he was a heavy smoker. ""People associate tobacco-use, whether it is a smokeless product or smoking, with lung diseases and cancer. But if you look at the statistics, number of deaths caused by heart diseases, where tobacco use is a culprit, is almost equivalent to the number of deaths caused by the other two diseases,"" Dr Roy said.His colleague, Dr Nitesh Naik, called for increased awareness to reduce modifiable risk factors, which can lead to serious heart conditions, including heart attack or sudden cardiac arrest. These risk factors include smoking, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and obesity. ""It is equally important for people aged 40 and above to undergo periodic health check-ups to screen for underlying heart diseases. Timely detection and intervention can reduce the risk of serious complications,"" he said.In the pilot's case, it is not yet clear what triggered cardiac arrest or sudden loss of heart activity due to an irregular heart rhythm. But the incident has triggered concerns regarding long work hours and stress among pilots. Several mechanisms have been postulated for linking stress with cardiovascular diseases, say doctors. This includes behavioural factors such as smoking, excess alcohol intake, lack of exercise, poor adherence to medications and increased heart rate and raised blood pressure.

NEW DELHI: An Air India Express pilot suffered cardiac arrest at Delhi airport on Wednesday shortly after safely operating a flight from Srinagar and passed away. First officer Armaan, who was about 36 years of age and had recently got married, had operated Delhi-Srinagar-Delhi on Wednesday. After landing in Delhi, he went to the aircraft lav where he vomited. He collapsed in the forward galley and was taken to the airport medical centre by cabin crew and ground staff. He was then taken to a private hospital in Vasant Kunj but could not be saved.“We deeply regret the loss of a valued colleague due to a medical condition. Our thoughts are with the family during this time of profound grief. We are extending all possible assistance to them as we all cope with this tremendous loss. We request all concerned to respect privacy at this time and avoid unnecessary speculation while we commit to assisting the relevant authorities in due process,” an Air India Express spokesperson said.Armaan, who went by his first name only, had joined AI Express in 2023 from SpiceJet. He had flown for less than 12 hours in the last seven days, it is learnt.The Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) said in a statement there’s an urgent need to put in place transparent regulations that prioritise rest for pilots, safety and humane scheduling practices. The association, which represents over 800 pilots of various Indian carriers, has stressed the need for having comprehensive mental health support systems within airline organisations and not merely as checkboxes but as active, accessible, and stigma-free services. ALPA says the untimely death of Captain Armaan’s death raises troubling questions about pilot welfare, mental health, and working conditions in the Indian aviation industry.While not linking Armaan’s tragic death to fatigue, several pilots say they have for a long time been pleading for less strenuous working conditions in India. After a significant delay, slightly less strenuous flight duty time limitations (FDTL) rules — that govern key issues like how much a pilot can fly with what rest periods and limits on night flying — are set to be enforced from this summer.“Many pilots have lost their lives suddenly in last few years, especially post Covid, and we have been fighting for a more humane FDTL. We just hope nothing else delays implementation of the new rules, something which we have seen in the past. Well rested and not stressed pilots are key to safe flights,” said many senior pilots.","First officer Armaan, who was about 36 years of age and had recently got married, had operated Delhi-Srinagar-Delhi on Wednesday.

India's natural gas consumption to rise 60% by 2030 under 'Good to Go' scenario,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-natural-gas-consumption-to-rise-60-by-2030-under-good-to-go-scenario/articleshow/120171022.cms,"India’s natural gas consumption is expected to climb by nearly 60 per cent by 2030, pushed by growing demand in the city gas distribution (CGD) sector and increased use across transport, cooking, and industry.A new study by the petroleum and natural gas regulatory board (PNGRB) revealed that daily gas consumption are likely to rise from 188 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in 2023–24 to 297 mmscmd by 2030 under the “Good-to-Go” scenario.This scenario assumed moderate economic growth and policy progress in line with current trends and government commitments. Looking further ahead, demand is projected to reach 496 mmscmd by 2040 under the same scenario.However, under a more optimistic “Good-to-Best” outlook, factoring in favourable policies, faster development, and greater investments, consumption could jump to 365 mmscmd by 2030 and hit 630 mmscmd by 2040.The CGD sector, which includeds supplying compressed natural gas (CNG) to vehicles and piped natural gas to homes and businesses, is set to be the biggest driver of demand. It is expected to account for 50 mmscmd of the 110 mmscmd incremental demand by 2030 and 129 mmscmd of the 198 mmscmd increase between 2030 and 2040 in the moderate growth scenario.“The CGD sector is expected to be the primary growth driver, with consumption projected to grow 2.5 to 3.5 times by 2030 and 6 to 7 times,” the study noted.India is targeting a rise in the share of natural gas in its energy mix to 15 per cent by 2030, up from the current 6–6.5 per cent, as part of its efforts to shift towards cleaner energy and meet net-zero emission goals by 2070.So far, the PNGRB has awarded city gas licences covering 307 geographical areas (GAs), extending gas infrastructure to most parts of the country.Refineries and the petrochemical sector are also expected to see a rise in gas usage, helped by a growing focus on petrochemical integration. This sector is projected to account for an additional 21 mmscmd of gas demand by 2030, and another 10 mmscmd by 2040.While growth in power generation and fertiliser usage is expected to be moderate, given existing high consumption levels, the transition towards cleaner energy is expected to keep gas relevant in both sectors.India currently imports around half of its gas needs, a reliance that is set to increase as demand outpaces domestic production. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports are projected to more than double by 2030.The study highlights the potential of LNG in reducing diesel usage in long-haul transport, noting, “LNG as a long-haul transportation fuel could be a game changer, with the potential to play a pivotal role in replacing diesel. LNG trucking is projected to gain momentum post 2030, with the potential to emulate China’s success in reducing diesel dependency,” PTI quoted.With global LNG supply expected to increase, the report suggests this could present India with an opportunity for long-term supply deals at more competitive prices.However, the PNGRB warned that several risks remain. “Achieving India’s projected natural gas targets for 2030 and 2040 will require a continued commitment from entities towards infrastructure expansion, favourable LNG pricing, and conducive policies,” the study said. “However, geopolitics, policy uncertainty, and volatility in gas prices cannot be ignored.”From 2015-16 to 2023-24, India’s natural gas consumption rose by 45 per cent, from 131 mmscmd to 188 mmscmd. While power sector demand contracted slightly due to sensitivity to price changes, CGD usage more than doubled, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12 per cent. The fertiliser sector saw 3.4% annual growth, while the refinery sector posted 1.8 per cent.",India’s natural gas consumption is expected to climb by nearly 60 per cent by 2030. The city gas distribution (CGD) sector is set to be the biggest driver of demand.

CJI Dipak Misra: Singapore Supreme Court Quashes 'Copy-Pasted' Arbitration Award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/singapore-sc-quashes-ex-cji-dipak-misras-copy-pasted-arbitration-award/articleshow/120141717.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major embarrassment, Singapore Supreme Court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) set up to manage dedicated freight corridors in India after finding that the tribunal headed by retired CJI Dipak Misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties but on different issues.Though the tribunal also comprised MP HC ex-Chief Justice K K Lahoti and ex-CJ of J&K HC Gita Mittal, a Singapore SC bench led by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said since the other two were not part of the earlier awards, it couldn't be ascertained whether they were even aware of Misra's ""copy-paste"" job.The Singapore SC was firm that the copying compromised the integrity of the arbitration process and thus it did not adhere to the ""principles of natural justice"".The court said, ""The patently substantial material derived from parallel arbitrations were extraneous considerations that hadn't been raised to the parties' attention. The material formed such a pervasive part of the award that it simply could not be overlooked. It was plain that it was neither contemplated nor agreed to by the parties that the award could be prepared by such a process. We agree with the (Singapore HC) judge there had been a breach of the fair hearing rule.""By its award dated Nov 24, 2023, the Justice Misra-led tribunal had ruled in favour of the three firms which formed a consortium to bag the contract for Western Dedicated Freight Corridor in Aug 2015. A dispute arose because of the Indian govt's decision to raise labour wages, leading to the consortium demanding more money which was contested by the SPV, and the matter was referred to the Justice Misra-led arbitration tribunal.Upholding the Singapore HC's decision to set aside the award, Justices Menon and Steven Chong in a 40-page judgment analysed the award, found it plagued by copying and in breach of the principles of natural justice. The Justice Menon-led bench accepted the SPV's arguments and rejected those of the consortium.The SPV contended that Justice Misra, during the arbitration, had used extensive material derived from parallel arbitrations. ""It is also common ground that the award was not drafted afresh. Rather, the parallel awards were used as templates, with adjustments made to account for what were thought to be the specificities of the arbitration,"" the Singapore SC said.CJ Menon said the SPV had abandoned some of the submissions made in the parallel arbitrations and replaced these with new arguments unique to the arbitration at hand. ""These new arguments arose because of the slightly different factual matrix presented by the arbitration: for instance, the difference in the length of delay between the issuance of the notification and the consortium's claim allowed the SPV to make additional arguments on estoppel,"" he said.""Despite this, the parallel awards were used as templates in drafting the award to a very substantial degree. It is undisputed that at least 212 paragraphs from the parallel awards were retained in the 451-paragraph award. This has several implications,"" the Singapore SC said.""We also consider that the expectation of equality between the arbitrators was compromised.

Scientists revive dire wolf using breakthrough biotech—Tom Brady and Tiger Woods play surprising role,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/scientists-revive-dire-wolf-using-breakthrough-biotechtom-brady-and-tiger-woods-play-surprising-role/articleshow/120170536.cms,"Credit: Colossal Biosciences

Tom Brady and Tiger Woods support wild project that brings iconic dire wolf back from extinction



In an achievement that sounds more like a storyline from Jurassic Park than real life, Colossal Biosciences has pulled off a remarkable scientific feat—resurrecting the dire wolf , a species believed to have vanished over 10,000 years ago. Known for their legendary size and strength, these creatures once roamed North America and were popularized in pop culture by HBO's Game of Thrones . Today, they are living and breathing again, thanks to the audacious vision of Colossal Biosciences.The Dallas-based biotechnology firm, founded by Ben Lamm, has emerged as a trailblazer in de-extinction science . But Lamm is clear about their mission. “We’re not a foundation, we’re not a nonprofit, we are not an academic think tank. We are trying to actually develop products and build technologies,” he told ABC News. This is a company driven not only by innovation but by the desire to reshape the future of genetics.The dire wolf resurrection was accomplished through cutting-edge genetic engineering. The team, led by Colossal’s chief scientist Beth Shapiro, extracted viable DNA from ancient fossils—a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull. These fragments were essential for sequencing the dire wolf genome. With DNA from close relatives like the gray wolf serving as a biological base, scientists rewrote the genetic code and created embryos that were implanted into domestic dog surrogates.In October, Romulus and Remus—the first male dire wolves—were born. They were followed by Khaleesi, a female named after the famed Game of Thrones character, in January. ""I had all the confidence that this was going to work,"" Shapiro said, underlining the precision and optimism that fueled this historic moment.Backing this revolutionary project are some of the world’s biggest names. From NFL legend Tom Brady to golf icon Tiger Woods, and even Hollywood stars like Paris Hilton and director Peter Jackson, Colossal’s investor roster reads like a who's who of global influence. Brady, a member of the company's cultural advisory board, shared his pride on Instagram: ""So proud of the team for the hard work, passion, and countless hours that have gone into this project!!!""The dire wolf isn’t the only animal Colossal is reviving. Earlier this year, they unveiled the “woolly mouse,” a genetically modified mouse with thick fur reminiscent of the woolly mammoth—another species the company hopes to bring back by 2028. Red wolves, currently critically endangered, were also successfully cloned by the team.With goals to restore extinct creatures like the dodo bird and Tasmanian tiger on the horizon, Colossal Biosciences is turning science fiction into science fact. As CEO Ben Lamm put it: ""This massive milestone is the first of many coming examples demonstrating that our end-to-end de-extinction technology stack works.""And as it turns out, the rebirth of the dire wolf may only be the beginning of a new era—where extinction is no longer forever.Also Read: NFL star Puka Nacua already has post-retirement plans—overseas basketball might be his next move","Dallas-based biotechnology firm Colossal Biosciences has pulled off a remarkable scientific feat.

26/11 Mumbai terror attack plotter Tahawwur Rana lands in Delhi after US extradition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/26/11-mumbai-terror-attack-plotter-tahawwur-rana-lands-in-india-delhi-after-us-extradition/articleshow/120153312.cms,"NIA confirms extradition

A special trial for a special case

The man behind the scenes

Legal journey: From Chicago to Delhi

Pakistan disowns Rana

A step closer to closure

NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough more than 15 years after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks , one of its key accused, Tahawwur Hussain Rana, has been extradited to India from the United States. The Pakistan-born Canadian national, a close associate of convicted terrorist David Coleman Headley , landed in Delhi on Thursday aboard a special flight.His extradition marks a significant diplomatic and legal milestone in India's prolonged efforts to bring the masterminds of the 2008 attacks to justice.In a detailed statement, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said it had ""successfully secured"" Rana’s extradition following years of ""sustained and concerted efforts."" Rana had been held in judicial custody in the US after proceedings were initiated under the India-US Extradition Treaty. “The extradition finally came through after Rana exhausted all legal avenues to stay the move,” the NIA added.The process had been underway for years. The District Court for the Central District of California ordered his extradition on May 16, 2023. Rana’s appeals to the Ninth Circuit Court and multiple petitions, including to the US Supreme Court, were all rejected. His final attempt—a review plea before the US Supreme Court—was dismissed on April 4, 2025, effectively clearing the path for extradition.The NIA also credited the US Department of Justice, US Sky Marshal, Indian intelligence agencies, National Security Guard (NSG), and ministries of external and home affairs for their roles in coordinating the transfer.Senior advocate Dayan Krishnan, who led India’s arguments in the US court, will now prosecute Rana in Delhi. Krishnan, a 1993 graduate of NLSIU Bengaluru and senior advocate since 2014, has previously represented India in the extradition of Ravi Shankaran and served as special prosecutor in the 2012 Delhi gangrape case. He also led the NIA team that interrogated Headley in Chicago.Krishnan will be joined by special public prosecutor Narender Mann, appointed by the Union home ministry. Mann, a seasoned criminal lawyer and Delhi University graduate, has represented the CBI in several high-profile cases including the Jain-diary Hawala case, CWG scam, and the Bofors case. His term will span three years or until the conclusion of the case, whichever comes earlier.The prosecution team will also include advocates Sanjeevi Sheshadri and Sridhar Kale, aside from NIA counsel.Also, advocate Piyush Sachdeva from Delhi Legal Services Authority will represent Rana.Rana, a former Pakistani military doctor turned Canadian citizen, ran an immigration services firm in Chicago that allegedly served as a cover for Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives. While he was convicted in the US in 2011 for supporting terrorism, he was acquitted of direct involvement in the Mumbai attacks due to jurisdictional issues.India, however, has maintained that Rana facilitated David Headley’s reconnaissance missions in Mumbai, including visits to the Taj Hotel and Chabad House.Rana’s trial began in 2018 in the US. The turning point came on May 16, 2023, when a Magistrate Judge ruled that the case was not one of double jeopardy—a principle that prevents an accused from being tried twice for the same offense. Krishnan successfully argued that Rana’s acts constituted distinct crimes under Indian law. His arguments prevailed against veteran extradition lawyer Paul Garlick QC, who represented Rana.Following this, a US District Judge rejected Rana’s appeal on August 10, 2023. His next appeal to the US Court of Appeals was denied on August 15, 2024. Ultimately, all of Rana’s petitions—including a writ of certiorari, habeas corpus petitions, and an emergency stay—were turned down by the US Supreme Court.The US Secretary of State signed Rana’s surrender warrant on February 11, 2025, leading to his final transfer.Interestingly, as the extradition proceeded, Pakistan distanced itself from Rana. “Tahawwur Rana has not renewed his Pakistani documents for over two decades. His Canadian nationality is very clear,” said Pakistani foreign ministry spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan. This comes despite Pakistan officially allowing dual citizenship with Canada.The 26/11 attacks killed 166 people and injured over 300 during a 60-hour siege across key locations in Mumbai. The carnage brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war and changed the course of global counter-terrorism policy.A senior NIA official said Rana’s extradition “is a significant development in our pursuit of justice for the 26/11 victims.” The agency has charged him under the Indian Penal Code, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and SAARC Convention on Suppression of Terrorism. A response to its Letter Rogatory to Pakistan is still awaited.While David Headley continues to serve a 35-year sentence in the US, Rana’s arrival in India may finally help uncover more about the network and planning behind the attacks—opening a long-awaited chapter in India’s search for justice.","Tahawwur Hussain Rana has been extradited to India from the United States.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's $23 million DC mansion is the third-most expensive house buy in Donald Trump's Home State,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-makes-the-third-most-expensive-house-buy-in-donald-trumps-home-state/articleshow/119946535.cms,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg

Meta confirms: ‘Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC…’

Jeff Bezos, former Google CEO and other tech moguls who have brought houses in Washington

Jeff Bezos purchased a $23 million Kalorama mansion in 2016.

Peter Thiel bought a $13 million beaux-arts residence in 2021.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

PayPal co-founder David Sacks, now a White House advisor, purchased a $10.3 million Northwest DC penthouse.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

EU pauses retaliation, but warns of ‘bazooka’



Trump says turmoil is ‘cost of transition’



NEW DELHI: Asian markets on Friday slumped with Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 nosediving over 5.6% in early trade, as investors reacted to mounting fears that the US-China trade war is spiralling out of control.The fresh jitters come a day after Wall Street erased much of its historic rally, triggered earlier in the week by President Donald Trump ’s temporary suspension of tariffs on several allies—excluding China.By late morning, Japan’s benchmark index was down 4.7% at 32,969.95. South Korea’s Kospi shed 1.6% while Australia’s ASX 200 lost 2.1%. The yen climbed sharply, with the dollar falling to 143.48 yen from about 146 yen on Thursday, a clear signal of investors rushing to safer assets. Gold also touched a new high as risk-off sentiment spread.The renewed sell-off was sparked after the White House clarified that Chinese imports will now face a 145% tariff rate, once earlier layers are included. Beijing swiftly responded with 84% tariffs on US goods and announced plans to reduce the number of Hollywood films imported—shaking stocks like Warner Bros. Discovery, which plunged 12.5%.US markets suffered their worst single-day drop in months on Thursday, effectively erasing the optimism sparked by earlier trade pauses.The S&P 500 slid 3.5%, closing at 5,268.05, while the Nasdaq suffered an even steeper fall of 4.3%. The Dow Jones tumbled 2.5%, shedding over 1,000 points to end at 39,593.66. The selloff was broad-based, with tech, financials, and consumer stocks all taking heavy hits. The plunge reflected deepening investor anxiety over rising tariffs, recession risks, and the possibility of a global slowdown.President Donald Trump confirmed on Thursday that his administration will move forward with a massive 145% tariff package on Chinese goods, significantly higher than the 125% figure floated earlier. While the White House recently paused tariffs on allies like the EU, Japan, and the UK, Trump framed the China move as a “necessary correction” to decades of unfair trade practices. “We’re bringing the jobs back. It’s tough love, but we’ll win,” he told reporters. Businesses and economists warned the steep duties could raise consumer prices and disrupt supply chains, particularly in electronics, automotive, and machinery sectors.Beijing responded swiftly to Trump’s tariff escalation, slapping 84% tariffs on key American exports including agricultural goods, electronics, and semiconductors. The Chinese government also announced a sharp reduction in the number of American films allowed to screen in China, a move that dealt a heavy blow to Hollywood. Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery plunged 12.5%, while Disney fell 6.8% amid fears of long-term market access losses. Analysts said the film industry, already grappling with streaming disruptions, could face major revenue hits if Chinese market access continues to narrow.Gold prices hit an all-time high as nervous investors piled into safe-haven assets amid deepening market turmoil. Uncertainty over global trade, equity volatility, and weakening currencies fuelled demand for the precious metal. Meanwhile, oil prices moved in the opposite direction. US crude fell 37 cents to $59.70 a barrel, while Brent crude dipped to $63.03. Traders pointed to concerns over potential demand destruction from slowing global growth and rising tariffs.The European Union said it would suspend its planned $22.4 billion in retaliatory tariffs against the United States for 90 days, offering a diplomatic window for negotiations. However, EU officials issued a stern warning, saying they are prepared to use their newly-adopted “anti-coercion instrument” — dubbed the ‘bazooka’ — if talks collapse. This tool gives the EU sweeping powers to impose countermeasures against economic bullying. While the pause was welcomed by business groups, Brussels made it clear that its patience has limits.Amid mounting market losses and global backlash, President Trump remained defiant, describing the economic upheaval as a “transition problem” necessary to achieve long-term prosperity. “We’ve been taken advantage of for decades. This is the correction — and when it’s over, it’ll be beautiful,” Trump said. He dismissed concerns about short-term pain, insisting that the tariff strategy would ultimately boost American manufacturing and reduce reliance on China. Critics, however, argue that Trump is underestimating the ripple effects on consumers, businesses, and global stability.(With inputs from agencies)","Nikkei 225 plunged 5.6% initially, later trading down 4.7% at 32,969.95 by mid- morning in Tokyo. yen surged against the US dollar, trading at ¥143.48, stronger than ¥146 the day before.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Who was Agustín Escobar? Siemens CEO killed with family in NYC helicopter crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-was-agustn-escobar-siemens-ceo-killed-with-family-in-nyc-helicopter-crash/articleshow/120185959.cms,"(Source: X)

A sightseeing trip over New York turned tragic on Thursday after a helicopter crashed into the Hudson River, killing six people — including a high-profile executive of Siemens, one of Europe’s largest technology firms.Agustín Escobar died in the crash alongside his wife, Merce Camprubi Montal, and their three children, aged 4, 5, and 11, ABC News reported. The pilot also lost his life.Escobar had led Siemens Spain since 2022 and also served as the Global CEO of Rail Infrastructure at Siemens Mobility , according to a company press release.Siemens is a German-based multinational company that operates in sectors including energy, industry, transport and healthcare technology. Its rail and mobility division, where Escobar held a global leadership role, is involved in projects related to rail systems, infrastructure, and transport technology in various countries.According to his LinkedIn profile, Escobar had over 25 years of experience running international operations across the US, South America, Germany, and Spain.

Prada to buy Versace for nearly $1.4billion to form an Italian fashion powerhouse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prada-to-buy-versace-for-nearly-1-4billion-to-form-an-italian-fashion-powerhouse/articleshow/120184520.cms,"On Thursday, in the biggest luxury deal of the year, Prada announced it was buying Versace for 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion) from Capri Holdings, a beleaguered New York group that at one point styled itself as the American answer to the great fashion groups of France.The deal is a sign of faith in the continued value of Made in Italy at a time when financial markets are in chaos because of Trump's policies. And it marks the end of Capri's attempt to create an American luxury group to rival LVMH and Kering, while signaling an attempt by Prada to create an Italian competitor to the powerhouses.Versace will join Prada and Miu Miu, as well as Luna Rossa, America's Cup sailing team, and pastry brand Marchesi as part of Prada Group, creating a ""best in class"" mosaic of Italian savoir-faire. It also gives Prada Group 's fashion holding critical mass, adding a ready-to-wear brand with a different identity to those of Miu Miu and Prada - as well as one that is not dependent on designer Miuccia Prada - to the mix. Prada CEO Andrea Guerra said the acquisition would add, ""a new dimension, different and complementary,"" to the group. ""The journey will be long,"" he added.Prada and Versace are, on the surface, a study in contrasts. Versace made its name on a celebration of flash and fantasy, reveling in sun, sex, the male gaze and the tightrope between bad taste and elegance. Prada, by contrast, embraced a contrarian exploration of the meaning of femininity, gender politics and strange allure of ugly chic. But, Prada chairman Patrizio Bertelli said, ""we share a strong commitment to creativity, craftsmanship and heritage,"" and an understanding of consumer power of brand semiology - the upside triangle, medusa head - and a belief in the importance of family.Miuccia Prada is close to Donatella Versace, who stepped in to run the company her late brother Gianni founded in 1997; though Versace left her position as chief creative officer last month, she is ""delighted' to have her brand back in family hands.","Versace will join Prada and Miu Miu, as well as Luna Rossa, America's Cup sailing team, and pastry brand Marchesi as part of Prada Group.

Pakistan's mineral investment push outrages Balochistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-mineral-investment-push-outrages-balochistan/articleshow/120184602.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's aggressive push for international investment in its mines and minerals sector has ignited a firestorm of dissent in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) regions.The Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025 , held in Islamabad on April 8-9, was billed as a golden opportunity to unlock ""trillions of dollars"" of the country's mineral wealth. The event drew over 300 delegates from nations like the US, Saudi Arabia and China. The forum has deepened the divide between the centre and provinces. Locals in accuse Islamabad of tightening its grip on their wealth for the benefit of foreign powers and the central elite.Addressing the forum, PM Shehbaz Sharif said: ""If we harness these vast reserves, Pakistan can bid farewell to global lenders."" His words, however, ring hollow in Balochistan, where Reko Dik copper-gold mine has become a lightning rod for dissent.The province has endured decades of neglect while its resources are siphoned off to benefit the elite. KP's gemstones have long been a source of pride, yet locals say they see little of the profits.""The mountains bleed wealth, but our children starve,"" said a tribal elder. In Gilgit-Baltistan, where gold, uranium and gems abound, protests were held over leases to Chinese firms. Leaders in PoK, known for ruby and sapphire deposits, have long demanded autonomy over resources.

Crackdown on international students sparks legal battle: Universities join fight against Trump admin’s policies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/crackdown-on-international-students-sparks-legal-battle-universities-join-fight-against-trump-admins-policies/articleshow/120160127.cms,"Climate of fear on campus:

Economic and educational fallout:

Global implications:

A call for judicial intervention:

A coalition of leading higher education institutions and academic associations have mounted a significant legal challenge against the Trump administration, denouncing a series of immigration enforcement actions against international students such as visa revocations, and arrests, and also threats to decertify certain educational institutions. These steps they argue have created a ‘climate of fear’ at American colleges and universities.The lawsuit, led by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has found support from the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration (a not for profit representing over 570 college and university leaders) who has filed an amicus brief. In turn, 86 associations and institutions, such as Illinois Institute of Technology, Regis University Rutgers, Georgetown University and others have backed the amicus brief. This brief outlines sweeping consequences for US academia, innovation, and global competitiveness if the Trump administration's approach is allowed to continue.Miriam Feldblum, President and CEO of the Presidents’ Alliance stated: “Recent actions have upended individual lives, undermined the safety of our institutions, and jeopardized academic freedom in and beyond the classroom. The uncertainty generated by visa revocations and terminations not only has immediate impacts but also threatens our long term ability to recruit, retain, and employ talented individuals from across the globe. In submitting this amicus brief, higher education leaders are coming together to amplify the contributions of noncitizen students and scholars, whose ideas and breakthroughs fuel our economy and uphold the collaborative spirit that defines American education.”The amicus brief details chilling examples of federal crackdowns on international students and scholars, many of whom have faced arrest, deportation, or visa cancellations based on suspected political views—particularly pro-Palestinian sentiments. Among the most prominent cases are those of Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish Ph.D. student at Tufts University, and Mahmoud Khalil, a recent Columbia University graduate—both arrested without clear links to any misconduct beyond protected political expression. The amicus brief also highlights the case of Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian citizen and Fulbright recipient attending Columbia’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation who self-deported. Quoting media reports, the amicus brief states that as of April 8, the Trump administration has revoked the status of over 500 non-citizens, including many international students, in some cases based on alleged participation in campus activism or social media activity deemed contrary to administration policies. The administration is also terminating the SEVIS student record of the students whose visas it revokes— often without notifying the students' schools or providing any justification. This is a change from prior practice, under which students with revoked entry visas (F-1) retain their status and could remain in the country as long as they were enrolled in study courses. By terminating the students’ SEVIS record, the administration appears to be paving the way to arrest and deport themBeyond civil liberties concerns, the Presidents’ Alliance argues the Trump administration’s policy is devastating to the US economy and higher education system. Over a million international students enrolled in American colleges and universities in 2023, they contributed more than $50 billion to the US economy and supported over 378,000 jobs. As fewer international students come to the US, these economic benefits will begin to disappear. Many also remain in the US after graduation, filling vital roles in STEM industries and contributing to entrepreneurship and innovation.“Over 70% of international Ph.D. students in STEM stay in the US workforce post-graduation,” the amicus brief notes, warning that reduced international enrollment will deprive the country of essential talent and innovation.The chilling effect is already being felt. StudyPortals, a global higher education platform, reports a 42% drop in international interest in US graduate programs since the beginning of 2025. International enrollment agencies in India, China, and other countries report a marked shift in student interest toward Canada, Australia, and the UK. “The US risks losing its position as a global leader in higher education and innovation,” the amicus brief warns.ThePresidents’ Alliance concludes its filing with a call for judicial intervention, urging the court to grant a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration’s enforcement actions and to protect the constitutional rights of students and scholars.","A coalition of leading higher education institutions and academic associations have mounted a significant legal challenge against the Trump administration.
