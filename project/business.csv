What happens to Zeenat will decide the fate of 15 tigers in India

Corridor Trails

Early Hiccups

The Road Ahead

Dec 8, 2024 | For Zeenat, it may have been the call of the wild, some primal instinct that urged her to move. The three-year-old tigress was supposed to stay within the confines of Odisha’s Similipal Tiger Reserve, where she had been translocated from Maharashtra’s Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve. But Zeenat knows no manmade borders. She gave in to the wild wanderlust and sets out from the reserve, traversing Odisha, Jharkhand and Bengal, travelling more than 300km and setting off a flurry of activity among forest officials. She is finally captured at a village in Bengal’s Bankura on Dec 29.Jan 12, 2025 | A male tiger in its prime enters Bengal from Purulia, gets clicked in a camera trap, giving the district its first ever recorded evidence of a tiger. As the big cat keeps wandering between Bengal and Jharkhand, the tiger cell at National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) confirms that it was first photographed in a trap camera in Chhattisgarh’s Balrampur forest division in March 2024, then in Jharkhand’s Palamau Tiger Reserve in May-June and later in Bengal’s Purulia and Jhargram in Jan 2025.India’s animal translocation efforts have come under serious scrutiny. The ambitious cheetah project in MP’s Kuno National Park has already courted controversy, having recorded numerous deaths since the first cheetah was released there from Africa in 2022. Even intra-country efforts are not going as planned, as evidenced from Zeenat’s travels. Another tigress — Yamuna — procured from Tadoba is also not settling down in Similipal, even as Bengal grapples with a tiger for the second time in three weeks. This has raised serious doubts on the practice of ‘forced’ redistribution of big cats from tiger-rich states to depleted habitats.India has seen a significant ‘unplanned’ movement of big cats in recent weeks, of them either straying into human settlements, or moving out of designated zones, reminding wildlife authorities of challenges in tiger conservation efforts. Recently, a tiger dispersed from Sariska Tiger Reserve and strayed into human habitation in Rajasthan’s Alwar, until it had to be darted and brought back to its habitat.Managing translocated animals and ensuring survival of their cubs in the wild is a bit tricky, given the risks involved, says Subharanjan Sen , MP’s chief wildlife warden. “In Kuno, we initially brought eight cheetahs. Later on, 12 were released in phases. The cheetah was extinct in India, and we brought the cubs from Namibia. I will not call the project a failure, but eight adult cheetahs have died. The population is now 24. Out of 17 cubs, 12 have survived.”Even though this is a reminder of the complex dynamics of forced redistribution, National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) is pushing forward with its ambitious tiger recovery programme. A new proposal aims to relocate 15 tigers from MP to three states: Odisha, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.Past experiences raise concerns about the success of such programmes, though NTCA member secretary Gobind Sagar Bhardwaj says comprehensive management efforts would be taken before executing relocation of tigers in Similipal, especially after a poaching of a melanistic tiger.Experts are wary, as state govts, in their eagerness to showcase conservation success, often overlook critical scientific protocol. “Translocation has become more about political image-building than scientific wildlife management,” says wildlife conservationist Biswajit Mohanty.Experts say the recent movement of wandering tigers, particularly in east-central India (covering Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and Bengal), points to the importance of preserving and maintaining ‘wildlife corridors’ — designated areas that connects wildlife populations that have been separated by human activity.These corridors, many feel, would do naturally what forced translocations are failing to achieve: long-term survival of wildlife, guard against localised extinctions and ensure exchange of gene flow, which helps in population diversity. In other words, let Mother Nature have her say.“If movement corridors are restored, in the long run, they will naturally ensure tiger dispersal from one landscape to another,” says scientist and conservationist Y V Jhala , who recently retired as dean of Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and was in charge of the initiative to reintroduce the cheetah in India. “This, coupled with good management practices and protection measures in tiger landscapes, will lead to less dependency on relocation projects such as those for tigers.”But chances of restoring the corridors are very little, given there’s so much fragmentation, says K Ramesh, a senior scientist and professor with WII. “Many corridors have gone beyond restoration because of agriculture and developmental activity,” he adds.There is, however, still some evidence that some wildlife trails still exist. In March 2023, a dispersing tiger was caught in a camera trap in Odisha’s Bonai division. NTCA tiger cell sources said this big cat was clicked in a trap camera in MP’s Sanjay National Park when it was a cub. It was also later clicked in Jharkhand’s Palamau Tiger Reserve. But unlike the ‘Purulia tiger’, which headed east from Palamau to enter Bengal, this tiger headed southwards to reach Odisha, pointing towards a still-functional corridor on the landscape.Between 2010 and 2022, the tiger population in India has grown from 1,700+ to 3,600+, presenting a new challenge, despite this success: long-distance migration of big cats, particularly males, from reserves with surplus populations.MP and Maharashtra, two of the best performing states in terms of tiger conservation, frequently witness migrations eastwards towards the forests of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Telangana and Bengal.But here, most areas neither have enough prey nor female tigers, two things that dispersing male tigers look for.“At Palamau, we have been regularly getting pictures of tigers since 2022, but all are males,” says Kumar Ashuthosh , who recently retired as field director, Palamau Tiger Reserve. “It is the dearth of female tigers, perhaps, that is not allowing more males to settle there. Some of them often vanish after wandering into the reserve. There were plans to write to NTCA to get two females under a relocation programme, on the lines of Similipal.”But such translocation projects, too, present certain challenges.Rajasthan’s Sariska and MP’s Panna were the first two parks to show the way in terms of tiger relocation in India. But a similar move — the first such inter-state project in India — failed, when two big cats from MP’s Bandhavgarh and Kanha couldn’t make Odisha’s Satkosia their home. While the male tiger fell prey to poachers, the female (Sundari) had to be sent back to Kanha and then to a zoo after being tagged ‘man-eater’.On the Panna model, a senior MP forester said that by 2009, Panna National Park became the second tiger reserve in India after Sariska to lose all its tigers. But Panna has successfully reintroduced tigers into the park’s natural habitats, resulting in close to 80 tigers, including cubs, thriving within its more than 500sq km boundaries.Despite starting early, Sariska, where the current tiger population is about 30, lags behind.“Issues like village relocation and poaching threat continue to prevail,” a source says.Taking lessons from Satkosia, authorities in north Bengal’s Buxa Tiger Reserve, where a similar plan is afoot, are treading cautiously. If all goes well, tigers may be brought either from Kaziranga or Orang, both in Assam, to Buxa, where camera traps had captured a tiger in Dec 2021 after four decades — again underscoring the importance of corridors between forests of Bhutan, Assam and N Bengal. Plans are on to shift two villages from the core area.In Palamu, NTCA had sent a proposal for tiger relocation to the back burner because of two villages with over 200 families inside the core area. According to RameshF, the Palamau habitat is still good and that tigers will make a comeback once the prey numbers rebound.The success of tiger relocation plan depends on how much connected the forest department is with local communities, where newly dispersed tigers will invariably disperse, Sen says. “Satkosia did not have enough prey and a new tiger was introduced, leading to Sundari’s dispersal soon after release,” he explains.Another thing to bear in mind is the peculiar challenges posed by new habitats. Though Similipal’s landscape is considered to be closely similar to central India’s in terms of flora and fauna, its high terrain and rocky hills are unique, absent in most tiger habitats in Maharashtra and MP. In Zeenat’s case, the Odisha forest department has it on record that the tigress got frightened by herds of elephants, which made it disperse too far.Bhanumitra Acharya, a former honorary wildlife warden, says translocation efforts are jeopardised by hasty decisions, often for the sake of “image-building of the receiving state.”With Zeenat’s fate now locked in a soft enclosure, it is not going to be easy for authorities to take a call on its re-release into the wild. Anup Nayak, former member secretary, NTCA, feels flawed selection of tigers for translocation — especially its age — is also crucial. “Tigers that are either too young or too old often struggle to adapt to new environments. Also, tigers that have grown up in areas with human presence pose risks in their new habitats,” he says.Tigers are also exploratory creatures, and it’s natural for them to look for their own solitary space once shifted to a new habitat,” says Joydip Kundu, a conservation campaigner and founder of SHER (Society for Heritage & Ecological Researches). “Tigers always start exploring new landscapes, and this can land them in different sanctuaries at times. But it is their right to get corridors to move and forests rich with enough prey.”","India has seen a significant ‘unplanned’ movement of big cats in recent weeks, of them either straying into human settlements, or moving out of designated zones.

Some very basic coal mining terms start with the word ‘man’. Manway, man-riding, mantrip… But managers (all of them men) of the 11 Incline mine of Singareni Collieries Ltd, one of the oldest coal mining PSUs in the country, feel it is about time ‘man’ is replaced with ‘person’. That’s because Singareni Collieries has become the first PSU in the country to allow women into underground mines. It has decided to dedicate one mine each — underground and opencast — to women.The central govt changed the law, allowing women in underground mines, in 2019, 82 years after the British govt first banned their entry. The 1937 ban sought to protect women from what was seen as an inhuman and oppressive working environment, not suited for women. The ban was lifted in 1943 but was back again in 1946.TOI visited Telangana’s Ramagundam coal mine areas in Peddapalli district recently where the 11 Incline mine is also located. There are 23 women miners there. They don’t exude toughness. It’s hard to picture them inside a mine. But the moment they start putting on their gear to travel almost 2 km underground — heavy-duty boots, sturdy helmets, workman’s overalls and headlights — you realise they are pros. Unlike the all-male TOI team, which struggled with the gear.The atmosphere in a coal mine, especially for someone not used to those narrow confines, can be stifling. There is obviously no natural light, the space is narrow and everything you say echoes. A man-riding train takes you down.But the women seem at home in this dark universe. They fit into it as if it was their natural domain.Among the women is Neredukomma Hiranmayee . If the central govt decided to amend the Coal Mining Act and allow women into underground coal mines it was largely because of this unrelenting lady who decided to challenge the laws of the land.“Seven women students, including me, were about to graduate from a mining college not far from here when we saw an ad by Singareni looking for engineers, but it said only men could apply,” Hiranmayee says. “This was very disheartening. We decided to go to Delhi and talk to the central govt about allowing us to do the work we were trained for. Allowing women to study mining and then not letting them work in mines — we were not ready to accept that.”The top of her forehead is dotted with vermillion, the marker of a traditional, married woman.Hiranmayee led the group of seven students who went to Delhi in 2017, and after much struggle managed to meet the then Union labour minister Santosh Gangwar . The Mines Act, 1952 was then amended to allow women in mines with some conditions. Women were to work in underground mines only between 7 am and 6 pm. They needed to give a written consent. And they had to work in groups, always.“The decision to go to Delhi was a tough one,” Hiranmayee adds. “Our college management was a little upset with us because they felt we were going against the govt and refused to help us, but we were adamant and that helped. In fact, it was strange that each time we visited mines as students for internships, those working there always encouraged us.In this group of 23, some come from families that have spent a couple of generations in coal mines and some have no family connections.Both the paternal and maternal grandfathers of Swathi Penugonada were Singareni employees. Swathi’s mother insisted that at least one of her two daughters got a Singareni job.But because women were not allowed in coal mines until 2019, she had joined an aerospace company as a quality control engineer. But the moment the mines opened up to women, she applied and got in. “I have worked very hard to be here and I feel proud that I am living my mother’s dream,” she says.Swathi adds that there was a lot of pressure from her extended family to get married, but because her mother stood by her, she was able to push back and become a miner.Allam Navyashree is a 2019 mining engineering graduate. “I got a job with a private firm first, working in underground mines as a section supervisor.” She says at the time there were no women in supervisory positions in underground mines. “I was one of the first. I had to listen to many comments from men openly saying that women are not fit for underground coal mines. But despite all the challenges I cleared my training period and exams. I even ended up supervising the men who said I was not fit for the job.”A mother of two kids, Chunchu Sandhya Rani, got into the mining en gineer job after her marriage. “When I got married in my final year of the mining engineering course from Jawaharlal Nehru Technical University (JNTU), Manthani, I thought my working life was over. But my husband, in-laws and my father encouraged me to apply for the job at Singareni mines. Now, my parents look after my two kids when I come to the mines,” Sandhya says.For Neeli Jyothsna, a diploma holder in ITI electric and now a trainee, her goal was only to land a govt job as none of her family was a govt employee. Her father, a private teacher, tried for a govt job but failed. Now, she has fulfilled her father’s dream.Thorrikonda Srivarsha continued the family tradition of landing jobs at Singareni. Both her grandfathers — her mother’s father and father’s father — were Sinagareni workers. Her mother wants the legacy to continue.Chilka Srinivas, deputy general manager and project officer at 11 Incline, says Singareni Collieries has been at the forefront in giving “equality below ground”. As of now, 16 types of designations and jobs have been identified for women, both in underground and opencast mines.Singareni Collieries’ Ramagundam Area-1 general manager Lalit Kumar D says women employees and workers now work at a depth of about 450 metres from the surface, travelling along three man-riding systems, for a distance of 4.5 km one way, which includes mechanised transport and man-ridings. “Mining is all about 3 Ds — dark, dirty and dangerous. But women work on a par with men,” Kumar adds.The GM says Singareni Collieries is providing equal opportunities for women and ensuring their safety. There’s a separate transport facility for women, first-aid rooms with female nurses, washrooms and creche. And everyone’s being trained on gender sensitivity.","Women were banned from underground mines, till seven women students petitioned the central govt to lift it.

who powered it

■ What inspired you to study the soft porn boom of ’90s and 2000s Kerala?

■ What led to its swift rise and fall?

■ Shakeela became synonymous with the industry. How did it impact her life?

■ How much control did starlets working on these projects have?

■ Were women able to watch these films?

■ These films portrayed unexplored forms of desire such as female orgasms and masturbation. Was it deliberate?

While doing my MPhil, I was trying to understand how young boys or teens get to know about sex education. After much coaxing, they said they learnt about sexuality and intimacy (what a condom was, for instance) through soft porn films. That made me think about the genre, but there wasn’t much scholarship about it then. Everyone told me these movies were made in Kodambakkam, Chennai. So, I went there, to the streets everyone told me existed, but no one was there. That’s when I learnt about Kodambakkam’s fictitious, pseudonym-driven production culture that capitalised on the reserve pool of mainstream cinema. They were tapping into people waiting for a break that never came. I started spending time at film labs and, after five months of waiting, I was finally introduced to someone who worked in soft porn.Soft porn became a parallel industry in the 1990s and early 2000s primarily owing to the financial crisis mainstream cinema faced. Many films made by prominent directors, featuring A-list actors, failed miserably at the box office. Exhibitors and distributors were trying to figure out what would work, and the quickly produced, low-budget formula of soft porn made it viable. However, oversaturation led to its decline — films with similar storylines, the same cast and crew with maybe 10 or 15 women who acted in all these films. Shakeela, for instance, began to charge per day rather than per film at one point. She got Rs 1.5 lakh a day, but what she didn’t know was that one day’s footage was being used for multiple films.Soft porn did become equivalent to Shakeela, but its fallout was that she never got to play a real character in Malayalam cinema . She tried directing a film, but everyone wanted to see her as the actress. Interestingly, for someone seen as the fantasy of heterosexual men, Shakeela was closely associated with the trans community and its causes. Now that she is gearing up for politics, I’m curious to know how she navigates the expectation of respectability.They didn’t have much control over what ended up at the editing table. They shared quasi-family relationships with directors and technicians, so it wasn’t direct exploitation. Some told me it was a way to get a foothold in the mainstream industry and make connections with directors. But once you’re a part of soft porn, your chances in the mainstream went down.Most cinema halls I went to in Kerala weren’t willing to have women in the audience, unless they were sex workers. But I spoke with many women who watched these films on cable television late at night. The female lead appeals to people because she’s sexually autonomous and doesn’t care about middle-class morality. Funnily, the men who acted in soft porn were more embarrassed to speak with me as their work was seen as demasculinising. The strong female lead was the fulcrum of the narrative. She needs to have sex, and sometimes there are references to it not being fulfilling. The men take that personally, feeling like they were just an extra in a Shakeela film, rather than an actor.Female sexual pleasure is a big no-no in mainstream filmic depiction. Women as agents of pleasure was something impossible to imagine in dominant media. When I asked directors why they wanted to show female pleasure, they said they wanted to change the dynamics, where instead of a hero dictating things, it’s a woman. The female lead then stands in for the man and is allowed those desires.",Darshana Sreedhar Mini studies Kerala’s once-bustling adult film industry.

Face it! Men's makeup is a booming beauty business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/face-it-mens-makeup-is-a-booming-beauty-business/articleshow/118516520.cms,"Face it! Men's makeup is a booming beauty business

For the longest time, men wearing makeup have been used as a comedic trope in Indian films. With plump red lips, unruly wigs, and rosy cheeks, they either impersonated women to fool cops in heist thrillers or were made the butt of 'gay' jokes in scenes with a roaring laugh track. Cut to 2025, however, and the world of men's makeup is on our screens for a different reason.In an episode of popular startup pitching reality show 'Shark Tank India', Ahmedabad's Rahul Shah stood in front of the judges, pitching Yaan Man - India's first makeup brand exclusively for men. Shah, who worked for five years as a cosmetic formulator in the US, returned to India in 2018 to break taboos.""In the US, I saw a lot of heterosexual men from Asia and other parts of the world using makeup to hide their dark circles, acne, and improve their skincare. But in India, most brands who even catered to men were only focusing on beard and hair care,"" Shah says.The path was not that easy, though. When he discussed his idea of selling concealers, foundation, and tinted moisturisers for men suited to Indian skin tones and weather conditions, people around him, including his friends, laughed. Most of them were reluctant to even use a proper face wash or apply sunscreen, forget anything else. Despite the taboos, he knew there was a growing market for it. After all, traditional players like Lakme India and MAC Cosmetics have introduced products for men, while representation has been growing - thanks to the glassy skin of K-drama heartthrobs and the videos of male beauty influencers like Ankush Bahuguna raking in millions of views.In fact, data by consumer research firm Mintel shows that one in every five beauty and personal care products launched in India since July 2022 was targeted at men - the biggest share for the category in the Asia-Pacific markets. Though the Indian market is smaller than that of China and Japan, the report adds, it is growing at a much faster rate, with the Indian male grooming category valued at more than Rs 10,000 crore.Social media has been the main catalyst for this shift, says Mumbai-based makeup artist Karan Chugh. ""For the longest time, heterosexual men associated taking care of their physical appearance to only going with the gym and oiling their beards. However, with access to trends from across the world, they realise now that this need not be the case."" In terms of products, concealers and tinted lip balms have become quite popular in the last year or two, he adds.A number of brands Chugh works with are also hiring male models for campaigns centred around beauty. A recent social media campaign he worked on for Nykaa Cosmetics, for instance, features 28-year-old Hindi film actor Gurfateh Singh Pirzada wearing nothing but an apron (and makeup). Centred around Valentine's Day, Pirzada stars as 'Pookieman', posing with a bunch of gender-neutral lip products, with names like Lip Glaze, Lip Cloud, and Butter Bomb - quite a shift from the matte black 'machoness' that male grooming products have traditionally relied on.This shift is not just limited to the sets of a reality show or the glittery world of Mumbai. Mohammed Maaz Khan, who hails from Rampur village in Uttar Pradesh, says he was more into fashion than all the other boys in his college. During Covid, he started posting grooming content online. A few of them went viral, and he was even featured on Instagram's official account. A chemical engineering graduate, Khan went on to pursue a course in cosmetology. However, the journey wasn't smooth as body butter. ""Initially, I faced a lot of criticism. A number of people asked me if I was transgender and used slurs. They couldn't digest what they were seeing,"" Khan says.His attempt to normalise makeup led him to start posting the beauty routines of Bollywood and TV actors. ""Many men admire actors and aspire to look like them but aren't aware of the products they use to look that way,"" Khan adds. He soon began posting about the benefits of using face serums, BB creams, CC creams and tinted lip balms, along with advice for tackling dark circles and wrinkles.Soon, his inbox was flooded with requests from curious men who wanted to know more. Several grooms-to-be reached out too, to enquire about the right products to look good on their wedding day. ""A lot of them would never have walked up to someone in real life and asked these questions out of fear of being ridiculed. But messaging someone online helped them overcome that,"" points out Khan, who has over 6 lakh followers on Instagram today.Meanwhile, Yaan Man founder Shah says the broader shift in Indian men's mentality will not happen overnight, but the response from users has been far better than expected. ""A lot of men are still hesitant to post public reviews or talk about it. But they're buying more and more products,"" he says. Now, he wants to double down on them, with four more products already in the pipeline scheduled to be launched later this year.","One in every five beauty and personal care products launched in India since July 2022 was targeted at men.

"As temple-mosque disputes rise, archaeology becomes a minefield",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-temple-mosque-disputes-rise-archaeology-becomes-a-minefield/articleshow/118516422.cms,"As temple-mosque disputes rise, archaeology becomes a minefield

In 1861, the British Raj had an epiphany. To better assert their control over the Indian population, they felt they needed to know more about the region’s history and culture. This, combined with the passion of a young army engineer named Alexander Cunningham for mapping and restoring India’s historical remains, led to the establishment of the Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ). Cunningham went on to become its first head.The ASI, which holds guardianship of over 3,600 monuments across the nation today, was initially tasked with preserving historical landmarks as well as studying the history of the Indian subcontinent through archaeological discoveries and excavations. In later years, its role expanded to include boosting India’s image as a prime tourist destination with vast historical assets.Of late though, ASI has waded into fraught terrain by investigating contentious claims that ancient mosques were built over pre-existing Hindu temples. The most recent is Sambhal where ASI is conducting surveys in the Shahi Mosque vs Harihar Mandir case. Last month, it submitted a report saying it had found evidence of a temple at the Gyanvapi mosque complex in Varanasi. While the survey on the Shahi Idgah mosque in Mathura has been put on hold by the Supreme Court, the ASI has been directed to conduct surveys and excavations following a petition claiming a temple exists below the famed Ajmer Sharif.As ASI lines up archaeologists, surveyors and field experts to dig deep into each case, it also raises questions as to whether the custodian of monuments has lost its original focus on protecting cultural heritage, and become more aligned with resolving centuries-old religious disputes on the pretext of archaeological research.Most ASI officials declined to comment, saying it was a politically and legal ly sensitive issue. “ASI’s role is to discover the truth. We are not driven by any local or political pressure. Our job is to explore archaeological evidence in the disputed sites and present our findings to the courts. Excavations have always been a mandate of ASI and well within our designated purview,’’ says an ASI official.However, some archaeology officials who spoke on condition of anonymity stressed the importance of ASI maintaining its secular image and felt it should not become involved in religious disputes. Former ASI director K N Dixit , who was recently honoured with the Padma Bhushan for his contribution to archaeology, was of the viewpoint that history should never be influenced by politics, a perspective shared by many officials of the organisation, former and current.Dr B R Mani , senior archaeologist, former ADG, ASI, and currently DG, National Museum, observed that avoiding an ideological and communal battle between Hindu and Muslim stakeholders is a tricky task. “Ultimately, you can’t please both contesting parties, and this is where ASI’s role becomes crucial. ASI is a government body and any verdict delivered by them on a disputed site becomes the official mandate. So, one has to be careful to ensure the powers of ASI are not misused on the behest of any faction,’’ he says.Mani pointed out that the Ayodhya case set a precedent. “The Ayodhya case should ideally have been treated as an exception, but now all courts are asking ASI to do similar archaeological excavations in other disputed religious sites. Resolving religious disputes was never the mandate of ASI, but when the courts give directions to carry out surveys at these sites, ASI has to follow,’’ he says.Alok Tripathi Silchar, who led a team of surveyors to examine whether Gyanvapi mosque was built on the remains of a demolished temple, was also clear. “The survey has been done in compliance with court orders. There can be no other interpretation and we do not comment on legal issues,’’ he says.Within ASI, there are differing views on the controversial excavations in the current political climate. The more popular view is that archaeological excavations at any site (religious or not) will yield new findings which can be an asset to the nation. The contrary view is that almost every Indian structure has layers of history associated with it and excavations should take that into account. “At one time, the country was a majority Hindu civilisation. Then Islamic rulers started to invade the Indian sub-continent and brought their own beliefs, philosophy, and teachings.There was widespread destruction of temples across the country and they built their own structures over them. This has been widely documented in many instances. But at the end of the day, all such relics, irrespective of when they were constructed, are a part of Indian history. So, which chapter of history do we want to preserve,” asks an official.A number of archaeologists and historians also wonder why ASI is no longer prioritising excavations at historically rich places like Rakhigarhi or other sites of Harappan and Indus Valley civilisations. Conservation work is also suffering, they say, with the ministry of culture itself admitting last year that over 50 monuments had gone missing. “The focus now seems to be primarily on excavating sites of Islamic structures to prove the existence of temples. Where does it end? There is documented proof that World Heritage Site Qutub Minar was built on the ruins of 27 temples. Are we ready to revisit history here as well,’’ asks an expert. In fact, cultural appropriation began in the Indian sub-continent long before the arrival of Islam or Hinduism. “India had a rich Buddhist history before the arrival of Hindu kings. Some believe that notable sites like Jagannath temple in Puri were built over Buddhist and Jain sites. There may or may not be archaeological evidence, but can we go on excavating every historic structure to find what predates it? At some point, we need to accept history as it stands today,’’ says a historian, requesting anonymity.Historian Swapna Liddle said the problem was not surveys but the motives behind them. “The purpose of archaeological excavation or any kind of scientific investigation is to further our knowledge and understand the site and the history. It is always done with an open mind. But it becomes problematic when these investigations are done with a preconceived notion. If we are not open about our motivations, then what are we even doing,” asks Liddle. She gave the example of Delhi’s Purana Qila monument, which is widely believed to be the original site of ancient Indraprastha. “There is an incessant need to prove it is there, despite no concrete evidence unearthed after decades of excavations. How long will we keep digging?’’ says Liddle.Reacting to the archaeological surveys at disputed mosque sites, conservationist AGK Menon questioned what purpose they served. “As per my understanding, these recent court-ordered surveys are in contravention of the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict, which clearly stated that you cannot disturb any existing place of worship anymore. But what’s been happening of late is setting a dangerous precedent,” he says. The recent SC order may have put a temporary pause on new pleas for excavations but there is no telling what the future might dig up.","As temple-mosque disputes rise, archaeology becomes a minefield. The most recent is Sambhal where ASI is conducting surveys in the Shahi Mosque vs Harihar Mandir case. Last month, it submitted a report saying it had found evidence of a temple at the Gyanvapi mosque complex in Varanasi.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118516449,imgsize-1203792,width-400,resizemode-4/118516449.jpg"

On Jan 29, India witnessed Isro's 100th rocket launch when GSLV-F15 rocket launched navigation satellite NVS-02. He urged people to observe National Science Day by spending “One Day as a Scientist”, which he said will foster curiosity among children and youth about science.On the country’s space sector achievements, Modi said, “Champions Trophy is going on these days and there is an atmosphere of cricket for everyone. We all know the thrill of a century in cricket. But today, I am not going to talk about cricket, rather I will talk about the wonderful century that India has made in space. Last month, the country was a witness to Isro's 100th rocket launch. This is not just a number, but it shows our resolve to achieve ever-new heights in space science. Our space journey started in a very normal manner. There were challenges in every step, but our scientists continued moving forward achieving victory over them.”“With time, the list of our achievements in space flights continues to grow longer. Be it building a launch vehicle, success of Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and Aditya L1 or carrying out the unprecedented mission of sending 104 satellites into space in one go with one rocket.

""You try to spend one day as a scientist. You must visit places like a research lab, planetarium or space centre that day. This will increase your curiosity about science. Like space and science, India is rapidly making its mark in another field. That is AI (Artificial intelligence). I went to Paris to take part in an AI summit. There, people lauded India's strides in the field of AI,"" PM Modi said.He also mentioned a teacher from Telangana, Thodasam Kailash, who is harnessing AI technology in digital song and music to help preserve the tribal languages, including Kolami.

NEW DELHI/AMRITSAR: A batch of 12 illegal Indian immigrants deported from the US to Panama arrived Sunday in Delhi via Istanbul on a Turkish Airlines flight, making them the first group to be sent back without restraints since three American military aircraft brought 332 deportees to Amritsar within a fortnight this month.The 12 deportees are said to be among 50 undocumented Indian nationals who reportedly arrived in Panama recently. Panama has been assisting the US in its deportation efforts.According to local media reports, the UN-affiliated International Organisation for Migration helped purchase plane tickets for people of various nationalities whose citizenship was confirmed, 17 of them Indians. More deportees from the group are expected next week once MEA verifies their nationality.Deportation from Panama is being carried out under the Regional Assisted Voluntary Return Programme , an IOM protection and support response to facilitate the dignified, safe, regular and orderly return, as well as voluntary and based on an informed decision, of migrants to their countries of origin.Four men from Punjab in the latest batch took a connecting IndiGo flight from Delhi to Amritsar.Airport authorities in the city were informed in advance about the arrival of Patiala resident Jatinder Singh, Maninder Dutt of Jalandhar, and Jugraj Singh and Harpreet Singh from Gurdaspur, but it wasn't immediately clear whether they came unescorted all the way from Panama.Official sources said after the mandatory debriefing that Jatinder, 34, paid a travel agent from Patiala Rs 52 lakh to help him enter the US through a route criss-crossing Guyana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.Maninder, 21, put his faith and Rs 42 lakh in the hands of a Delhi-based illegal immigration agent, who then sent him on a perilous journey through Spain, Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. Jugraj and Harpreet, both 30, paid Rs 38 lakh each to an agent from Batala and reached the US via Nicaragua.Punjab NRI minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal said the state govt had registered cases against 15 travel agents based on complaints from natives of the state who were deported from the US this month. Of these, three agents have been arrested, while police have been raiding offices and homes in search of the absconding 12.Sources said the deportees who arrived on Sunday told authorities they intended to file cases against the travel agents who duped them only if there was a chance of getting their money back.The first US military flight that arrived on Feb 5 brought 104 deportees, with both men and women handcuffed and their feet shackled. The second flight, carrying 119 deportees, arrived on Feb 15. The third flight, with 112 deportees, landed on Feb 16, this time with only the men in shackles.",Four men from Punjab in the latest batch took a connecting IndiGo flight from Delhi to Amritsar.

Will focus on making Delhi a 'viksit rajdhani': Sachdeva

NEW DELHI: CM Rekha Gupta said Sunday the previous AAP dispensation left the state coffers ""empty"", but assured that the BJP govt was ""committed"" to rolling out the Rs 2,500-per month honorarium scheme for eligible women.Addressing a joint press meet with Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva after a legislative party huddle, Gupta said several rounds of meetings had been held with govt officials on the issue in the past four days since she took over.""The condition the previous govt left for us... when we sit with officers to review the financial status... the entire govt exchequer is found empty,"" Gupta said, while replying to a question on preparations to implement the women's aid scheme. ""But giving the money to women is a routine work we have to do. We will surely implement the scheme with detailed planning. It's our commitment. We will do it 1,000%,"" the CM said.According to an estimate, after excluding taxpayers, govt servants and beneficiaries of other state welfare schemes, around 38 lakh women above 18 will be eligible for assistance under this scheme. The govt may need over Rs 11,000 crore annually for this.Giving a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,500 per month to women in Delhi under the ' Mahila Samriddhi Yojana ' was one of the prominent electoral promises made by BJP in the run-up to the assembly polls.The Delhi CM said the first day of the Delhi assembly session on Monday will see the election of Speaker and Deputy Speaker followed by the newly-elected legislators taking oath. She added that the three-day assembly session will focus on discussions about development projects. ""The most important aspect of the session, as we committed, will be the laying of the pending CAG reports in the house and the previous govt must now answer the people of Delhi for the misuse of their hard-earned money,"" Gupta said, adding that all commitments made by BJP will be fulfilled.On former CM Atishi's statement that her govt followed the procedure and forwarded the CAG reports to the lieutenant governor for approval before tabling them in the house, Sachdeva said the AAP dispensation was in a habit of ""peddling lies."" ""They should be ready to reply (on CAG reports),"" he added. The assembly session is starting Monday and will continue till Thursday.Sachdeva also said that the BJP govt in the next five years will focus on making Delhi a ""viksit rajdhani"" (developed capital). ""All MLAs discussed in the meeting on how to take forward the developmental works in their respective constituencies. Our govt will complete all the projects and fulfil the expectations of the people.

Indian-origin billionaire’s daughter Vasundhara Oswal narrates shocking ordeal in Uganda jail

Arrested without a warrant, thrown into a van

Denied legal rights, trapped in the system

From petty crimes to murderers’ block

'They wanted money'

Seeking justice

NEW DELHI: Vasundhara Oswal , daughter of Indian-origin billionaire Pankaj Oswal , has broken her silence on her three-week nightmare behind bars in Uganda. Falsely accused of kidnapping and murdering her father’s former employee, she endured prison conditions that she calls a “gross violation of human rights.”The 26-year-old was arrested on October 1, 2024, over the alleged abduction of Mukesh Menaria , a former employee of Pankaj Oswal.However, the case crumbled when Menaria was found alive in Tanzania just days later.Despite this, Vasundhara remained imprisoned for weeks. Speaking to PTI on Friday, she recalled the horrors she faced, ""I was detained for five days, then thrown in prison for two weeks. I wasn’t allowed to shower, and they denied me food and water. My parents had to bribe police officers just to get me basic necessities.”At one point, she was reportedly denied access to a washroom as punishment.According to Vasundhara, Ugandan police raided her premises without a warrant and took her away under false pretenses. ""When I asked them to present a search warrant, they said, ‘We are in Uganda, we can do anything. You’re not in Europe anymore,’” she alleged.She claimed a male officer physically forced her into a police van when she refused to comply immediately.Forced to give a statement without a criminal lawyer, Vasundhara said she was made to pay $30,000 and surrender her passport for a police bond—yet she was still thrown back in her cell. Even after obtaining an unconditional release order from the courts, she was illegally detained for another 72 hours.Shockingly, instead of dismissing the case after Menaria was found alive on October 10, authorities kept her in prison and even escalated her charges from kidnapping to attempted murder.Initially housed in a facility for petty criminals, Vasundhara was later moved to a prison for convicted murderers and human traffickers. She spent two weeks in Nakasongola prison , fearing for her life.After weeks of legal battles, she secured bail on October 21, but her ordeal was far from over. Her passport was only returned on December 10, and the case was not dismissed until December 19.Vasundhara alleges that corrupt officials kept the charges alive even after Menaria was found, reducing them later to a misdemeanor confinement charge—all in an attempt to extort more money.""This was done to keep something over our heads and squeeze more money from my family,"" she said.Now free, Vasundhara wants the Ugandan government to be held accountable for what she calls an unjust persecution. ""This is up to the Ugandan government to correct its mistakes. We have invested in their country for years, and this is how they treat us?"" she said.As she reviews legal options, her case has raised global concerns over police corruption and human rights violations in Uganda.","Vasundhara Oswal, daughter of Indian-origin billionaire Pankaj Oswal has broken her silence on her three-week nightmare behind bars in Uganda.

Centre bans manufacture & export of 2 drugs ‘fuelling’ W Africa opioid crisis

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON/MUMBAI: A media expose on a Maharashtra-based pharma company accused of illegally manufacturing unlicensed, addictive opioids and exporting them to West Africa led to a joint raid by state and central drug inspectors over the weekend and the announcement of curbs on the manufacturing and export of such products.The raid on Aveo Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd's facility and warehouse in Boisar under Palghar district followed a BBC World Service documentary titled ' India's Opioid Kings '. It examined the public health crisis caused by pills made of a deadly cocktail of tapentadol (a powerful opioid) and carisoprodol (an addictive muscle relaxant), packaged as legitimate licensed medicines, in countries such as Nigeria and Ghana.This drug combination is not licensed for use anywhere in the world. ""They are coming in from India and that has become a big menace in Nigeria,"" a member of Nigeria's drug enforcement agency told BBC.Maharashtra FDA officials said the entire stock was seized, and further production was immediately halted. The company was also slapped with a showcause.On Friday, the Centre issued directives to all states to revoke the no-objection certificate (NOC) for export and the manufacturing licences for tapentadol, carisoprodol, and other similar products.Speaking to TOI, an FDA official said, ""Aveo has been on our radar for the past few months. We served them notice in October for non-matching of their manufacturing and distribution records. Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) is responsible for testing the exports as per their protocols, and the state does not play a role. Both the medicines have their use separately, but their combination is harmful, and it is already banned in India.""Monish Bhalla, former senior officer of India's Narcotics Control Bureau, said, ""The checks and balances on imports in India are far more stringent than for exports.""Aveo is breaking Indian law because it is not meeting import requirements in Ghana, but ""the Indian authorities pay little attention to pharma drugs not sold in India,"" the documentary states.An undercover BBC reporter went to Aveo Pharmaceuticals' factory posing as a businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria and met the managing director Vinod Kumar Sharma. Whilst being plied with snacks and Bisleri, Sharma showed him the pills boxed under different brand names such as Taamdol 225mg and Taramaking 250, all made from the same dangerous cocktail.Sharma told the reporter, ""This is very harmful for their health, but the customer cannot understand that. He wants to relax. Any medicine can be misused. This is a very harmful product in their hands, but nowadays this is business. I can clear from our customs, means India. You can clear from your side.""He told the reporter that he can ship them to Ghana and they can enter Nigeria from there. The drugs he shows are the same ones that have been seized by the police in West African nations because they are illegal. Sharma also boasted that his factory is ""WHO certified"".The documentary also focuses on a drug rehabilitation centre in Nigeria where patients addicted to these opioids live in appalling conditions with their legs chained together, sleeping on the floor with no running water. In Tamale, Ghana, local city chief Alhassan Maham has created a citizens' task force of 100 volunteers whose mission is to raid and arrest the drug dealers and take these illegal opioids off the streets. But the problem is: India is manufacturing them faster than they can do that.CDSCO told the BBC it has taken the matter up with countries in West Africa and will take immediate action against any pharmaceutical firm involved in malpractice.While Sharma did not respond to TOI requests, the company in a statement said that the allegations against it were baseless and without merit. The company added that it adhered to the rules and regulations set by various regulatory authorities to manufacture and export its products.","Maharashtra FDA officials said the entire stock was seized, and further production was immediately halted.

NEW DELHI: Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan 's seat on the Air India airbus that flew him Bhopal-Delhi Saturday was not ""broken"". That, sources say, is the new light seat increasingly chosen by airlines to keep aircraft weight low and help save fuel burn with the lean cushion taking all the passenger weight, giving the effect of being sunken.""The seat was reclining and not broken. It has been checked by engineers. But the lean cushioning often gives a sunken feel, especially during turbulence when flyers may feel the seat is moving,"" said sources. A senior DGCA official said on Sunday evening Air India was yet to submit its report on the Union minister's experience.The former Madhya Pradesh CM wrote on X Saturday: ""I had booked a ticket on AI 436. I was allotted seat number 8C. I went and sat on the seat, the seat was broken and sunken in. Sitting was uncomfortable.... Not just one, there are more such seats....""It is learnt that a number of seats had ""sunken"" or thinned cushioning. The minister had written on X: ""After charging passengers full amount, seating them on a bad and uncomfortable seat is unethical. Is this not cheating the passengers? Will Air India management take steps so that in the future no passenger faces such discomfort, or will it keep taking advantage of passengers' urgency to reach their destination?"" Air India has apologised to Chouhan.With the advent of low cost carriers, air travel is no longer a luxury. The comfort factor, once associated with flying, is gradually giving way to a more frugal onboard experience.

Various bar bodies had objected to the amendments proposed by the Commission (report No. 266) on the grounds that the proposed bill recommends for ""introducing non-legal persons entering into the statutory body in the name of eminent persons and they will be empowered to deal with the disciplinary proceedings against advocates"".","The law ministry on Saturday withdrew the draft Advocates (Amendment) Bill, 2025 from public consultation. Various lawyers' bodies threatened protests against the bill.

Silt, water pose challenge for rescue team at Telangana tunnel

HYDERABAD: Six members of the team behind the heroic Nov 2023 Silkyara tunnel rescue operation in Uttarakhand joined the Army, NDRF, SDRF and local agencies on Sunday in accelerated efforts to save the eight workers - two of them engineers - trapped inside a collapsed portion of Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) in Telangana's Nagarkurnool district, reports Roushan Ali.As the clock ticked on an operation that yielded little in over 36 hours, families of the trapped men and agencies trying to reach them drew hope from the rescue of 41 workers confined for 17 days inside the Silkyara Bend-Barkot tunnel after a portion had caved in.Fears centred around the possibility of debris, including segments of the tunnel's concrete slab, having fallen on the eight workers. There was no contact with any of the trapped men until late Sunday, although rescue teams were stationed just outside the roof collapse site 13.5km inside the tunnel.The teams couldn't make any headway beyond the tunnel boring machine and debris because of the twin barriers of silt and water.Minister Jupally Krishna Rao, who is supervising the rescue effort along with his colleague N Uttam Kumar Reddy, said there was waterlogging along a 2km stretch leading to the collapse point. ""Getting through this is a challenging task. We have to flush out the water before the equipment can push ahead. Only then can removal of debris start. Additional motors have been brought to speed up water removal,"" he said.An irrigation department official said there was hardly 5 to 10 metres of space left where the eight workers were believed to be trapped.""The Telangana govt has requisitioned the Uttarakhand tunnel rescue team along with rat-hole miners to assist in the operation because they have the expertise. Better to have more hands in such a situation. We hope all lives will be saved,"" he added.The ground above the tunnel is 400 metres or nearly half a kilometre in height. Agencies involved in the operation are exploring all possible options to find the easiest exit for the trapped workers.","Silt, water pose challenge for rescue team at Telangana tunnel.

Here are the key quotes from PM's address:



""The Champions Trophy is going on these days... But today, I am not going to talk about cricket with you all; rather, I will talk about the wonderful century that India has made in Space. Last month, the country witnessed Isro's 100th rocket launch... With time, the list of our achievements in space flight continues to grow longer. Be it building a launch vehicle, the success of Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan, and Aditya L-1, or carrying out the unprecedented mission of launching 104 satellites into space.""

""Next month, March 8th is International Women’s Day… All types of knowledge are manifestations of various forms of Goddesses and she is also reflected in all the women power in the world… I am going to take an initiative which will be dedicated to our women power. I am going to hand over my social media accounts to a few inspiring women of our country for one day. ""

""Recently, I visited Paris to participate in a big AI conference. There, the world praised India's progress in this sector... Recently, Thodasam Kailash, a government schoolteacher in Telangana's Adilabad helped us preserve our tribal languages. Using AI tools, he composed a song in the Kolami language. Be it the space sector or AI, the increasing participation of our youth has brought in a new revolution.""

Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people to observe National Science Day by spending ""one day as a scientist"" through visits to research labs and planetariums.

""More than 11,000 athletes from all over the country performed brilliantly in the National Games held in Uttarakhand. This event presented a new version of Devbhoomi. Uttarakhand is now emerging as a strong sporting force in the country... This is the power of sports, which transforms individuals and communities as well as the entire State. It inspires future generations and also promotes a culture of excellence. My congratulations to the services team for winning maximum gold medals in these games.""

""Every year during ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’, we discuss various topics related to exams with our Exam Warriors. I am happy that this initiative is now being more institutionalised. Many new experts are also joining it. This year, we introduced a new format in 'Pariksha Pe Charcha’. We included eight different episodes featuring experts. We covered a wide range of topics from overall exam preparation to healthcare, mental well-being, and nutrition.""

""In Karnataka's BRT Tiger Reserve, the population of tigers is steadily increasing. Much of the credit goes to the Soliga Tribes, who worship tigers. Because of them, the man-animal conflict is almost non-existent in this region. Similarly, in Gujarat, the local people have played a crucial role in protecting and conserving Asiatic lions in Gir... Due to these dedicated efforts, the population of tigers, leopards, Asiatic lions, rhinos, and swamp deer has significantly grown in the past few years.""

The operation generated fake invoices worth Rs 97 crore for tobacco products and soft drinks, and fraudulently claimed input tax credits of Rs 66.6 crore.The mastermind behind the scheme was found to be a former property dealer — Ashim Kumar (50) — who had transformed his modest shop into the epicentre of the tax evasion network . He was arrested on Friday.Kumar, officials said, registered a fictitious company at the shop's address in Khandsa, and claimed to deal in high-tax FMCG products. Cigarettes, which attract a staggering 108% tax, including central GST and cess, and soft drinks with their 40% tax burden, were the primary focus of this fraudulent operation.The veil was lifted off the scam when tax officials noticed an unusually high volume of trade emanating from a tiny establishment within a short period.

He faces charges under various provisions of the GST Act, 2017.Singh admitted there was a growing sophistication of tax fraud in the country that enforcement agencies were finding it challenging to tackle.""What makes this case particularly concerning is how a small retail space was being used to perpetrate such a massive fraud. It portrays the need for continued vigilance and advanced detection methods in our tax administration system,"" he added.Officials said more revelations were expected as the probe progressed and delved deeper into the network of companies involved in tax evasion.","The operation generated fake invoices worth Rs 97 crore for tobacco products and soft drinks, and fraudulently claimed input tax credits of Rs 66.6 crore.

Watch: Rescue operation underway for 8 workers trapped in Telangana’s Srisailam tunnel collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/rescue-operation-underway-for-8-workers-trapped-in-telanganas-srisailam-tunnel-collapse/articleshow/118495882.cms,"NEW DELHI: A rescue operation is underway after a portion of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel collapsed in Telangana's Nagarkurnool district on Saturday, leaving eight workers trapped inside.Emergency teams, including the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), are working to locate and rescue them.The collapse occurred near Domalpenta, about 200 meters inside the tunnel, which has a depth of 500 feet.At the time, 60 workers were on-site, and while 52 managed to escape, some with injuries, eight remain trapped.The trapped workers include Jaiprakash Associates Limited project engineer Manoj Kumar and field engineer Sri Niwas (both from Uttar Pradesh), four labourers from Jharkhand—Sandeep Sahu, Jataks, Santosh Sahu, and Anuj Sahu—and two machine operators from Robbins India Company, Sunny Singh (Jammu & Kashmir) and Gurpreet Singh (Punjab).Sukhendu Datta, NDRF deputy commander said, ""Yesterday at around 10pm, we went inside the tunnel to analyse the situation. Out of the 13 km distance inside the tunnel, we covered 11 km on this locomotive and the remaining 2 km, we covered on the conveyor belt. When we reached the end of the TMV (Tunnel Boring Machine), we tried to establish contact with the trapped workers by calling out their names, but we could not find anything.""Further he stated, ''There is a 200-metre patch filled with debris. Until this debris is cleaned, we will not be able to find out the exact location of the trapped workers and rescue them. Water is filled in the patch between 11-13 km of the tunnel, and until water is removed, debris cleaning work will not start. Our first team reached here around 7pm yesterday. To rescue the trapped workers, first we need to complete the dewatering process and then remove the debris. The exact location of the trapped workers is yet to be ascertained.""Earlier, The senior irrigation officials have confirmed that the collapse of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel roof was triggered by a sudden leakage of water and soil, affecting nearly 13 kilometres of the excavation site.The SLBC tunnel, which extends approximately 44 kilometres from the left bank of the Srisailam Dam, suffered the accident about 13 kilometres from its entrance.An earth fracture along the tunnel wall allowed water and mud to rush in, forcing workers to flee for safety. According to Jaiprakash Associates and Robbins India, the companies responsible for tunnel boring, the incident occurred within 30 minutes of starting work at 8am. While workers near the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) managed to escape, those in the front section of the tunnel were trapped.Work was immediately halted, and supervisors swiftly evacuated as many workers as possible. Officials have assured that the ventilation system inside the tunnel remains operational, ensuring a continuous oxygen supply for those still trapped.Rescue teams are working tirelessly to locate and assist the missing workers, with the Army expected to arrive at the site by Saturday night to aid in the ongoing operations.","A portion of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel collapsed in Telangana's Nagarkurnool district on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: The US President Donald Trump has once again raised concerns over alleged USAID's $18 million funding allocation for elections in India, questioning the rationale behind spending substantial amounts abroad instead of focusing on American voter participation.Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Trump suggested reverting to paper ballots and proposed seeking India's assistance with electoral processes.""18 million dollars for helping India with its elections. Why the hell? Why don't we just go to old paper ballots, and let them help us with their elections, right? Voter ID. Wouldn't that be nice? We're giving money to India for elections. They don't need money,"" US president said.""They take advantage of us pretty good. One of the highest tariffed nations in the world. We try and sell something. They have a 200 per cent tariff.

Ranveer Allahbadia is in the middle of a firestorm. His controversial question on Samay Raina ’s—a disturbing hypothetical about incest—set the internet ablaze.That was the question. It didn’t take long for outrage to follow.Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis publicly condemned him, and an FIR was filed. The backlash grew fast, with major names weighing in. While figures like Uorfi Javed and Kashish Kapoor argued that he had apologized and people were dragging the issue, the damage was done. The Supreme Court eventually granted him interim relief, but that didn’t stop the internet from digging up his past.Now, his old interviews are resurfacing—including a conversation with Ajay Devgn and Rohit Shetty , where Allahbadia pushed Bollywood's biggest names to embraceagain.In a recently resurfaced interview, Ranveer Allahbadia sat down with Ajay Devgn and Rohit Shetty while they were promoting. Midway through the conversation, he brought up Samay Raina’sand called it one of the biggest YouTube stories of 2024.His pitch? That India isn’t like the US. That while American audiences take offense easily, Indians areabout edgy humor. He argued that offensive jokes should make a comeback in Bollywood.Rohit Shetty and Ajay Devgn didn’t push back too hard, but Shetty did acknowledge that a scene from—where Shreyas Talpade’s stammering character struggles to say a phone number—wouldn’t fly today.But does India reallycare?

“Inko dekh ke kisi Logan walo ka Prime drink yaad aaya 😂,”

“It looks like Prime’s third copy (not that Prime is good or something). They will def use Ruchika for promoting this chapri brand and getting views. Sasta Prime 😭.”

Fokus hit the market in February 2025, and yes, it’s significantly cheaper than Prime

“It’s like Prime... but for people who think 500 bucks is too much for a drink.”

Fans are already calling Fokus a copy of Prime, but will it actually sell?

Fukra Insaan (Abhishek Malhan) and Triggered Insaan (Nischay Malhan) just entered the hydration drink market, but instead of praise, they’re getting roasted. Their new drink, Fokus, looks eerily similar to Prime, the hydration brand by KSI and WWE Superstar Logan Paul . The colors, the branding, even the bottle design—it’s all too familiar.Social media caught on immediately.One Reddit user didn’t hold back:basically calling Fokus a knockoff. Another user added,People aren’t mad. They’re just having fun with how obvious the similarities are. Fokus seems to be banking on the same influencer-heavy marketing strategy that made Prime popular, except at a much lower price point.Having hit the market in February 2025, Fokus is being marketed as an affordable hydration drink, available in flavors like Mango Pineapple, Kiwi Lemon, and Watermelon Strawberry. The drink contains coconut water, taurine, and ginseng extract, ingredients meant to provide hydration and energy.And the price? A three-pack costs Rs. 450. That’s way cheaper than Prime, which is ridiculously overpriced in India. One Redditor put it best:Fokus is clearly aiming at the younger crowd, the same people who built Fukra Insaan and Triggered Insaan’s careers. The two YouTubers have been posting behind-the-scenes content about the drink’s development, with their managers Mayank Mishra (Fukra Insaan’s manager) and Ankit Madaan (Triggered Insaan’s manager) handling the business side of things.The internet can’t unsee the similarities. From the branding to the influencer-driven promotions, Fokus is walking the same path that made Prime a global hit. But while people love making fun of the “Sasta Prime” branding, they’re still paying attention.Also Read : Amid backlash and threats from ex-WWE star, Ranveer Allahbadia recounts ‘hyper offensive humor’ pitch to Bollywood bigs Fokus launches across India in February 2025.

On Wednesday evening, a large group of activists gathered outside SpaceX 's Washington, D.C., office to protest recent federal job cuts announced by the Trump administration. The demonstration, which blocked traffic in front of the aerospace company's headquarters, was a result of mounting frustration over government layoffs. The protest followed a march that began at Federal Triangle and concluded at 11th and F Street Northwest.The demonstrators, including former federal employees and labor union members, held signs criticizing Elon Musk’s influence in the current administration. One protester’s sign read, ""No one voted for Elon Musk ,"" referencing his role in establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been central to recent budget cuts. These layoffs have disproportionately affected employees in various government agencies, including the National Park Service.Union organizers have called for continued protests, highlighting the adverse impact of these job cuts on essential public services such as housing, environmental conservation, and historical preservation. As tensions escalate, the movement against these workforce reductions continues to gain traction.The primary catalyst for Wednesday’s demonstration was the Trump administration’s implementation of extensive federal job cuts. These layoffs, reportedly part of a broader effort to reduce government spending, have led to uncertainty and distress among public sector employees.Tiffany Montes, a former National Park Service worker, shared her frustration and disappointment after being unexpectedly dismissed from her role in historic preservation. Despite two years of dedicated service as an intern and securing a permanent position, she received a termination email on Friday.Montes told NBC News. She further expressed disbelief at the justification for her termination.Montes was among hundreds of National Park Service employees dismissed under the new measures. The National Park Service plays a crucial role in maintaining historical landmarks, including the White House, and the job cuts have raised concerns about the potential neglect of these important sites.Paul Osadebe, a representative of the Federal Unionists Network, emphasized the risks posed by these job losses.he stated.Union leaders have warned that these cuts could have severe consequences for government services, affecting infrastructure, housing, and public safety.Elon Musk has gained significant influence within the Trump administration since Donald Trump assumed the presidency last month. One of his most controversial moves was the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an agency tasked with reducing federal spending.DOGE's primary goal is to streamline government operations and eliminate what it deems unnecessary expenditures. However, critics argue that its aggressive cost-cutting measures have led to the indiscriminate removal of employees essential to public services.Protesters outside SpaceX's office held Musk accountable for his role in implementing these workforce reductions. Many view his growing political influence as a concern, particularly since the agency’s budget reduction strategy has resulted in widespread job insecurity.The Trump administration has justified the job cuts as necessary for achieving fiscal responsibility. DOGE has outlined a plan to reduce federal spending by $2 trillion within the next year.To facilitate this process, DOGE previously sent mass emails to over two million federal employees, offering a voluntary resignation program. Those who accepted the offer were promised continued salary and benefits through September of this year. However, the administration had warned that if an insufficient number of employees opted for voluntary resignation, involuntary layoffs would follow.As a result, mass terminations were implemented across multiple agencies, affecting thousands of workers. The administration argues that these cuts will lead to a leaner, more efficient government, though critics contend that the measures disproportionately impact lower-level employees while leaving higher-ranking officials unaffected.In response to the job cuts, activist groups and labor unions have vowed to continue their demonstrations. The Federal Unionists Network, the organization behind Wednesday’s protest, has planned a mutual aid event on Friday evening to provide support for affected workers.Union leaders anticipate further demonstrations in the coming weeks, particularly as more workers begin to feel the effects of the layoffs. Protesters have also urged lawmakers to intervene and reconsider the restructuring efforts led by DOGE.","Demonstrators gathered outside SpaceX's Washington, D.C., office to protest recent federal job cuts announced by the Trump administration.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
