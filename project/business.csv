"2006 Mumbai train blasts: It started in a jail cell. Now, it fights to free those wrongfully jailed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2006-mumbai-train-blasts-it-started-in-a-jail-cell-now-it-fights-to-free-those-wrongfully-jailed/articleshow/122930276.cms,"LONG BATTLE: Wahid Shaikh, who helped found the network, was acquitted in the case in 2015. Soon, his role shifted from accused to advocate

Besides its work on the 11/7 case, the Innocence Network India is helping other terror accused with legal aid

A narrow, rain-soaked lane in Mumbai’s Vikhroli leads to a small ground-floor room. Inside, a few chairs, a chatai, shelves of books, and maps of India and the world hang on the wall. This unassuming space is the ‘secretariat’ of Innocence Network India, a coalition of lawyers, prison-rights activists and civil society groups who work for “the rights of those wrongfully prosecuted or convicted, especially under terrorism charges.”On July 21, when the Bombay high court acquitted all 12 men convicted of the 2006 Mumbai train blasts — also known as the 11/7 bombings — some credit was due to this little-known coalition that kept the pressure alive, along with the efforts of the Maharashtra unit office of Jamiatul Ulema-e-Hind.Wahid Shaikh, who helped found the network, is visibly happy, and yet combative, seated in his two-room tenement. It’s where Shaikh, a school teacher in Nagpada, central Mumbai, spends most of his after-school hours running Acquit Undertrial, his one-man YouTube channel that amplifies cases of alleged wrongful prosecution and demands compensation for acquitted convicts. It was here that he recorded a congratulatory message for the accused and their families the night before the verdict.“I was 100% sure HC would exonerate them. I recorded it before the order was pronounced,” says Shaikh. He should know. He was one of 13 men arrested under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) for the train blasts. He spent nine years in Arthur Road jail before being acquitted in 2015. The only one to walk free at the time.Soon after, his role shifted from accused to advocate. On the day the prosecution sought death for eight and life terms for four, Shaikh was in court filing applications to allow two of the accused — Ehtesham Siddiqui and Sajid Ansari — to appear for their LLB exams.That day, he said, “This is not the end of the road. There are more doors to knock on, and a longer way to go.” In the decade since, that road became his life’s work. Outside of his teaching job at a school in Nagpada, Shaikh has devoted himself to helping undertrials and families left waiting as years passed.His journey from accused to advocate began in jail. Inside the anda cell, he read 10 newspapers a day in four languages, filed dozens of RTIs, and helped other inmates prepare their defence. He earned an LLB, an MA in English, and wrote ‘Begunah Qaidi’, a 400-page Urdu memoir that was later translated into Hindi and English and adapted into a film.By 2016, less than two years after his own acquittal, Shaikh had formalised his work by founding the Innocence Network, a coalition of lawyers, retired judges, activists, and filmmakers committed to fighting wrongful arrests and prolonged incarceration. The collective organises seminars, people’s tribunals, and public campaigns for those caught in the crosshairs of terror cases. “Innocence Network is an NGO for the exonerees, by the exonerees and of the exonerees,” explains Shaikh, 48. He adds that many of the RTIs he filed from prison helped him and the other accused during trial.“We had to build our case from the inside,” he says. “That became the foundation for everything that followed.” The idea came from innocence projects across the globe. “Such networks by civil society groups exist in different countries. When we saw how many men were wrongly framed in terror cases and later acquitted by the courts as state failed to prove their culpability, we realised the need for such a network in India too,” says Sharib Aqleem Ali, co-founder and scholar-activist.Over the past eight years, Innocence Network has run mobile legal-aid clinics and awareness drives. But one of its most visible tools has been People’s Tribunal, a citizen-led public hearing that highlights stories the courts often overlook.At the first such tribunal in Delhi on Oct 2, 2016, chaired by retired Delhi high court Chief Justice A P Shah, around 15 acquitted individuals shared testimonies and filmmaker Saeed Mirza was among the eight-member jury whose recommendations later informed Law Commission’s Report No. 277.“One of those recommendations was that India ratify UN Convention Against Torture, which it has signed but never formally adopted,” says Delhi-based lawyer and network facilitator Fawaz Shaheen. Another key recommendation was repeal of Section 18 of MCOCA, which allows confessions made in police custody to be admissible, an issue central to the 11/7 trial.A second tribunal, held in Kolkata in 2017, heard testimonies from 20 more acquitted in terror cases. The network has also compiled a dossier based on letters written by the 11/7 accused from prison, and continues to file RTIs to uncover procedural lapses and custodial irregularities. Regular meetings are held by the coalition that runs on pro bono support with mentors like retired Bombay HC judge B G Kolse Patil.As for the blasts case, the legal fight isn’t over yet. Bombay HC order acquitting all 12 has been stayed by Supreme Court. And from this tiny room in Vikhroli, the battle continues.","Innocence Network India is helping other terror accused with legal aid.

The project, taken up by the department of minor irrigation and groundwater development in collaboration with the department of survey, settlement and land records, seeks to geotag all 41,875 waterbodies in the state.As of April 2025, as many as 31,033 waterbodies were geotagged. Locals and panchayats are pitching in, turning conservation into a community mission. With this, the govt can track real-time updates, including water flow and encroachments.Till April, the state had surveyed and mapped 34,651 lakes spanning 7.7 lakh acres. In the process, it identified 42,678 acres of lake encroachment; of this, 28,750 acres have been cleared and restored, while the remaining are in the process of being recovered. Among the districts, Hassan has the highest number of geotagged waterbodies so far, while Ballari has the least. Community participation has played a key role in ensuring the project's progress, with gram panchayats helping in identifying lake boundaries, resolving local disputes and validating field data.Legal enforcement has also been made easier through geotagging. When encroachments are detected using data, the authorities concerned fine those responsible. The geotagged data is being used to support drought resilience and groundwater recharge planning, and aligns with the Karnataka State Action Plan on Climate Change, the Bengaluru Climate Action & Resilience Plan, and World Bank's water resilience project.Officials say this integrated approach will help the state strengthen flood-control measures, improve water storage, and secure the long-term water availability across the urban & rural areas across the state.","The project seeks to geotag all 41,875 waterbodies in the state.

'It Is Reasonable That...': Indian Envoy's Big Remark On Russia-India-China Troika Revival

‘Rudra brigades to have all combat elements, to be deployed together’

NEW DELHI: With the collusive military threat from China and Pakistan figuring high on India's radar screens, which was reinforced during Operation Sindoor , the Army is now setting up some new 'Rudra' all-arms brigades and 'Bhairav' light commando battalions for a greater and swifter offensive punch along the borders.The 11.5-lakh strong Army is also going in for 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries, and will also progressively equip all its 400-odd infantry battalions with drone platoons, against the backdrop of drone warfare upending all conventional military tactics in conflicts across the globe.Announcing these steps towards transforming and modernising the Army into ""a future-ready force"" during the Kargil Vijay Diwas in Drass on Saturday, General Upendra Dwivedi said India had delivered ""a well-planned, precise, and decisive response"" to Pakistan during the May 7-10 cross-border hostilities to ""achieve a decisive victory"".We gave them (Pakistan) a chance for peace but they acted with cowardice. We then answered with only valour...Operation Sindoor is our resolve, our message, and our response,"" General Upendra Dwivedi said, warning Pakistan against misadventures in the future. ""With the unwavering trust of the countrymen and the strategic autonomy granted by the govt, the Army delivered a well-planned, precise, and decisive response.The Army chief's transformation announcements involve conversion of existing units and formations, without fresh troop accretions, a senior officer told TOI. Some of the existing over 250 single-arm brigades (over 3,000 soldiers each) are now being converted to all-arms ones with integration of fighting elements like infantry, mechanised infantry, armoured (tanks), artillery, Special Forces and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), which will be backed by customised logistics and combat support. The bulk of the existing brigades are from the infantry, with the others being from other arms like the artillery, armoured, mechanised infantry, air defence and the like. At present, these brigades, commanded by one-star officers or brigadiers, come together only during exercises or actual combat.""Now, the ones being converted to Rudra brigades, tailor-made for specific areas and tasks along the borders, will have all combat elements and be permanently deployed together in peace and war. Their re-structuring has been validated and approved. Two Rudra brigades have already been set up,"" the senior officer said.This is in tune with the long-pending proposal to restructure some Army formations into self-contained 'integrated battle groups (IBGs)', with 5,000-6,000 soldiers and a varying mix of infantry, tanks, artillery, air defence, signals, engineers and other units to be commanded by Major-Generals, which is yet to be approved by the govt.The new Bhairav light commando battalions will be in addition to the existing specially-trained and equipped 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions (each has around 620 soldiers) meant for covert warfare deep behind enemy lines.The plan is to raise at least 40-50 Bhairav battalions, drawn from existing infantry units and equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones, in phases. Indicating that a few have already been raised, Gen Dwivedi said, ""The agile and lethal special forces Bhairav units are ready to surprise the enemy on the borders.""""Every infantry battalion will have drone platoons, while the firepower of the artillery has been multiplied many times through Divyastra batteries and loiter munitions batteries. The Army Air Defence (AAD) is being equipped with indigenous missile systems,"" he added.The AAD is slated to get two new regiments of the Akash Prime surface-to-air missiles designed for air defence in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China for Rs 8,160 crore as well as three regiments of the new quick reaction surface to air missile (QRSAM) systems for Rs 36,000 crore (which includes three squadrons also for IAF), as was reported by TOI earlier.Akash Prime has the capability to intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters and drones at a 25km range, it is 30km for the highly-mobile QRSAMs. They will add to India's existing multi-layered air defence network that played a crucial role in thwarting multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles launched by Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.","The 11.5-lakh strong Army is also going in for 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries. The Army chief's transformation announcements involve conversion of existing units and formations, without fresh troop accretions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122928223,imgsize-1267892,width-400,resizemode-4/122928223.jpg"
"Even the dead are filling up Bihar SIR forms, Supreme Court told",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/even-the-dead-are-filling-up-bihar-sir-forms-supreme-court-told/articleshow/122928606.cms,"BLOs found forging voters' signs: RJD

NEW DELHI: The special intensive revision of Bihar's electoral rolls was ""conducted in a manner that constitutes a grave fraud on voters"", petitioners opposing the Election Commission's exercise told Supreme Court on Saturday, alleging irregularities such as BLOs being found signing enumeration forms themselves, those dead being shown to have filled up forms, and those who hadn't filled up forms getting a message that their forms had been completed.Countering EC's submission that there was no irregularity in the process, Association for Democratic Reforms and Bihar's main opposition party, RJD, said in their responses that EC's figures were of no consequence since most of the forms were collected without documents and a large number of voters continued to be at the risk of disenfranchisement.Enumeration forms are being mass uploaded by BLOs without the knowledge or consent of voters, in order to achieve the unrealistic target set by EC. Many voters have reported that their forms have been submitted online, despite never having met with any BLO or signed any documents. Forms of even dead individuals have been reported to have been submitted,"" Association for Democratic Reforms said in its response filed through advocate Neha Rathi.It said, ""This points to the flawed manner in which the current SIR is being conducted, where the integrity of electoral rolls is compromised, potentially affecting millions of voters and undermining the democratic process.The situation raises serious questions about transparency, accountability and the potential for electoral fraud, as voters express confusion and concern over how their details were uploaded without their involvement. ""RJD MP Manoj Jha, in his response filed by advocate Fauzia Shakil, said media reports pointed out countless instances where electors have complained that BLOs did not visit their house or neighbourhood, forms were not given in duplicate, no acknowledgement was given on submission of forms and photos were not taken. He said BLOs were found forging voters' signatures on forms and uploading them.""The present exercise is unprecedented inasmuch as for the first time a person is being asked to furnish a documentary proof of his citizenship to the satisfaction of Election Commission to be enrolled as a voter and exercise his constitutional right to vote. As is evident from a bare perusal of Form 6 - the application form for a new voter - and documents for proof of date of birth and documents for proof of residence were required to be furnished along with only a declaration that a person is a citizen of India,"" Jha said.Pitting former EC commissioner against the poll panel, the petitioner referred to the opinion of Ashok Lavasa, who also questioned EC's decision on SIR. They also said there was no valid reason for EC to reject SC's suggestion to accept Aadhaar, voter ID and ration cards for inclusion in electoral rolls and that the exercise being done just months before the Bihar assembly polls was creating confusion on the ground and could disenfranchise lakhs of voters.""In light of the media reports from Bihar, showing how BLOs are signing blank enumeration forms in absence of voters, the numbers as suggested by EC are circumspect and even otherwise are of no consequence since most of these forms have been collected without documents and a large number of the electorate in Bihar continues to be at the risk of disenfranchisement. It is submitted that inclusion of name in draft roll has no meaning till documents as required are submitted, and thus, the risk of disenfranchisement looms large over a huge population who has already voted in multiple elections since 2003,"" the response said.","The special intensive revision of Bihar's electoral rolls was ""conducted in a manner that constitutes a grave fraud on voters"", petitioners say. They allege irregularities such as BLOs being found signing enumeration forms themselves, those dead being shown to have filled up forms, and those who didn't fill up forms getting message that their forms had been completed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122928625,imgsize-153620,width-400,resizemode-4/122928625.jpg"

Despite US warnings against participation, India hopes the conference will pave the way for concrete steps towards a two-state solution, advocating for an immediate ceasefire and hostage release.

NEW DELHI: India is expected to participate in the UN high-level conference on peaceful settlement of the Palestine question and implementation of the 2-state solution, amid renewed international efforts to end the Gaza war. According to a list of delegates, 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday that will be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, both key strategic partners for India.India had also voted in favour of a UNGA resolution last year that announced an international summit in June 2025 to discuss the 2-state solution. However, the conference couldn’t take place last month because of the Iran-Iraq conflict.The US had last month warned governments around the world against participating in the conference, saying it would mar ongoing efforts to end the war and free hostages, according to a diplomatic cable witnessed and reported by Reuters from Paris and Washington.According to France, the conference aims to chart a path towards the 2-state solution through “concrete measures” proposed by the 8 working groups, which have conducted extensive consultations with UN member-states and civil society.The conference is drawing attention also for the announcement by French President Emmanuel Macron this week that France will recognise the Palestinian state, becoming the first G7 country to do so. The US has condemned France’s decision and will skip the conference along with Israel.Indian ambassador to the UN, P Harish, had in a statement last week in the Security Council on the Palestinian question had taken note of the high-level conference. “While engaging in a forward-leaning and constructive manner, it is our hope that this Conference would pave the way for concrete steps towards achieving a two-State solution,” said the official, while strongly calling for a ceasefire to be put in place and seeking release of all hostages.India, which was among the 19 countries that abstained from voting on a UNGA resolution in June for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, has been in touch with the 8 working groups and is expected to further provide its inputs on the 2-state solution during the conference. The level of India’s participation is still under consideration.On the Gaza issue, India has continued to walk a tightrope between its vital and growing ties with Israel and the traditional support for the Palestinian cause, including the 2-state solution. While the government strongly defends Israel’s right to defend itself from Hamas terrorist attacks, it also expects Israel to follow international law and not target civilians. “India shares historic and strong ties with our Palestinian brothers and sisters. We have always stood by them and our commitment towards the Palestinian cause is unwavering,” said Harish in his remarks in the Council.The ministry of external affairs also reiterated the Indian position in Parliament on Friday that India has always supported a negotiated 2-state solution, towards establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognized borders, living side by side in peace with Israel.","Despite US warnings against participation, India hopes the conference will pave the way for concrete steps towards a two-state solution. 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday.

There is no greater example I think than what we did in Operation Sindoor. Less than 50 weapons can bring the adversary to the talking table...that is an example that needs to be studied and will be studied (by scholars),"" Air Marshal Tiwari said, speaking at an interactive session during an aerospace power seminar here.Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, in turn, said the armed forces need to maintain ""very high"" operational readiness round-the-clock and throughout the year because Operation Sindoor ""still continues"", while stressing that ""there are no runners-up in war"".Noting that the rapid advances in technology and the ongoing geopolitical churn have ushered in ""a third revolution in warfare"", the CDS said the Indian military needs ""information warriors, technology warriors and scholar warriors"" geared for multi-domain operations. It is essential for the military to learn both 'shastra' (warfare/weapons) and 'shaastra' (knowledge), he said.Though Air Marshal Tiwari did not specify the weapons that were used during the May 7-10 hostilities, IAF deployed Sukhoi-30MKI, Rafale and Mirage-2000 fighters to launch BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as Crystal Maze-2, Rampage and Scalp missiles for the calibrated pinpoint strikes on the Pakistani airbases and radar sites, a few of them close to nuclear facilities as well as command and control structuresThe IAF vice chief also said manned systems like fighters ""still have a huge advantage"" over unmanned systems like drones, in terms of the ""compellence"" and ""coercive diplomacy"" to be imposed on an adversary, and will continue to do so for some time.""We are giving too much importance to unmanned systems. While they have a place and relevance in modern warfare, but the kind of weight of attack, the intelligence required, the kind of damage they can cause...You have to see whether they balance with what manned aerial systems bring to the table,"" he said.Different speakers at the ""Capstone"" seminar organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies and College of Air Warfare stressed the need for India to ""prioritise"" the development of aerospace power, which was ""not escalatory"" but ""a strategic and effective tool for escalation control"" as was witnessed during Operation Sindoor. ""Operation Sindoor underlined the speed, reach and flexibility of airpower. We established escalation dominance over Pakistan,"" said a speaker.Others pointed out that India had drawn a new red line for Pakistan by stressing it will not be dissuaded by the western adversary's nuclear blackmail and continue to give cross-border kinetic responses to terror attacks in the future as well.","Less than 50 air-launched weapons fired by India at airbases and radar sites in Pakistan compelled the western adversary to come to the negotiating table and sue for peace.

NEW DELHI: In a bold step, the Delhi Govt on Friday requested the Supreme Court to reconsider its 2018 blanket ban on plying of over 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles on the roads of entire National Capital Region saying stricter BS-VI norm compliant vehicles emit far less pollutants compared to BS-IV vehicles.It requested the SC to direct the Union govt or Air Quality Management to “carry out a suitable broad-based, scientific study on the need for continuance of a complete ban on playing of 15 or more years old petrol and 10 or more years old diesel vehicles of all categories in NCR, imposed by the SC through its order on Oct 10, 2018”.The Delhi govt said the blanket ban, not backed by any scientific study, does not differentiate between poorly maintained,The directive to off-road vehicles purely on the basis of age disproportionately affects the middle-class population whose vehicles are less used, well-maintained, and pollution norm compliant, the govt said. “Studies indicate that these vehicles often have significantly lower annual mileage and contribute negligibly to overall emissions,” it said.It said the significant improvement in Pollution Under Control Technology, increased coverage of PUC testing, stricter monitoring of emission standards, transition to BS-VS engines and other measures have suitably addressed the concerns that had impelled the SC to pass the order seven years ago.Road-worthiness is a technical and scientific issue that must be linked to actual emissions of a vehicle, which is required to be banned, and not a blanket ban based on the age of the vehicles, it said, echoing the popular sentiments of people living in the national capital region and Delhi.Delhi govt, through an application settled by additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, said, “There is a need for a graded, balanced and technology riven regime to handle vehicular pollution issue and instead of blanket ban, a scientific, data-driven framework should be developed taking into account all parameters to ascertain individual emission levels of vehicles.”Repeatedly stressing that the 2018 blanket ban order needs reconsideration, the BJP govt said vehicular pollution constitutes only one of the several sources of air-pollution, including stubble burning, biomass burning, road and construction dust, industrial emissions coupled with weather and meteorological factors and the intensity of pollution varies from season to season.Delhi govt said its transport department has strictly implemented PUC has resulted in issuance of 1,63,103 challans in the first seven months of this year, compared to 29,589 challans issued in 2021, 43,494 in 2022, 36,176 in 2023, and 68,077 in 2024. It said with the augmentation of CNG and electric buses and improvement in road infrastructure, the pollution caused by vehicles has reduced.It said the good AQI days have increased from 159 in 2018 to 209 in 2024 and good AQI days this year till July was 106.

""I believe, based on data before me, that it (investment) is one of the primary drivers of sustained economic growth. It can be higher but the level at which we have maintained investment is largely on the back of public capital expenditure.

Since 2019 once the twin balance sheet problem was addressed and corporate tax was brought down, we can see that the balance sheets of the private sector are healthier.

TUTICORIN: The India-UK FTA will benefit Tamil Nadu (TN) youth, MSMEs, and startups, PM Narendra Modi said at Tuticorin airport, where he launched infrastructure projects worth over Rs 4,800 crore across southern TN on Saturday. Among the major projects unveiled was the Rs 450 crore new airport terminal designed to handle 20 lakh passengers annually.""Following FTA, 99% of Indian products sold in UK will be tax-free, boosting Indian manufacturing and creating new opportunities. The agreement will serve as a catalyst for industries rooted in TN's traditional strengths, ranging from handlooms to seafood exports,"" he said, addressing the gathering at the airport.Modi said TN is witnessing unprecedented development under NDA government at Centre. ""Infrastructure and energy form the backbone of any state's development. Over past 11 years, the sustained focus on these sectors reflects the priority accorded to the state's progress,"" he said. The PM said Rs 3 lakh crore was devolved to TN central taxes over the past 11 years, nearly three times what was allotted under previous UPA government.He inaugurated multiple projects involving road, rail, port, and power sectors. All the launches, including ribbon-cutting of the terminal, were done symbolically from the airport. He flagged off three railway infrastructure upgrades and electrification of the Madurai-Bodinayakkanur line. He also laid the foundation for a Rs 550 crore 765 kV transmission corridor project to evacuate power from Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant Units 3 and 4.Modi said the global perception of India has shifted significantly.

SRINAGAR: J&K government on Saturday instructed all doctors and paramedical staff in public healthcare institutions to wear white aprons and nameplates during duty hours, reaffirming existing norms after observing instances of breach.The latest directive comes days after a scuffle outside a prominent hospital in Srinagar involving patients and journalists on one side and protesting doctors on the other. The protests stemmed from a doctor being slapped after a critically ill patient passed away.“It has been observed that doctors and paramedical staff in various government healthcare institutions are not strictly adhering to prescribed norms regarding the wearing of aprons and displaying of nameplates during duty hours. Such non-compliance is causing inconvenience to patients in identifying healthcare personnel,” a health ministry circular states and directs heads of healthcare institutions to ensure strict compliance.Many doctors and paramedical staff have avoided wearing aprons fearing attacks after alleged medical negligence cases. The fresh directive has fuelled concerns that it would make doctors more vulnerable to attacks as aprons would make it easier to identify and target them.Senior doctors argue that aprons would do little to address core issues like excessively long working hours and rush of patients.The latest brawl unfolded on July 22 at Srinagar’s SMHS Hospital. CCTV footage shows a local, identified as Abid Hussain Bhat, slapping Shahnawaz, a resident doctor from UP who is reportedly physically challenged, causing the latter to fall to the ground. Bhat alleged negligence in treatment of his deceased brother-in-law.As doctors, interns, and staff protested the attack, a local woman journalist, Sufi Hidayah, alleged that she was harassed while covering the demonstration. “My only aim was to know what had happened with Dr. Shahnawaz and hear his side of the story as medical negligence allegations were dominating the media. As I approached him, a group of doctors surrounded and manhandled me. Some pulled at my clothes. Even the principal of GMC (inside SMHS) pushed me,” Hidayah said.Health minister Sakeena ordered Saturday an inquiry into the row and asked for a report within 15 days.

'Wrong Bodies' Of Ahmedabad Air India Crash Victims Sent to Families: India Dismisses UK Media Claim

NEW DELHI: Brainstorming is on at the highest levels of Tata Group and the aviation ministry to put Air India back on track after the spate of bad news led by the deadly AI 171 crash and regulatory actions in past few months. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran on Friday met Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu and aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha. The meeting came after three days of detailed discussions between the airline management led by CEO Campbell Wilson and officials led by the secretary that have led to concrete suggestions emerging from the same.“We have discussed all issues threadbare including those related to maintenance, leadership and communications. Something positive will come out of this. India needs strong carriers and govt will support airlines wherever needed. The results will hopefully be visible in coming days once the suggestions are implemented,” said people in the know. One such meeting went on till well after 10 pm earlier this week.Sources say Chandrasekaran informed govt about the steps being taken by the airline post AI 171 crash and some recent incidents o bolster safety.“Basically, it was informed how AI plans to win back flyers’ confidence,” they said.It is learnt the areas identified during the recent meetings for immediate attention include airworthiness, engineering and maintenance. A lack of spares, for instance, often forces aircraft to fly under “minimum equipment list” (MEL) for a long time. MEL is a list that conditionally allows aircraft to be used with some equipment inoperative with the condition that the same does not impact safety and that it would be replaced within a certain timeframe.The main issue, say multiple people involved in the exercise, is of culture. “Vistara was merged into AI last Nov, ideally it should have been the other way round. But that is done. Both the airlines have a very different culture and AI is now facing post-merger issues. During the meetings, solutions were suggested.

Shannon Sharpe, the NFL legend, might have reached a settlement with his 20 year old accuser but it seems the legal drama has taken a new turn. A few days ago, Shannon Sharpe reached a settlement with the 20 year old woman after she sued him for $50 million and accused him of sexually assaulting her multiple times. But now, a former girlfriend of Shannon Sharpe’s has brought a new turn to the case.Recently, as per the US Sun, a judge has ordered Shannon Sharpe not to destroy the s*x tape that he had recorded while getting intimate with the 20 year old woman.Shockingly, this order comes as a woman named Michele Evans, who claims to be Shannon Sharpe’s ex girlfriend and has also accused him of sexual assault, had filed a lawsuit for the NFL legend’s s*x tape with the 20 year old woman to be not destroyed.Shannon Sharpe and his attorneys have not reacted to this new ruling and have also stayed silent about reaching a settlement with the 20 year old OnlyFans model.When Shannon Sharpe was accused of sexual assault by the 20 year old woman, he had constantly spoken about how the two were in a consensual intimate relationship. The NFL legend had even posted their texts to prove his point but got brutally trolled by fans.Shannon Sharpe’s attorneys had also denied that the NFL legend ever sexually assaulted Michele Evans.According to People, Tony Buzbee, the lawyer of the 20-year-old woman, has issued a statement.Tony Buzbee said, “Both sides acknowledge a long-term consensual and tumultuous relationship…After protracted and respectful negotiations, I’m pleased to announce that we have reached a mutually agreed upon resolution.”Also Read: “He is very much guilty”: Shannon Sharpe’s alleged $50 million assault case ends in settlement, but it raises eyebrows among fans","Shannon Sharpe reached a settlement with the 20 year old woman after she sued him for $50 million and accused him of sexually assaulting her multiple times.

‘It’s Up To Them’ Owaisi Ready To Join Mahagathbandhan In Bihar Elections, Says NDA Must Go

EC uploads 2003 rolls, says most voters need not worry

Opposition says revision targets the poor, migrants

EC Trying To Push NRC 'Through Backdoor'- TMC Blasts Poll Body, Alleges 'Nazi' Action | Bihar Polls

Massive on-ground push by all parties

NEW DELHI: A fresh controversy has erupted in poll-bound Bihar over the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the state's electoral rolls, a process the Election Commission of India (ECI) insists is legally mandated, even as opposition parties allege it could end up deleting ""tens of lakhs"" of genuine voters, especially the poor, migrants, and those on the margins.While the EC said that the revision, happening after 22 years, is in line with the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, opposition parties claim the timing is suspiciously close to the assembly polls and could ""skew the voter base"".""There is nothing more transparent in a democracy than the law. “Despite apprehensions of some persons, SIR will ensure that all eligible persons are included,” Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar told TOI.As part of the roll-revise process, voters may be asked to submit documents to support their claims, not just for themselves, but also for their parents if their names are mentioned. Each document must be self-attested and submitted separately for the individual, father, and mother.However, there's one major relief: If a person's name appears in the Bihar electoral roll dated January 1, 2003, that alone will be treated as sufficient proof, no additional documents will be needed in that case.Highlighting the exclusion of Aadhaar from this voter revision process, Congress's in charge of Bihar Krishna Allavaru accused the EC of ""acting under government pressure"".""Whenever the government faces a crisis, its agencies begin such actions,"" he said.""It is strange that the very voters who elected this government are now being asked to prove their identity. By excluding Aadhaar from this voter revision process, eight crore people are being asked to submit documents they don't have,"" the Congress leader added.Trying to calm nerves, the EC clarified this week that 4.96 crore out of Bihar's 7.89 crore registered voters won't need to submit parental documents during the revision. This includes those already listed in the 2003 electoral rolls or born to such electors.To make things smoother for booth level officers (BLOs) and voters alike, the EC has uploaded the 2003 Bihar rolls on its website for easy access.On Wednesday, leaders from 11 opposition parties, including Congress, RJD, TMC, DMK, SP, JMM, and Left parties, met the Election Commission, calling the revision ""disastrous"". They warned that the EC’s guidelines on verifying if someone is ""ordinarily resident"" in a constituency may disqualify large sections of migrants, who form a major chunk of Bihar’s electorate.The opposition argued that a revision this close to elections casts doubt on the EC’s intentions. But interestingly, despite their public opposition, these parties have joined the ground-level process, appointing thousands of booth level agents (BLAs) to keep watch.Contrary to their protests, opposition parties have gone all in. The RJD has deployed 47,143 BLAs, second only to BJP's 51,964. Congress has appointed 8,586, while Left outfits like CPI(ML), CPM, and CPI have sent in their own agents. On the NDA side, JDU, LJP, and RLSP have mobilised more than 30,000 BLAs in total.The election commission claimed it was determined to follow Article 326 of the Constitution, which mandates that only Indian citizens aged 18 or above and ordinarily resident in a constituency should be enrolled.“SIR is in line with Article 326. It’s a straight question (to the parties criticising SIR): Do you agree with Article 326 or not?"" a senior EC official said.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) is revising Bihar's electoral rolls.

The US citizenship test, officially known as the Naturalization test, is an examination that an applicant has to take to become a naturalized American citizen. This test is not for green card holders unless they are applying for citizenship. The new director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service said the existing test is too easy and the answers can be memorized. The Donald Trump administration is planning to bring back the 2020 version of the test.First, the applicants have to submit Form N-400 seeking for naturalization. They need to pass a background check and meet residency and other requirements. Then there have to attend an interview where they take two tests: English and a civic test.In the civic test, there are 100 questions; the officer asks the applicant 10 and the applicant must answer at least six correctly. During the first term of Donald Trump, there was a new rule for a very brief time where there are 128 questions; applicants are asked 20 and they must get at least 12 right. The USCIS is planning to bring back some version of this type of test.Before 2008, the test was random but the Bush administration introduced the 6 out of 10 questions benchmark.USCIS director said the present version is not really ""comforting with the spirit of the law"".The development regarding the US citizenship test comes as the Department of Homeland Security proposed sweeping changes for the H-1B visa program that allows US companies to hire foreign workers. According to the proposed changes, H-1B will not be for entry-level workers. It will be only for high-skilled jobs for which there will higher salary. If this becomes implemented, US graduates will not lose out jobs in the entry level and tech companies will not be able to hire foreign workers at a lower wage.","The US citizenship test, officially known as the Naturalization test, is an examination that an applicant has to take to become a naturalized American citizen.

Qatar is opening new doors for long-term residents with its Permanent Residency programme, a significant move that signals the nation’s evolving approach to retaining skilled expatriates. Introduced through Law No. 10 of 2018 and regulated by the Ministry of Interior (MOI), the policy grants select foreign nationals the opportunity to live, work, invest, and access public services in Qatar without the need for a local sponsor marking a major shift in the country’s traditional sponsorship model.To apply under the standard route, applicants must have legally resided in Qatar for:Eligible applicants must also:These requirements may vary per Council of Ministers decisions.Certain individuals, including children of Qatari women married to non-Qataris, spouses of Qatari citizens, and those with notable contributions or exceptional skills are exempt from residency and income duration requirements. Approval for such exemptions lies with the MOI committee.These routes are codified under the investor-based provision and allow property ownership in designated areas.Permanent residents can start or fully own companies in Qatar without needing a national partner.This provision is designed to attract foreign business, especially in sectors prioritized by Qatar Vision 2030.Permanent residents enjoy various advantages:No need for employer permission to exit or re-enter Qatar. Standard six-month absence rules for temporary visas do not apply.PR holders and eligible dependents can access government healthcare via MoPH‑regulated institutions and enroll in public schools, though many families choose private schools.PR status allows property ownership in designated freehold zones. This makes residency tied not only to living rights but also potential real estate investment.PR holders can register companies under foreign ownership, allowing full control without needing a Qatari shareholder. This is a strong perk for entrepreneurs and investors.Applicants can verify eligibility via the MOI’s official portal using their QID status and residency record.Eligible individuals submit applications through the MOI portal. Required documents typically include:A special MOI committee reviews submissions and makes recommendations to the Minister of Interior.Applicants pay a non-refundable QAR 3,000 (~USD 825) application fee. The same fee applies upon issuance of the Permanent Residency Card.While temporary residence processing typically takes under two weeks, permanent residency applications may take longer, depending on eligibility review and background checks. Monitoring through MOI portals is advised.PR cards are issued for one- or three-year periods, renewable via MOI submission. Permanent residents can remain outside Qatar beyond six months without forfeiting status. However, an extended absence exceeding six months post-application may reset residency duration under MOI discretion.Residency may be revoked if:Official decision lies with the Minister of Interior based on public interest criteria.With economic diversification underway and global mobility shifting, Qatar’s PR program aligns with Vision 2030 goals by attracting long-term talent and investment. PR status offers distinct advantages over temporary residency including stability, access to public benefits, and business freedom.That said, the 100‑permit cap means selection is competitive. Those who qualify, especially via investment or service gain long-term residency options without committing to citizenship. This makes it a strategic tool for international professionals and entrepreneurs with ties to Qatar’s growth sectors.For eligible expatriates born abroad, 20 years of Qatar residency, Arabic proficiency, clean record, and financial stability open the door to permanent residency. Investor pathways reduce the timeline via real estate or economic contribution. PR status grants access to public services, company ownership, property rights, and travel freedom.Strict enforcement of eligibility checks and a fixed annual quota ensures that permanent residency remains a strategic and privileged status, not a mass offering. For deeply committed expats or investors, Qatar Permanent Residency presents a meaningful long-term option.Eligible applicants include expats who have legally resided in Qatar for at least 20 years (10 years for those born in Qatar), have a clean criminal record, and demonstrate sufficient income and Arabic proficiency.Holders can access free healthcare and education, invest in real estate and commerce without a Qatari partner, and work without a local sponsor.Applications must be filed through the Ministry of Interior’s dedicated platform. Required documents include a valid ID, proof of residence duration, income statements, and police clearance.Yes, Qatar issues a limited number of permanent residencies each year, as determined by the MOI.No, it does not automatically lead to Qatari citizenship.

The Fine Line Between Innovation and Spectacle











In a region where rain is rare and water more precious than oil, the United Arab Emirates once had its sights set on an audacious engineering marvel: towing a gigantic Antarctic iceberg to its sun-baked coast to quench thirst, summon clouds, and maybe even reshape climate patterns. But as of 2025, the only glacier ice that has made it to Dubai is not floating off the coast but chilling highball glasses in rooftop bars, courtesy of a boutique Greenland startup.Launched in 2017 by the National Advisor Bureau Limited, a private Abu Dhabi-based company, the UAE Iceberg Project sought to tow a massive tabular iceberg, measuring roughly 2 kilometers long by 500 meters wide, from Antarctica to Fujairah, a coastal emirate on the Gulf of Oman.The logic, according to Abdulla Alshehi, the firm’s managing director and the project’s chief architect, was straightforward: an average iceberg holds over 20 billion gallons of fresh water, enough to supply 1 million people for five years. “This is the purest water in the world,” he told Gulf News in 2017. And the UAE, consuming 15% of the world’s desalinated water and facing depleting groundwater within 15 years, was in no position to ignore unconventional ideas.The iceberg, selected via satellite near Heard Island in the Southern Ocean, would undertake a 12,000-kilometer (≈6,480 nautical miles), 10-month journey across the Southern, Indian, and Arabian Seas to reach the coast of Fujairah in the UAE. Towed by large ocean-going vessels, it would travel northward through the Indian Ocean before entering the Gulf of Oman.Upon arrival, it would be stationed roughly 3 kilometers off Fujairah’s coast. Harvesting would begin immediately, with the aim of extracting potable water within two to three months before significant melting occurs. Computer simulations commissioned by the company projected that up to 30% of the iceberg’s mass could be lost during the journey, a challenge the team hopes to mitigate by timing its arrival during the UAE’s winter season, when sea temperatures are lower and melting would slow.To prevent breakup during the long journey, Alshehi’s firm developed a patent-pending metal belt, a kind of reinforced corset designed to hold the iceberg intact against wave stress and temperature gradients. In 2020, the UK Intellectual Property Office granted Alshehi a patent for his invention, called the ""Iceberg Reservoirs"" system. The patent was promoted as a credibility boost to attract investment and reinforce the project's technical feasibility.A pilot project, costed between $60–80 million, was announced for 2019. A smaller iceberg was to be towed to Cape Town or Perth as proof of concept. The full UAE project carried a price tag of $100–150 million.Despite a splashy website launch (www.icebergs.world), promises of scientific panels, and a vision of global humanitarian water relief, no trial was ever confirmed to have taken place. As of 2025, there’s been no operational progress, no updated logistics, and no official cancellation, just prolonged silence.What made the proposal especially memorable was its near-mystical secondary goal: climate engineering. Alshehi claimed that the presence of a colossal iceberg floating off the UAE coast could induce localized weather changes.“Cold air gushing from an iceberg close to the Arabian Sea would cause a trough and rainstorms,” he told local media. The iceberg, he argued, could “create a vortex” that would attract clouds from across the region, generating year-round rain for the desert interior. This, he claimed, could help reverse desertification and transform arid landscapes into lush, green areas, with benefits for agriculture, biodiversity, and the broader ecosystem.Meteorologists weren’t sold. While some acknowledged localized effects, like minor cloud formation due to temperature differentials, experts like Linda Lam from Weather.com said sustained, regional rainstorms were unlikely due to the complex nature of atmospheric dynamics.The UAE’s acute water issues form the bedrock of the project’s rationale. The country experiences a paltry 120 millimeters of rainfall annually, and according to a 2015 Associated Press report, its groundwater could be fully depleted within 15 years. Meanwhile, the Gulf states have among the highest water usage rates in the world: around 500 liters per person per day.Desalination, though critical, is energy-intensive, costly, and environmentally damaging. Alshehi warned of desalination plants pumping concentrated brine back into the Gulf, increasing salinity and harming marine life. His iceberg initiative, he claimed, would be not only cheaper in the long run but eco-friendlier, despite concerns about dragging a 100,000-year-old ice mass across the globe.He asserted that environmental impact assessments had been conducted, and results suggested minimal disruption to ecosystems,though no independent third-party review was ever published.While Alshehi’s Antarctic ambitions appear stalled in bureaucratic limbo, a smaller, scrappier company in Greenland has quietly realized a modest version of his vision,not as a humanitarian water source, but as luxury indulgence.Founded in 2022 by Greenlandic entrepreneurs, Arctic Ice ships ice harvested from Greenland’s fjords to high-end bars and restaurants in Dubai. Their first commercial shipment, around 22 metric tonnes, arrived recently, offering the “cleanest H₂O on Earth” to be shaved into ice cubes for cocktails, ice baths, and facial massages in Dubai’s spas.The process is artisanal: Using a crane-equipped boat, workers collect naturally calved icebergs from the Nuup Kangerlua fjord near Nuuk. Only the clearest, bubble-free ice, locally known as “black ice,” is selected. These are believed to be over 100,000 years old, having never touched soil or contaminants.Each chunk is cut with sanitized chainsaws, stored in food-grade insulated crates, and sampled for lab analysis to screen for ancient microorganisms or harmful bacteria. The ice is shipped via refrigerated containers aboard cargo ships already returning empty from Greenland, minimizing additional emissions. The second leg, from Denmark to Dubai, completes the frozen supply chain.Despite the company’s carbon-neutral commitment, backlash has been fierce. Critics online lambast the concept as “climate dystopia,” arguing that glacial ice should not be commodified, especially given the accelerating melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Co-founder Malik V. Rasmussen says some messages have verged on death threats.Still, Arctic Ice insists it is creating economic opportunity for a financially dependent Greenland, where 55% of the budget is subsidized by Denmark. “We make all our money from fish and tourism,” Rasmussen said. “I’ve always wanted to find something else we can profit from.”Both projects,the giant iceberg tow from Antarctica and the boutique glacier cubes from Greenland, highlight a pressing tension: how far will humanity go to secure water, and at what cost?Alshehi’s vision is bold but fraught with logistical and ethical challenges. Icebergs aren’t endlessly renewable, and towing them across hemispheres feels more sci-fi than sustainable.Arctic Ice’s venture, meanwhile, has found a controversial niche,combining novelty, luxury, and symbolism. In a time of climate anxiety, it offers an icy illusion of control, frozen fragments of a melting world, crafted into cocktail spheres.Whether climate solution or spectacle, these ideas raise key questions: Who owns natural ice? Can it be harvested responsibly? And as water scarcity grows, how do we balance local needs with global care?For now, the UAE’s giant iceberg remains a dream deferred, and Dubai’s cocktails are as cold as ever, just sourced from a little farther north, and in smaller, sparkling doses.","The UAE Iceberg Project planned to tow a massive Antarctic iceberg 6,480 nautical miles to Fujairah but faced major challenges and remains unfulfilled.

Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday said that discussions with the United States on the proposed bilateral trade agreement are progressing swiftly.Addressing the media, Goyal said that negotiations with Washington are “making fast progress”, as per news agency PTI.A team from the US is scheduled to visit India in August for the next round of negotiations.The fifth round of talks between the two countries concluded last week in Washington. Both sides are now working towards finalising the first tranche of the agreement by fall, around September or October.The goal is to significantly boost bilateral trade, which currently stands at $191 billion, with an aim to raise it to $500 billion.Goyal also mentioned that negotiations for a free trade agreement with Oman are “almost finalised.”The trade discussions with the US are expected to focus on ironing out remaining differences, particularly around sectors such as agriculture and dairy, where India has traditionally maintained a cautious stance.Earlier, Goyal had said that “fantastic progress” was being made and stressed the importance of a “consequential partnership” with the US.He also indicated that India is seeking “preferential market access” in the US compared to its global competitors, aiming to leverage its early engagement in the negotiations.The minister had underscored that successful trade negotiations require flexibility and a balanced approach.“One has to have a broad mind and a package which is balanced and can give equity to both sides,” he had said, while cautioning against rigid timelines.","The fifth round of talks between the two countries concluded last week in Washington.

EU sanctions on Russia oil: Indian oil refiner Nayara Energy CEO Alessandro des Dorides resigns; Russia-backed refinery key fuel retailer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/eu-sanctions-on-russia-oil-indian-oil-refiner-nayara-energy-ceo-alessandro-des-dorides-resigns-russia-backed-refinery-key-fuel-retailer/articleshow/122902994.cms,"Russia-backed Indian oil refiner Nayara Energy has named Sergey Denisov as its new chief executive, following the resignation of CEO Alessandro des Dorides in the wake of European Union sanctions targeting the company, Reuters reported citing four sources.Denisov, a company veteran who has been with Nayara since 2017, was appointed to the top job during a board meeting held on Wednesday, the report said. He replaces des Dorides, who had taken over the CEO role in April 2024 but stepped down amid growing regulatory pressure linked to Nayara's ties to Russian oil major Rosneft.The EU had announced sanctions earlier this year over Nayara’s business links, a move the company described as “unjust and unilateral”. New Delhi, too, has distanced itself from the European action, reiterating that it does not endorse sanctions not backed by the United Nations.Earlier this week, the European Union’s latest sanctions on Russian oil began to directly impact Indian refiner Nayara Energy Ltd, as oil firms and shipping operators started distancing themselves from the company. The move followed the EU's decision to explicitly list Nayara in its latest sanctions package, citing its ties to Russian oil major Rosneft, which holds a 49.13% stake.Shipbrokers reported that vessel operators turned wary of lifting crude or delivering refined products from Nayara this week. According to Bloomberg ship-tracking data, a vessel named Talara reversed course and exited Gujarat’s Vadinar port on Sunday without lifting a planned diesel shipment. Sources said the cargo collection was cancelled in the immediate aftermath of the sanctions.Another ship, the Chang Hang Xing Yun, was seen idling off India’s southwest coast while en route to Vadinar but later diverted to the Arabian Gulf to load for southern Africa. Both diversions were attributed to uncertainty over EU compliance risks, shipbrokers confirmed.Shipping firms based in Greece and Norway—two countries with a major share in global tanker operations—were expected to follow EU directives, analysts said. Greek shippers, in particular, had helped move Russian oil priced below the cap since the Ukraine conflict began in 2022.Market observers said financial institutions and trade partners were also assessing their exposure, and several Indian refiners were reportedly seeking clarity from the EU over restrictions on diesel refined from Russian crude.The redirection of Talara added to concerns about Nayara’s recent policy of requiring advance payments or letters of credit before releasing cargoes. The standard industry practice involves 15–30 day post-loading settlements. Sources said the policy shift indicated unease about payment risks after loading.This change led to hesitation among prospective buyers in Nayara’s future fuel tenders, traders said.","Russian-backed Indian oil refiner Nayara Energy has named Sergey Denisov as its new chief executive.

8th Pay Commission: What is the fitment factor; how it may impact salary hike of central government employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/8th-pay-commission-what-is-the-fitment-factor-how-it-may-impact-salary-hike-of-central-government-employees/articleshow/122888330.cms,"8th Pay Commission news:

What is the fitment factor?

Why it matters for take-home pay

When will the 8th Pay Commission be implemented?

As the central government has begun consultations with key stakeholders, including the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Personnel and Training, and state governments, as part of the process to constitute the 8th Central Pay Commission (CPC) to revise pay structures for nearly 50 lakh central government employees and 62 lakh pensioners, attention is now focused on a key component of the salary calculation — the fitment factor.According to an ET report, the fitment factor plays a pivotal role in determining how much a government employee’s basic pay will rise under a new pay commission structure.The fitment factor is a numerical multiplier used to calculate revised salaries. It is applied to the existing basic pay to arrive at the new basic salary under the Pay Commission. A higher fitment factor results in a proportionally higher salary.For example, under the 7th Pay Commission, the fitment factor was 2.57 — meaning the basic pay was increased by 2.57 times to arrive at the new structure. If the 8th Pay Commission recommends a higher figure, the salary hike could range between 30% and 34%, as per initial estimates cited in reports. However there's no official word yet on the new multiplier, any upward revision will significantly impact take-home pay and pension calculations.A higher basic salary also boosts allowances that are linked to it, such as dearness allowance (DA), house rent allowance (HRA), and travel allowances. This means a higher fitment factor not only increases base pay but also enhances total take-home earnings.While there is no official notification yet, in a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said, “Inputs have been sought from major stakeholders, including Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Personnel & Training and from states.” He added that the chairperson and members of the 8th CPC will be appointed once the commission is formally notified.The Union Cabinet had approved the setting up of the 8th Pay Commission in January 2025, aiming to revise the pay structure of nearly 50 lakh central government employees and the allowances of about 65 lakh pensioners, according to a PTI report.Responding to a query on when the revised pay scales would be implemented, Chaudhary clarified: “The implementation would be taken up once the recommendations are made by the 8th CPC and are accepted by the government.”","The fitment factor is a numerical multiplier used to calculate revised salaries.

US Adds $250 Visa Integrity Fee: What It Means For Indian Travelers & Tech Workers | Explained

'JD Vance is misleading people'







Vice president JD Vance slammed US companies prioritizing H-1Bs instead of giving jobs to Americans and said he does not believe in the bulls**t story that these companies can't find workers in America. Speaking at a bipartisan event co-hosted by the Hill and Valley Forum, Vance questioned the ethics and economic logic behind mass layoffs by companies like Microsoft which is followed by an increase in H-1B applications.This suggests that these companies are laying off Americans and then applying to hire people from overseas.""You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me,"" Vance said.""That displacement and that math worries me a bit. And what the president has said, he said very clearly: We want the very best and the brightest to make America their home. We want them to build great companies and so forth. But I don't want companies to fire 9,000 American workers and then to go and say, 'We can't find workers here in America.' That's a bulls**t story.""Microsoft recently laid off 9,000 employees globally and came under scrutiny for its use of the H-1B visa program. According to several social media claims. Microsoft submitted applications for more than 6,000 H-1B visas since October while they are also laying off so many employees.An Indian-American tech investor reacted to JD Vance's suggestion and said the vice president would not mention that many of the 9,000 laid off employees were H-1Bs too and they got no severance, no safety net and just a 60-day countdown to leave the country.""Microsoft didn’t bring in new foreign workers after laying people off , they renewed visas for long-time employees who’ve been in the U.S. legally for many many years, stuck in green card backlogs. Saying that’s “replacing Americans” is like saying letting a loyal employee stay and renew his visa in the building is the same as hiring someone new off the street. It’s not. It’s just letting them stay in the job they already earned,"" the tech investor wrote.","JD Vance slammed US companies prioritizing H-1Bs instead of giving jobs to Americans.

Toronto Maple Leafs struggling to trade veteran forward Calle Jarnkrok amid salary cap crunch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/toronto-maple-leafs-struggling-to-trade-veteran-forward-calle-jarnkrok-amid-salary-cap-crunch/articleshow/122927732.cms,"Claus Andersen/Getty Images

Calle Jarnkrok’s $2.1M cap hit, age, injury history, and limited offensive upside stall Toronto Maple Leafs trade talks

Toronto Maple Leafs face roster logjam and cap space issues as NHL training camp approaches

FAQs:

1. Why is Calle Jarnkrok on the trade block?

2. What is Calle Jarnkrok’s net worth?

The Toronto Maple Leafs are facing challenges in offloading veteran forward Calle Jarnkrok as they look to address a crowded bottom six and tight salary cap situation. While general manager Brad Treliving remains active on the trade front, there’s been little market movement for the 33-year-old winger. With training camp around the corner, the Leafs may need to reconsider their strategy to gain roster flexibility.Calle Jarnkrok has quietly been on the trade block throughout the offseason, but interest has been lukewarm at best. According to The Fourth Period, the Swedish winger’s $2.1 million cap hit, combined with a 10-team no-trade list, has hindered progress on a potential deal.Since joining the Leafs, Jarnkrok has appeared in just 71 games across two seasons and tallied 28 points. While he brings value as a penalty killer and versatile defensive forward, his declining offensive production and durability issues have made opposing teams hesitant to take him on, especially at his current cap hit through the 2025–26 season.Adding to Toronto’s urgency is the influx of bottom-six forwards acquired during the offseason, creating a surplus that leaves Jarnkrok as the odd man out. Unless the Leafs retain a portion of his salary to bring the cap hit closer to $1 million, trade negotiations may remain stagnant.The Maple Leafs’ inability to move Jarnkrok is starting to complicate their broader offseason goals. Brad Treliving is still looking to fine-tune his roster, but with both Jarnkrok and David Kampf on the books, there’s limited financial wiggle room.Toronto may ultimately be forced to keep Jarnkrok heading into the season or package him in a deal with salary retention, a less-than-ideal scenario for a team with Stanley Cup ambitions and a need to maximize every dollar.For now, Jarnkrok remains in limbo. Until the Leafs find a viable trade partner or rework the terms to make a deal more appealing, Toronto’s cap concerns will continue to linger, limiting their ability to make further roster upgrades.The Leafs are trying to free up salary cap space and reduce their bottom-six forward surplus.Calle Jarnkrok’s estimated net worth is around $10 million.Also Read: Corey Perry pumped to return to California with Los Angeles Kings after signing $2M deal","Calle Jarnkrok’s $2.1 million cap hit, combined with a 10-team no-trade list, has hindered progress on a potential deal.

NEW DELHI: A case has been registered against a group of individuals accused of attempting to extort Rs 25 lakh from the popular Rameshwaram Cafe by allegedly staging a false incident of food contamination at its Kempegowda International Airport outlet in Bengaluru.According to police, the incident took place on the morning of 24 July.According to news agency PTI, a group of five to seven people reportedly caused a public disturbance by claiming that an insect had been found in the food served at the cafe.The complaint, filed by the café’s operations head, alleges that the individuals threatened to release a video of the incident on social media unless they were compensated.Soon after the scene, the team reportedly received a phone call demanding Rs 25 lakh in cash to avoid reputational damage to the brand.The cafe management has submitted call records, message screenshots, and other documents to support their claims and has urged police to take swift legal action.Police say a Zero FIR has been registered under sections 308(2) and 351(4) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), and the case will be transferred to the jurisdiction relevant to the complainant’s address.A Zero FIR allows a complaint to be filed at any police station regardless of the location of the crime.In a statement, Divya Raghav, founder of The Rameshwaram Café, rejected the accusations.“We categorically deny the baseless accusation that a worm or insect was found in our food,” she said. “This is clearly a staged act with malicious intent to extort money and malign our brand.”Ms Raghav said the cafe operates under “the strictest quality protocols” and that food safety, especially at sensitive locations like airports, is non-negotiable.She added that similar extortion attempts had been made in the past.“We will not succumb to intimidation or blackmail,” she said, adding that the company is fully cooperating with authorities and plans to pursue legal action against the alleged perpetrators.","A case has been registered against a group of individuals accused of attempting to extort Rs 25 lakh from the popular Rameshwaram Cafe.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says: 'If I were 20 years old today, I would focus more on this field than software'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-if-i-were-20-years-old-today-i-would-focus-more-on-this-field-than-software/articleshow/122776861.cms,"Jensen Huang's evolving view: from engineering to physical AI

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power.Huang’s vision aligns with growing industry momentum around embodied AI—where intelligence is tied to physical systems like robots or autonomous machines. Leading research labs such as DeepMind and Boston Dynamics are already exploring this frontier, integrating reinforcement learning with robotics to train systems capable of real-world interaction and problem-solving. This convergence of AI with physics and motion is what Huang sees as the next great leap.Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics.

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes.","Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google's parent company, Alphabet, is now worth $1.1 billion.

Asset managers navigate data security challenges

BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager, has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to China, requiring staff to use temporary loaner phones and prohibiting company laptops during business trips, according to Bloomberg News and Reuters reports.The financial giant detailed the ""policy enhancement"" in an internal memo effective July 16, barring the use of BlackRock-issued iPhones, iPads, laptops, and remote access via virtual private networks while in China. Employees will also lose access to the BlackRock network during personal travel to the country, Bloomberg reported.The move reflects mounting corporate anxiety about business operations in China as geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to strain international business relationships. BlackRock did not immediately respond to requests for comment from either Reuters or Bloomberg.The restrictions come after a series of high-profile incidents involving Western business executives being prevented from leaving China. Wells Fargo suspended travel to China last week after one of its senior trade financing bankers, Chenyue Mao, was blocked from departing the country in what Beijing's foreign ministry described as a criminal matter.Earlier this month, China also prevented a US Patent and Trademark Office employee from leaving during a personal visit, while a US Commerce Department worker has reportedly been unable to leave China for several months.Since China implemented stricter data security laws in 2021, global financial firms have struggled to balance operational needs with compliance requirements. Many banks and asset managers have established onshore data centers to keep Chinese information within the country, adding significant costs and complicating business management.BlackRock maintains a substantial presence in China through a wholly owned mutual fund company and a wealth management joint venture with China Construction Bank Corp. The firm's new travel policy reflects the broader challenges facing global financial institutions operating in an increasingly complex regulatory and security environment between the world's two largest economies.Meanwhile, Amazon is shutting down its AI lab in Shanghai amid rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China. Launched in 2018, this lab contributed to over 100 academic papers and helped develop a neural network framework that generated close to $1 billion in sales, according to a scientist at the lab.As reported by The Financial Times, the development was confirmed by Wang Minjie, a scientist at the lab, via a social media post on China's WeChat. The lab was established by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2018 and Wang stated that his team was being “dissolved due to strategic adjustments amid US-China tensions,” and reflected on the “golden era of foreign research labs” in China.",BlackRock has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to China.

The remark from Vance is seen as a broader defense of Trump administration’s pro-worker AI strategy. Vance stressed on the fact that AI will augment human labour and not replace it. He also criticised the tech leaders who promote dystopian visions of mass layoffs.According to a report by Business Insider, Vice President JD Vance criticised what he called ‘doomsday narratives’ from tech leader who believe that AI will eventually lead to widespread layoffs. “Too many leaders in the AI industry, when they talk about this fear of replacing workers, miss the point,” he said. “AI, we believe, is going to make us more productive, more prosperous, and more free.”His comments suggest a belief that while AI will undoubtedly transform industries and job roles, a sudden, widespread elimination of human labour is not currently underway or immediately foreseeable.Instead of complete job destruction, JD Vance anticipate a period of job evolution. He emphasised that AI as a tool will augment human capabilities and will also help in creating new kinds of jobs and will also create demands for new type of skills.The Vice President's remarks come as discussions around AI's societal implications intensify, with concerns ranging from ethical considerations to economic disruption. His statement serves as a call for a data-driven approach to understanding AI's impact, urging observers to look for concrete evidence of significant shifts in the labor market before succumbing to alarmist predictions.",US Vice President JD Vance does not agree with the idea that AI will lead to mass unemployment.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
