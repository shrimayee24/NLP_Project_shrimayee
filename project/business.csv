'Will not tolerate Hindi colonialism': Stalin's fresh attack on Centre over language row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-not-tolerate-hindi-colonialism-stalins-fresh-attack-on-centre-over-language-row/articleshow/118772614.cms,"Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin (PTI photo)

What is 3-language formula?



NEW DELHI: Continuing his alleged anti-Hindu imposition tirade, Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Friday called the Centre's three-language formula under the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 a "" Hindi colonialism "".Stalin, in a post he wrote in English, said Tamil Nadu will not tolerate ""Hindi colonialism"" replacing ""British colonialism"".""History is clear. Those who tried to impose Hindi on Tamil Nadu have either been defeated or later changed their stance and aligned with DMK . Tamil Nadu will not tolerate Hindi colonialism replacing British colonialism,"" he wrote.The Tamil Nadu CM also mocked the state BJP's signature campaign in the NEP's favour, challenging the rival party to contest the next year's assembly elections on the same issue.""Now the BJP’s circus-like signature campaign for the three-language formula has become a laughing stock in Tamil Nadu. I challenge them to make this their core agenda in the 2026 Assembly elections and let it be a referendum on Hindi imposition ,"" Stalin wrote on X.The DMK boss also hit out at the Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan ""for reviving a fight he can never win"".""The tree may prefer calm, but the wind will not subside."" It was the Union Education Minister who provoked us to write this series of letters when we were simply doing our job. He forgot his place and dared to threaten an entire state to accept #HindiImposition, and now he faces the consequences of reviving a fight he can never win. Tamil Nadu will not be blackmailed into surrendering,"" Stalin wrote.Highlighting the names of Union government's schemes, institutions and awards, Stalin said Hindi has been ""imposed to a nauseating extent, suffocating non-Hindi speakers, who are the majority in India"".""Men may come, men may go. But even long after the dominance of Hindi is shattered in India, history will remember that it was DMK that stood as the vanguard,"" he wrote.On Thursday, Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai claimed that over one lakh people across the state have supported the BJP's online campaign on the three-language policy. He added that his party would continue its outreach despite police action, questioning how many people the government could ""illegally arrest"".Countering Stalin's ""Hindi imposition"" claims, Annamalai claimed that in the matriculation schools run by Stalin's party men have not even made Tamil a compulsory subject.""Having realised that the opposition to the three-language policy hasn't yielded support from the common people, Thiru @mkstalin has now jumped to the imaginary Hindi imposition,"" he added.The three-language formula under the NEP 2020 promotes multilingualism while ensuring flexibility in language learning. It mandates that students learn three languages, with at least two being Indian languages, though the choice of languages is left to states and schools.The policy encourages the mother tongue or regional language as the medium of instruction at least until class 5, preferably until class 8 and beyond. While it allows English as an option, it does not impose any particular language, emphasising state autonomy in language selection. Despite its flexible approach, states like Tamil Nadu oppose the policy, fearing it could lead to the imposition of Hindi over regional languages.","Stalin says Tamil Nadu will not tolerate ""Hindi colonialism"" replacing ""British colonialism"" DMK boss also hit out at the Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan ""for reviving a fight he can never win"" Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai claimed that over one lakh people across the state have supported the BJP's online campaign.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118773106,imgsize-698492,width-400,resizemode-4/118773106.jpg"

Jungles cleared of Maoists but 'urban Naxals' a threat: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jungles-cleared-of-maoists-but-urban-naxals-a-threat-pm-modi/articleshow/118770357.cms,"PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Decisive government actions have cleared Naxalism from jungles but the threat of urban Naxals is growing and they have ""rapidly infiltrated"" political parties, PM Narendra Modi said on Thursday. The voices and language of urban Naxals are now heard within these parties, indicating their deep-rooted presence, he said.Naxalism is in its final phase, with affected districts reduced from more than 100 to fewer than 24 in the past decade, the PM said as he credited decisive governance, infrastructure expansion and grassroots development for neutralising the insurgency.Warning of the new challenge posed by urban Naxals, the PM said once on the fringes, they are now ""shaping narratives within parties that were once rooted in Gandhian ideology"". ""Their influence threatens both India's development and heritage,"" Modi said at a media event here. He also underscored that the ideological extremism is also gaining ground in intellectual spaces. Highlighting India's remarkable economic strides, Modi said even 65 years after independence, the country was the world's 11th-largest economy, but in the past decade, it has become the fifth-largest economy and is now rapidly moving towards becoming the third-largest economy.He recalled that in 2007, India's GDP reached $1 trillion annually, whereas today, the same amount is generated every quarter, reflecting the nation's accelerating growth. In addition, he said, 25 crore people have been lifted out of poverty and Rs 42 lakh crore has been directly transferred to beneficiaries through DBT, ensuring transparency and eliminating corruption leakages.Modi also detailed India's rise in global industries. ""From importing rifles, we now export defence equipment 20 times more than before. Solar energy capacity has increased 30 times, and toy exports have tripled,"" he said. Infrastructure investment has seen a five-fold boost, doubling the number of airports and tripling the number of AIIMS institutions. The startup ecosystem has flourished, and India now ranks among the top three in the world for new businesses, Modi said.","Naxalism is in its final phase, with affected districts reduced from more than 100 to fewer than 24 in the past decade, the PM said.

BENGALURU: After Tamil Nadu, voices against ""Hindi imposition"" and the three-language formula proposed under NEP are getting louder in Karnataka, too, with Kannada Development Authority (KDA) writing to chief minister Siddaramaiah to adopt a two-language policy in the state. ""Considering the variety of discussions going on regarding the language issue, it seems Karnataka needs a bilingual formula,"" KDA chief Purushottham Bilimale wrote.Bilimale also forwarded a copy of a letter he had received from Ramesh Bellamkonda, a member of Namma Naadu Namma Aalvike, alleging a language inequity existed in the country, with Hindi being imposed on non-Hindi-speaking populations.Ramesh, too, advocated a two-language formula - with Kannada and English being the two compulsory languages in the state for education, governance, and general interaction.

In addition, facilities for those interested in learning any number of other languages, depending on their individual choices or circumstances, should exist, but the burden of learning languages should be kept to a minimum possible level, he said.","After Tamil Nadu, voices against ""Hindi imposition"" are getting louder in Karnataka.

Trade deal with India key to Donald Trump's bid to boost exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trade-deal-with-india-key-to-donald-trumps-bid-to-boost-exports/articleshow/118769020.cms,"US President Donald Trump, right, speaks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, Feb 13, 2025, in Washington. (AP)

NEW DELHI: A bilateral trade deal is critical not just for India but also for the US as it is seen to be key to Donald Trump's focus on boosting production and exports from America. An across-the-board duty reduction will mean that carmakers, bourbon producers or handset manufacturers will ship goods into India from the most competitive source, likely to be China or south-east Asia, instead of an American factory.Neither Harley Davidson, a favourite with all American presidents, or Tesla, run by Trump aide Elon Musk, source their vehicles from the US.While Harley is importing its bikes from its manufacturing set-up in Thailand, Tesla, which is close to launching its cars in India, is likely to ship its electrics from Germany after authorities requested the company not to import the vehicles from China.Companies find it beneficial to use other manufacturing bases due to locational advantages helping them save on freight or due to economies of scale. Besides, some are taking advantage of India's existing free trade agreements to ship goods at zero duty.For all the noise, Harley, which only makes the 440cc model in India in partnership with Hero Moto. ""There is a mega set-up in Thailand that the company uses to get its bikes to India. Beyond the 440cc that it makes here, all the other bikes - including bigger ones like Pan America, Nightster, Street Glide and Fat Bob - are being imported from Thailand,"" an analyst specialising in foreign trade told TOI.""So even if India reduces the duty on imported bikes from the US to zero, Harley will still find it beneficial to get them from Thailand due to its proximity to India, which lowers the freight cost and makes shipments faster,"" another analyst said.A bilateral trade deal, for which commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal is in Washington, could provide duty advantages to India as well as the US, and enable factories and farmers in both countries to directly export.Government has signalled its lower tariffs by slashing duties on imported bikes and bourbon. Although the move, which saw reduction from all sources of imports, was addressing Trump's repeated attack on India's ""high tariffs"", it did not result in any gains for factories in the US.Of the $2.6 million import of bourbon whiskey, only $780,000 was directly from the US, and the bulk came from other countries, some of which were bottling hubs.","A bilateral trade deal is seen to be key to Donald Trump's focus on boosting production and exports from America.

NEW DELHI: In a major boost to IAF’s strategic airlift capability to forward areas, a gigantic C-17 Globemaster-III aircraft has for the first time landed at the high-altitude Kargil airfield near the Line of Control with Pakistan.The “trial run” saw the four-engine C-17 take off from its home base at Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi and land at the Kargil airstrip, which is in a bowl surrounded by mountains on all sides and located at an altitude of over 9,700-feet, on Wednesday morning.“The next step will be to conduct a night landing by a C-17 at Kargil. The C-17 can normally airlift a 70-tonne cargo but it’s around 35 tonne at the altitude in Kargil. The much smaller C-130J `Super Hercules' had landed at night in Kargil in Jan last year. The C-17 increases the load carrying capacity by around four times,” a source told TOI .With an eye on both China and Pakistan, India has progressively upgraded the infrastructure at forward air-bases and advance landing grounds (ALGs), including Thoise, Fukche, Nyoma and Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) in Ladakh as well as Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh.The ongoing Rs 230 crore upgrade work at the Nyoma ALG, which is located close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in eastern Ladakh at an altitude of 13,710-feet, for instance, includes extending and strengthening the existing airstrip into a 2.7-km `rigid pavement’ runway for all kinds of fixed-wing aircraft including fighters for “defensive as well as offensive operations”, as was earlier reported by TOI.The IAF has inducted 11 C-17s for $4.5 billion and 13 C-130Js for $2.1 billion from the US over the last 15 years to augment its airlift capabilities. One C-130J was lost in a crash near Gwalior in March 2014, which killed the five personnel on board.The rugged C-17s and C-130s, which can even land at makeshift airstrips, have been extensively used to airlift supplies and troops to border areas with China and Pakistan, evacuation of Indian nationals from abroad, and providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief in India and overseas.In Aug 2013, for instance, a C-130J had for the first time landed at the rudimentary airstrip in DBO at an altitude of 16,614-feet, the highest such ALG in the world that overlooks the strategic Karakoram Pass and is just a few kms from the LAC with China.",A gigantic C-17 Globemaster-III aircraft has for the first time landed at the high-altitude Kargil airfield near the Line of Control with Pakistan.

CHENNAI: Madras HC Thursday directed Union government to unblock Tamil journal Ananda Vikatan 's website, which had been blocked after it published online an offensive cartoon showing PM Narendra Modi.The cartoon was published during Modi's visit to the US and his summit meeting with US President Donald Trump, and coincided with illegal immigrants from India being deported from the US.Justice D Bharatha Chakravarthy granted the interim relief to the magazine with a rider that the cartoon should be removed. Since only the caricature in question appears to be objectionable, the rest of the magazine can remain accessible, the court said.The court's order came on a plea moved by the magazine challenging Centre's action of blocking access to its website. The magazine's counsel, Vijay Narayan, submitted that the website was blocked without giving a proper opportunity to respond to the allegation. Narayan argued that as per Section 69A of Information Technology Act , it will not be sufficient to block access to a website merely because sovereignty is affected; it is also necessary that the integrity of the country is compromised. ""The cartoon published by the magazine did not fall under any of the reasons cited under the law for blocking public access to information,"" he added.No damage was caused to the sovereignty and integrity of the country, and no harm befell the friendly relations between India and the US due to the publication of the cartoon, Narayan said.Opposing the plea, additional solicitor-general of India A R L Sundaresan said the cartoon would affect India's relations with the US. ""Article 19(2) of the Constitution and Section 69A of the IT Act provide for reasonable restriction on content if it is satisfied that such restriction is necessary in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India,"" he said.",Madras HC Thursday directed Union government to unblock Tamil journal Ananda Vikatan's website.

"Visually impaired man battles system for 15 years to get UPSC posting, triumphed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/visually-impaired-man-battles-system-for-15-years-to-get-upsc-posting-triumphed/articleshow/118769269.cms,"Shiwam Srivastava

NEW DELHI: For 15 years, Shiwam Kumar Srivastava fought not just for a job, but for the right to be seen. He had cleared the UPSC Civil Services Examination in 2008, ranking high enough for selection. But when the final list came out, his name wasn’t on it. No explanation. No rejection letter. Just silence — a quiet, deliberate erasure.The irony was impossible to miss. Shiwam had lost his vision, but the system refused to see. The Persons with Disabilities (PwD) Act, 1995 guaranteed visually impaired candidates a fair chance in the civil services. However, laws mean nothing when those enforcing them choose to look the other way.For over a decade, the bureaucracy that was supposed to uphold fairness denied him with a different kind of blindness — one that had nothing to do with sight. Vacancies were left unfilled. Legal protections were ignored. His rightful selection was buried in paperwork. Justice delayed wasn’t just justice denied — it was a career erased before it had even begun.He took the fight all the way to the Supreme Court , which, in July 2024, finally ordered the Union govt to appoint him. By then, his batchmates had spent 15 years rising through the ranks. Some were joint secretaries. Shiwam, at 46, was just starting.“The order came seven months ago, but I haven’t celebrated yet. I haven’t even told my relatives,” he said from his third-floor apartment in Rohini, Delhi. For years, every small victory had been followed by another setback. Even now, with his post in Indian Information Service (IIS) finally secured, he remains wary. “This fight was never just about me,” he said. “It was about proving that people like me deserve a place in this system — even when the system refuses to see us.”Supreme Court’s order, invoking Article 142, had directed the Union government to place him in Indian Revenue Service or any other suitable service. He was eventually allotted to IIS, but the victory was bitter. Bureaucratic blindness had cost him the prime years of his career—something no court ruling could restore.His legal battle had begun in 2009, when he and fellow candidate Pankaj Srivastava discovered that UPSC had left vacancies for visually impaired candidates unfilled from 1996 to 2005. They challenged this in Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), which ruled in their favour in 2012. Union govt appealed to Delhi High Court, which upheld their case in 2013. Even then, Centre dragged the matter to the Supreme Court, where it remained stuck for a decade. Hearings stretched from 2014 to 2024, while his career stayed frozen in time.“There were three others like me. After the 2008 results, we found that our UPSC scores were higher than those selected for various services. Yet, despite clearing our interviews, we were never recommended,” he said. The authorities never said it outright, but the message was clear—blind officers had no place in government.Before his IIS appointment, Shiwam had worked in the judiciary for two decades, first as a junior assistant clerk at the Rohini court in 2003, then as a senior judicial assistant officer. Even there, he had faced the same structural resistance. Promotions were rare for disabled employees, and he remained stuck in the same pay grade for years — not because he lacked ability, but because the system didn’t believe he deserved more.Now, six months into his new job as an assistant director in Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, he commutes 60 km daily via auto-rickshaw to Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC), where he is undergoing two years of induction training. “I will get perks, including a car, only after the training is over and I receive a posting,” he said. Even now, he remains behind his batchmates — not because of merit, but because the system chose to look away.Shiwam had learned early what it meant to be overlooked. Born in Motihari, Bihar, in 1978, he had been a topper, excelling in school, when, at 17, his world collapsed. Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), a rare genetic disorder, took his sight permanently. His father took him to every specialist imaginable, but nothing worked. For five years, he clung to hope—yoga, meditation, alternative medicine—but by 2001, he had to accept reality.Determined to rebuild his life, he moved to Delhi, where he trained at All-India Confederation of the Blinds (AICB) and National Institute for the Empowerment of Persons with Visual Disabilities (NIEPVD), Dehradun. There, he discovered text-to-speech software like GAWS and NVDA, which allowed him to scan, digitise, and listen to books—a tool that became his lifeline in UPSC preparation.In 2016, he married Pushpanjali Rani, who never doubted his ability to achieve his dreams. “‘Impossible’ is not in his dictionary. Nothing can stop him,” she said. They now have two daughters, aged 7 and 2. His resilience has inspired many, including Sunil Kumar, a judicial officer at Tis Hazari Court, who credits him with pushing for major workplace reforms.“There was no promotion quota for disabled employees in Delhi courts, but thanks to him, I am now a senior judicial assistant. He also ensured we received four days of special casual leave. The only thing I wish is that the Supreme Court had granted him a retrospective appointment—he deserves the same benefits as his batchmates.”For Shiwam, that remains a painful truth. “I fought for my place and won, but I will always be years behind my batchmates. If my appointment had been backdated, I would be in a much better position today,” he said.Beyond the legal battle, Shiwam has fought constant scepticism about his abilities. “From my neighbours in Motihari to my colleagues and even my own relatives, people have never been kind to my condition. I despise the term ‘blind’ because I believe I am more capable than many who have full vision. I had to constantly prove I was disabled—something that should never have been questioned.”In frustration, he even attempted to ride a two-wheeler but met with accidents thrice. He would've continued trying had it not been stolen later. Despite possessing a disability card and undergoing medical examinations at multiple hospitals, people still doubted him.“Since I wasn’t born blind, I have a sense of distance, and my eyes adjust to voices in a certain way. A sliver of light enters from the rim, helping me navigate, but I cannot see straight. How do I make anyone understand this?” he said, his voice laced with years of frustration.Yet, his story is not just one of hardship but of defiance and perseverance. After 15 years of fighting the system, he has finally arrived, though not in the way he once imagined. His nameplate now hangs on his door, his title official, his legal battle over. And yet, as he looks ahead, he cannot shake the feeling that the system is still looking away.","Shiwam Kumar Srivastava, 46, lost his vision at the age of 17. He fought for 15 years for a job and the right to be seen in the civil services. The Persons with Disabilities (PwD) Act, 1995 guaranteed visually impaired candidates a fair chance. But laws mean nothing when those enforcing them choose to look away.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118769271,imgsize-1100604,width-400,resizemode-4/118769271.jpg"
RSS neta sparks Maha row with remark on Marathi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rss-neta-sparks-maha-row-with-remark-on-marathi/articleshow/118770029.cms,"Photo/Agencies

MUMBAI: Senior RSS leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi 's remark at a function in Ghatkopar that knowing Marathi was not necessary to live in Mumbai stirred a political controversy on Thursday, with the opposition MVA criticising him strongly and demanding to know if the state govt agreed with him. While CM Devendra Fadnavis said in response that Marathi is the language of Mumbai and Maharashtra and anyone who lives here should learn and speak it, Joshi himself said later that his comment had been misconstrued and that ""Marathi is a part of the state's culture and identity, and it is the duty of every citizen to learn it.""Speaking at a programme on Wednesday evening, Joshi said those coming to Mumbai need not learn Marathi. He also said Gujarati is ""the language of Ghatkopar.""The statements invited criticism from the Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress. Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray demanded Joshi be booked for treason for his remarks, and in the state assembly, and the party's MLA Bhaskar Jadhav sought an explanation from the govt. NCP (SP) MLA Rohit Pawar said, ""The language of Mumbai is Marathi"" and demanded the govt state its stance on the controversy. In the legislative council, opposition leader Ambadas Danve attacked the govt, asking it, ""Do you endorse Bhaiyyaji Joshi's statement?"" The council was adjourned for ten minutes as opposition MLCs demanded that chairman Ram Shinde accept their demand for a discussion on the issue. When the House reassembled, Congress' Bhai Jagtap slammed the govt, stating it seemed to have forgotten the ""Hutatmas"" who sacrificed their lives for formation of the state on linguistic lines. Later, opposition MLCs staged a walkout in protest.In the afternoon, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray went to Hutatma Chowk with all his MLAs and MLCs to protest Joshi's statement.Following the uproar, Joshi issued a video statement. He said, ""Due to one of my statements, a misunderstanding occurred. There is no question of the language of Mumbai not being Marathi. The language of Maharashtra is Marathi. Mumbai is in Maharashtra, and naturally, the language of Mumbai is Marathi. Different languages are spoken in India. People speaking different languages live in Mumbai as well. So, it is a natural expectation that they should also come here and learn Marathi, understand Marathi, and read Marathi. I think that this is a great example of coexistence, that people speaking so many different languages in India live together. I think that Mumbai is also an ideal example of this. But there is a natural expectation that a person coming to Mumbai should understand Marathi, speak Marathi, learn Marathi, and read Marathi. This is the only expectation. I have nothing more to say than this... My mother tongue is Marathi. But I also respect the existence of all languages... I request everyone to see it from the same perspective.""Fadnavis said in the assembly, ""I haven't heard what Bhaiyyaji said, but the language of Mumbai and Maharashtra is Marathi. Everyone should learn Marathi and should speak the language.""","Senior RSS leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi said those coming to Mumbai need not learn Marathi.

Collegium picks Calcutta HC judge Joymalya Bagchi for Supreme Court post,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/collegium-picks-calcutta-hc-judge-for-sc-post/articleshow/118769551.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The five-member Supreme Court Collegium led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna on Thursday decided to recommend to the Union govt to appoint Justice Joymalya Bagchi, a judge of the Calcutta HC, as a judge of the Supreme Court, which at present has two vacancies in its sanctioned strength of 34 judges.The Collegium, also comprising Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant, A S Oka and Vikram Nath, zeroed in on Justice Bagchi after considering the judgments and judicial acumen of several judges and CJs of HCs, who were in the zone of consideration for elevation to the SC.If the Union government accepts the recommendation, Justice Bagchi would be superseding many judges across HCs who are senior to him and would be the second judge from Calcutta HC in the SC, which at present has sole representation through Justice Dipankar Datta .In his parent HC, Justice Bagchi would be superseding Justices Harish Tandon and Soumen Sen. While Justice Tandon was appointed as a Judge of Calcutta HC on April 13, 2010, Justice Sen was appointed as a Judge exactly a year later on April 13, 2011. Justice Bagchi was appointed as a Judge on June 27, 2011.Justice Tandon could take consolation in the fact that the Collegium on Thursday decided to recommend to the Union govt his appointment as Orissa HC chief justice. Orissa HC at present has an acting CJ in Justice Arindam Sinha, who was transferred from Calcutta HC to Orissa HC on Oct 8, 2021.Justice Bagchi, on appointment to the SC, would also supersede five judges including CJ Alok Aradhe in Bombay HC. Justice Bagchi-led bench has handled sensitive cases relating to R G Kar Hospital rape-murder incident as well as the teacher recruitment scam.Interestingly, Bagchi as a lawyer had argued successfully before a special bench of Calcutta HC against the ban imposed by West Bengal govt on Taslima Nasreen’s book “Dwikhondita’. He was transferred to Andhra Pradesh HC, where he had a stint as a judge from Dec 2020 till Sep 2021.The CJI-led Collegium had on Jan 7 recommended appointment of Justice K Vinod Chandran, then chief Justice of Patna HC. The government had cleared the appointment within a week and Justice Chandran took oath as a Judge of the SC on Jan 16.","The five-member Supreme Court Collegium led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna on Thursday decided to recommend to the Union govt to appoint Justice Joymalya Bagchi.

KOLKATA: Calcutta HC advised Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose and CM Mamata Banerjee on Thursday to have a "" chai pe charcha "" to resolve their differences, saying ""it isn't a good example"" for the public to witness a legal battle involving Raj Bhavan and the state government.Justice Krishna Rao, who was hearing the state's petition challenging an interim directive restraining it from making any statement against the governor, extended the gag order till April 10.The case dates back to July 2023, when Bose filed a defamation case against Mamata and three others - MLAs Sayantika Banerjee and Reyat Hossain Sarkar, and former MP Kunal Ghosh - over what he said was ""personal imputation"" in public. The governor soughtRs 11 crore in damages along with an order barring the respondents from allegedly maligning him. Bose specifically objected to Mamata's purported remark that ""women fear to enter Raj Bhavan"" in Kolkata, alluding to allegations against the governor that he molested a former member of his staff.Later that month, the court restrained the three from ""making any defamatory or incorrect statement"" against the governor. It said Bose had prima facie made a case for an interim restraint order. Mamata challenged this order on the ground that ""justifiable criticism"" wasn't libel, and that the gag order curbed her fundamental right to free speech as a citizen and an elected representative.The matter is slated to come up for hearing next on April 9.","Calcutta HC advised Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose and CM Mamata Banerjee to have a "" chai pe charcha "" The case dates back to July 2023, when Bose filed a defamation case against Mamata and three others.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118769554,imgsize-895396,width-400,resizemode-4/118769554.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Observing that preventive detention is a draconian measure whereby a person can be detained without conviction, Supreme Court has held that such orders must reflect an independent application of mind by the detaining authority , and a mere statement that it's ""satisfied on examination of the proposals and supporting documents"" is not sufficient.Quashing a detention order passed by the home department of Nagaland government, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Augustine George Masih said that the detaining authority, special secretary (home department), did not even make separate grounds of detention but merely acted upon the proposals for detention forwarded to her by the additional director general of police, which is not valid.""The cryptic orders of detention passed by her (special secretary) merely recorded that she was satisfied, on careful examination of such proposals and other supporting documents, that sufficient grounds were made out for the detention of Ashraf Hussain Choudhary and Adaliu Chawang. This is not in keeping with the statutory scheme, inasmuch as Section 6 of the Act ( Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act ) specifically refers to the order of detention 'being made' on separate grounds,"" the court said.""Further, Section 3(1) also records that the authorised officer, be it of the central govt or of a state govt, must be 'satisfied' that the person concerned required to be detained so as to prevent him/her from engaging in illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. Such 'satisfaction' of the detaining authority necessarily has to be spelt out after application of mind by way of separate grounds of detention made by the detaining authority itself and cannot be by inference from a casual reference to the material placed before such detaining authority or a bald recital to the effect that the detaining authority was 'satisfied on examination of the proposals and supporting documents' that the detention of the individuals concerned was necessary,"" it said.","Quashing a detention order passed by the home department of Nagaland government, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Augustine George Masih said that the detaining authority, special secretary (home department), did not even make separate grounds of detention.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118769334,imgsize-1371931,width-400,resizemode-4/118769334.jpg"

Chennai: Enforcement Directorate began searches Thursday at places linked to Tamil Nadu electricity and prohibition and excise minister V Senthil Balaji in Chennai and Karur, as well as at offices of Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation and breweries and distilleries supplying it.Though ED did not reveal the basis for the searches, sources said it had registered a fresh case based on multiple FIRs registered by DVAC from 2016 to 2021 on seizures of unaccounted cash from Tasmac outlets. ""The suspicion is that this unaccounted cash is being used for money laundering . This is being probed,"" said a source.ED is also said to be investigating the irrational procurement of liquor from distilleries and breweries . ""Tasmac's procurement of liquor should be based on the three-month weighted average (average sales of a particular brand). In exceptional cases, a special indent can be raised for a particular variety of liquor, but they should show sales volumes to justify the special indent,"" the source added.

NEW DELHI: Observing that ""over-solicitous homage"" to the accused's liberty can, sometimes, defeat the cause of public justice, Supreme Court has said that anticipatory bail should be granted only in exceptional cases, particularly when an accused is alleged to be involved in corruption.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said corruption in the higher echelons of govt and political parties was the biggest menace which could lead to economic unrest and underscored that courts should not hesitate to deny liberty to an accused in such cases in order to ensure a corruption-free society .""The presumption of innocence, by itself, cannot be the sole consideration for grant of anticipatory bail. The presumption of innocence is one of the considerations, which the court should keep in mind while considering the plea for anticipatory bail. The salutary rule is to balance the cause of the accused and the cause of public justice. Over-solicitous homage to the accused's liberty can, sometimes, defeat the cause of public justice,"" the bench said.The court passed the order while rejecting anticipatory bail plea of a public servant who was alleged to have demanded illegal gratification in connection with audit of development work undertaken by a gram panchayat. It said Law Commission in its 41st report recommended introduction of a provision for grant of anticipatory bail where it said that ""power to grant anticipatory bail should be exercised in very exceptional cases"".""If liberty is to be denied to an accused to ensure corruption free society, then courts should not hesitate in denying such liberty. Where overwhelming considerations in the nature aforesaid require denial of anticipatory bail, it has to be denied. It is altogether a different thing to say that once probe is over and chargesheet is filed, court may consider to grant regular bail to a public servant accused of indulging in corruption,"" SC said.Stating that parameters for grant of anticipatory bail in a serious offence like corruption were required to be satisfied, the bench said, ""Anticipatory bail can be granted only in exceptional circumstances where court is prima facie of view that applicant has been falsely roped into the crime or allegations are politically motivated or frivolous. So far as the case at hand is concerned, it cannot be said that any exceptional circumstances have been made out by the petitioner for grant of anticipatory bail and there is no frivolity in the prosecution,"" it said.Highlighting the problem of corruption in society, the court said, ""If one is asked to name one sole factor that effectively arrested the progress of our society to prosperity, undeniably it is corruption.""",Supreme Court said that anticipatory bail should be granted only in exceptional cases.

L&T introduces one-day menstrual leave per month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lt-introduces-one-day-menstrual-leave-per-month/articleshow/118769276.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: In a first of sorts for the engineering and construction industry, Larsen & Toubro chairman S N Subrahmanyan introduced a one-day menstrual leave facility every month for the company's women staff.The announcement came during Women's Day celebrations at the Powai office in Mumbai where the chairman addressed 350 women employees.The organisation's workforce of 60,000 includes about 5,000 women employees, representing 9% of total staff. The policy excludes L&T's non-construction and non-engineering businesses such as financial and technology services. That's because these businesses have work-from-home and flexible work arrangements, while the main L&T operations have an office-based working policy.The menstrual leave provision is a pioneering step for a progressive workplace policy in the industry that L&T operates in.Thursday's announcement follows Subrahmanyan's earlier contentious statement suggesting a 90-hour work week for employees while also expressing disappointment about the inability to implement working on Sundays.Specific details regarding the implementation of the 12-day annual menstrual leave policy remain undetermined, including its commencement date, and whether it constitutes additional paid leave beyond existing entitlements and the permissible timing within the menstrual cycle.While India lacks national legislation on menstrual leave, several organisations such as AU Small Finance Bank, Orient Electric (part of CK Birla Group), Swiggy and Zomato and states like Odisha, Bihar and Kerala have independently adopted such a policy to support women's health and well-being. A proposed bill addressing women's rights to menstrual leave and free menstrual products awaits enactment.According to KS Legal and Associates' managing partner Sonam Chandwani, despite positive intentions behind menstrual leave policies, practical issues exist. ""While it recognises biological differences and supports workplace inclusivity , it could unintentionally reinforce gender biases. Employers might hesitate to hire or promote women in roles requiring continuous availability, fearing additional leave requirements like maternity leaves. This could set back workplace equality,"" she said.“Misuse is another concern,” she added. “Any leave category specifically designated for a particular group can be difficult to regulate and might be exploited, making implementation inconsistent. Since employees already have access to sick leave, introducing a separate menstrual leave policy may not be necessary. Instead, a more practical approach would be a need based, flexible leave policy where employers accommodate employees based on genuine health concerns without mandating a rigid framework,” Chandwani concluded.","The announcement came during Women's Day celebrations at the Powai office in Mumbai.

NEW DELHI: The Indian government deplored the misuse of democratic freedoms by pro-Khalistan separatists after a breach of security during foreign minister S Jaishankar's ongoing visit to the UK. While the MEA did not confirm if it has officially lodged a protest with London, the ministry said in a statement that India expects the host government in such cases to fully live up to its diplomatic obligations.""We have seen the footage of a breach of security during the visit of EAM to the UK. We condemn the provocative activities of this small group of separatists and extremists,"" said spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Following India's statement, the UK, too, condemned the incident, calling it completely unacceptable. ""While the UK upholds the right to peaceful protest, any attempts to intimidate, threaten, or disrupt public events are completely unacceptable. The Metropolitan Police acted swiftly to address the situation, and we remain fully committed to ensuring security of all our diplomatic visitors, in line with our international obligations,"" said a spokesperson.The freedom enjoyed by anti-India extremists has remained a vexing problem in bilateral ties and Jaishankar raised the issue again in his meeting with UK home secretary Yvette Cooper in a meeting this week.On this occasion, pro-Khalistan protesters had gathered outside Chatham House, where the minister was participating in a discussion, and tried to heckle him while he was leaving the venue in his car. One of the protesters also sprinted towards the car while pulling at an Indian flag, but was quickly restrained by the cops, according to a video that went viral on social media.","Pro-Khalistan protesters had gathered outside Chatham House, where the minister was participating in a discussion.

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON: The world is becoming increasingly multipolar with different centres of power as a result of the Trump administration’s policies, which suits New Delhi very well, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said at Chatham House here.“If I were to look at the big priorities of this president, many of them work for us,” he said. “He seems to be committed to keeping energy prices reasonably affordable and stable — we welcome that. He is putting a lot of emphasis on tech and on the use of tech as a game changer in global politics. That offers a lot of possibilities for us. When I look at our interests and our expectations of the relationship, there is a lot of promise. We see a president and an administration moving towards multipolarity and that is something which suits India,” he said.“Just because there is multipolarity, it doesn’t have to translate into currency multipolarity,” he explained. “There is no policy on our part to replace the dollar,” he stressed. “The dollar, as the reserve currency, is the source of international economic stability and we want more economic stability, not less. The assumption that, somehow, there is a united BRICS position against the dollar is not borne out by facts,” he said. “We have no interest in undermining the dollar. On the contrary, a lot of problems in our region are due to the lack of availability of the dollar,” he said.“Since 1945, one tends to think and talk about the USA as ‘USA and the Western world’ so it’s more like a bloc rather than a nation. What is quite clear is that the US’s own self-perception is now more as a nation; and perhaps a little less as a bloc.” India has spent the past decade developing relations with big players, and non-big ones, he said. “If we can do that successfully with all major powers and groupings, that puts you in a much better position in a world which we could see was heading towards multipolarity,” he said, adding that both India and the Global South would benefit from this new world.Jaishankar also defended India’s human rights record from foreign press criticism. “We have been, for political reasons, at the receiving end of a lot of expressions and sometimes even campaigns on human rights. We listen to it. We are not perfect, but I would argue if one looks around the world, we have a very strong human rights record.“As a credible democracy where people have growing faith in that democracy, where representation has broadened in every conceivable way, where the state has been very fair in terms of treatment of its citizens, I think any sweeping concern on human rights is misplaced.”He also batted back against a question from Bronwen Maddox, chief executive of Chatham House, referring to British media and “parts of UK govt” claiming that minorities such as Tamils, Sikhs and Muslims do not feel as comfortable in India. “I am a Tamil and I feel perfectly comfortable,” he said.“There is a certain politics prevalent in some parts of the world, very driven by a kind of vote bank consideration, driven by creating identity lobbies, actually pandering to them and stoking a certain attitude, and we don’t think that is a very healthy politics,” he said.“That kind of tokenism is very disruptive politics and so I would dispute the idea that that is an ideal to which we should all aspire. That is a model which we reject. Good politics is about treating your citizens equally,” he added.","The world is becoming increasingly multipolar with different centres of power, S Jaishankar said. “We see a president and an administration moving towards multipolarity and that is something which suits India,” he said. India has spent the past decade developing relations with big players, and non-big ones.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118768892,imgsize-847685,width-400,resizemode-4/118768892.jpg"

JAMMU: Chief minister Omar Abdullah tabled Thursday J&K’s economic survey in the assembly with heady data on growth and jobs, the first such dossier since the 2019 abrogation of Article 370 and the region’s conversion into a Union territory (UT).J&K’s economy is expected to grow at 7.06% in 2024-25, while unemployment rate has dipped 0.6% to 6.1% since 2019, according to the survey tabled by Omar. He also handles finance in his nearly six-month-old National Conference (NC) govt.The size of J&K’s economy is estimated at Rs 2.65 lakh crore, and its real GSDP at Rs 1.45 lakh crore in 2024-25. The jobs report card is rosy, too. “Unemployment rate has recorded a dip of 0.6% points to 6.1& in 2023-24 from 6.7% in 2019-20, reflecting enhanced employment opportunities and economic dynamism,” the report says.Tourism appears to be going places, with arrivals soaring to an all-time high of 2.36 crore in 2024, the survey says. This includes foreign tourists (0.65 lakh), Sh Amarnath Ji (5.12 lakhs) and Shri Mata Vaishno Devi (94.56 lakhs). Home stays are being encouraged to accommodate more visitors and generate employment.J&K is estimated to achieve a compound annual growth rate of 4.89% in real GSDP from 2019-20 to 2024-25 compared with 4.81% from 2011-12 to 2019-20.J&K’s per capita annual income at current prices is estimated at Rs 1,54,703 in 2024-25 compared with the national per capita income of Rs 2,00,162. “Per capita income of J&K is anticipated to grow 10.6% in 2024-25. Comparative analysis with northern states from 2019-20 to 2023-24 indicates J&K’s per capita income grew at a compound annual growth rate of 8.3%, higher than Punjab (6.22%), Delhi (6.74%), and Himachal (6%),” the survey says.Inflation in J&K increased to 4.5% in 2024 from 4.3% in 2023. In contrast, all-India level inflation decreased to 5% from 5.7% in the same period.Tax revenue of Rs 10,624.09 crore was realised in the first nine months of 2024-25, which is 76 per cent of the Rs 13,903.22 crore revenue in 2023-24. “Among the major revenue contributors, the highest increase of 96% was witnessed in taxes on vehicles, followed by a 67% increase in power, 36% in GST, 33% in water user charges, and 14% in excise collection, among others,” the report adds.The survey projects a robust industry phase. Around 1,984 units with investments of Rs 9,606cr and 63,710 jobs have come on stream from 2019 to Dec 2024. Investment proposals worth Rs 1.63 lakh crores (till Dec 2024) have been received, with the potential to generate over 5.9 lakh jobs. Handicraft exports doubled to Rs 1162cr in 2023-24 from Rs 563cr in 2021-22.","J&K’s economy is expected to grow at 7.06% in 2024-25, while unemployment rate has dipped 0.6% to 6.1% since 2019.

MUMBAI: A sessions court in Mumbai on Tuesday issued a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma while rejecting his plea for suspension of a jail sentence in a cheque bouncing case . A magistrate sentenced the filmmaker to three months’ simple imprisonment and directed him to pay Rs 3,72,219 to the complainant within three months.In a March 4 order, Additional Sessions Judge A A Kulkarni issued the NBW against the filmmaker but granted Varma liberty to apply for bail and to make the application for suspension of sentence by appearing before the court. The court adjourned the matter for the report of NBW to July 27.An Andheri Magistrate court recently convicted and sentenced filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma to three months' simple imprisonment in a 2018 cheque bouncing case. The magistrate observed that the filmmaker was given ""sufficient opportunity"" to make the payment.Varma was not present in court when Magistrate Y P Pujari convicted him on January 21, and the court issued a non-bailable warrant against him to ensure he surrendered.Varma then filed an application before the Dindoshi Sessions court against the magistrate’s order and sought suspension of the sentence given by the subordinate court. On February 13, the sessions court sought a reply and adjourned the case to March 4 for a hearing.The case against Varma under the Negotiable Instruments Act alleged dishonour of a cheque of Rs 2.38 lakh, dated June 1, 2018, in Mumbai. When the money was not paid within the legally stipulated period, the complainant, a firm, filed the complaint against the filmmaker.Varma’s defence was that the cheque was not issued by him, the complaint did not show that any articles were delivered to him, the cheque was issued without his knowledge, and not for any legally enforceable debt.","A sessions court in Mumbai issued a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma.

While the booster stage was successfully caught by the launch tower's ""chopstick"" arms, the upper stage tumbled uncontrollably before the live feed cut out.""Can confirm we did lose contact with the ship. Unfortunately, this happened last time, too,"" SpaceX official Dan Huot said, referring to the January 16 test that saw the upper stage explode over the Caribbean, scattering debris.Meanwhile SpoaceX issued a statement and said, "" We will review the data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. As always, success comes from what we learn, and today’s flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starship's reliability.""The incident raises further scrutiny over CEO Elon Musk ’s involvement in the company as he continues leading government overhaul efforts under former President Donald Trump. Concerns have mounted over his influence on US space policy, particularly regarding regulatory oversight.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had allowed Thursday's launch to proceed before completing its review of the previous Starship failure. The January test had ended with debris falling over the Turks and Caicos Islands, triggering cleanup efforts.SpaceX had introduced multiple upgrades for this flight, aiming to enhance the upper-stage vehicle's reliability. The company had also planned to deploy Starlink simulators designed to mimic satellite deployments before burning up in the atmosphere. However, the fate of the errant upper stage remains unclear as SpaceX ended its livestream about 40 minutes after launch.Standing 403 feet (123 meters) tall, Starship is the world's most powerful rocket and is central to Musk's long-term vision of colonizing Mars. Nasa is also relying on a modified version of Starship for its Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon this decade.While SpaceX is working towards full reusability, its current strategy involves targeting splashdowns for the upper stage in the Indian Ocean off Australia’s western coast.Musk’s handling of SpaceX has drawn fresh criticism, particularly regarding regulatory matters. A Bloomberg report recently alleged that a SpaceX engineer warned FAA employees that their jobs were at risk unless they expedited work on a program involving the company's Starlink satellite terminals. SpaceX has denied the claims, calling the media reports ""false.""Despite the setback, Thursday’s test marks the third successful booster recovery for SpaceX, a key milestone in the company’s bid to develop fully reusable rockets.","SpaceX's latest test launch of its Starship mega-rocket ended in partial failure on Thursday.

Is Elon Musk the Ultimate Ketamine Case Study?



Morpheus posed this question in, challenging Neo’s perception of reality. But today, we might ask the same of Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who increasingly behaves as if he exists in a different dimension—one where he alone is in control of everything. What if Musk thinks he is the Chosen One because of this? From shaping global politics to making impulsive leadership decisions, Musk’s actions suggest a man who believes he is operating above the rest of humanity—beyond consequences, beyond reality itself.According to an older report from, Musk’s use of ketamine may be influencing his behavior. The powerful dissociative drug, known for severing users from reality, has been linked to cognitive distortions, paranoia, and an altered sense of self-importance.Could Musk’s increasingly erratic decision-making be influenced by ketamine—a drug that can create a sense of detachment and grandiosity?Musk has never shied away from controversy, but his relationship with drugs has long been a topic of public scrutiny. His 2018 appearance on—where he took a single puff of a cannabis joint—was enough to shake Tesla’s stock and trigger a NASA investigation.But cannabis was only the beginning. Reports indicate Musk has been prescribed ketamine and uses it to manage depression. He confirmed in a March 2024 interview withDon Lemon that he takes the drug every other week under medical supervision. However,Ronan Farrow reported that Musk’s associates worry his ketamine use, combined with his isolation, is affecting his behaviour. While Musk insists that “if you use too much ketamine, you can’t really get work done,” his unconventional leadership and erratic decision-making have led to increased speculation about the effects of his ketamine use.Ketamine, first approved by the FDA in 1970, has gained attention as a potential treatment for severe depression, particularly for those resistant to traditional antidepressants. Dr. Adam Kaplin, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, says that esketamine—a derivative of ketamine—offers new hope for depression treatment: “For the first time in 60 years, we have a new antidepressant therapy that isn’t just a spinoff of existing drugs.”Dr John Krystal, chief of psychiatry at Yale-New Haven Hospital, highlights concerns about ketamine’s potential side effects: “Ketamine can induce feelings of unreality, visual and sensory distortions, and unusual beliefs.”The Mayo Clinic warns that while ketamine may offer benefits, long-term effects remain unclear, and misuse can lead to dependence and cognitive impairment. While medically supervised ketamine use can be beneficial, experts caution that frequent or high-dose use may lead to dissociative symptoms, paranoia, and distorted thinking.Musk’s public behavior in recent years has sparked debates over his leadership and mental well-being. According to, Musk’s 2024 appearance at CPAC raised eyebrows when he hoisted a chainsaw in the air and questioned whether Fort Knox actually contains gold. His late-night rants on Twitter/X range from impulsive business decisions to cryptic memes, causing stock fluctuations and investor panic. Musk’s leadership of X has been marked by unpredictable decisions, from mass firings to controversial policy changes. While Musk has always been known for his unorthodox style, concerns have grown about whether his behavior is becoming increasingly erratic.Musk has not just pushed boundaries in technology—he has increasingly played a role in geopolitics. According to, Musk privately limited Starlink access to Ukrainian forces, raising concerns about his influence over military communications. He has engaged in direct discussions with government leaders, influencing policy on issues ranging from AI to electric vehicles. He has shifted politically, criticizing progressive policies and engaging with figures on the right. Musk’s involvement in global affairs highlights his growing influence—but also raises questions about how his decision-making is shaped by personal beliefs, business interests, and even his mental health treatment.Musk is not alone in using mind-altering substances. According to the, psychedelic drugs, including ketamine, are widely used in Silicon Valley’s elite circles. The ketamine industry is now worth billions, with an increase in off-label prescriptions. A 2010 study by Professor Celia Morgan at the University of Exeter found that frequent ketamine users exhibited cognitive impairments and delusional thinking.Musk once joked that he believes we are all living in a simulation—that reality itself may be an illusion. But as his behavior continues to raise eyebrows, the real question might be: Is Musk the one losing touch with reality? The effects of chronic ketamine use—dissociation, grandiosity, and detachment—align with some of the concerns raised about Musk’s unpredictable behaviour.Morpheus told Neo: “The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.”For Musk, the ketamine matrix may be blinding him from reality itself. And when a man who controls SpaceX, Tesla, Starlink, Twitter/X starts making impulsive decisions, and has a direct line to the POTUS—should we be concerned about what he sees when he looks out from inside his simulation?","Elon Musk is the world’s richest man, but his relationship with drugs has long been a topic of public scrutiny.

Cyclone Alfred’s unusual path baffles experts: Why forecasters are concerned,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/cyclone-alfreds-unusual-path-baffles-experts-why-forecasters-are-concerned/articleshow/118742988.cms,"What’s making Cyclone Alfred unusual?

Why are forecasters concerned?

The bigger picture: Is climate change a factor?

As Cyclone Alfred closes in on Australia’s eastern coast, meteorologists are grappling with its unpredictable movement, unusually strong intensity, and potential for widespread destruction. Unlike most tropical cyclones that veer away from Australia’s coastline, Alfred has taken a rare westward turn, putting densely populated areas at risk.1. A rare westward turn toward landMost cyclones in the Coral Sea move southeastward, following prevailing mid-latitude westerly winds that steer them away from land. However, Alfred has defied this norm. Initially drifting southward parallel to the Australian coastline, it took a sudden westward turn toward Queensland and New South Wales.Dr Liz Ritchie-Tyo, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Monash University, was quoted by the Independent as explaining, “This shift is due to Alfred’s interaction with a mid-latitude trough. Instead of weakening and drifting away, it has re-intensified into a hybrid system, sometimes even stronger than the original tropical cyclone.”2. Strength sustained further south than expectedTropical cyclones typically weaken as they move south due to cooler ocean temperatures and stronger wind shear, which disrupts their structure. However, Alfred has maintained its strength as a Category 2 system and could even brush close to Category 3 intensity before landfall.“The last time a severe tropical cyclone made landfall this far south was in the 1950s,” said Dr Tom Mortlock of Climate Analytics Asia-Pacific, as quoted by the Independent. “We’re seeing storms sustain their intensity much further south than before, and that’s alarming.”One key factor is ocean temperatures. The sea surface near Sydney is currently around 27°C—about 1°C above average. Warm waters above 26.5°C are essential for cyclone development, and Alfred is feeding off this energy.3. Intensification and unpredictabilityScientists have noted that Alfred formed alongside two other tropical systems in late February, a rare phenomenon in the South Pacific. While cyclones forming in clusters aren’t unheard of, Alfred’s ability to sustain itself and intensify over an extended period has raised eyebrows.“This is a storm that refuses to weaken,” said meteorologist Thomas Hinterdorfer. “The longer it stays over warm waters, the more energy it gains before landfall.”1. Extreme rainfall and flooding risksCyclone Alfred is expected to bring up to 600mm of rain—enough to overwhelm rivers and trigger widespread flooding across Queensland and northern NSW. With Brisbane and Gold Coast in the storm’s path, authorities are bracing for a major flood event not seen since Cyclone Wanda in 1974.2. Coastal erosion and storm surgesWith high tides coinciding with Alfred’s landfall, coastal communities could see severe erosion and storm surges. The combination of heavy rainfall and strong onshore winds will push seawater inland, increasing flood risks.3. Slow movement could amplify damageThe cyclone is currently moving at just 14 km/h—slower than the average tropical cyclone speed of 15-20 km/h. Slower-moving storms tend to cause prolonged destruction, dumping heavy rainfall over the same area for an extended period.“When cyclones move slowly, they linger over land, causing greater wind damage and prolonged flooding,” said Hinterdorfer. “We saw this with Hurricane Harvey in the U.S., where slow movement led to record-breaking rainfall.”Scientists warn that climate change is altering cyclone behavior, making storms more intense, more frequent, and less predictable. Rising global temperatures are warming ocean waters, fueling stronger cyclones that reach further south than before.“Tropical cyclones used to weaken before reaching Brisbane. That’s no longer guaranteed,” said Dr. Iftekhar Ahmed of the University of Newcastle. “We need to start planning for a future where these types of storms become more common.”With Alfred set to make landfall within hours, authorities are urging residents to prepare for severe weather conditions that could rival the most destructive storms in Australia’s history.","Cyclone Alfred has taken a rare westward turn toward Australia’s eastern coast.

Taylor Swift urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate

Taylor Swift is reportedly coming under more pressure to keep her personal life separate from her professional image. Some, according to insiders, think that her very public romance with Travis Kelce might be having a detrimental impact on her reputation.

Taylor Swift's involvement in Blake Lively’s legal dispute case has now taken a major turn

Taylor Swift and Blake Lively have been inseparable for almost a decade, so the absence of Lively from Swift's Super Bowl suite in New Orleans was something of a talking point, particularly given that she came with her to last year's game in Las Vegas. Rumors have emerged of a split, which has been linked by some to Lively's recent legal battle with her co-star on It Ends With Us, Justin Baldoni. But neither Swift nor Lively has commented on the rumors, and fans are left wondering about the state of their friendship.Blake Lively and Taylor Swift have shared a strong friendship for nearly a decade, making it somewhat surprising that Lively was absent from Swift’s VIP suite at the Super Bowl in New Orleans. Just a year ago, she was by Swift’s side at the big game in Las Vegas, fueling speculation about why she skipped this year's event.There have been rumors about the two supposedly being at odds, with some speculating that Lively's current lawsuit against actor and filmmaker Justin Baldoni—her co-star in the 2024 film It Ends With Us—is the reason for the alleged feud. Neither Swift nor Lively has commented on the rumors, however, leaving fans to speculate on what is actually occurring.Blake Lively has allegedly filed a lawsuit against Justin Baldoni, alleging he sexually harassed her while filming the two of them together. The claims have been vehemently denied by Baldoni and he in turn has brought a $400 million lawsuit claiming civil extortion, invasion of privacy, and defamation against Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds as well.Taylor Swift's name came up in the controversy over an apparent text message from Lively, in which she apparently named Swift as one of her ""dragons""—a guardian in her fight with Baldoni. The actor posted a screenshot of the message, implying that Lively used Swift's name as backing for her argument.Reports indicate that Swift is not pleased to be brought into the scandal, which might have created tension between her and Lively, possibly weakening their long-time friendship.A new report from Daily Mail has revealed that Swift's involvement in the case has now taken a major turn. ""In an embarrassing new blow for Blake Lively, Taylor Swift will be subpoenaed to be questioned under oath as part of the on-going Lively vs Justin Baldoni lawsuit battle, according to a source close to the legal action,"" read Daily Mail's report.Both sides in the dispute have mentioned Swift in their filings, making her part of the first group of potential witnesses contacted by Baldoni's team. The report also mentions ""It Ends With Us"" actors Jenny Slate and Isabela Ferrer, among others, in the witness list.Also Read: Travis Kelce's beau Taylor Swift faces lawsuit with copyright infringement over several songs across various albums Swift is currently spending time with her boyfriend Travis Kelce, who announced he will not retire after a Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Boston Bruins Eyeing Bigger Return from Flames at NHL Trade Deadline Amid Brandon Carlo Speculations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/boston-bruins-eyeing-bigger-return-from-flames-at-nhl-trade-deadline-amid-brandon-carlo-speculations/articleshow/118737459.cms,"Image Via Getty Images

A Brandon Carlo To Flames Deal Could Create A Bigger Opportunity

With the NHL trade deadline approaching, the Boston Bruins have been in the limelight with their recent activities. Just after the Bruins traded Trent Frederic and Max Jones to the Edmonton Oilers for draft picks and prospect Max Wanner, they would surely be eyeing a bigger fish. With Carlo supposedly on the radar of the Calgary Flames, Boston could set itself for a much larger return that would greatly benefit the roster into the future. This retooling type of move indicates that the team plans to enhance its roster without slowing down its long-term goals.Brandon Carlo's worth on the trade market is rising with increased speculation, especially with two years remaining on his contract with a very manageable cap hit of $4.1 million. The 27-year-old American defenseman has been a steady presence on the Bruins' blue line, making him a tempting sweetener in a deal for teams seeking defensive stability. With strong interest reportedly being expressed by the Calgary Flames to acquire Carlo, this may lead to quite a larger return relative to Frederic's worth.With several teams still in the hunt for the playoffs, this year's trade market is definitely on the side of the sellers. Boston's recent dealings with the Oilers, which saw them acquire two draft picks and a promising prospect, indicate that teams are ready to pay well for valuable assets. Should the Bruins act upon that market trend and trade Carlo, he could attract high picks and prospects that could greatly bolster the franchise's efforts in the offseason.With the Flames looking to shore up their back end with an eye toward the playoffs, the Bruins would have all the more leverage in trading Carlo. Such a deal fits neatly into Boston's short-term retooling plan while preserving guys like David Pastrnak, Brad Marchand, and Charlie McAvoy for greater glory in the future.Also Read: NHL fans express concern as Brad Marchand takes devastating hit during Bruins vs Penguins showdown The Bruins are using a calculated strategy for the day of the trade, balancing short-term goals and long-term projects. A trade of Brandon Carlo could bring the package of picks and prospects valuable to their offseason roster upgrade. There will be no total rebuild; instead, the Bruins are positioning themselves strategically to retool and be competitive. With many building blocks already in place, Boston's front office will wisely prioritize the accumulation of assets to set the stage for sustained success. Just before the deadline, the fans can expect the Bruins to make a series of calculated moves that favor their present as well as future.","Brandon Carlo's worth on the trade market is rising with increased speculation, especially with two years remaining on his contract.

"At Rs 6,000cr, Pune’s 2024 cybercrime losses 5x that of Mumbai, Thane & Nagpur combined",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/at-rs-6000cr-punes-2024-cybercrime-losses-5x-that-of-mumbai-thane-nagpur-combined/articleshow/118773831.cms,"Representative Image

PUNE: CM Devendra Fadnavis, in a written reply during the ongoing Assembly session in Mumbai, said Rs6,007 crore were lost in 1,504 cyber crime cases in Pune in 2024.As many as 7,245 cases of cyber frauds were registered last year in Pune, Mumbai, Thane and Nagpur, and the victims lost Rs7,132 crore in the cases, the CM said. Of these, 4,849 cases were registered in Mumbai for cyber frauds worth Rs888 crore, 680 cases running up to Rs174 crore in Thane, 212 cases in Nagpur for frauds involving Rs63 crore, the reply stated on Tuesday.This would mean the cyber frauds in Pune in terms of value were around five times more than those in Mumbai, Thane, and Nagpur combined. Observers said the fraud amount in Pune was almost more than the annual budget of many municipal corporations in the state, like Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Nagpur, or Nashik.When contacted, Pune commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar told TOI, ""I have called for some more information and details relating to the statistics presented in the Assembly before I can speak more on the issue. However, we are trying to respond in golden hours to ensure that we freeze the bank accounts of the cyber fraudsters and money is returned to the victims in time.""A senior Pune police officer, who did not wish to be named, told TOI, ""The amount of cyber frauds in Pune mentioned in the CM's written reply looks high, but it is only because of two cases of GST fraud worth Rs5,000 crore and Rs561 crore. Both the cases were registered under section 66 D of the IT Act; hence they were counted in the total number of cases related to cyber fraud. If we exclude these two cases, then Pune's cyber fraud amount for 2024 come down to Rs446 crore, which is actually less than Mumbai's.""Earlier this year, Pune city police officers had said they recorded a 776% spike in cases related to online scams in 2024 compared to the previous year.Pune commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar said, ""We are working on providing training to our staff to ensure skilled manpower to investigate these cases.""Cyber experts said govt or the administration has failed to create awareness about cybercrime across the country, leading to an increase in such frauds.""Central govt has started pre-call announcements for callers to create awareness about cyber crimes. But the fraudsters are coming up with new ideas every day. As a result, this initiative alone cannot help to prevent such frauds,"" Sandip Dadiya, a cyber crime investigation expert, said.Police were overburdened with other work, due to which they also failed to organise awareness programs on the ground, he said, adding that the (police) department lacked skilled manpower to investigate such cases.""They often face delays in getting information from banks, sim card companies, or social media firms. This further delays their investigation. During this period, the accused manage to escape. If sim card companies and banks strictly comply with the KYC norms, ensuring there is no loophole in their system, cyber frauds can be brought under control to a good extent,"" he said.Explaining steps taken by govt to handle cyber-related cases in the state, chief minister Fadnavis said, ""Govt has already made 50 cyber police stations functional across the state, and skilled policemen have been deployed there. Besides, govt has established a laboratory, called 'Centre of Excellence in Digital Forensic', in Pune for forensic analysis to help investigations in cases related to cyber fraud.""He said the home ministry was also working on a semi-automated processing project to speed up the analysis in cases pending for a longer period.","CM Devendra Fadnavis said Rs6,007 crore were lost in 1,504 cyber crime cases in Pune in 2024.

Canadian Tire to close 17 Atmosphere stores in Western Canada amid restructuring,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/canadian-tire-to-close-17-atmosphere-stores-in-western-canada-amid-restructuring/articleshow/118773519.cms,"Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd. will shut down 17 Atmosphere stores across Western Canada in the coming months as part of its restructuring strategy, the company announced Thursday. The closures, which include locations in British Columbia, are part of its Truth North plan , a four-year, $2 billion initiative aimed at streamlining operations and improving efficiency.The company, which also owns SportChek , Mark’s, Party City, and Pro Hockey Life, is shifting away from its holding company model to consolidate systems and data across its brands.“We will operate more efficiently and go to market more strategically, harnessing our banners and loyalty system to elevate our scale,” said Canadian Tire CEO Greg Hicks in a statement.Of the 17 Atmosphere locations set to close, 14 will be relocated within existing SportChek stores in a phased transition. However, the company has not specified which locations will be affected. British Columbia currently has 10 Atmosphere stores, including in West Vancouver, Coquitlam, Surrey, Langley, Nanaimo, Victoria, Kamloops, Kelowna, and Prince George, while Alberta has multiple locations in Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, and Banff.Canadian Tire is working to place affected employees in new roles but has not disclosed how many workers will be impacted. The company declined an interview, stating the move is intended to reduce redundancies and back-office costs.Beyond store closures, the company’s strategy includes optimizing SportChek’s retail footprint, expanding its loyalty program by adding brand partners, and increasing its Triangle Mastercard user base. It also plans to carry out up to $400 million in share buybacks , doubling its previous target of $200 million.As part of the transition, the leadership team is being restructured. Susan O’Brien, previously the chief brand and customer officer, will take on the role of chief transformation officer, while T.J. Flood, president of Canadian Tire’s retail division, will become COO. The company is also searching for a new chief commercial officer.RBC Capital Markets analyst Irene Nattel described the changes as “sensible,” stating in a note to investors, “If properly executed, the result should be closer connection to (Canadian Tire’s) customer base and a more effective approach to procurement and merchandising, in turn driving stronger revenue growth/profitability.”The announcement comes just weeks after Canadian Tire signed a nearly $1.3-billion deal to sell its Helly Hansen brand to Kontoor Brands, the owner of Wrangler and Lee.Hicks has recently warned that U.S. tariffs could impact the company’s financial outlook, stating that consumer spending had started recovering but could be “substantially erased” due to tariff pressures. Canadian Tire currently sources about 15% of its products from the U.S. and is exploring shifting 25-30% of those purchases to Canadian suppliers.","Canadian Tire Corp.
