'Belief shattered': Two JD(U) leaders resign over party's support for Waqf bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/belief-shattered-two-jdu-leaders-resign-for-partys-support-of-waqf-bill/articleshow/119963762.cms,"Rajya Sabha (Agencies)

NEW DELHI: At least two individuals in Bihar on Thursday announced their resignation from chief minister Nitish Kumar 's party, Janata Dal (United), or JD(U), due to disagreement with the party’s support for the Waqf (Amendment) Bill introduced by the central government.Mohammed Qasim Ansari, claiming to be a senior JD(U) leader, and Mohammed Nawaz Malik, JD(U) minority pradesh secretary of Bihar, wrote separate letters to Nitish Kumar. In the letters, they said that Muslims no longer had trust in the party, which they earlier believed followed a secular path.“Millions of Indian Muslims like us had unwavering faith that you are the flag bearer of a purely secular ideology. But now, this belief has been shattered. Millions of dedicated Indian Muslims and activists like us are deeply shocked by JDU's stand regarding the Waqf Bill Amendment Act 2024,” reads the letter written by Shah Nawaz Malik.Ansari wrote that the Waqf Bill was “against Indian Muslims” and could not be accepted “under any circumstances.”“This bill violates many fundamental rights of the Constitution. Through this bill, Indian Muslims are being humiliated and insulted. Neither you nor your party realises this. I regret that I gave many years of my life to the party,” he wrote.However, JD(U) national spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad responded by saying that neither Ansari, from East Champaran, nor Malik, from Jamui, were part of the party’s official structure.In a letter circulating on social media, Ansari described himself as JD(U)'s medical cell president in East Champaran and claimed to have been a candidate from the Dhaka assembly seat. However, the JD(U) did not contest Dhaka in the 2020 elections. That seat was won by the BJP’s Pawan Jaiswal, an ally of JD(U).Rajiv Ranjan Prasad told news agency PTI, ""I wonder what to say about things. I have been associated with the party for a long time. I say with full responsibility that neither person has been a part of our rank and file.""He added, ""We admit that some genuine members of our party, like national general secretary Ghulam Rasool Baliyawi, are not very happy with the passage of the Bill. Their grievances will be dealt with at the appropriate level. But those who are coming up with the claim of resignation from the party, were never members in the first place.""Earlier in the day, Baliyawi and Syed Afzal Abbas, who heads the Bihar Shia Waqf Board, also expressed concern about the Bill. They said many suggestions made by Muslim leaders during meetings with the Joint Parliamentary Committee were not accepted. However, they did not speak against the party’s decision to support the Bill.Parliament passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025 in the early hours of Friday after a detailed discussion in the Rajya Sabha. The bill was approved in the Rajya Sabha with 128 members voting in favour and 95 opposing it. Earlier, it had cleared the Lok Sabha with the support of 288 MPs, while 232 voted against it.Parliament approved the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, in the early hours of Friday following an extensive discussion in the Rajya Sabha.

He said that the RJD, which ruled Bihar for 15 years and got Muslim votes, had failed to stop Hindu-Muslim clashes.The RJD, Congress, and Left parties are expected to use the Waqf Bill issue to criticise the JD(U) and are hoping to gain Muslim voters' support for the ""Mahagathbandhan"" alliance.","Mohammed Qasim Ansari, claiming to be a senior JD(U) leader, wrote separate letters to Nitish Kumar.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday lauded the passage of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, in both the houses of Parliament, describing it as a ""watershed moment"".The contentious legislation cleared both houses of Parliament after extensive debates, with the Rajya Sabha passing it following a marathon 13-hour discussion.

"India gets slapped with tariff, others punched",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gets-slapped-with-tariff-others-punched/articleshow/119961287.cms,"India's reaction:

At a White House Rose Garden event on Wednesday on what he called “Liberation Day” for the US, India became a middling victim in Trump’s take-no-prisoner approach that treated friend and foe alike with a two-tier tariff: a baseline tax of 10% on all countries that will go into effect on April 5, and additional tariffs on some countries that he considers to be the “worst offenders”, which will be imposed on April 9.India, described by Trump as the ‘tariff king’, makes the US President’s ‘worst offender’ checklist because, by his calculation, New Delhi taxes US imports to the tune of 52%, a dubious figure arrived at by adding perceived non-monetary, nontariff barriers, ‘currency manipulation’ etc. China was assessed at 67%, Taiwan at 64%, and South Korea at 50%.But out of the ‘kindness of his heart’ he would impose not a ‘commonsense reciprocal tariff’ but give a 50% ‘discount,’ Trump said, thus making it 27% tariff on imports from India.“For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far – both friend and foe alike. Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream,” the president of the richest country on earth raged in remarks that were borderline offensive and distasteful.Financial markets plunged in response. Some $2tn of market value was wiped out in S&P 500 stocks alone as the index fell 4%, its worst day since Sept 2022. The dollar experienced its largest single-day decline on record, dropping 2.1% against major currencies.The ripple effect of Trump’s sweeping tariffs will reshape global trade flows, disrupt supply chains, and test longstanding diplomatic alliances. As countries scramble to respond, the economic and geopolitical fallout is likely to be deep and enduring.The govt said it would seek to “expeditiously” clinch a “mutually beneficial” bilateral trade deal with the US and reiterated its commitment to strong strategic relations.Sources said the commerce department is consulting export councils and ministries to gauge the fallout and explore support for affected businesses.With PM Modi and Trump agreeing to a bilateral trade agreement later this year, India and the US have finalised the broad contours of detailed discussions with technical negotiations expected to be launched this month. This, sources said, gave India a lead over others who will now begin an engagement with the US to seek tariff cuts. “India was an early mover and over the last 50 days a lot of work has been done. The idea is to settle all outstanding bilateral trade issues,” an official said. The assessment is that the Trump administration too is keen to engage and a deal can be crafted by lowering a few duties in India.","India, described by Trump as the ‘tariff king’, makes the US President’s ‘worst offender’ checklist.

Experts at India Meteorological Department (IMD) expect some more rain Friday morning.The city received 4.3mm of rain Thursday. Though the day dawned with overcast conditions, the skies opened up only by noon. But within minutes, Bengaluru was reminded of how vulnerable it could be in case of heavy rain, with several roads and areas inundated.As many as 12 trees and 451 branches fell in various parts of the city. Though the downpour lasted only a short while in most areas, the impact lasted hours, with traffic crawling as the road conditions were unnavigable. To counter the vehicle pile-up, traffic police issued advisories on the go, on social media.The inundated stretches included the road from Domlur water tank to Domlur bridge, Kadugodi bridge towards Hoskote main road, Madiwala 29th Main road towards Silk Board, Palace Cross underpass, Ramamurthy Nagar underpass, Puttenahalli underpass towards JP Nagar, Inner Ring Road towards Indiranagar underpass, and HBR Layout towards Tin Factory.A tree fell at Chowdeshwari temple, near the National Games Village back gate, slowing down traffic. In Rajajinagar II Block, an uprooted tree landed on an SUV. By 6pm, six of the uprooted trees were cleared and 27 of the 41 fallen branches removed.IMD Bengaluru director CS Patil told TOI: ""While parts of the state were issued a yellow alert on Thursday, the intensity of rainfall will be less on Friday. Parts of Karnataka have only a thunderstorm alert.""He attributed the shower spells to strong south-easterly winds blowing from the Bay of Bengal. ""They bring in a lot of moisture into the interior land. And the past few days witnessed very high temperatures. The combination of the temperature and humidity in effect gave us good rainfall,"" he said.What's that froth on the road?Vehicles wading through accumulated rainwater on Thursday also had to watch out for frothy roads — be it at Koramangala, Indiranagar or the CBD area — that were mildly layered with suds. The speculation was that the suds were caused by Shikakai trees that react with rainwater and release saponins, and BBMP deputy conservator of forests BLG Swamy agreed. He told TOI that the foam, however, doesn't make the roads slippery. ""The seed, though, is dangerous to be lying around. But it is swept away each morning by sanitation workers. There is no proposal for replacing these trees,"" he added.209 vulnerable areas identifiedBBMP has identified 209 areas — including 11 new ones — as vulnerable to flooding.

There are 30 teams in the city to clear trees and branches brought down during rain.This was revealed at the monsoon preparedness meeting at Naukarara Bhavana on Thursday, where BBMP chief commissioner Tushar Giri Nath instructed officials to visit flood-affected areas and take measures to prevent waterlogging, including clearing gratings installed on the roadside.In his instructions on desilting, he also asked for a two-month plan along with a list of cleaning tasks for the SWD department.",As many as 12 trees and 451 branches fell in various parts of the city.

"In counter to Yunus's remark, PM Modi says Northeast integral to Bimstec",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-counter-to-yunuss-remark-pm-modi-says-northeast-integral-to-bimstec/articleshow/119956816.cms,"Modi to meet Yunus today, claim top Bangladesh officials

As he departed for Thailand to participate in the 6th Bimstec summit, PM Narendra Modi asserted India's Northeast lies at the heart of the inter-regional group, underlining the primacy of the northeastern states in the region, days after Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said in China the ""7 sisters"" are landlocked with no way of reaching the ocean. Modi's remark came ahead of a likely bilateral meeting between the two on Friday on the summit's margins.Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.Modi was seated between Yunus and Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli. An Indian govt source speaking on condition of anonymity said the meeting, as sought by Dhaka, is ""in the works"". Senior officials in Dhaka were quoted as saying that the leaders would meet on Friday afternoon, shortly after the Bimstec summit. The meeting, if it happens, would be the first between the leaders since the interim govt took charge in Bangladesh in Aug 2025.Separately, in a Bimstec ministerial, Jaishankar said that the North-East had emerged as a connectivity hub for the Bimstec and the completion of the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway will connect the region all the way to the Pacific Ocean. This, he said, would be a veritable game-changer.Yunus's office had clarified on Wednesday that his remarks about India's North-East had been made with ""honest intentions"" but were interpreted wrongly. The fact that he was speaking in China, while inviting Beijing to take advantage of Bangladesh's geographical location, raised eyebrows in India.Modi had last week written to Yunus on Bangladesh National Day, extending his felicitations and underlining the significance of working together on the basis of mutual sensitivity to each other's interests and concerns. India also remains concerned about the law-and-order situation in Bangladesh, and the threat to minorities amid increasing radicalisation in the country.According to govt sources, bilateral meetings are likely also with Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli and Myanmar junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who is undertaking a rare visit abroad amid the civil war in the country for Bimstec.In his departure statement, Modi also said that Bimstec has emerged as a significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region. ""I look forward to meeting the leaders of the Bimstec countries and engaging productively to further strengthen our collaboration with the interest of our people in mind,"" said Modi.Bimstec or the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation is an inter-regional grouping comprising five South Asian countries and two Asean states, lying in the littoral and adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh will take over as the chair of Bimstec at the Bangkok summit.At the last summit in Colombo in 2022, the leaders adopted the Bimstec Charter, completing its transition from a grouping to a regional organisation. With Saarc now non-functional because of the lack of any diplomatic engagement between India and Pakistan, the Indian govt has pushed Bimstec as an alternative for regional trade, connectivity and security. Addressing the Colombo summit, Modi had also called for expediti ng ongoing talks for a Bimstec free trade agreement (FTA) that would enhance mutual trade.The PM will also visit Sri Lanka from Bangkok. ""This follows the highly successful visit of President Dissanayaka to India last Dec. We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of fostering partnerships for a shared future and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,"" he said in his departure statement.","Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.

We should remember that Muslims also have contributed to the development of the country,"" T Siva said in his speech in the Upper House. Siva in his speech highlighted how the BJP governments in states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were targeting the Muslims.Earlier on Wednesday, when the Bill was being debated in Lok Sabha, Stalin shot off a letter to Prime Minister Modi against the legislation.""The Constitution of India grants every citizen the right to follow their respective religion and it is the duty of the elected governments to uphold and protect this right. However, the proposed amendments to the Waqf Act, 1995 have not taken into consideration the constitutional protection given to minorities and are bound to severely harm the interest of Muslim community,"" Stalin wrote in his letter.Last week, Stalin had got a resolution passed against the Bill in the state assembly on March 27. The resolution stated that the proposed Waqf legislation would seriously affect the religious harmony of India besides the minority Muslim community.Clearly, all his moves appear to be part of a well-planned political strategy to steal the initiative over his rivals in the state with assembly elections scheduled early next year.Interestingly, on all these initiatives the AIADMK , which is DMK's arch rival, has been forced to support the government.In fact, actor-politician Tamilaga Vetri Kazhagam chief Vijay, who may be the surprise factor in the upcoming assembly elections, has also dubbed the Waqf Bill ""anti-democratic"" and demanded that it be taken back.Accusing the BJP of pursuing ""majoritarian and divisive politics"", he wondered whether the Bill was not a ""psychological attack"" on Muslims and rejected the BJP-led Centre's arguments in support of the Bill.""The TVK urges that the anti-democratic Bill be immediately taken back heeding the voice of all democratic forces. In case the union government led by the BJP does not do this, the TVK will join forces with Muslim brothers and take part in their Waqf rights legal struggle,"" Vijay said.Stalin has been quick to latch on to some of the issues raised by the BJP in the state.When Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan asked the DMK government in Tamil Nadu to implement the three-language policy, Stalin turned it into an issue of state's rights alleging that it was not the National Education Policy that the BJP was trying to implement but a ""saffron policy"" aimed at developing Hindi and not the nation.Raising fears of ""Hindi imposition"" on the state, Stalin claimed that Tamil Nadu was ready for another language war. The Tamil Nadu chief minister did not stop at that.He simultaneously raised the pitch on the ""threat"" of Tamil Nadu losing Lok Sabha seats under the proposed delimitation and called an all-party meeting on the issue to ensure that the state was not penalised for ensuring development and controlling population.Muslims constitute nearly 6% of the state's population and have equally supported the DMK and the AIADMK in their pockets of influence. However, this time around Stalin perhaps wants to consolidate their support for his party. Also, perhaps there is a concerted effort by CM Stalin to make DMK a main stream player in national politics and lead opposition unity against the BJP. That was evident when Stalin brought opposition CMs and leaders from non-NDA parties in the joint action committee against the delimitation.","DMK president and chief minister M K Stalin has taken the lead to emerge as one of the strongest critics of the Waqf Amendment Bill. On Thursday, Stalin came to the assembly wearing a black badge to protest against the passing of the Bill in Lok Sabha. His party member in Rajya Sabha Tiruchi Siva claimed that the BJP-led NDA government was targeting the Muslims.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119951890,imgsize-969804,width-400,resizemode-4/CM-Stalin.jpg"

Tyeb Mehta's bull run continues: 2nd priciest Indian painting at 61.8cr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tyeb-mehtas-bull-run-continues-2nd-priciest-indian-painting-at-61-8cr/articleshow/119957048.cms,"His work is worth crores, but Tyeb struggled most of his life

The bull run seems to be truly on in the Indian market, and who better to capture its animal spirits than Tyeb Mehta, the celebrated modernist who made the bull his enduring motif?Less than a fortnight after a work by his contemporary M F Husain joined the Rs 100-crore club, Mehta's 'Trussed Bull' (1956) went for Rs 61.8 crore ($7.27 million), becoming the second most expensive Indian painting sold at auction globally. It is now tied with Amrita Sher-Gil 's 'The Story Teller', which sold for the same price in 2023. Mehta's powerful image of a shackled and subjugated bull went for nearly nine times its higher estimate at a Saffronart auction in Mumbai on Wednesday.This is not the first time Mehta, who lived in Mumbai most of his life and passed away in 2009, has raised the bar for Indian art. In 2002, his triptych, 'Celebration', from The Times of India's collection, made history as the first modern Indian artwork to sell for over a crore (Rs 1.5 crore at Christie's).It was a Tyeb work again ('Mahishasura') which crossed the $1m mark for the first time in 2005. Now, he has set another benchmark for Indian art. Wednesday's auction was also a benchmark for homegrown auction house Saffronart, which celebrated its 25th anniversary with an auction that raked in a record-breaking $25 million. ""It's a global record for an Indian art auction. It shows the strength of the art market when other asset classes are struggling,"" said Dinesh Vazirani, Saffronart CEO and co-founder. ""It's even more meaningful because it is Mehta's centenary year.""The proceeds will go to the Mehta family since the work was from their collection. For most of his life, the artist lived in a cramped one-room apartment that was studio by day and bedroom at night. It was only in the 1990s that he and his wife Sakina could afford to move into a two-bedroom place in Lokhandwala. ""Like many other artist wives of that period, Sakina supported him. She used to work as a teacher,"" said Kishore Singh, senior VP at DAG (formerly Delhi Art Gallery).His work now goes for sums that are as jaw-dropping as his pregnant Kali and avenging yet tender Durga but to talk of Mehta purely in terms of zeroes does no justice to the man and the ideals he lived by. ""The power of painting was far more important to him than the prices it commanded,"" said Singh, narrating an anecdote from Delhi gallerist Arun Vadehra who was close to Mehta. ""Arun used to have one of his paintings hanging in his office. One day, Mehta took it away, only to replace it later with another work. When Arun asked, he said he had ripped the earlier painting because he wasn't happy with it. Tyeb may not have been very prolific but he stayed true to his art.""Mehta's strong imagery was always rooted in his life, with his canvases charting the tumult around him - the horrors of Partition, the struggles of a newly independent India and the violence of the 1992 Bombay riots. In an interview, he recounted his memories of Partition. ""At the time, I was living on Mohammed Ali Road, which was virtually a Muslim ghetto. I remember watching a young man being slaughtered in the street below my window. The crowd beat him to death, smashed his head with stones."" Those images haunted him for life, as did the sight of bullocks being led to slaughter at an abattoir in Bombay. The bull, Mehta later said, was important to him on many levels. ""The way they tie up the animal's legs and fling it on the floor of the slaughterhouse before butchering it... you feel something very vital has been lost. The trussed bull also seemed representative of the national condition... the mass of humanity unable to channel or direct its tremendous energies...""In the winter of his life, Mehta's vision was impaired. ""Those primary colours that he used so much was because his sight was affected,"" explained Singh. But he continued to paint, a perfectionist till the end.","Tyeb Mehta's 'Trussed Bull' is the second most expensive Indian painting sold at auction globally.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court judges led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna have unanimously decided to make public their assets and liabilities as a dormant issue about wealth of constitutional court judges was revived after the alleged discovery of a huge amount of cash at high court judge Justice Yashwant Varma's official residence on March 14, reports .CJI Khanna mooted the proposal before the collegium comprising himself and Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant, A S Oka and Vikram Nath and later, the issue was put forth before a full court meeting Tuesday. All judges agreed to the proposal to make public their assets and liabilities by posting it on the SC's website. The SC in a press release said 30 of the 33 SC judges, including the CJI, have declared their assets.Two newly-appointed judges - Justices K Vinod Chandran and Joymalya Bagchi - are yet to declare their assets and liabilities to the CJI. The SC has a sanctioned strength of 34 judges but one post is vacant.""The assets and liabilities statements of judges, which are mandatorily declared before the CJI by every judge of the SC and, thereafter, kept in sealed cover, is likely to be uploaded on the SC website by the end of this month,"" an SC source told TOI.The full court of the SC in Aug 2009, during the tenure of CJI K G Balakrishnan, had decided to upload the assets and liabilities declared by judges immediately after getting appointed to the SC, on the SC website after Justice Shylendra Kumar of Karnataka HC publicly joined issue with CJI Balakrishnan for his stand that judges should not be required to disclose their assets to the public.But the practice petered out four or five years later when a judge stirred a huge controversy by mentioning ""daughters' marriage"" as a liability in her declaration. Moreover, judges, who as lawyers had roaring practices prior to joining constitutional courts, were reluctant to share details of their huge assets.In Nov 2019, a five-judge SC bench, of which Justice Khanna was a part, had ruled that the office of CJI was a public authority and amenable to RTI Act. Justice Khanna had said independence of judiciary and transparency went hand in hand. Justice N V Ramana, who became CJI in 2021, had concurred with Justice Khanna and said there should be a balance between right to information, transparency and independence of judiciary.Declaration of assets and liabilities by judges started with a full court resolution of the SC on May 7, 1997, which read, ""Resolved that every judge should make a declaration of all his/her assets in the form of real estate or investments (held by him/her in his/her own name or in the name of his/her spouse or any person dependent on him/her) within a reasonable time of assuming office and in the case of sitting judge within a reasonable time of adoption of this resolution and thereafter whenever any acquisition of substantial nature is made, it shall be disclosed within a reasonable time."" But the declarations were kept confidential till 2009, when it was made public for the first time.","CJI Khanna mooted the proposal before the collegium comprising himself and Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant, A S Oka and Vikram Nath.

NEW DELHI: Senior JD(U) leader Mohammed Qasim Ansari has resigned from the party and all his posts on Thursday, citing disappointment over JD(U)'s stance on the Waqf Amendment Bill 2024 .In a strongly worded resignation letter to party leader Nitish Kumar, Ansari expressed deep dismay, stating that the party’s position had shattered the faith of millions of Indian Muslims.""I am disheartened that I gave several years of my life to the party,"" his letter read.Ansari accused JD(U) of betraying its secular principles and criticised JD(U) MP Lalan Singh for the way he supported the bill in the Lok Sabha.""With due respect, I would like to state that millions of Indian Muslims like me had unwavering faith that you were a true flagbearer of secular ideology. However, that belief has now been shattered,"" he wrote.""The stance taken by the JD(U) regarding the Waqf (Amendment) Act 2024 has deeply hurt millions of dedicated Indian Muslims and party workers like us. We are extremely disheartened by the way Shri Lalan Singh presented his statement in the Lok Sabha and supported this bill with such conviction.""Calling the bill an attack on Indian Muslims and a violation of fundamental constitutional rights, Ansari argued that the legislation was also anti-Pasmanda Muslims—something he claimed neither JD(U) nor its leadership acknowledged.""The Waqf Bill is against Indian Muslims. Under no circumstances can we accept it. This bill violates several fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. Through this legislation, Indian Muslims are being humiliated and disgraced. Additionally, this bill is also anti-Pasmanda Muslims—something neither you nor your party seem to realize,"" he wrote.Regretting his long association with JD(U), Ansari said, ""I deeply regret dedicating several years of my life to this party. I am therefore submitting this letter and resigning voluntarily from the party’s primary membership and all other responsibilities.""However, when asked about Ansari, JD(U) national spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad dismissed him as a ""non-entity,"" claiming he was insignificant within the party.""Who is he? He has never been an office bearer of consequence or a prominent figure. I don't even know him. He never held any post in the party, not even at the district level. He is a non-entity,"" Prasad told PTI.Earlier to the tabling of Bill, JD(U) aligned itself with ally BJP on the Waqf Bill, though party MP Sanjay Jha clarified that JD(U) opposed any retrospective implementation of the law. He expressed hope that the government would address this concern.""Nitish Kumar has been working in Bihar for the last 19 years. During this time, the work he has done for the Muslim community is also visible. Our party had said that it should not be implemented with retrospective effect, and we hope that the government will consider it... As long as Nitish Kumar is in politics, the interests of the people will be protected,"" Jha had said days before the bill’s passage.The Lok Sabha passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2025 after an extended and heated debate.

Meanwhile, Delhi HC refused on Thursday the mining firm's petition to stay SFIO probe.SFIO claims its probe reveals that Veena T's company, Exalogic Solutions Pvt Ltd, received Rs 2.7 crore from CMRL without providing any legitimate service. The payments were allegedly routed through CMRL and Empower India Capital Investments Pvt Ltd, a company linked to Kartha's family. The chargesheet states that these payments had no valid business justification, making them a violation of corporate fraud laws.The accused have been charged under Companies Act, 2013 Sect 447, which deals with corporate fraud.

The US stock market plunged sharply on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 1,400 points, or 3.3%, amid widespread concerns triggered by President Donald Trump ’s latest set of severe tariffs.According to news agency AP, the S&P 500 fell 4%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.1%, reflecting a broader global market sell-off. At one point in the morning, the S&P 500 was on track for its worst day since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020.The announcement of new tariffs on imports, including a 10% baseline tax on a range of products, caused significant alarm among investors, fuelling fears of rising inflation and slowing economic growth. The impact was felt globally, with major stock indexes in Europe and Asia also suffering sharp losses.The tariffs have rattled markets, with commodities like crude oil, tech stocks, and even gold—all traditionally seen as safe havens—declining in value. The Russell 2000 index of smaller US companies dropped 5.9%, dipping more than 20% below its record.Trump’s new tariffs include heightened taxes on imports from countries like China and those in the European Union . Economists warn that the tariffs could lower US economic growth by as much as 2 percentage points this year and push inflation close to 5%, potentially dragging the economy into a recession ""Markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade,"" said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.The Federal Reserve faces a challenging dilemma. While it may consider cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy, such moves could further fuel inflation. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note dropped to 4.04% from 4.20% late Wednesday, reflecting growing concerns about the economy’s future.Despite the ongoing economic growth, data released Thursday showed signs of strain. Unemployment claims remained lower than expected, suggesting a stable labour market, but weaker-than-anticipated growth in US service industries highlighted the broader effects of the tariffs. Businesses reported supply chain disruptions, higher costs for materials like aluminium, and delays in deliveries.Corporate stocks took a major hit, with retailers and airlines among the worst affected. Best Buy dropped 15.2%, United Airlines lost 12.3%, and Target fell 10.3%, as investors grew worried about the impact of the tariffs on consumer spending and business activity.Internationally, European and Asian markets followed suit. France's CAC 40 dropped 3.3%, Germany's DAX lost 3%, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.5%. South Korea's Kospi also lost 0.8%.","US stock market plunged sharply on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 1,400 points, or 3.3%.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde on Thursday launched a blistering attack at Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray for opposing the Waqf Amendment Bill , accusing him of straying from Hindutva and Balasaheb Thackeray 's ideology.Speaking to the media, Shinde described the opposition to the bill as the ""biggest crime.""""By opposing this, UBT has revealed its true face. It has been proven that they have completely abandoned Hindutva and the ideals of Balasaheb Thackeray. This is extremely unfortunate. It is a bigger crime than the betrayal in 2019 when he (Uddhav Thackeray) formed a government with Congress , forsaking Balasaheb Thackeray's ideology,"" Shinde said.He further criticised Thackeray’s leadership, calling him ""confused"" and suggesting it was putting the party’s future in jeopardy.""Uddhav Thackeray is completely confused. He doesn't even know what decisions to take. When leadership becomes like this, the future of the party is also in darkness,"" he added.Shinde defended the Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2025, saying it aims to break the monopoly over Waqf properties and alleging that Congress seeks to keep the poor in poverty.""The Waqf Board was in the hands of a handful of people, but now, with the bill introduced by Modi ji, their dominance will end. This will provide an opportunity for women and children to come into the mainstream. It will benefit the poor sections of the Muslim community, but Congress wants to keep Muslims poor for the sake of votes,"" he claimed.Earlier in the day, Uddhav Thackeray lashed out at the BJP-led Union government, calling it ""all show, no substance."" He reaffirmed his party’s opposition to the Waqf Amendment Bill, as well as what he called the BJP’s hypocrisy and its alleged plans to hand over land to business interests.""There are some corrections (for the Waqf board) in the Waqf amendment bill, which are good. However, the experience with the BJP till now is that yanche dakhwayeche daant ani khayeche daant vegde ahe (all show, no substance). We supported them during the repeal of Article 370... But I want to ask, did the Kashmiri Pandits get their land? We not only opposed the bill but also the hypocrisy and corruption of the BJP and its plans to give land to its businessmen friends,"" former Maharashtra CM Thackeray said at a press conference.The Lok Sabha passed the Waqf Amendment Bill 2025 after an extended and heated debate, with INDIA bloc members opposing it while BJP and its allies backed the legislation. The session continued past midnight before Speaker Om Birla announced the results of the division vote.""Subject to correction, Ayes 288, Noes 232. The majority is in favour of the proposal,"" Birla said.The revised bill, incorporating recommendations from the Joint Parliamentary Committee, seeks to amend the 1995 Act to improve the administration of Waqf properties, enhance efficiency, streamline registration, and integrate technology into record-keeping.Meanwhile, Union parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju moved a motion in the Rajya Sabha for consideration of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Musalmaan Wakf (Repeal) Bill.","Mahar Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde attacked Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray for opposing the Waqf Amendment Bill.

According to Bajaj Broking Research, NHPC and Symphony are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for April 4, 2025:

Index View: NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

We expect the index to head towards 53,000 levels in the short term being the measuring implication of the last 10 weeks range breakout. The recent breakout area and key retracement area of 50,500-50,000 will act as support for the Index.

Stock market recommendations:Nifty during last week on expected lines consolidated in the range of 23,000-23,800 after a 8.5% rally in the preceding 15 sessions. Index in the process worked off the overbought condition developed after the recent sharp rally.Key observation in the daily chart of Nifty is that it has already taken 7 sessions to retrace just 50% of its preceding 6 sessions up move (22,353-23,869). A shallow retracement signals overall positive price structure and a higher base formation above the 50 days EMA. Nifty during the current consolidation phase has absorbed the entire volatility related to US tariff highlighting strength. Hence, we believe the current breather should be used as a buying opportunity in quality stocks in a staggered manner.Going ahead, in the coming week we expect the index to resume up move after the recent breather and gradually head higher towards 23,869 (last week high) and then towards 24,200 levels in the coming weeks being the high of January 2025 and 50% retracement of the entire 5 months decline (26,277-21965)On the downside, 23,000-22,700 would act as strong support being the confluence of the recent breakout area and 50% and 61.8% retracement area of the recent up move from 21965-23869.The recent sharp decline of US 10-year yields below 4.2%, Dollar index below 104 and Brent crude staying below $ 75 is positive sign for India’s economy and Equity market.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, NHPC and Symphony are the top stock picks for today.

Prince Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy claims descent from Mughal emperor



Prince Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy’s controversial claims on the Taj Mahal and Ayodhya land



Prince Tucy’s role as caretaker of Aurangzeb’s grave

India's monarchical dynasties, once ruling large portions of the subcontinent, were in effect eradicated with the nation's declaration as a republic in 1947. With India's independence, the monarchy system was abolished de jure and democracy was in the spotlight. Even though royal rule has ceased, numerous offspring of these previously influential families remain living in India, profiting from a blood relationship with their vaunted forbears and, in numerous instances, claiming ownership of their ancestors' properties and lands. Among them are influential members like Maharani Rajikaraje Gaekwad and Princess Diya Kumari of Rajasthan, influential individuals from the royal circle living in India.One such person creating ripples in the royal world is Prince Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy, who alleges being a descendant of the Mughal emperors. The prince has stepped into the limelight announcing himself as the sixth-generation heir of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last emperor of the Mughals, which connects his lineage to great Mughal emperors like Aurangzeb, Shah Jahan, and Akbar. Prince Tucy has been in the news for claiming rights to some of India's most important symbols of Mughal heritage, such as the Taj Mahal and the problematic Ayodhya Ram Mandir site.Currently, he lives in Hyderabad and is the Mutawalli and caretaker of Aurangzeb’s grave.Prince Tucy's most notorious claim till date has been the one for owning the Taj Mahal, India's legendary white marble mausoleum erected by Shah Jahan for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. His claim was made years ago and caused great media attention. To validate his claims, the prince even filed a DNA report before the Hyderabad court, which was reportedly admitted by the court, going to further strengthen his daring claims.Apart from his assertion on the Taj Mahal, the prince was also embroiled in controversy during the Ayodhya Ram Mandir issue. At the center of controversy was land whose ownership belongs to many Hindus since they are sure that Lord Ram was born there, an icon in Hindu religion. Through the controversial argument that was rife at this time, Tucy rose to prominence when he challenged the Wakf board that had previously laid claim on the controversial property. As per the prince, if the property was connected to Babur, the Mughal emperor who had commissioned the building of the Babri Masjid on the land, then he and his family were the legitimate owners of it. He went on to declare that he had no problem if the Ram Temple were to be built on the property, even donating a golden brick for the temple itself along with the whole property in order to make the project feasible.Apart from his purported claims over these heritage sites, Prince Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy is Mutawalli and Caretaker of Aurangzeb's Grave in Maharashtra. He takes charge of looking after the tomb of the controversial Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who ruled much of India in the 17th century. The prince has been outspoken in calling for the protection of this historic monument, especially considering recent vandalism incidents. In one, Tucy petitioned the President of India, asking the government to do something to protect the monument. His petition stated, ""I request the government to take measures to protect the monument/grave of Aurangzeb Alamgeer RH.""Prince Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy's public image is closely linked to his royal Mughal lineage. His fashion sense attests to the heritage, as he is typically dressed in the long, majestic robes and a similar cap that Mughal emperors used to wear. His fashion also supports the persona of a man of royal blood, one who prides himself on his heritage and the history that he comes from. His online profiles often reflect these traditional looks, harkening to the grandeur and gravitas of the Mughal empire.","Prince Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy claims descent from Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar.

"Bharuch horror: Friend chops man into 9 pieces, dresses up as woman to dispose parts over 3 days",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/dismembered-body-college-friend-chopped-victim-into-nine-pieces/articleshow/119916744.cms,"BHARUCH: The discovery of human body parts for three days in a row that had puzzled the Bharuch police was solved with the arrest of the victim Sachin Chauhan's close friend Shailendra Chauhan, who had chopped him into nine pieces.Investigators said the macabre member stemmed from the victim's possession of Shailendra's wife's private photos and a loan that the latter had taken in his name.To mislead police, Shailendra (32) dressed up as a woman, wore a nightgown, covered his face with a dupatta, and used elbow-length gloves to mislead the police. He spent three nights disposing of the body parts at different locations in the Bharuch's Bholav GIDC area.The murder came to light on March 29 when a stray dog dragged a human head out of a drain. Over the next three days, different body parts, including a torso and hands, were found at various locations, prompting a frantic investigation by the police.The brutality of the crime and the deliberate method of disposal pointed to a well-planned act.Forensic analysis of the remains revaled tattoos on the hand and evidence of dental treatment that led investigators to identify the victim as Sachin Chauhan. His family had already reported him missing, and suspicion quickly turned to his Shailendra, who had also disappeared.Using human and technical intelligence, the police traced Shailendra's movements across Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, finally nabbing him in Bijnor. During interrogation, he confessed to the gruesome murder.Sachin and Shailendra were close friends since their college days. They did BSc from Bijnor and even knew each other's mobile passwords and debit card PINs.""Sachin had transferred private photos of Shailendra's wife from his mobile and had allegedly used them to extort money from him. Adding to the tension, Shailendra had taken a Rs 4 lakh loan in Sachin's name, which became another reason for bitter conflict,"" said CK Patel, deputy superintendent of police, Bharuch.On March 24, Shailendra invited Sachin home for a party. After Sachin fell asleep, Shailendra tried to delete the compromising photos from his phone. When Sachin woke up and resisted, the argument broke out, ending with Shailendra slitting his throat with a kitchen knife.In a desperate attempt to erase all traces of the crime, he purchased a saw, plastic bags, and a woman's outfit. Over the next three nights, he cut the body into nine pieces and, dressed in a gown, used Sachin's scooter to discreetly dispose of the remains at different locations.To mislead the police, Shailendra used Sachin's phone to send messages to his family, pretending to be in Bengaluru. He withdrew money from Sachin's bank account and left his ATM card on a train to create a false trail. While the murder has been officially linked to blackmail and financial disputes, investigators are also probing whether an affair between Sachin and Shailendra's wife played a role.Meanwhile, police are still searching for Sachin's missing legs.","Shailendra Chauhan, 32, chopped up his friend Sachin Chauhan into nine pieces.

Trump says next taxes a “declaration of economic independence”

The technology sector suffered particularly heavy losses due to the newly-imposed substantial reciprocal tariffs by US President Donald Trump with Magnificent Seven – Apple , Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, Nvidia and Facebook parent Meta – hit the most, a report has said.According to news agency Reuters, about $760 billion in market capitalisation was lost by these companies cumulatively within hours of the trading session's close, with Apple among the hardest-hit.Apple led a significant downturn among major technology companies, plunging nearly 6% in extended trading. Should Apple's after-hours losses carry through to Thursday's regular trading session, it would mark the company's most severe single-day decline since September 2020, CNBC said.The iPhone maker, whose revenue predominantly relies on devices manufactured in China and several other Asian countries, faced the most substantial decline. Manufacturing hubs in China and Taiwan faced tariffs exceeding 30%, resulting in a staggering total tariff of 54% on imports from China.Nvidia shares dropped approximately 4% amid concerns about its Taiwan-based chip manufacturing and Mexico-assembled AI systems. Tesla also suffered, with its stock falling 4.5% in after-hours activity. The selloff extended across other technology giants, with Alphabet, Amazon and Meta experiencing declines between 2.5% and 5%. Microsoft showed more resilience but still fell by almost 2%.Trump said the new tariffs on imported goods will be a “declaration of economic independence” for the US. He announced a 10% blanket tariff on all imports, and higher duties for specific countries based on what tariffs they charge on US exports, Trump highlighted.“We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers. Ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers,” Trump said.","Magnificent Seven – Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, Nvidia and Facebook parent Meta – hit the most.

BENGALURU: Contrary to IMD's forecast of surplus pre-monsoon showers in Bengaluru and adjoining districts of south-interior Karnataka, the city ended March with a prolonged dry spell and deficit rainfall.In fact, Bengaluru saw a rainfall deficit of 2.9mm. However, unlike the harsh 2024 during which the city saw near-record temperatures, mercury levels were on par with the average mark.Officials at IMD, Bengaluru, said they are pinning hopes on April and May, which are likely to bring in 30-40% excess pre-monsoon rain over the city.CS Patil, scientist at IMD Bengaluru, said on average, the city receives 14.5 mm to 20 mm rainfall during March, which is the first month of pre-monsoon showers during summer. However, both the city and HAL observatory of IMD fell short of average rain with only isolated showers. But northern parts of the city towards Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) received 4cm of rainfall.Witnessing the early onset of summer, both Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka were issued a heat-wave alert in the first weeks of March. While mercury soared over 40 degrees Celsius in coastal areas, it hovered between 35 degrees and 36 degrees Celsius in and around Bengaluru, according to IMD scientists.""Yet, the situation was not as bad as it was in 2024 summer when Bengaluru recorded 36.6 degrees Celsius. On the rain front, even though Bengaluru continued its tryst with deficit figures for the third consecutive month since Jan 2025, we hope the city will get good rain in April and May,"" Patil said.As against average rainfall of 14.7mm for March, Bengaluru city received 11.8mm. This was even less in eastern parts, with HAL recording only 9.3mm as against 12.5mm average rainfall.Balancing the soaring temperature, IMD hinted at possible thunderstorms over Bengaluru over the next three days. Pointing towards an infusion of easterly-westerly trough over peninsular India, IMD officials said this could result in thundershowers and strong gusty winds accompanied by lightning.""The conditions will be favourable for thundershowers from Thursday till Sunday in and around Bengaluru,"" Patil said.","Bengaluru ended March with a prolonged dry spell and deficit rainfall.

GURGAON: The district administration has approved the town and country planning department's plan for demolition of illegal constructions and sealing of commercial setups in 2,100 housing units across DLF phases 1 to 5.While 4,500 properties had been identified for violations earlier, 2,100 units now face demolition and sealing drive that is set to begin from April 4, following orders from Punjab and Haryana high court.The HC had issued directives on Feb 13, following which an enforcement team survey identified over 4,500 properties violating building regulations.Property owners were served show-cause notices and given seven days to respond. Those who failed to provide a satisfactory explanation are now facing strict action.The operation is being conducted under the Haryana Urban Development Act and Haryana Building Code regulations.The department of town and country planning (DTP) enforcement team has finalised the action plan to target illegal constructions and unauthorised commercial activities. To ensure smooth execution, four teams have been formed and duty magistrates have been appointed for supervision.Additionally, a heavy police force will be deployed to prevent any untoward incidents during the operation. Senior DTP officials and the Gurgaon administration will oversee the crackdown.This action is expected to significantly impact thousands of homeowners in these premium residential areas.Town and country planner (enforcement) Amit Madholia said restoration orders have been issued against more than 2,100 properties, and recommendations have been sent to DTP for cancelling their occupation certificates (OC) and disconnecting electricity, water and sewer connections. The on-ground demolition and sealing process will commence from April 4.The authorities have taken all necessary precautions, with the police and municipal teams on high alert. Any attempt to obstruct the demolition or sealing process will lead to an FIR against the property owner.Panic has gripped residents, particularly in the economically weaker section (EWS) blocks of DLF 3's U-Block. In a desperate attempt to escape action, many homeowners have built brick walls in front of illegal shops operating on the ground floors of their properties.For years, commercial activities have flourished in these 60-square-yard houses, with many homeowners renting out spaces for shops, paying guest (PG) accommodations and guest houses. However, following the HC directive and the upcoming crackdown, these businesses have shut down, leaving once-busy streets eerily empty.Local sources confirm that the enforcement department is already aware of these last-minute walls and is planning its next course of action. Officials are closely monitoring the situation to ensure violators do not evade legal consequences.The violations in U-Block are among the most severe, with some buildings illegally extended up to seven or eight floors, far beyond permissible limits. The conversion of residential spaces into commercial hubs has been a longstanding issue, but the upcoming crackdown is expected to bring stricter enforcement.While some homeowners believe they can avoid demolition with makeshift modifications, authorities have warned that any tampering with the sealing process will lead to legal action, including FIRs. With heavy police deployment planned, any resistance to enforcement may result in strict penalties.","The district administration has approved the town and country planning department's plan for demolition of illegal constructions and sealing of commercial setups. 4,500 properties had been identified for violations earlier, 2,100 units now face demolition and sealing drive that is set to begin from April 4.

PUNE: Jayesh Koloti, a resident of Wanowrie, booked an autorickshaw last week via Uber platform to travel to Pune airport.""The fare on the platform showed Rs 220. After I boarded the auto, the driver started the meter, which generally doesn't happen when one books a ride on aggregator platforms. Once I reached my destination, the auto driver told me to pay the meter fare, which was Rs 260. I was taken aback, and he told me that regulations had changed,"" Koloti said.With Uber having changed its regulations pertaining to autorickshaw rides from its platform, several commuters are confused and hassled. According to the new regulations, which came into effect in March this year, the auto fare to a destination reflected on the platform of Uber would only be suggestive, and the commuter and the auto driver must decide on the final fare. Further, Uber said it won't charge auto drivers any commission, and the fare should be paid to the driver via cash or UPI.An Uber spokesperson told TOI that the autorickshaw rides via the platform shifted to a new service model called Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). ""Given the industry's shift towards subscription-based model for drivers, we have decided to align our approach accordingly so as not to be at a competitive disadvantage,"" an Uber spokesperson said, adding that the same model had not been implemented yet for cabs.A spokesperson for ride-haling platform Ola, however, said that the drivers on its platform are expected to charge customers the fares shown on the app. ""There is no change in our policy yet,"" the spokesperson said.Vinay Pawar, who booked a ride on Uber app to travel from Vimannagar to Shivajinagar Metro station, said the auto driver refused to accept the fare of Rs 170 shown on the ride-hailing platform. He also refused to go by the meter. ""the driver quoted a fare of Rs 350, citing new regulations. When I requested him to go by the meter, he refused and told me to cancel the ride, which led to an argument,"" he said.Udayan Tajani, a resident of Koregaon Park, said the RTO-approved fares needed to be synced with Uber platform. ""The only advantage of booking rides on aggregator platforms is that one does not have to hunt for autorickshaws. Last week, I travelled from Koregaon Park to Kalyaninagar in Uber auto. Though the fare on the Uber platform showed Rs 60, the driver demanded Rs 140. Auto drivers in general don't want to confirm shorter trips. I was forced to pay the money as I was in a hurry,"" Tajani, a working professional, said.""Recently, I booked an auto on Uber platform to travel from Pune railway station to Lullanagar. The fare shown on the platform was Rs 100. However, once I boarded the auto, the driver told me to pay Rs 250. When I requested him to go by the meter, he refused to do so, citing the new change in regulations. Auto drivers have been fleecing customers for a long time, but no action is taken against them. It is time that RTO should step in,"" said Sathish Jaikar, a bank employee.Autorickshaw unions said they are aware of the situation. ""We have started a campaign and requested all autorickshaw drivers to go by the meter and not fleece customers. In many of the autos, information about changed Uber policy has been put up so that passengers know about the changed rules,"" Keshav Kshirsagar, president, Baghtoy Rickshawala union, told TOI.Attempts to contact Pune RTO officials failed to elicit any response.","Uber's new autorickshaw service model has caused confusion among Pune commuters.

Waqf showdown: Rijiju slams INDIA bloc, Congress hits back



Cash-rich Waqf board but Muslims remained poor in India: Rijiju in LS

""You tried to mislead people on issues which are not part of Waqf Bill,"" said minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju to the opposition in LS.

""A case ongoing since 1970 in Delhi involved several properties, including the CGO Complex and the Parliament building. The Delhi Waqf Board had claimed these as Waqf properties. The case was in court, but at that time, the UPA government denotified 123 properties and handed them over to the Waqf Board. If we had not introduced this amendment today, even the Parliament building we are sitting in could have been claimed as Waqf property. If PM Modi Govt did not come into power, several properties would have been de-notified,"" he said after introducing the bill.

""In 2013, right before Lok Sabha elections in 2014, there were some steps taken which will raise questions in your mind. In 2013, the act was changed to allow Sikhs, Hindus, Parsis and others to create Waqf. Everyone knows Waqf is for Muslims to create Waqf in the name of Allah. This change was made by Congress in 2013. Congress made the boards specifics, only Shias in Shia boards...A section was added that Waqf will have an overriding effect over every other law. How can this section be acceptable?"" he added.

""Changes made in Waqf law by UPA govt gave it overriding effect over other statutes, hence, new amendments were required,"" he said.

""This bill, which we are discussing, is not new. The history of this bill dates back to pre-Independence in 1913 when the 'Mussalman Waqf Validating Act' was passed. Later, in 1923, the 'Mussalman Waqf Act' was brought in, which accounting and transparency were in focus. After Independence, in 1954, Waqf Act was incorporated. State Waqf Board was included in this Waqf Act, 1954,"" he added.

""Waqf property private in nature, unfair to compare it with land banks of Railways, armed forces,"" Rijiju asserted.

""Waqf Bill to be renamed as Unified Waqf Management Empowerment, Efficiency and Development (UMEED) Bill,"" he announced.

""Now Shia, Sunni, Bohra, backward Muslims, women, and expert Non-Muslims will also be there in Waqf Board. Let me elaborate in detail. I'll give my own example. Suppose I am not a Muslim but I am minority affairs minister. Then I become Chairman of the Central Waqf Council. Despite my position, there can be a maximum of 4 Non-Muslim members in the Council, and among them, 2 women members are compulsory,"" he said.

""The provisions of the Waqf Board have nothing to do with the management of any mosque, temple, or religious site. It is simply a matter of property management. However, Waqf properties are managed by the Waqf Board and the Mutawalli. If someone fails to understand this basic distinction or deliberately chooses not to, then I have no solution for that,"" he asserted.

""There were some anomalies in this bill, so it was necessary to amend it. I had mentioned earlier that any any Indian could create a Waqf, but this was not the case in 1995. In 2013, you made changes, and now we have reinstated the 1995 provision, ensuring that only someone who has practiced Islam for a minimum of five years can create a Waqf,"" he said.

""The railway tracks, stations, and infrastructure belong to the nation, not just to Indian Railways. How can we equate railway property with Waqf property? Similarly, defence land, the second-largest landholder, is meant for national security and military training. How can that be compared to Waqf land? A lot of Waqf properties are private properties. That is why India has the largest amount of Waqf property in the world,"" he said.

""Cash-rich Waqf board but Muslims remained poor in India,"" Kiren Rijiju said in Lok Sabha.

""When our country has the largest Waqf property in the world, why hasn't it been used for the education, medical treatment, skill development, and income generation of poor Muslims? Why has no progress been made in this regard so far? If this government, under the leadership of PM Modi, is working for the betterment of poor Muslims, then why is there an objection?,"" he asked.

""On our own WAMSI portal, we have reviewed the records. The Sachar Committee, which was formed in 2006 has also provided detailed information on this matter. In 2006, there were 4.9 lakh Waqf properties, and the total income from them was Rs 163 crore and after making changes in 2013, the income has income Rs 166 crores,"" he continued.

""Today, the total Waqf property has increased from 4.9 lakh to 8.72 lakh in our country. If these 8.72 lakh Waqf properties were managed properly, it would not only improved the lives of Muslims but also transform the destiny of the entire country,"" Rijiju told the parliament.

Kumbh, national president jibes by Akhilesh Yadav

NEW DELHI: The BJP-led central government tabled the Waqf (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on Wednesday amid opposition from INDIA bloc . The bill incorporates suggestions made by the Joint Parliamentary Committee that examined it. The House also took up the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2024, for consideration and passing.Rijiju during his arguments in the House said that the Waqf Bill have been renamed as the Unified Waqf Management Empowerment, Efficiency and Development (UMEED) Bill.""The Waqf (Amendment) Bill that we have introduced includes several recommendations from the JPC, which we have accepted and incorporated into this bill. It is wrong to say that recommendations from JPC has not been incorporated in this bill. One very important aspect of this bill is the new structured system. Waqf Bill has been renamed as the Unified Waqf Management Empowerment, Efficiency and Development (UMEED) Bill. This will give rise to a sense of hope,"" he said.Amidst a big showdown, Union minister Kiren Rijiju introduced the bill in the Lok Sabha and defended the proposed reforms. He questioned the criticism, saying, ""Why are we being challenged when we are introducing positive changes? Those who have no direct involvement in the bill are being misled and provoked.""The debate on the bill began with Congress leader KC Venugopal, who opposed the bill, saying that the Centre was ""bulldozing the legislation"".""This type of bill ( Waqf Amendment Bill ) that you are bringing into the House, at least the members has to have the power to give amendments. You are bulldozing the legislation. This is this type of legislation. You need to give time for amendment. There are several provisions to be given amendment. There is no time at all,"" he said.To this, Union minister and senior BJP leader Amit Shah dismissed the opposition to the bill, saying, ""It was your (opposition) insistence that a Joint Parliamentary Committee should be formed. We do not have a committee like the Congress. We have a democratic committee, which brainstorms,"" he said.. Our committee discusses, deliberates on the basis of discussions and makes changes. If the changes are not to be accepted, then what is the point of the committee?"" he added.Meanwhile, Speaker Om Birla assured that amendments from both government and opposition received balanced consideration from him.When RSP representative NK Premachandran raised procedural concerns, Home minister Amit Shah clarified that the union cabinet had approved the amendments within the bill, which stemmed from the JPC report. He concluded, ""There is no point of order.""The proceedings continued with staunch reply from Rijiju to opposition. He highlighted that the JPC's consultation process was the largest ever exercise carried out by a parliamentary panel in India's democratic history.He reported that the JPC received and reviewed more than 97.27 lakh submissions, including petitions and memorandums, through both physical and online formats before completing their report.The minister noted that 284 delegations presented their perspectives on the bill, alongside Waqf boards from 25 states and Union Territories.He mentioned that distinguished legal luminaries, charitable organisations, academicians and religious leaders, among others had also contributed their views.Deputy leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi opened the argument on behalf of the Congress during the debate after Rijiju tabled the bill. He alleged that Waqf bill is a deliberate effort to dilute the Constitution.He accused Rijiju of misleading the House while referencing the UPA government’s actions in 2013 during his speech.""This bill is not just about administrative changes; it is a deliberate effort to dilute the Constitution, defame minority communities, divide Indian society, and ultimately disenfranchise minorities,"" Gogoi said.""Did the Minority Affairs Ministry make this bill, or did some other department make it? Where did this Bill come from?... Today, the condition of minorities in the country has become such that today, the government will have to give a certificate of their religion... Will they ask for a certificate from other religions whether you have completed five years or not? Why is this being asked in this bill? Why is the government interfering in this matter of religion,"" Gogoi asked.BJP MP Prasad described the Waqf as merely a statutory body and questioned its contributions to public welfare.""The Waqf Board is simply a statutory entity. How many schools and hospitals have been built on its properties?"" he asked, challenging its role in serving the community.Samajwadi Party chief and MP Akhilesh Yadav, during his argument over the Waqf bill, took a jibe at BJP that triggered a political tussle with a tinge of humor. He said, ""The party that calls itself the world's largest party has not yet been able to choose its national president.""Replying to him, Union minister Amit Shah sarcastically said, ""All the parties in front of me, their national president, will be chosen by only some family members. We have to choose from 12-13 crore members after a process. So it takes time. In your case, it will not take much time. I am saying that you will remain president for 25 years.""He alleged that the controversial Waqf (Amendment) Bill was introduced by BJP to divert attention from the failures of the current government.""This Bill has been brought not for reforms, but to cover up the shortcomings and failures of this regime,"" he said accusing BJP of using legislation as a political tool.","Waqf Amendment Bill tabled in Lok Sabha amid opposition.
