NEW DELHI: India is learnt to have tested a nuclear-capable submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), designed for a strike range of 3,500-km, from the newly commissioned nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat on Wednesday, reports Rajat Pandit.There was, however, no official word on the missile test that took place off Visakhapatnam in the Bay of Bengal in the morning. Sources said it was the solid-fuelled K-4 missile that was tested from the 6,000-tonne INS Arighaat. The K-4 has so far only been tested from submersible pontoons over the last several years.A detailed analysis of Wednesday's test results will show whether the missile firing was actually a success and met the laid down trial objectives and parameters, the sources added.A few days ago, India had issued a public area warning and notice to airmen (NOTAM) for an intermediate range missile test over a 3,490-km flight corridor in the Bay of Bengal between Nov 27 and 30.INS Arighaat, the country's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBN in naval parlance), was commissioned on Aug 29. The submarine can carry K-4 missiles, unlike her forerunner INS Arihant armed only with 750-km range K-15 missiles.India plans to induct the third SSBN, with a displacement of 7,000-tonne, as INS Aridhaman early next year.","There was, however, no official word on the missile test that took place off Visakhapatnam in the Bay of Bengal in the morning.

We don’t want one issue to disrupt Parliament. We must hold this government accountable for its multiple failures,” Dastidar said“We will take on the BJP, but our approach to doing so can be strategically different,” she added.The development comes in the wake of the TMC skipping an INDIA bloc meeting on Monday, where the alliance decided to demand a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the Adani Group issues. The TMC also missed an opposition meeting on Wednesday aimed at discussing key matters for the ongoing session.Central funding issues, including the halting of Mngrega funds for West Bengal, remain the TMC's top priority, alongside concerns over price rise, unemployment, and fertilizer shortages, according to party sources cited by PTI.Despite being members of the INDIA bloc, the relationship between the TMC and Congress has often seen rough patches. From the TMC contesting Lok Sabha elections independently to disagreeing on seat sharing, the differences between the two parties have come up often, particularly after Congress's losses in Haryana and Maharashtra.After Congress’s unexpected defeat in Haryana in October, rift is at the forefront with several INDIA bloc partners, including AAP and Shiv Sena (UBT), hitting out at the party for ""arrogance"" and not keeping regional allies in the loop. ""Congress could not capitalise despite a favorable situation,"" Shiv Sena (UBT) had said after election results.""The biggest lesson here is to avoid overconfidence in elections,"" Arvind Kejriwal had said hitting out at Congress.Similarly, following Congress’s disappointing performance in Maharashtra, the TMC called for introspection and even suggested Mamata Banerjee as a potential leader for the INDIA bloc.""The Congress has failed to achieve the desired result either in Haryana or in Maharashtra.

'Defeats social ethos of reservation': Supreme Court upholds Madras HC decision over religious conversion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/defeats-social-ethos-of-reservation-supreme-court-upholds-madras-hc-decision-over-religious-conversion/articleshow/115725610.cms,"Supreme Court of India

Conversion for benefits 'undermines reservation policy'



'Fraud on the Constitution'



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has ruled that religious conversions undertaken purely to avail reservation benefits without genuine belief amount to a ""fraud on the Constitution."" The verdict, delivered by a bench comprising Justices Pankaj Mithal and R Mahadevan on Tuesday, upheld a Madras high court decision denying a scheduled caste (SC) certificate to a woman who converted to Christianity but later claimed to be a Hindu to avail quota benefits for securing employment.The case was filed by C Selvarani, who was born to a Hindu father and a Christian mother, and baptised as a Christian shortly after birth. Selvarani applied for an upper-division clerk position in Puducherry in 2015, seeking an SC certificate on the basis of her father's Valluvan caste, which is classified under scheduled castes.However, evidence presented to the court indicated that she regularly practiced Christianity and attended church services, sabotaging her claim of identifying as a Hindu.Justice Mahadevan, writing the 21-page verdict for the bench, pointed out that conversion to a religion must be inspired by its principles and tenets.""However, if the purpose of conversion is largely to derive the benefits of reservation but not with any actual belief in the other religion, the same cannot be permitted, as the extension of benefits of reservation to people with such ulterior motives will only defeat the social ethos of the policy of reservation,"" he noted.The top court highlighted that individuals who convert to Christianity lose their caste identity and must provide substantial evidence of reconversion and acceptance by their original caste community to reclaim SC status. In Selvarani's case, the bench found no credible proof of reconversion to Hinduism, such as public declarations, ceremonies, or documentation. On the contrary, her continued adherence to Christian practices invalidated her claim.The bench ruled that Selvarani’s claim to identify as a Hindu solely to access SC reservation benefits while actively practicing Christianity was untenable. The court held that granting her SC status would violate the spirit of reservation policies aimed at uplifting marginalised communities and ""would go against the very object of reservation and would amount to fraud on the Constitution"".""One converts to a different religion when genuinely inspired by its principles. Conversion purely for reservation benefits, devoid of belief, is impermissible,"" the bench added.The apex court also dismissed Selvarani's argument that her caste identity was merely in ""eclipse"" during her conversion to Christianity and would automatically resume upon reconversion to Hinduism.The judgment mentioned that such resumption requires clear and verifiable evidence of reconversion, which was absent in her case.""As the factum of reconversion is disputed, there must be more than a mere claim. The conversion had not happened by any ceremony or through 'Arya Samaj'. No public declaration was effected. There is nothing on record to show that she or her family has reconverted to Hinduism and on the contrary, there is a factual finding that the appellant still professes Christianity,"" it said.","Supreme Court rules that religious conversions undertaken purely to avail reservation benefits without genuine belief amount to a ""fraud on the Constitution"" The verdict was delivered by a bench comprising Justices Pankaj Mithal and R Mahadevan on Tuesday.

Waqf JPC panel chief agrees for tenure extension after showdown by opposition members,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/entire-proceeding-is-a-mockery-opposition-storms-out-of-waqf-committee-meeting-after-calls-for-extension/articleshow/115734509.cms,"NEW DELHI: The chairman of the parliamentary committee examining the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, Jagdambika Pal , on Wednesday said that the panel unanimously agreed on the need to extend its tenure to address unresolved issues. This came after opposition members walked out of the meeting, accusing the proceedings of becoming a ""mockery.""""We still have to invite and listen to other stakeholders and state officials from six states where there are disputes between Waqf and state governments, and regarding 123 properties, there is a dispute between Government of India, Urban Ministry and Waqf Board.

They demanded an extension for more comprehensive discussions.Gogoi said after the walkout that Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla had previously indicated that the committee might be granted an extension. However, he alleged that the chairman appeared to be under pressure from a senior government minister to push through the proceedings by the November 29 deadline.TMC leader Kalyan Banerjee also voiced his concerns, claiming that the chairman had failed to engage with opposition members or invite key witnesses. ""The entire proceeding is a mockery,"" Banerjee said.YSR Congress MP Vijay Sai Reddy said that several state Waqf boards and stakeholders had not yet been heard, making it impossible for the committee to complete its work by the stipulated deadline.The opposition members, after walking out of the meeting, had reiterated their demand for an extension, insisting that the JPC must allow for more time to ensure a thorough and balanced review of the proposed amendments.The meeting, which was also attended by senior officials from the ministry of minority affairs, was to discuss the amendments to the Waqf Bill and adopt or reject them based on the committee’s findings.","Committee member and BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi confirmed that the panel would request Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to extend the deadline for submitting its report.

Three of the four constituent indicators (stunting, wasting and child mortality) are related to health of children and cannot be taken to reflect hunger in the population.""There has been an ""improvement in India's rank in 2024 compared to 2023, which is mainly attributable to improvement in the fourth constituent indicator, namely prevalence of undernourishment (PoU), of the index"", she said.

SC frowns upon Delhi court asking ED not to oppose bail if agency delays trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-frowns-upon-delhi-court-asking-ed-not-to-oppose-bail-if-agency-delays-trial/articleshow/115746277.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday disapproved of an order passed by a Delhi trial court asking the Enforcement Directorate director to instruct its counsel not to oppose the bail plea of an accused in a case where trial was delayed because of the agency and asked ED to place the order on record.The apex court called the order ""drastic"".The trial court passed the order earlier in the day while granting bail to an accused in the Delhi Waqf Board money laundering case in which AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan is the main accused.Within hours, additional solicitor general S V Raju brought the matter to the apex court's notice while it was hearing the bail plea of another accused in the same case.Raju told the bench that the presiding judge of the trial court had said in the open court that ""he would teach a lesson to ED"".Taking note of the direction given to the ED director not to oppose bail pleas, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih said, ""This is very drastic.""The justices asked Raju to place on record the Delhi court's order and said they would examine it. As the money laundering case is pending in Supreme Court, the bench said it would take cognisance of the trial court's order.The Supreme Court has held in various rulings that delay in trial and long incarceration of accused persons could be ground to grant bail in money laundering cases. Accordingly, trial courts have started giving bail to accused which was earlier denied because of stringent bail conditions under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.Earlier in the day, the trial court rejected Enforcement Directorate's contention that a lower court could not grant bail to an accused in the waqf board money laundering case on the ground of delay in trial and long incarceration. The court told the ED director to issue ""appropriate instructions"" to the special public prosecutors representing the agency. Special judge Jitendra Singh instructed ED not to oppose the bail plea where the delay in trial was due to the agency's conduct.The court then granted bail to Kausar Imam Siddiqui, stating that there was not even the remotest possibility of the trial concluding soon.Siddiqui had moved for bail citing long incarceration and also seeking parity with another accused who had got bail on the same grounds from the high court on Nov 13.The agency had opposed the bail to Siddiqui.Rejecting the ED's plea, the trial court said that it was bound to follow the apex court's ruling and it was its duty bound to protect and enforce constitutional rights.The court said the right to a speedy trial was one of the most important facets of Article 21, and it lay in the exclusive domain of trial courts. All courts, including the trial courts, are mandated to adhere to, protect and enforce constitutional rights and constitutionalism per se, the lower court said. ""In fact, duty is cast upon the trial court to see that the constitutional rights of individuals are not violated,"" the court said.The court also noted that Siddiqui was in judicial custody since Nov 24, 2023.Referring to the case of Manish Sisodia and various others, the court added that if a person accused under PMLA was incarcerated for too long without the remote possibility of trial concluding soon, he may be released on bail, even if the twin conditions in Section 45 (1) of the PMLA are not met.According to Section 45 of the PMLA, bail can be granted to an accused in a money laundering case only if twin conditions are satisfied.First, there should be prima facie satisfaction that the accused has not committed the offence. Second, that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.The allegation against Siddiqui is that he acted as a middleman on behalf of Amanatullah Khan for the purchase of property in Jamia Nagar in which the proceeds of crime were used.The judge added that the ED had an opportunity to admit its responsibility but had opted to oppose the bail with full vigour and vehemence, which was nothing short of defiance of the mandate of the Supreme Court.","A Delhi trial court asked the Enforcement Directorate director to instruct its counsel not to oppose the bail plea of an accused in a case where trial was delayed because of the agency.

NEW DELHI: Parliament failed to transact any significant business on the third day of the winter session on Wednesday due to protests and sloganeering by opposition members who demanded discussions on different issues, including allegations of irregularities against Adani Group and violence in Sambhal and Manipur, in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. Both the Houses were adjourned once in the morning and later for the day amid continuing uproar.The Lower House could not transact any business except taking up one question during Question Hour amid the din and laying a few official papers and approving a couple of routine motions. At one point, opposition members trooped into the well of the LS raising slogans.The furore in the Upper House started after Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar rejected 18 notices under a rule to suspend scheduled business to take up issues. It first resulted in a brief adjournment.Only Congress members demanded a discussion under Rule 267 after suspension of House business, on setting up a joint parliamentary committee to probe allegations against Adani Group, while other opposition parties gave similar notices on different issues, including on violence in Manipur and UP's Sambhal. AAP MP Sanjay Singh wanted a discussion on rising crime in Delhi.Since the ruckus continued in the House after it reassembled at 11.30am, the Chairman adjourned the proceedings for the day, saying the ""House is not in order"".Meanwhile, in the business advisory committee, leader of Upper House, J P Nadda, and Dhankhar agreed to have a two-day special debate on the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution.",Both the Houses were adjourned once in the morning and later for the day amid continuing uproar.

ED raises issue of 'non-cooperation and delaying tactics' by accused during trials

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would direct persons accused under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to give an undertaking that they would not seek adjournments as a condition to grant them bail, in order to ensure they do not misuse the liberty by resorting to delaying tactics in trial proceedings by seeking repeated adjournments, reports Amit Anand Choudhary.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih said a balance has to be maintained between the interests of the accused and the prosecuting agency and to prevent delay in trial which is itself a ground for granting bail.The order which will have a bearing on PMLA cases involving politicians and high-profile figures facing money laundering charges was welcomed by officials in the ED, which has complained that influential accused have been hindering trial by seeking repeated adjournments.The bench was hearing a bail plea of Zeeshan Haider, who is one of the accused in the Delhi Waqf money laundering case, which has AAP leader Amanatullah Khan as the main accused. Justices Oka and Masih directed Haider to first give personal undertaking that he would not seek any adjournment when the case is taken up by trial court for framing of charges and in subsequent proceedings.Senior advocate Vikram Chaudhri, appearing for the accused, told the bench that his client had been in custody for more than a year and trial had not yet been initiated. Invoking the apex court's ruling that delay in trial and long incarceration could be a ground for granting bail in money laundering cases, he submitted that Haider should also be released on that ground.The bench indicated that it was in favour of granting him bail but said that he had to first give personal undertaking and had to file an affidavit stating on oath that he would not seek adjournment in trial proceedings. It posted the case for hearing to Dec 3 and directed him to file undertaking before it.As accused are now being granted bail more frequently after the apex court's various rulings, the ED has raised the issue of non-cooperation and delaying tactics by the accused in trial proceedings. Addressing the agency's concerns, the court said an undertaking by the accused could go a long way in ensuring speedy and timely completion of trial.Earlier, the court had expressed concern over the way in which the PMLA law is being implemented and made it clear that any high handedness in action against the accused in violation of the fundamental rights would not be allowed and reminded the agency that the accused also have right to liberty. ""They (ED officers) should remember that there is something called Article 21 in the country (which guarantees right to life and liberty),"" it had observed.The Rouse Avenue Court in Delhi had earlier granted bail to AAP MLA Khan, chairman of Delhi Waqf Board, in the money laundering case and declined to take cognisance of the ED's supplementary chargesheet, stating that the necessary sanction to prosecute him was not obtained.","The order will have a bearing on PMLA cases involving politicians and high- profile figures facing money laundering charges.

Railway safety commissioner flags lapses new Pamban Bridge while giving nod for train operation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/railway-safety-commissioner-flags-lapses-new-pamban-bridge-while-giving-nod-for-train-operation/articleshow/115744135.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), South Circle, has pointed out several lapses in the planning and construction of the new Pamban Bridge between Mandapam and Pamban stations in Tamil Nadu, while giving nod to allow movement of passenger and freight trains on the section. It has, however, imposed specific “stipulations” that must be complied with before commencing train operation .CRS clearance is mandatory for commercial operation of any railway line. The new bridge — just over two-km-long — will replace the existing bridge, which was opened in 1914.In his letter to the Southern Railway, South Circle CRS, A M Chowdhary, said while the construction of the previous bridge is regarded a technical marvel, considering the much lesser availability of technology 100 years back, “I am constrained to point out that, in stark contrast, the present bridge sets a bad example of constructing an important structure, with glaring lapses from the planning stage to execution”.The letter, dated Nov 26, has also ticked off the Railway Board by saying, “It is unfortunate that the Railway Board has been flouting its own guidelines” by dissociating RDSO (railways standards organisation) from the project. It has pointed out that the lift span girder was designed using non-standard codes, bypassing RDSO norms. The letter has also flagged violations, ranging from non-standard design approaches to substandard welding techniques, which could reduce the stress-carrying capacity of the bridge by 36%.The Southern Railways is hopeful of opening the bridge for commercial operation in the next two weeks. A spokesperson of the Indian Railways Southern Zone said, “Authorization given by CRS-SBC for traffic of goods and passenger trains with some observations... will be adhered to by the Southern Railway as mentioned in the CRS letter.”As per the letter, during the speed trial the new bridge sustained speeds of up to 80 kmph. However, CRS has allowed a maximum sectional speed of 75 kmph. The railway safety regulator has asked the South Zone to “rectify deficiencies” before starting commercial services and intimate it.","The Pamban Bridge between Mandapam and Pamban stations in Tamil Nadu will replace the existing bridge, which was opened in 1914.

NEW DELHI: Pointing to the “delay”in land acquisition holding up execution of four critical projects in Kerala, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Wednesday urged chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to expedite the process. So far less than 15% of the land has been acquired despite the Centre making a payment of over Rs 2,100 crore to the state for this purpose.The four projects are doubling of Thiruvananthapuram-Kanyakumari, Ernakulam-Kumbalam and Kumbalam-Turavur, and a new line from Angamali to Sabarimala. Vaishnaw, in a letter addressed to Vijayan, said that railway projects worth Rs 12,350 crore are in progress in the state.“However, most of the railway projects in Kerala are not progressing due to non availability of requisite land. Railways had initiated efforts for acquisition of land for most of the sanctioned projects but could not succeed in acquiring land,” Vaishnaw wrote. He added that against the required 470 hectares for these projects, only 64 hectares has been acquired so far.The minister wrote, “Support of the Govt of Kerala is essentially required in the matter.” He urged the CM to issue instructions for expediting land acquisition.The Kerala govt has been blaming the railway ministry for slow down in project execution and also not clearing its flagship Silver Line project in the state.Meanwhile, in a written reply in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, Vaishnaw said there are “many deficiencies in the DPR (detailed project report)” of the Silver Line from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod, which has been identified by Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd (KRDCL), a joint venture company of Kerala govt (51%) and railway ministry (49%).“KRDCL has been advised by Southern Railway to address those deficiencies and prepare revised DPR as per the latest technical standards such as adoption of broad gauge, integration with existing Indian Railways network at suitable points, flatter ruling gradient, speed potential of 160 kpmh, provision of KAVACH, electrification with 2x25 kv, proper drainage scheme for yards and sections, addressing environmental concerns during construction and operation,” the reply mentioned.The project has not been sanctioned yet.","Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw urged chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to expedite the process.

NEW DELHI: Launching a nationwide campaign- "" Bal Vivah Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan "" with the aim to free the country of the menace of child marriage , minister for women and child development Annpurna Devi on Wednesday highlighted that available data shows that about two lakh child marriages were prevented in the past one year.“In our country today, one in every five girls is married before the age of 18. Child marriage is one of the most severe forms of human rights violations and is also a criminal offense under the law,"" Devi said to drive home the need to fight the menace in campaign mode even as she highlighted the progress India has made and contributed significantly to the sharp global decline in child marriage rates observed in South Asia. As per the National Family Health Survey-5 the prevalence of child marriage stands at 23.3% in 2019-21. This was 26.8% in 2015–16 and 47.4% in 2005–06.The minister also urged states to prepare action plans that can contribute to bring down prevalence rates of child marriage to below 5% by 2029. The WCD minister said the nationwide campaign aims to also bring special focus on high burden states and districts and go down to the villages to combat the problem.The minister also launched a national platform - “Child Marriage Free Bharat Portal” where going forward people will be able to register their complaints pertaining to child marriage and these will be directed straight to the concerned child marriage prohibition officer (CMPOs) anywhere in the country.All states have been directed to log-on to the portal and register the CMPOs so that there is real time monitoring of cases. The WCD ministry plans to assign nodal officers at the Centre for monitoring the portal. The minister also said that the “Abhiyan” is not a sporadic one time campaign but an exercise that will continue with the aim to eradicate child marriage.Drawing from NFHS-5 data seven high burden states - West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Tripura, Assam and Andhra Pradesh and nearly 300 districts where prevalence of child marriage is higher than the national average will be in focus under the outreach campaign.""Figures also reveal that nearly 2 lakh child marriages have been prevented in a single year. Additionally, a United Nations report states that the most significant global decline in child marriage rates has been observed in South Asian countries, with India playing a crucial role in this achievement,"" she said drawing from available data and reasearch.The national campaign comes in the backdrop of the Supreme Court judgement of october 18 that has emphasised the need for a “whole of govt and whole of society” approach to combat child marriage and bring a cultural shift. WCD ministry officials said that in pursuance of the visions setout by the SC, the the national campaign seeks to ensure implementation of the Prohibition of the Child Marriage Act 2006 and secure the rights of the girls.","One in every five girls in India is married before the age of 18, says Annpurna Devi.

Two passengers were fully drunk. One went to the washroom and slept off. The other one who was outside had a bag to vomit.

Representing the Centre, Solicitor General Bhati informed the court that an affidavit had been submitted, and guidelines and circulars were issued to address the issue ofunruly passengers .The woman had filed the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in March 2023, stating that she was compelled to approach the Supreme Court due to Air India and the DGCA’s failure to handle her ordeal with adequate care and responsibility.

List of unsold player in IPL mega auction

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn. Notable names like David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, and Kane Williamson , who have been cornerstones in the IPL for years, found themselves without bids.Each had a base price of Rs 2 crore, but despite their immense experience and proven track records, none of them attracted offers. Their absence from the auction table raised questions, particularly given their global stature in T20 cricket. It’s a stark reminder of how the dynamics of the auction can sometimes overshadow established stars in favour of fresh talent.In addition to these marquee international names, other seasoned players like Shardul Thakur Ajinkya Rahane , and Glenn Phillips also went unsold. Rahane, a reliable middle-order batsman, and Thakur, an all-rounder with vast IPL experience, both entered the auction with a base price of Rs 1.5 crore, but failed to secure a contract.Similarly, Phillips, known for his explosive batting and wicketkeeping skills, and Thakur, a consistent bowler, were left out despite being integral parts of their national teams. This reflects the fierce competition in the auction, where franchises appear to be banking on younger, more explosive talent rather than experienced hands.Perhaps the most surprising snub was former U-19 captain Prithvi Shaw , who had once been considered one of India’s brightest young talents. With a modest base price of Rs 75 lakh, Shaw was expected to generate significant interest.However, despite his impressive domestic performances, Shaw failed to attract any buyers. This highlights a growing trend in the IPL, where franchises are increasingly looking for players who can deliver immediate impact, while the burden of expectation weighs heavily on players like Shaw, who have not yet lived up to their early promise.The unsold list also includes several uncapped players, such as Yash Dhull, Kartik Tyagi, and Piyush Chawla, who could have added value to any team. With base prices ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, these players were considered potential investments, but their inability to secure deals underscores the auction's unpredictable nature.As franchises continue to focus on emerging talent from India and abroad, the auction results serve as a reminder that the IPL is not just about star power but also about fitting the right players into the right roles, irrespective of their past achievements.","IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn.

Will my old PAN card become invalid

Why is the government upgrading the PAN system

What about the people holding more than one PAN card

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved the Income Tax Department’s Permanent Account Number (PAN) 2.0 Project. This project aims to streamline and modernise the process of issuing and managing PAN and TAN, making it more user-friendly and efficient. In line with the Budget 2023 announcement, the government has decided to make PAN the ""common business identifier"" for all digital systems of specified govt agencies. Although it is illegal to have more than one PAN, there are several entities and individuals, who violate the law and the government is hoping that once the project is rolled out, it will be easier to check such instances. Currently there is a database of 78 crore PANs and 73.3 lakh TANs in the country. Here's all you need to know about the PAN Card 2.0 .PAN 2.0 is a significant upgrade to India's Permanent Account Number (PAN) system. This initiative aims to modernize the PAN system by introducing a unified digital platform. It will streamline PAN-related services, enhance security, and improve overall taxpayer experience. Currently, PAN-related services are spread across three different platforms: the e-Filing Portal, UTIITSL Portal, and Protean e-Gov Portal. With the implementation of PAN 2.0, all these services will be integrated into a single, unified portal. This one-stop platform will handle comprehensively issues/matters related to PAN and TAN, including application, updates, corrections, Aadhaar-PAN linking, re-issuance requests, and even online PAN validation. By doing so, the Income Tax Department endeavours to simplify processes, eliminate delays, and improve grievance redressal mechanisms.The QR code helps in validating the PAN and PAN details. Incidentally, the QR code is not a new feature. QR codes have been incorporated in the PAN cards since 2017-18. The same will be continued under the PAN 2.0 project with enhancements (dynamic QR code which will display the latest data present in the PAN database). PAN holders having an old PAN Card without QR code have an option to apply for a new card with QR code in existing PAN 1.0 eco-system as well as in the PAN 2.0.On reading through the reader application, complete details, i.e., photo, signature, Name, Father’s Name / Mother’s Name and Date of Birth is displayed.No, you do not need to apply for a new PAN card. Your existing PAN card will remain valid. Your existing PAN card will remain valid under PAN 2.0 project and you will automatically receive an electronic version of the card in your mail ID, without having to apply for it.There are no fees. You can opt to upgrade your PAN card to the new design with a QR code at no additional cost. But those seeking a physical card, however, will have to apply and pay Rs 50 for it if they live within the country.No, your old PAN card will not become invalid unless it is not linked to your Aadhaar number. The absence of a QR code on your PAN card will not affect its validity.The government aims to make the PAN system more efficient, secure, and user-friendly. By modernizing the system, the government hopes to improve tax compliance and reduce administrative burdens.As per the provisions of Income-Tax Act, 1961, no person can hold more than one PAN. In case a person holds more than one PAN, he/she is obliged to bring it to the notice of the Jurisdictional Assessing officer and get the additional PAN deleted/de-activated. In the PAN 2.0, with the improved systems logic for identification of potential duplicate requests for PAN and centralized and enhanced mechanism for resolving the duplicates would minimize the instances of one person holding more than one PAN.","PAN 2.0 is a significant upgrade to India's Permanent Account Number (PAN) system.

Income Tax Department releases top 10 points",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pan-2-0-faqs-answered-will-your-pan-card-change-will-it-have-a-new-number-income-tax-department-releases-top-points/articleshow/115703671.cms,"PAN 2.0: Existing PAN card holders can rest assured as no reapplication is necessary.

What is PAN 2.0?

PAN 2.0 FAQs Answered:

How will PAN 2.0 be different from the existing setup?

Integration of Platforms: Currently, PAN services operate across three separate portals (e-Filing Portal, UTIITSL Portal and Protean e-Gov Portal). The PAN 2.0 Project will consolidate all PAN/TAN services onto a single unified ITD portal. This centralised platform will provide comprehensive services including allocation, updates, amendments, Online PAN Validation (OPV), Know your AO, AADHAAR-PAN linking, PAN verification, e-PAN requests, and PAN card reprint applications.

Digital Transformation: The system will implement a complete online paperless workflow, replacing the current operational methods.

Taxpayer facilitation: PAN allocation, updates and corrections will be provided at no cost, with e-PAN documents delivered to registered email addresses. Physical PAN cards require a separate application with a Rs 50 fee for domestic delivery. For international delivery, applicants must pay Rs 15 plus actual India post charges.

Do existing PAN CARD holders have to apply for a new PAN under the upgraded system? Do you need to change your PAN number?

If new PAN cards are QR code enabled, will older ones continue to function as it is? What will QR code help with?

QR codes have been a standard feature on PAN cards since 2017-18, and this functionality will be enhanced under the PAN 2.0 project through dynamic QR codes that reflect the most current information in the PAN database. Those who possess older PAN cards without QR codes can request new ones featuring QR codes through either the existing PAN 1.0 system or the newer PAN 2.0 platform.

The QR code serves as a tool for authenticating both the PAN and its associated information.

Currently, verification of QR code information requires a dedicated reader application. When scanned using this application, it displays comprehensive information including the photograph, signature, name, Father's Name / Mother's Name, and Date of Birth.

Do I need to change my PAN card under the PAN 2.0?

For people holding more than one pan, how will you identify and weed out the extra PAN ?

What does the “Unified Portal” mean?

Do people have an option to get corrections done on PAN, like name, spellings, address change etc?

A lot of people have not changed their addresses and are continuing with old address. How will the new PAN be delivered? By when will the

new PAN Card

get delivered?

What is - the ""Common Business identifier for all business-related activities in specified sectors""?

Will Common Business identifier replace the existing unique taxpayer identification number i.e. PAN?

The app displayed large profits but when he tried to withdraw them, the crooks sought 20% of the funds for taxes. This raised his suspicion and he approached police.The probe led police to an ATM from where a part of the money was withdrawn. CCTV footage showed Mansuri and some women depositing the cheques. “The women pointed fingers at Mansuri,” said Gopale.Police found that Mansuri and his mentor, Hussain Malbari, had sent large sums to Dubai and China using hawala channels.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Dr Jay Bhattacharya: The 'anti-Covid lockdown' Bengali tasked by Trump to fix public health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dr-jay-bhattacharya-the-anti-covid-lockdown-bengali-tasked-by-trump-to-fix-public-health/articleshow/115736505.cms,"Early Life and Education: A Multidisciplinary Foundation



A Career Dedicated to Health Policy and Research



Pandemic Controversy: The Great Barrington Declaration



Restoring Trust in Public Health Institutions



Dr Jayanta ""Jay"" Bhattacharya, a Stanford professor of medicine and economics, is set to bring a transformative vision to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as its next director under President-elect Donald Trump . Known for his contrarian stance during the COVID-19 pandemic and his advocacy for evidence-based, economically sound health policies, Bhattacharya’s nomination signals a bold shift in the Trump administration’s approach to public health. His multifaceted career in medicine, economics, and policy places him in a unique position to redefine the role of the NIH in addressing the nation’s most pressing health challenges.Born in 1968 in Kolkata, India, Bhattacharya immigrated to the United States as a child and quickly distinguished himself academically. He earned his undergraduate, medical, and doctoral degrees from Stanford University , where he remains a tenured professor. His Ph.D. in economics and MD from the Stanford School of Medicine have allowed him to examine healthcare through a multidisciplinary lens, combining clinical insight with economic analysis. Bhattacharya’s upbringing in a multicultural environment, along with his academic training, has shaped his understanding of global health challenges and the need for policies that balance medical science with social and economic realities.Throughout his academic career, Bhattacharya has focused on the health and well-being of vulnerable populations. As the director of Stanford’s Center for Demography and Economics of Health and Aging, he has studied the impact of aging, government programs, and biomedical innovation on public health. His work spans critical areas such as chronic disease management, healthcare disparities, and the economic implications of medical advancements. A prolific researcher, he has authored over 150 peer-reviewed articles and serves as a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, among other affiliations. These roles have positioned him as both a scholar and an influencer in shaping health policy debates.Bhattacharya gained international recognition during the COVID-19 pandemic for his controversial opposition to lockdowns and vaccine mandates. As a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration , he proposed a strategy of ""focused protection,"" advocating for the shielding of vulnerable populations while allowing lower-risk groups to resume normal life. His views, though polarizing, sparked vital conversations about the trade-offs inherent in public health interventions. Bhattacharya argued that prolonged lockdowns caused more harm than good, particularly for economically disadvantaged communities, and called for a more balanced approach that considered the social and economic costs of pandemic policies. This willingness to challenge conventional wisdom aligns with the Trump administration’s ethos of questioning entrenched bureaucracies.As the incoming director of the NIH, Bhattacharya is expected to prioritize restoring public trust in health institutions. He has been a vocal critic of the erosion of trust during the pandemic, attributing it to inconsistent messaging and the suppression of dissenting voices. At the NIH, Bhattacharya plans to promote transparency and open debate, fostering a culture where diverse perspectives are welcomed. His leadership is likely to emphasize the importance of free speech in science, protecting researchers from political or ideological pressures and ensuring that public health decisions are rooted in robust evidence.One of Bhattacharya’s primary objectives will be addressing the crisis of chronic illness in the United States. Chronic diseases account for the majority of healthcare costs and are a leading cause of mortality. Bhattacharya’s research background equips him to design innovative strategies to tackle these illnesses, focusing on preventive measures and cost-effective treatments. By leveraging the NIH’s vast resources, he aims to advance research on the underlying causes of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, with an eye toward improving quality of life and reducing healthcare expenditures.Bhattacharya is also a staunch advocate for biomedical innovation. He has long argued that new technologies and treatments are essential for improving health outcomes, particularly in underserved populations. At the NIH, he intends to prioritize research that accelerates the development of cutting-edge therapies while ensuring equitable access. His tenure is expected to highlight the role of innovation in addressing disparities in healthcare, making breakthroughs accessible to those who need them most.Another critical area of focus for Bhattacharya will be the integration of public health interventions with economic considerations. Drawing on his expertise as a health economist, he is likely to advocate for policies that strike a balance between public health benefits and their social and economic impacts. His leadership will aim to ensure that future health crises are managed in a way that minimizes harm to society while protecting the most vulnerable. This approach reflects his belief in targeted solutions rather than broad, one-size-fits-all mandates.Joining forces with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, Bhattacharya will play a key role in reshaping the nation’s health agenda. Together, they plan to address systemic issues in healthcare delivery, chronic illness management, and the federal government’s approach to medical research. Bhattacharya’s appointment reflects the Trump administration’s commitment to reforming public health institutions and fostering innovation while maintaining a critical eye on economic sustainability.","Dr Jayanta ""Jay"" Bhattacharya is set to bring a transformative vision to the National Institutes of Health.

India voices concerns over Das' arrest

As India hit out at Bangladesh for the arrest of Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das , Dhaka reaffirmed its commitment to communal harmony , and said that it is dedicated to protecting all citizens, regardless of religious identity.Bangladesh's ministry of foreign in a statement said that Das was arrested on “specific charges” and dismissed allegations of religious discrimination.It criticised statements and reactions surrounding the arrest of Das, calling them “misconstrued” and harmful to the spirit of friendship between Dhaka and New Delhi.“It is with utter dismay and deep sense of hurt that the Government of Bangladesh notes that the arrest of Sri Chinmoy Krishna Das has been misconstrued by certain quarters since Sri Chinmoy Krishna Das has been arrested on specific charges,” the ministry said.""The Government of Bangladesh maintains that such unfounded statements not only misrepresent facts but also stand contrary to the spirit of friendship and understanding between the two neighboring countries,"" the statement added.The priest’s detention has sparked significant backlash, with thousands of his followers staging protests in Chattogram. Demonstrators blocked prison vehicles and called for his immediate release after his bail plea was denied, leading to the death of a lawyer.Bangladesh reiterated its commitment to communal harmony, citing the peaceful Durga Puja celebrations last month as evidence.""Bangladesh reaffirms in the strongest terms that every Bangladeshi, regardless of his or her religious identity, has the right to establish, maintain or perform respective religious rituals and practices or express views without hindrance,"" the statement said.Chief adviser to the interim government of Bangladesh Muhammad Yunus, in a separate statement condemned the murder of lawyer during the protest in Chattogram and announced an investigation. “The Interim Government is committed to ensuring and upholding communal harmony in Bangladesh at any cost,” Yunus said in a statement.Yunus also urged citizens to ""keep calm"" and ordered heightened security in vulnerable areas.""He has urged people to keep calm and stay away from participating in any untoward activities.
