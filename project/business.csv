NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled that candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Economically Weaker Sections are entitled to general category posts if they secure the cutoff marks stipulated for general category.The ruling by a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine G Masih was inspired by SC's landmark verdict in the Indra Sawhney case of 1992 which had granted 27% reservation to OBCs in govt jobs. The bench dismissed a petition by Rajasthan HC which, while recruiting candidates for certain posts, had barred reserved category candidates from getting appointed against general category posts despite securing more marks than the cutoff fixed for general category.When an HC division bench ruled in favour of reserved category candidates who wanted to be considered for general category posts, HC moved SC, arguing that considering reserved category candidates for general category posts would amount to their being granted double benefit. Writing the judgment, Justice Datta said, ""We hold that the word 'open' connotes nothing but 'open', meaning thereby that vacant posts which are sought to be filled by earmarking it as 'open' do not fall in any category.Upholding the HC division bench's decision, SC said, ""The availability of reservation doesn't operate as a bar for a reserved category candidate from being considered on merit against the unreserved category.""The HC recruitment process was based on a written test followed by an interview. SC said if a reserved category candidate gets more marks more than the cutoff prescribed for general category, they should be considered to be in general category while appearing for interview.

Traffic to Sonprayag, P 10

.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to improve connectivity to Kedarnath, reduce travel time by road and enhance pilgrims' safety, the govt has zeroed in on the construction of a 7-km tunnel connecting Chaumasi in Kalimath Valley near Guptkashi to Sonprayag, the starting point of the ropeway project which will take pilgrims to the shrine.The twin tube tunnel will not just be an alternative but also serve as an escape route in case of emergency and bad weather. The govt will also carry out a feasibility study for a walkway and pedestrian tunnel from Chaumasi side for better connectivity to Kedarnath shrine.At present, all vehicles heading to Sonprayag and Gauri Kund take NH-107.As per the plan, the existing one-lane road in Kalimath Valley, which is under the Uttarakhand govt, will be expanded to two lanes to cater to increased traffic once the tunnel becomes operational.TOI has learnt the road transport ministry held a detailed discussion last week with Uttarakhand govt on the proposal. It took note of the increased number of pilgrims and tourists in Kedarnath, which stood at 17.7 lakh last year and is estimated to rise to 25 lakh in 2030 and 40 lakh in 2040.Taking lessons from the Sylkiyara tunnel episode, detailed geological and hydrological investigations will be carried out. The govt has awarded to Adani Enterprises the 12.9-km Sonprayag-Kedarnath ropeway project, which is likely to be operational in 2031-32.It will have the capacity to carry 1,800 pilgrims per hour, and pilgrims will be able to complete a one-way trip in just 40 minutes.",The twin tube tunnel will not just be an alternative but also serve as an escape route in case of emergency and bad weather.

BENGALURU: Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal AP Singh Sunday — Jan 4, 2025 — stressed the need for strict adherence to delivery timelines, warning that delays could affect IAF’s operational readiness, even as he congratulated ADA on the completion of 25 years of Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas flight.Inaugurating the two-day national seminar “Aeronautics 2047” here, Singh said meeting committed schedules was critical at a time when the operational environment was rapidly evolving and the IAF’s requirements were growing.Aeronautics 2047 will also trace the journey of LCA Tejas from early design sketches to operational squadrons. Designed and developed by ADA, Tejas has completed more than 5,600 successful flight trials.“More than 100 design and development centres, including govt laboratories, academic institutions and industry partners, have contributed to the programme. The effort led to the development of several niche technologies such as carbon composites, lightweight materials, fly-by-wire flight control, digital utility management systems and a glass cockpit, enabling Tejas to emerge as a fourth-generation fighter aircraft,” the ministry of defence (MoD) said.The LCA-Mk1A, an advanced variant of Tejas, is expected to serve as a key platform for meeting the IAF’s operational requirements. The LCA-Mk2 and the naval variant are currently under development. The seminar features a series of technical talks by engineers, test pilots and scientists closely associated with the Tejas programme.According to ADA officials, the LCA programme has helped India build both capability and capacity to design and manufacture fighter aircraft domestically. So far, 38 aircraft, including 32 fighters and six trainers, have been inducted into two IAF squadrons.Secretary, department of defence R&D, and DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat, stressed the importance of developing indigenous, cutting-edge technologies to reduce dependence on imports. This, he said, “was central to achieving the vision of Viksit Bharat @2047”.The seminar brought together experts from industry, academia, government laboratories and the wider aerospace community.Discussions are centred on the future trajectory of Indian aeronautics, with sessions covering next-generation aircraft manufacturing and assembly, digital manufacturing, advanced aerodynamics, propulsion systems, flight testing techniques, digital twin technology, certification challenges, flight control systems and avionics, maintainability of fighter aircraft, artificial intelligence in aircraft design, and precision manufacturing for actuators.As part of the event, public sector undertakings, defence PSUs, private industry and MSMEs are showcasing indigenously designed products and systems for airborne applications.","Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal AP Singh stressed the need for strict adherence to delivery timelines.

NEW DELHI: In a first, India will get a twin-tube underwater tunnel that will have provision for movement of both vehicle and trains, boosting faster movement of forces and ammunition in case of any exigency, reports Dipak Dash.An inter-ministerial panel, headed by the expenditure secretary has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track.As per design, there will be no vehicular movement when trains run through this tube. It will have ballistic track and the trains will run on electricity. The total project of 33.7km, including the tunnel, approach roads and railway track will cost around Rs 18,600 crore. Once the project is complete, travel time between Gohpur and Numaligarh will reduce from current six-and-half hours to just 30 minutes, shortening the distance from 240km to 34km. This will enhance connectivity to Arunachal, Manipur, and other northeastern states.The project cost will be borne by road transport, railways and defence ministry.Designed as two unidirectional tunnels with two lanes each, these will be built 32m below Brahmaputra's deepest bed level. The project is expected to be completed in five years after the award of work.Officials said the projects will be placed before Union cabinet for approval and this may happen before Assam assembly polls. Last year, finance ministry had green signalled a road tunnel costing around Rs 14,900 crore with provision of 80:20 funding by road transport ministry and defence ministry. But following a decision to build road-cum-railway tunnels where it's feasible, govt had identified three such tunnels for North-East chicken neck corridor, across Brahmaputra in Assam and on Maranahally-Addahole (Shiradi Ghat) stretch in Karnataka, which TOI first reported on Oct 6, 2025.Officials said because of provision of railway track in one tunnel the cost has gone up.","An inter-ministerial panel has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam.

NEW DELHI: A day after Congress announced that the nationwide 'MGNREGA Bachao Sangram' will be conducted from Jan 8 to Feb 25, rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan called the opposition party's campaign a 'Bhrashtachaar Bachao Sangram' and accused Congress of spreading misinformation and falsehoods on Viksit Bharat- Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act.Addressing a press conference in the capital, Chouhan alleged that corruption was rampant in MGNREGA and claimed that 'VB-G RAM G' scheme is better and several steps ahead of MGNREGA. ""MGNREGA had ceased to be a symbol of honest employment. More than 1.091 million complaints were registered through social audits conducted in gram sabhas,"" he pointed out.The minister highlighted that contractors were carrying out work in the name of labourers, wages were withdrawn by showing machine-based work and the same roads were shown as 'new' year-after-year. He also highlighted that around 30% of workers were above 60; instances of 80-year-old ""labourers"" and fake attendance records were also found.""Over Rs 8.48 lakh crore has been spent on rural development so far under Modi govt, compared to only Rs 2 lakh crore during UPA regime,"" Chouhan said. He also questioned if permanent assets were created in villages and the lives of villagers and workers truly improved because of money spent by the earlier regime.Chouhan said 'VB-G RAM G' is a ""corruption-free, technology-driven and worker-centric reform"". The focus now will be on concrete development works such as water conservation, roads, schools, hospitals and natural disaster management. He said this is not the time for agitation but for cooperation and ""Congress should stop misleading the nation and spreading falsehoods"".Meanwhile, Congress on Sunday announced the setting up of a coordination committee to ""oversee, guide and monitor implementation of 'MGNREGA Bachao Sangram', with senior party functionary Ajay Maken as its convenor.

Indian Army Raises Bhairav Special Force With Over One Lakh Drone Operatives For Modern Warfare

NASIRABAD: At a time when the Centre is pushing for restructuring the defence forces, the Indian Army has carried out one of the biggest ever transformations to meet modern warfare challenges creating a pool of over one lakh drone operatives across the force.Bhairav, the latest Special Force raised by the Indian Army- is being readied to tackle the challenges of modern warfare, as all operatives are capable of handling drones and use them in real operations for targeting bases and formations inside enemy territory.Team visited one of the newly raised Bhairav battalions in the desert sector under the Southern Command, where it witnessed the capabilities of the troops who had been selected from Infantry regiments to raise the Special Force and were being given special training as per the requirements of modern warfare.The Bhairav battalions raised by Army Headquarters with lessons from global and own conflicts in mind, have been created to provide a dedicated force for high-speed, offensive operations to carry out the Special Forces tasking at multiple levels as per requirements.The Indian Army has raised around 15 of these battalions already, and they have been assigned to different formations on both borders and have plans to raise around 25 of them in total in the near future.The Bhairav battalions would also bridge the gap between the Para Special Forces and the regular Infantry battalions. The Bhairav would also be tasked to carry out Special Operations at tactical to operational depth.""Modern warfare is changing at a very rapid pace. The conflicts of today are hybrid in nature, and one needs to be fully equipped with modern technology to be able to deal with the Challenges. The Bhairav battalions have also been created as part of the force restructuring, which have been raised in line with the requirements of modern technology, new thought process and as per the new operational requirements,"" Commanding Officer of the 2 Bhairav Battalion told ANI in an exclusive interview.""I am the Commanding officer of the desert Bhairav battalion of the Southern Command of the Indian Army. The desert has its own challenges where special skill sets, endurance and technology are required to be used in the right way. That is why the Bhairav has been raised as a technology-driven system which can operate independently and carry out multi-domain operations in the future,"" he added.Explaining about the formation of the unit, the Commanding officer said, ""The desert Bhairav Battalion has been raised on the concept of 'Sons of the Soil' as the majority of the troops are from Rajasthan who can understand the terrain, language, weather and the area. The battalion has been built upon the legacy of the valour and gallantry of Rajanghan, and that is our biggest strength. We are ready to meet any challenge in the desert sector. ""The Bhairav battalions have trained very hard in the last five months since their raising, using modern technology and carried out successful operational validation during the Exercise Akhand Prahar, where the troops showcased their readiness in the presence of Southern Army Commander Lt Gen Dhiraj Seth.The Commanding Officer said the force was evolving very strongly and emerging as the ""Swift, Capable and Decisive"" force of the Southern Command and the Indian Army. The Bhairav battalions would also be part of the India Army's Army Day Parade at Jaipur to be held on January 15 this year. The 2 Bhairav, also known as the Desert Falcons, would be taking part in the event.The Indian Army has also carried out major force restructuring keeping in mind the operational requirements and created Rudra Brigades, which are all-arms formations that combine infantry, mechanised units, tanks, artillery, special forces, and unmanned aerial systems with dedicated logistics and combat support.The Artillery, Mechanised Infantry and the Armoured Corps are also being equipped with modern warfare equipment like drones and other capabilities to be able to perform tasks more efficiently.","Bhairav, the latest Special Force raised by the Indian Army- is being readied to tackle the challenges of modern warfare.

NEW DELHI: As it takes a determined step to agitate for MGNREGA with the successful farm laws stir as motivation, Congress views the agitation as a long-term sensitisation programme than the one which can radically change the status of the scheme disbanded by Modi govt. The reason is that the nature of the stakeholder in the rural job scheme is the poor working class in contrast to the big farmers involved in the campaign against farm laws.As MGNREGA workers are fighting for daily survival, it is conceded they cannot be mobilised for a long struggle over a future concern. This is in stark contrast to farm laws agitation which witnessed farmers from across the north gather for a prolonged dharna, which finally forced Centre to roll back three Acts. The marked difference in social clout of the two groups is what seems to complicate the struggle which otherwise, many feel, was a straight battle.Interestingly, the other agitation, which forced Modi govt to backtrack in its early days in power, was against ""weakening"" of land acquisition law, led by Rahul Gandhi. But that too involved farmers who were concerned about easing of acquisition norms.In contrast, MGNREGA changes may actually put farmers against labourers, and the protest, because of the policy of pausing G RAM G Act for two months during the agricultural season.Thus, it is felt, the agitation for MGNREGA is more a long-term campaign, which would seek to sensitise the poor workers and prepare them for the time when ""they feel the pinch"" of the new G RAM G Act.The difference between past successful agitations and proposed MGNREGA campaign was discussed in Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting last week that considered the issue.Sources said CWC acknowledged the battle will be prolonged, as wage earners cannot be called away from work to join a struggle. Instead, political activists will have to visit work sites and villages to sensitise the groups that, according to Congress, will be hurt by the changes from the job guarantee scheme brought in the new law - like budget, pause during agriculture season, panchayat-level planning. This will also require coordination with voluntary organisations involved in the job guarantee scheme.",Congress views the agitation as a long-term sensitisation programme than the one which can radically change the status of the scheme.

BHOPAL: Official audits had warned for years that contaminated drinking water posed serious public health risks in Madhya Pradesh, after 5.45 lakh cases of water-borne diseases were recorded in Bhopal and Indore civic areas between 2013 and 2018 - long before the Indore tragedy claimed at least 10 lives and triggered public outrage.These alerts were part of a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report on General and Social Sectors for the year ended March 31, 2018. The report flagged systemic lapses in monitoring and testing of drinking water by urban local bodies while putting out the tally of 5.45 lakh diseases in the two cities.The report cautioned that ""the possibility of contaminated water being supplied by the MCs (municipal corporations) during the period could not be ruled out"". Such CAG reports are part of its assessments of the civic bodies' finances.To assess ground realities, CAG's audit conducted joint sampling in Aug-Sept 2018 with officials of Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC). A total of 54 samples were collected from water sources, filter plants, overhead tanks and consumer taps, and independently tested at the State Research Laboratory, Bhopal.In BMC areas, turbidity in some samples exceeded BIS norms, while faecal coliform, which should be 0, was detected in multiple samples. In Indore, faecal coliform counts ranged from 40 to 140, far above permissible limits.The auditor noted that 8.95 lakh residents -- 3.62 lakh in Bhopal and 5.33 lakh in Indore -- were likely to be affected due to the supply of contaminated water containing faecal coliform, pointing to a ""lack of monitoring of filter plants at the operational level as well as at the distribution level"".CAG raised concerns again in the audit report on local bodies for the year ended March 31, 2022, which found that seven of the 14 urban local bodies randomly audited did not have water testing laboratories.CAG observed that tests were not conducted regularly and that civic bodies failed to follow minimum sampling frequencies prescribed in the CPHEEO manual, warning that ""adverse effects on the health of the population due to supply of water without regular testing cannot be ruled out"". CPHEEO is short for Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organisation, a technical wing of the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs.After the recent Indore deaths, NGO Jan Swastha Abhiyan has written to the MP chief secretary and the Union Jal Shakti ministry, citing the repeated audit findings, demanding urgent action and stressing that warnings sounded years ago were never translated into sustained corrective measures.",Official audits had warned for years that contaminated drinking water posed serious public health risks in Madhya Pradesh. 5.45 lakh cases of water-borne diseases were recorded in Bhopal and Indore civic areas between 2013 and 2018. The Indore tragedy claimed at least 10 lives and triggered public outrage.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126340038,imgsize-1536832,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photos.jpg"
FDA OKs 1st oral drug for anaemia in adults with thalassemia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fda-oks-1st-oral-drug-for-anaemia-in-adults-with-thalassemia/articleshow/126340013.cms,"With 33% people deficient in Iron, simple ways to increase absorption and intake of iron

NEW DELHI: In a landmark advance for thalassemia care, US FDA has approved Mitapivat, the first oral treatment for anaemia in adults with thalassemia, covering both transfusion-dependent and non-transfusion-dependent alpha and beta disease.Clinicians and patient groups in India have welcomed the decision as a potential game changer for a lifelong genetic blood disorder that currently depends largely on repeated blood transfusions and iron chelation. The drug, however, is not yet available in India, as it has not received approval from DCGI.Calling the approval a historic shift, Dr Rahul Bhargava, director and head of hematology and hemato-oncology at Fortis Institute of Blood Disorders, said Mitapivat targets the disease at its cellular core by correcting red-cell metabolism rather than only managing consequences.From a transfusion-medicine perspective, Dr Rishiraj Sinha from AIIMS said adult patients have long borne the clinical and quality-of-life burden of lifelong transfusions and chelation. ""The approval of the first oral therapy for both transfusion-dependent and non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia is a meaningful shift in disease management.

This was also one of the five pledges (Panch Pran). “When we see even the smallest thing related to colonialism in us or around us, we have to be rid of it... Indians should shed ‘colonialism’ from their minds and habits,” Modi had said.Last week, speaking at the Veer Baal Diwas programme, the PM had said that by 2035, people will ensure that the nation is completely “free from the mentality of slavery”. He has increasingly invoked the theme of colonialism and the need to shed its lingering impact on the national psyche and development.Construction of the new Parliament building, changing the name of Rajpath to Kartavya Path and shifting the seat of power from the South and North Blocks are also being seen as part of this government’s bigger plan to put an end to the colonial past.Similarly, the government has projected that the economic growth and improved ranking in ease of doing business are results of its agenda of reforms.Officials said that while the ministries will share the steps they have taken so far, they will also provide some details of the future steps to improve ease of living and doing business.",Removing traces of colonialism has become the talking point for the government.

Rupee continues to fall! Currency drops 4 paise in early trade; reaches 90.24 against US dollar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-continues-to-fall-currency-drops-4-paise-in-early-trade-reaches-90-24-against-us-dollar/articleshow/126343970.cms,"Rupee opened the week on a weak note, slipping 4 paise to 90.24 against US dollar in early trade on Monday, extending its downward momentum from 2025. The decline was triggered by ongoing geopolitical uncertainty as US intervention in Venezuela boosted demand for the American currency.Last week on Friday, the currency had fallen below the 90-mark, closing 22 paise lower at 90.20 against the dollar. The decline came amid disappointing macroeconomic data and a strengthening US currency in overseas markets.According to traders, this muted sentiment was due to continuous withdrawal of foreign fund and strong dollar demand from importers, which dragged rupee down. However, softer crude oil prices and a sharp rise in domestic equities helped limit the downside, they added. Furthermore, any intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) could provide support to the rupee at lower levels.In 2025, the currency depreciated almost 5% against the US dollar, marking its weakest annual performance since 2022. Despite a softer dollar and most global currencies registering gains, rupee still lagged behind.According to a recent report by SBI Funds Management, the underperformance was fueled by “muted foreign portfolio investor (FPI) inflows, weak export momentum and heightened hedging demand from importers.” Foreign investors withdrew close to $18 billion from Indian equities, citing earnings downgrades, limited exposure to AI-led global growth, and more attractive opportunities in other emerging markets.Looking ahead, the bank expects the rupee to decline by around 2% in the next financial year, with the exchange rate hovering near 92 against the US dollar.","Rupee slipped 4 paise to 90.24 against US dollar in early trade on Monday.

What about other products?



What has changed?

Cigarettes are set to cost more from next month!The jump in cigarette prices comes after government’s decision to impose an additional excise duty under a revised tax structure, pushing up the tax burden across all categories. The finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing an additional excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 sticks, depending on cigarette length.This increase will come on top of the 40% GST that will be levied on tobacco products from February 1, making each cigarette noticeably costlier at the counter.In per-stick terms, the increase translates into a clear jump in retail prices, particularly for medium and long cigarettes. The additional excise duty across categories is outlined below:This higher slab for ""other"" category applies only to unusual or non-standard cigarette designs. Most popular cigarette brands do not fall under this category.From February 1, all tobacco products, including cigarettes and pan masala, will attract 40% GST, while biris will be taxed at 18%.Chewing tobacco and jarda scented tobacco will face an excise duty of 82%, and gutkha will attract an excise duty of 91%.The total tax incidence on pan masala, after factoring in GST, will remain unchanged at 88%.The revised tax structure replaces the existing regime of 28% GST along with a compensation cess on tobacco and related products.The levy of excise duty on cigarettes and a cess on pan masala was approved by Parliament last month, following a GST Council decision in September on taxing these products over and above GST after the compensation cess framework ends.Currently, tobacco products attract 28% GST along with a varied compensation cess. From February 1, this will shift to 40% GST, along with excise duty and compensation cess. The GST Council had earlier decided that the compensation cess would cease after the repayment of loans taken to compensate states for GST revenue losses during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Rs 2.69 lakh crore loan is scheduled to be fully repaid by January 31, 2026.Giving reasons for the hike in excise duty on cigarettes, sources said it will ensure that cigarettes carry a tax burden proportionate to their severe public health impact, and also maintain a tax incidence closer to international best practices.Taxes on cigarettes in India have remained unchanged for the past seven years since the introduction of GST in July 2017. According to World Bank estimates, India’s total tax incidence on cigarettes is around 53% of the retail price, substantially lower than the World Health Organization’s recommended benchmark of 75% or more. In comparison, countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia tax cigarettes at over 80–85% of the retail price, while France, New Zealand and several EU member states maintain tax levels exceeding 75–80%.New rules also mandate manufacturers of chewing tobacco, jarda scented tobacco and gutkha to install functional CCTV systems covering all packing machines and preserve footage for at least 24 months. Manufacturers will have to disclose the number and capacity of machines to excise authorities and can claim abatement in excise duty if a machine remains non-functional for a minimum of 15 consecutive days.","From February 1, all tobacco products, including cigarettes and pan masala, will attract 40% GST, while biris will be taxed at 18%.

Cigarette tax hike: Experts warn of surge in illicit trade; fear major revenue losses for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cigarette-tax-hike-experts-warn-of-surge-in-illicit-trade-fear-major-revenue-losses-for-government/articleshow/126334324.cms,"Representative image

A sharp increase in taxes on cigarettes, along with a new excise duty structure on tobacco products, could trigger a surge in illicit trade and lead to significant revenue losses for the government, experts have warned.Earlier this week, the finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks, depending on their length.The new excise duty, which comes into effect from February 1, will be levied in addition to the existing 40 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ).This change implies an overall tax hike of around 60–70 per cent, varying by cigarette length, compared with the current overall tax incidence of about 50–55 per cent.The move marks a transition from the GST compensation cess to an excise-based regime for demerit goods.The unexpected nature of the tax increase has raised concerns about higher smuggling and illegal trade in tobacco products.According to news agency PTI, Ranganath Tannir, secretary general of Think Change Forum, said the steep rise could prove counterproductive. “Public finance theory is clear that excessive taxation of inelastic goods fuels illicit trade, not compliance,” he said, adding that cigarettes in India are already among the least affordable globally based on World Health Organization affordability indicators.Making them more expensive is unlikely to curb demand, but could push consumers towards illegal and smuggled products, undermining tax collections, he noted.Brokerage reports have echoed similar concerns. According to JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research, a higher tax rate for the King Size Filter Tip (KSFT) segment increases the risk of consumers downtrading to cheaper options and may also lead to higher consumption of illicit cigarettes.Illicit tobacco already accounts for about 26 per cent of India’s total tobacco market, making the country the fourth-largest market globally for smuggled tobacco, PTI reported.Nomura, in its research note, said that while higher taxes are aimed at reducing consumption, they often have unintended consequences. “High taxes on cigarettes… fuel the growth of illicit cigarettes and push consumers towards cheaper, non-tax paid smuggled cigarettes,” the brokerage said.Jefferies, citing a report by the Tobacco Institute of India (TII), said the industry body has urged the government to review the proposed excise structure.A wider gap between legal and illegal prices could benefit non-duty-paid cigarettes and result in higher tax leakage, the report noted.Experts also pointed to international experience to underline the risks. Australia’s repeated tobacco tax hikes between 2012 and 2020 led to a sharp rise in cigarette prices and were followed by a jump in illicit tobacco consumption from under 2 per cent to around 14 per cent of the market.Calling the proposed excise levies “unprecedented”, an analyst said there is still time to reassess the decision before it comes into force.“Since they take effect from February 1, 2026, the government has an opportunity to revisit and rectify them before they spawn a much larger problem of uncontrollable illicit networks,” the analyst warned, as per PTI.","The finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks.

Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

BENGALURU: The state govt has uncovered a major property registration scam involving its e-khata system, leading to the suspension of five sub-registrars after officials detected fraudulent registration of around 1,332 properties over a one-year period between Dec 6, 2024, and Dec 5, 2025.The department of stamps and registrations has suspended the officials for their alleged role in the misuse of the Kaveri 2.0 portal, failure to import mandatory e-khata details from the e-swathu software, and illegal registration of sale deeds. Those suspended are Ravi Sankana Gouda, N Satish Kumar, Sridhar (first division assistant-in-charge sub-registrar), Girish Chandra and R Prabhavathi.Launched with much fanfare as a foolproof digital safeguard, the state govt's e-khata system, meant to prevent property registration fraud, has come under scrutiny after scam came to light following a complaint filed by the executive director of the centre for smart governance (CSG), which provides technology solutions to govt departments. Based on the complaint, the north CEN police registered a cybercrime case against unknown persons under various provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Officials said the Kaveri-2 portal, which has not permitted property registration without a valid e-khata since 2024, was allegedly manipulated. According to them, individuals accessed details from the Unified Land Management System (ULMS), which contains land records from origin to conversion, and hacked the software to falsely project certain properties as having e-khata under the rural development and panchayat raj (RDPR) department.These properties were then registered illegally.The complaint alleged that miscreants forged property documents and bypassed system safeguards to facilitate registrations despite the absence of valid e-khatas. This is the second major case of fraudulent property registration reported since e-khata was made mandatory for all property registrations in Bengaluru.Sources said several sub-registrar offices with jurisdiction over rural gram panchayat properties were affected, with most illegal registrations traced to these offices. Technical analysis reportedly revealed software bypasses in multiple sub-registrar offices, including Banaswadi, Ulsoor and Varthur.","Five sub-registrars suspended after 1,332 illegal property registrations in Bengaluru.

Melinda French Gates is one of the wealthiest women in America but her path to a $17.4 billion fortune began with an unusual advice from hiring manager at IBM .

It was tiny,” French Gates said during an interview.“And she said, ‘If they give you an offer, you should take it.’ And it dumbfounded me,” she added.The manager’s reason was clear: She reportedly said that a young recruit would have the better chance to move up quickly at Microsoft as it was growing rapidly.French Gates took the leap and moved to the West Coast in Seattle.“I didn’t know anybody in Seattle. It was moving to the West Coast, but I was so excited about what they were doing.I was like, ‘I want to be part of that,’” she said. French Gates spent nine years at Microsoft and became the General Manager of Information Products. She was a critical architect of the company’s expansion, which is now a $3.6 trillion software titan.Reflecting on her journey, French Gates now uses her story to encourage other women.“I remind them all the time you can pivot careers.

Manus, a versatile AI agent, achieved rapid growth and significant revenue, prompting Meta to integrate its technology across its platforms. The deal, however, carries geopolitical undertones due to Manus's Chinese origins and subsequent move to Singapore.

Meta's $2.5 billion bet on AI agents signals new era

Chinese roots raise geopolitical concerns despite Singapore move





The co-founder of Manus, the AI startup recently acquired by Meta for $2.5 billion, has drawn parallels between himself and Mark Zuckerberg , highlighting their shared journey as college dropouts who built successful tech companies. Ji Yichao, the 32-year-old chief scientist and co-founder of Manus, shared two photographs on X showing younger versions of himself and Zuckerberg working on laptops in the same room at the ""Facebook House"" in Palo Alto, California. ""21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge,"" Ji wrote following acquisition announcement.According to Chinese media reports, Ji started a computer science degree at Beijing Information Science and Technology University in 2010 but dropped out to pursue entrepreneurship. He later returned to complete his degree in 2018. Zuckerberg famously left Harvard University in 2004 to focus on building Facebook, which eventually became Meta.The deal includes a $500 million retention pool for Manus employees, as Meta ramps up its foray into AI. Manus will be retained as a stand-alone subscription service while weaving in the startup's technology into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.Manus, which debuted in March 2024 as a ""general-purpose"" AI agent capable of independently conducting deep research and vacation planning, and even coding and stock analysis, reached more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than a year and gained millions of users.That deal is also not without geopolitical nuances, given that Manus was founded by Butterfly Effect in Beijing and Wuhan in 2022. Still, it moved to Singapore in mid-2025, apparently to hedge against geopolitical risk as part of the U.S.–China tech rivalry.Meta says there will be “no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI” after the acquisition, adding it would wind down services in China. Manus reportedly laid off most of its Chinese staff and now operates with 105 employees across Singapore, Tokyo, and San Francisco.Earlier, Senator John Cornyn had criticised Silicon Valley venture firm Benchmark for its support of Manus, citing fears of American capital underpinning Chinese technology interests.","Ji Yichao, the 32-year-old chief scientist and co-founder of Manus, shared two photographs on X showing younger versions of himself and Zuckerberg working on laptops in Palo Alto, California.

The company faces lawsuits over alleged harm caused by ChatGPT, while its safety teams have been disbanded. This new role aims to balance rapid AI advancement with crucial safeguards, a challenging task given the technology's unprecedented capabilities and potential dangers.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Safety teams keep vanishing as products multiply

Lawsuits paint darker picture of AI's mental health toll





The man who unleashed ChatGPT on the world is now sounding the alarm about his own creation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is hunting for a Head of Preparedness to tackle what he calls ""real challenges"" emerging from AI systems that have grown so sophisticated they're finding critical security vulnerabilities and impacting users' mental health. The $555,000 role comes as the company that revolutionised generative AI in late 2022 grapples with lawsuits, safety team departures, and the uncomfortable reality that its technology may be causing genuine harm.""Models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges,"" Altman wrote on X. He didn't sugarcoat the position's demands, warning applicants: ""This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.""The new hire will lead OpenAI's preparedness framework, evaluating frontier AI capabilities and coordinating safeguards across cybersecurity, biosecurity, and the prospect of AI systems that can improve themselves—challenges that Altman admits have ""little precedent."" The company specifically needs help figuring out ""how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm.The job opening arrives amid a disturbing pattern at OpenAI: safety teams appear, then disappear. The company's Superalignment team, launched in 2023 with the mission of preventing AI systems ""much smarter than us"" from going rogue, lasted less than a year before being disbanded in May 2024. Co-leader Jan Leike quit with a blistering exit statement, declaring that ""safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products. ""The AGI Readiness team met a similar fate in October 2024, dissolved after advising on the company's preparedness for artificial general intelligence. Meanwhile, Aleksander Madry, OpenAI's previous Head of Preparedness, was reassigned in July 2024 to work on AI reasoning instead—leaving the crucial safety position vacant for months even as the technology advanced.The urgency behind the new position becomes clearer when examining the lawsuits piling up against OpenAI. Multiple families allege ChatGPT reinforced delusions, deepened isolation, and even encouraged suicide. One case involves a 16-year-old California boy; another centers on a 56-year-old Connecticut man who allegedly murdered his mother and killed himself after interactions with the chatbot that fueled his paranoid delusions.OpenAI says it's working to improve ChatGPT's ability to ""recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress,"" but the company hasn't slowed its product velocity. Despite Altman's 2023 signing of a letter warning that AI extinction risks deserve priority alongside ""pandemics and nuclear war,"" OpenAI keeps accelerating. The company, now valued at $157 billion after October's $6.6 billion funding round, is reportedly negotiating with Amazon for another investment exceeding $10 billion.That contradiction—tech leaders prophesying catastrophe while racing to build the very technology they fear—hasn't gone unnoticed. ""If they honestly believe this could bring about human extinction, then why not just stop?"" asked one critic after Altman's Congressional testimony. The new Head of Preparedness will inherit that impossible balancing act: making AI safer while the company that employs them pushes relentlessly forward.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is seeking a Head of Preparedness to address AI's growing security risks and mental health impacts.

The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Right-wing influencer weighs in on Indians earning highest pay in Germany: 'How can a group be so beneficial while...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/right-wing-influencer-weighs-in-on-indians-earning-highest-pay-in-germany-how-can-a-group-be-so-beneficial-while-/articleshow/126342365.cms,"



Right-wing political analyst Richard Hanania, who has previously said that ""anti-Indian hate is the dumbest form of racism,"" is now praising Indian workers after a recent report showed that they earn the highest median pay in Germany.In a post on X, the influencer said: “Indians win again. How can a group be so beneficial while bringing no harms across so many countries? It’s absolutely awe inspiring.”Hanania has previously defended H‑1B visas and condemned anti‑India hate prevalent in the conservative circles of America. He has even backed Indian-Americans against MAGA bigwigs like former Trump advisor Steve Bannon and Republican leader Ron DeSantis, saying Indians are among the highest earning ethnic groups in US.The comments follow the release of figures showing Indian employees in Germany earned more than any other nationality in 2024.According to a report published by the employer‑linked Institute of the German Economy (IW), the median gross monthly wage for Indian workers reached €5,393. This was higher than the pay for Austrians at €5,322, US nationals at €5,307, and Irish nationals at €5,233.Overall foreign workers in Germany earned a median gross income of €3,204.German workers earned €4,177, which was about €1,200 less than the median pay for Indian employees.The study said Indian nationals earn high salaries mainly because many work in technical and academic jobs. The number of Indians in MINT fields, which cover maths, IT, science and engineering, has grown almost nine times since 2012 to over 32,800.About one-third of full‑time Indian workers aged 25 to 44 were employed in MINT occupations. The trend was supported by a hefty rise in Indian students in Germany. Many of them completed their studies, stayed on, and contributed to research and innovation. The report said that patent applications involving inventors of Indian origin increased twelvefold between 2000 and 2022.IW expert Axel Plünnecke described skilled immigration from India as “a particular success story,"" according to DW.Since 2012, the German government has actively recruited skilled workers from outside the European Union, with a focus on academic and technical professions. In 2024, the then German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government introduced a range of measures designed to encourage immigration from India.The analysis covered nationalities with more than 5,000 full‑time employees in Germany and used data from the Federal Employment Agency.",Richard Hanania has previously defended H‑1B visas and condemned anti‑India hate prevalent in the conservative circles of America.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax currently applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of personal income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Bahrain offers long-term residency with lower investment thresholds and fewer financial barriers to entry.

Clear restrictions and religious guidelines





Approval process and record management



Repeal of previous rules and broader implications









Saudi Arabia has unveiled a detailed framework governing how public facilities across the Kingdom are named. The regulations, recently approved by the Saudi Cabinet and published in the Umm Al-Qura Gazette, aim to unify naming practices, strengthen administrative oversight, and ensure compliance with Islamic principles. They are set to come into force 120 days after publication and will apply to all publicly owned facilities nationwide.According to Saudi Gazette, the new rules define public facilities broadly, covering municipal buildings, educational institutions, cultural centres, sports venues, religious sites, healthcare establishments, transport infrastructure, and other government-owned assets. Each government entity will be responsible for naming facilities under its jurisdiction, following the unified framework and relevant laws.To implement the system, entities must issue their own executive bylaws. These internal regulations will outline organisational, technical, procedural, and operational requirements, while also setting governance mechanisms to oversee naming decisions.The regulations introduce strict prohibitions on certain naming practices. Public facilities cannot be named after Kings of Saudi Arabia, Crown Princes, or leaders of allied nations without explicit approval from the King.Names that contradict Islamic Sharia are also strictly forbidden. Additionally, the rules set limits on the use of the Names of God. Only seven names are permitted for public facilities: Al-Salam, Al-Adl, Al-Awwal, Al-Nur, Al-Haqq, Al-Shahid, and Al-Malik.When naming a facility after an individual, authorities must verify the person’s integrity. This includes reviewing their intellectual orientation, criminal history, and security record, in coordination with relevant bodies. The chosen name must reflect the individual’s status and public standing appropriately.The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing will issue official naming categories after consulting relevant authorities. All government entities are required to comply with these classifications. The final approval of any facility name rests with the head of the respective entity, who may delegate this authority if needed.The regulations also permit the use of numerical designations, either on their own or alongside names, offering flexibility in naming conventions. To ensure coordination and consistency, each entity must maintain a comprehensive database of all public facility names under its jurisdiction. These records must be updated regularly and shared annually with the General Authority for Survey and Geospatial Information.The new framework replaces earlier provisions regarding the naming of streets and squares and overrides any regulations that conflict with the updated rules. This initiative forms part of wider efforts to modernise administrative practices, standardise public naming, and reinforce alignment with religious principles, governance requirements, and national identity.By establishing these clear and detailed guidelines, Saudi Arabia aims to create a unified, transparent, and culturally consistent approach to naming public facilities, ensuring that every decision carefully reflects the Kingdom’s values and administrative standards","The regulations aim to unify naming practices, strengthen administrative oversight, and ensure compliance with Islamic principles.

However, the GOP leader did not mention India in the list despite mentioning most of its neighbours, including China, Pakistan and Bangladesh.The chart was titled “Immigrant Welfare Recipietnt Rates by Country of Origin,” and was posted on Trump’s Truth Social platform and covers about 120 countries and territories. It lists the percentage of households receiving some form of government assistance for immigrants born in each country.Here are the top 10 and bottom 10 countries, according to the data.According to the data provided by US president, India's neighbours, Bhutan received 81.4%, Bangladesh 54.8%, Pakistan 40.2%, and Nepal 34.8%.The chart does not explain why certain countries were omitted or the specific types of assistance covered.India is not included in the chart because Indian immigrants have one of the lowest rates of welfare use among all immigrant groups, likely well below the apparent 25 per cent threshold for inclusion.Indian-American households have very high median incomes, over $151,000 per year on average in 2023, and immigrant-headed households earn around $156,000. This is largely due to selective immigration policies, such as H-1B visas, high levels of education, and employment in professional fields like technology, medicine, and engineering. These factors mean Indian immigrants are largely self-sufficient and rarely rely on government programs such as Medicaid or food assistance. As a result, India ranks far below the countries on the chart and is excluded from a list focused on higher welfare usage.","US President Donald Trump on Sunday shared data showing the rates at which immigrant households from various countries receive welfare and public assistance in the United States.
