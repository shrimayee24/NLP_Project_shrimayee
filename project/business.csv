He added that applicants will undergo anti-money laundering, criminal background, and social media checks, but the final decision rests with UAE authorities.Approved individuals receive permanent residency, can bring family, employ staff, and pursue business or professional work. Unlike earlier investment-linked visas, the nomination-based Golden Visa does not expire, even if assets are sold.The ‘One Touch’ Golden Visa service simplifies the entire process of visa application, identity documentation, renewals, and status changes—conveniently bundled into a single step.This new initiative reflects the UAE’s growing strategic and economic ties with India, particularly after the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) signed in 2022. The nomination-based model is expected to extend to other CEPA countries like China in future phases.Alongside the nomination model, the traditional investment and merit-based routes for Golden Visas remain active.

‘Govt looking to redevelop some post offices for leasing’: Jyotiraditya Scindia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-looking-to-redevelop-some-post-offices-for-leasing-scindia/articleshow/122287179.cms,"Jyotiraditya Scindia

You have spent a year with the current portfolios in the current Modi dispensation. There was focus on the North-East. How do you view the progress during your tenure in the ministry?

How far have you expanded the 5G coverage?

BSNL is seen as the next Air India. What is being done to ensure that it remains financially viable and a relevant player in the market?

You spoke about avoiding duopolies…

Vodafone Idea is very fragile. Is there a plan for fresh support?

You have a plan to make the postal department a profit centre. Is it really possible?

How do you take on competition from couriers?

Is there a plan to monetise prime real estate?

What is the department doing to improve the telecom services?

■ PM has identified the North-East as the area with maximum focus. Since Independence, it was consistently neglected. PM has changed the paradigm and decided to make the North-East the growth engine of our development paradigm. Over the last 11 years, he has himself visited the North-East more than 70 times, which is more than all PMs together in the previous 65 years. He has ensured that the Cabinet continuously keeps in touch with the grassroots of the NorthEast. Cabinet ministers have visited the NorthEast over 700 times. Around Rs 5 lakh crore is being invested in plug and play infrastructure. There is a massive build-up in road, railway and airport infrastructure. Private companies are putting in investment. At the NorthEast Investment Summit, they committed to invest Rs 4.2 lakh crore, and I am not counting investments such as the Rs 27,000 crore for a semiconductor facility being set up by the Tata Group in Assam.■ There has been a phenomenal change. PM had the foresight and capability to not only assess the revolution that was coming but also ensure that India leads it. It is evident from the rise in subscribers, the cost has come down for consumers.India can become the data capital of the world. We have the fastest 5G rollout with 99.6% of the districts now covered and 82% population. We have built our own 4G stack. BSNL has installed 94,500 towers and 80-85% are commissioned. We are working towards leading the world on 6G.■ After 18 years BSNL has done a turnaround, posting a quarterly profit for the first time since 2007. In the Dec quarter, it posted a profit of Rs 262 crore and in the March quarter, the profit was Rs 280 crore. For the full year, losses have come down 55% to Rs 2,415 crores; operating profit has more than doubled to Rs 5,395 crore. It has done the largest capex, of Rs 25,000 crore in FY25, which will be amortized over 10 years. It has rolled out 4G. We have grown our customer base, focusing on all areas and all segments.■ India is not a duopoly. We are the only few markets in the world with four players. My responsibility as the minister is to ensure that customers have choice, whether it’s internet or telecom.■ There will be no more conversion of equity. It’s the company’s management to look at their business strategy, profitability, just as the BSNL management.■ We have undertaken a business process reengineering and converted the department into six verticals and four horizontals looking at mail, international mail, parcels, Postal Life Insurance, post office savings bank and citizen centric services. Every transaction now has a cost structure and we are mapping the revenue. We are looking at six strategic business units with profit and loss for each. We are then determining the path to profitability for each of them. We are working on IT 2.0 and for the first time we have hired a chief technology officer with deputy CTOs for each vertical. I look at it turning into a logistics organization with a huge reach of 1.6 lakh crore post offices. The restructuring and capex by govt will hopefully turn it into a profit centre in five years. Today, our cost structure is Rs 27,000 crore and revenue is around Rs 12,000 crore.■ No one has the breadth and depth of India Post, even internationally. The point is how much can you push through this pipe and increase different products. We are now providing governmental services such as Aadhaar and passport. We are bringing new mail and parcel products; we will deliver within 24 hours. We are approaching mutual funds to distribute their products. There must be a mindset change and for that I am meeting the ground level staff.■ Whether it’s telecom or department of posts, we must sweat our assets. Therefore, if you have a large piece of land, you can have the post office on the ground floor and build the whole building and lease out space. First thing we are doing is understanding how many properties do we have, we are checking where are the title papers, the mutation details and identifying the major potential properties before we get a developer.■ Improving the quality of service (QoS) is one of my top priorities. Trai monitors performance, issues showcause notices, and imposes penalties for non-compliance. New regulations introduced in Aug mandate Six Sigma practices and graded penalties for repeated lapses. In coordination with service providers, new sites are being added and existing infrastructure upgraded to boost internet speed and reduce congestion.","PM has identified the North-East as the area with maximum focus.

NEW DELHI: Two people, a 25-year-old civil services aspirant and a 30-year-old lab technician, were killed in the massive fire at Vishal Mega Mart in central Delhi's Karol Bagh on Friday. According to the fire service, the building lacked a valid fire certificate and a case of negligence has been registered by police.The deceased were identified as Kumar Dhirender Pratap Singh and Pawan Gautam. Singh, originally from Sonbhadra in Uttar Pradesh, was found dead inside the elevator, where he is believed to have suffocated after getting trapped, while Gautam, an ITI graduate from Aligarh who worked as a lab technician, was found on the second floor.According to Delhi Fire Service, the blaze was reported at 6.44pm on Friday. Minutes later, Singh's brother, Vikram, received a desperate message from his trapped sibling. ""At 6.51pm, my brother texted me about being stuck in the lift,"" Vikram revealed to TOI. ""He pleaded, ‘Kisi tarah se bachalo, main lift mein fasa hua hoon. Bohot suffocation ke kaaran saans lena mushkil ho raha hai' (Please save me however you can, I'm trapped in the lift.I feel suffocated and cannot breathe)'.""Vikram, who was in Sonbhadra, immediately contacted his brother's friend to rush to Karol Bagh. ""She went and requested authorities to check the lift around 7pm. They told her they had done it and hadn't detected anyone inside,"" he claimed. His body was eventually recovered at 2.30am on Saturday. ""He was unconscious when we saw him. He was shirtless and in his vest, maybe because he used his shirt to cover his face to avoid the smoke,"" said Vikram. ""I wish I had been there to go into the building and save him,"" he added.Before the tragedy, Singh had been studying in a library nearby for 4-5 hours, according to his friends. Vikram remembered his younger brother, ""He had a good nature. Our mother is a govt schoolteacher in UP and he often volunteered to teach the students whenever he visited our village.""The fire broke out in the multistorey building that housed Vishal Mega Mart, gutting its basement, ground, first, second and third floors. The structure had only two staircases and one lift, with no ventilation except the entrance. Preliminary investigations suggest the fire was caused by a short circuit on the second floor.Firefighting operations were severely hampered due to the lack of ventilation in the building. Fire officers had to use JCB machines to break open the front-facing parts of the upper floors to extinguish the flames, with 15 fire tenders and 90 firefighters engaged in the fierce struggle to control the massive blaze.TOI reached out to Vishal Mega Mart for a response, but the company had not replied at the time of filing this story.","Two people, a civil services aspirant and a lab technician, were killed in the massive fire at Vishal Mega Mart in central Delhi's Karol Bagh on Friday.

""Condemning terror should be our principle, not just a convenience. If we first see in which country an attack took place and against whom, it will be a betrayal of humanity,"" he said.Modi said the attack in Pahalgam was a blow not only to India but ""entire humanity"", adding there should be no hesitation in imposing sanctions against terrorists, and that victims and supporters of terror couldn't be weighed on the same scale.Brics condemned in ""the strongest terms"" the Pahalgam attack, and backed a comprehensive reform of UNSC - two key takeaways for India from the Rio summit.PM Modi also called upon Brics to adopt a clear and unified stance on overcoming terrorism . ""On a subject like terrorism, there is no room for double standards. If any country provides direct or indirect support to terrorism, it must pay the price for it,"" the PM said.""For personal or political gain, giving silent consent to terrorism, supporting terror or terrorists, should not be acceptable under any circumstances. There should be no difference between words and actions regarding terrorism,"" said the PM.""If we cannot do this, then the question naturally arises whether we are serious about the fight against terrorism or not,"" he added.While describing the humanitarian situation in Gaza as a cause of great concern, Modi said India firmly believes that no matter how difficult the circumstances are, the path of peace is the only option for the welfare of humanity.""India is the land of Lord Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi. There is no place for war and violence for us. India supports every effort that takes the world away from division and conflict and leads it towards dialogue, cooperation and coordination, and increases solidarity and trust,"" he said.On reforms, he said with Brics having included new members the same determination must be shown to reform institutions like UNSC, WTO, and multilateral development banks.He sought to drive home his point on reforms by stating in his address that in the age of AI, where technology evolves every week, it's unacceptable for global institutions to go 80 years without reform. ""You can't run 21st-century software on 20th-century typewriters,"" said the Prime Minister.The PM said two-thirds of humanity still lack proper representation in global institutions built in the 20th century. ""Many countries that play a key role in today's global economy are yet to be given a seat at the decision-making table. This is not just about representation, it's also about credibility and effectiveness,"" he said, adding that with the Global South, these institutions are like a mobile phone with a SIM card but no network.They're unable to function properly or meet the challenges of the 21st century, said Modi, adding that the Global South has often faced double standards.""Whether it's about development, distribution of resources, or security related matters, the interests of the Global South have not been given due importance,"" he said, adding that whether it's ongoing conflicts, the pandemic, economic crises, or emerging challenges in cyber or space, global institutions had failed to offer solutions.","PM Modi calls on Brics to adopt a clear and unified stance on overcoming terrorism.

Poll Do you believe stricter enforcement of traffic rules will reduce road crashes in Delhi-NCR? Yes, absolutely No, it won't help

NEW DELHI: Concerned over unabated violation of traffic rules by two and three-wheelers entering the main carriageway of expressways and access-controlled stretches in Delhi-NCR, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has asked the Delhi Police to “strictly enforce” the ban on such vehicles on high-speed corridors.Gadkari has also directed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to remove hoardings and illegal advertisements on national highways and expressways, as these can distract drivers and become the cause of a crash.The issues had come up for discussion at a meeting chaired by Gadkari and attended by Delhi Lt Governor V K Saxena and CM Rekha Gupta on June 4.As per the minutes of the meeting issued this week, NHAI and highway ministry officials highlighted that the entry of two and three-wheelers has been prohibited on the main carriageway of the Badarpur Elevated Highway as per a Feb 16 notification. Similarly, a Jan 2021 notification prohibits these vehicles on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway.Similarly, a notification was issued in Jan 2024 prohibiting these vehicles on UER-II, Delhi-Gurgaon and Dwarka expressways. “The traffic police were instructed to ensure strict enforcement of these restrictions across all these stretches,” reads the minutes of the meeting.Gadkari’s direction comes amid growing concerns over crashes caused by the unauthorised entry of these vehicles. Officials said, despite signage and regulations, enforcement has been lax, leading to widespread disregard for rules. “The minister had said that maintaining discipline on high-speed roads is crucial for reducing road crashes and ensuring smooth traffic flow. Only the fear of getting caught every time for violations can be a deterrent and police have to enforce this,” said a highway ministry official.TOI last week had highlighted how almost 63% of traffic rule violations on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and the newly opened Dwarka Expressway were due to illegal entry of two and three-wheelers on these access-controlled stretches.",Union minister Nitin Gadkari asks Delhi Police to ‘strictly enforce’ ban on 2 & 3 wheelers on high-speed corridors in Delhi-NCR.

The directive comes after witnessing a significant massive impact of the tragic June 12 AI 171 crash in which 260 people lost their lives on the mental health of both pilots and cabin crew. AI even saw mass sick reporting by them soon after the crash on a few days as the many of the crew members were too stressed to report to work in the right frame of mind.“The DGCA has asked AI to hold the workshops and offer support. AI despatch now often has a psychologist in case some crew members wants counselling before operating their flight. IndiGo, which has a very wide network, has been asked to conduct e-modules of this workshop,” said officials across airlines.Pilots are especially on the tenterhooks as there has been no preliminary report even 24 days after the accident that could indicate what caused the crash just 30 seconds after take off. No one knows who all are investigating the crash, apart from AAIB chief. That suspense is taking its toll on everyone, but more so airline crew. Now it is common for crew to say a silent prayer first when an aircraft gets safely airborne and then when it completes its journey.The DGCA has even directed the major airlines “not to push” crew to come to work if they are not feeling upto it to operate a flight. “Mental health affects physical health, which in turn affects the ability to operate flights safely. Till the cause, even a preliminary one, is known of AI 171 crash, the feeling of jitteriness among crew members is likely to continue,” they said.“One of the two major Indian carriers has been putting crew members on standby duty whenever it wants, thereby inducing more stress among pilots even though there are required number of standby crew when the flight programme is published. Then there are continuing pay issues with the fix pay being reduced to 40 hours from 70 earlier. Our weekly offs are not printed on the rosters. As it is this was causing both mental and financial stress among pilots. The crash has made things even worse for us,” said pilots.Multiple pilots, especially of the Boeing 787 that crashed in Ahmedabad last month, have been reporting trauma after the accident. “The conversation in cockpits these days is mostly limited to what could have caused the crash. What is it that went wrong. That is really eating us up. With no guidance from the probe panel so far, we are all in the dark and jittery,” said multiple pilots.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has guidelines on how aviation medical examiners should assess and evaluate pilots for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The European, Australian and International Civil Aviation Organisation also have guidelines for the assessment of PTSD in aviation. PTSD is known to compromise aviation safety.",The directive comes after witnessing a significant massive impact of the tragic June 12 AI 171 crash in which 260 people lost their lives.

India has expressed its reluctance to lower import duty on agricultural products while controlling the entry of genetically modified maize and soybean.Goyal said govt has prescribed a minimum import price of Rs 50 a kg and there is also a 25% import duty, translating into a protection of around Rs 75 a kg and a selling price of at least Rs 125-150 a kg. With domestic prices linked to the cost of imported goods, Goyal argued that a sharp increase in protection will raise retail prices further, making them unattractive to consumers and hurting overall demand.""To give the taste of Kashmir apples to the country, price has to be affordable. We need to balance between the interests of producers and consumers. We will see if MIP and other protection can be increased,"" he said.With production not keeping pace with growing demand, India imports 4.5-5 lakh tonne of apple, with Turkiye being among the largest sources. The US is seeking to topple Turkiye by seeking preferential duty access.Goyal told local businessmen govt was making efforts to step up exports of Indian goods through free trade agreements. While asserting that the Modi govt kept the country's interests paramount, he also said trade liberalisation cannot be a one-way street and as part of trade deals, both countries needed to open markets.He said the new rail link from Kashmir will help move goods faster to the rest of the country and assured businesses that development work will be pushed by the Centre.Noting that the Pahalgam terror attack was meant to hurt tourism and the economy in Kashmir, the minister said that business is returning to normal and tourist flow has also increased.", commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said govt will review protection for homegrown apples.

‘It’s Up To Them’ Owaisi Ready To Join Mahagathbandhan In Bihar Elections, Says NDA Must Go

EC uploads 2003 rolls, says most voters need not worry

Opposition says revision targets the poor, migrants

EC Trying To Push NRC 'Through Backdoor'- TMC Blasts Poll Body, Alleges 'Nazi' Action | Bihar Polls

Massive on-ground push by all parties

NEW DELHI: A fresh controversy has erupted in poll-bound Bihar over the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the state's electoral rolls, a process the Election Commission of India (ECI) insists is legally mandated, even as opposition parties allege it could end up deleting ""tens of lakhs"" of genuine voters, especially the poor, migrants, and those on the margins.While the EC said that the revision, happening after 22 years, is in line with the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, opposition parties claim the timing is suspiciously close to the assembly polls and could ""skew the voter base"".""There is nothing more transparent in a democracy than the law. “Despite apprehensions of some persons, SIR will ensure that all eligible persons are included,” Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar told TOI.As part of the roll-revise process, voters may be asked to submit documents to support their claims, not just for themselves, but also for their parents if their names are mentioned. Each document must be self-attested and submitted separately for the individual, father, and mother.However, there's one major relief: If a person's name appears in the Bihar electoral roll dated January 1, 2003, that alone will be treated as sufficient proof, no additional documents will be needed in that case.Highlighting the exclusion of Aadhaar from this voter revision process, Congress's in charge of Bihar Krishna Allavaru accused the EC of ""acting under government pressure"".""Whenever the government faces a crisis, its agencies begin such actions,"" he said.""It is strange that the very voters who elected this government are now being asked to prove their identity. By excluding Aadhaar from this voter revision process, eight crore people are being asked to submit documents they don't have,"" the Congress leader added.Trying to calm nerves, the EC clarified this week that 4.96 crore out of Bihar's 7.89 crore registered voters won't need to submit parental documents during the revision. This includes those already listed in the 2003 electoral rolls or born to such electors.To make things smoother for booth level officers (BLOs) and voters alike, the EC has uploaded the 2003 Bihar rolls on its website for easy access.On Wednesday, leaders from 11 opposition parties, including Congress, RJD, TMC, DMK, SP, JMM, and Left parties, met the Election Commission, calling the revision ""disastrous"". They warned that the EC’s guidelines on verifying if someone is ""ordinarily resident"" in a constituency may disqualify large sections of migrants, who form a major chunk of Bihar’s electorate.The opposition argued that a revision this close to elections casts doubt on the EC’s intentions. But interestingly, despite their public opposition, these parties have joined the ground-level process, appointing thousands of booth level agents (BLAs) to keep watch.Contrary to their protests, opposition parties have gone all in. The RJD has deployed 47,143 BLAs, second only to BJP's 51,964. Congress has appointed 8,586, while Left outfits like CPI(ML), CPM, and CPI have sent in their own agents. On the NDA side, JDU, LJP, and RLSP have mobilised more than 30,000 BLAs in total.The election commission claimed it was determined to follow Article 326 of the Constitution, which mandates that only Indian citizens aged 18 or above and ordinarily resident in a constituency should be enrolled.“SIR is in line with Article 326. It’s a straight question (to the parties criticising SIR): Do you agree with Article 326 or not?"" a senior EC official said.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) is revising Bihar's electoral rolls.

India-US Mini Trade Deal Soon?



India-US trade deal: India and the United States are close to finalising a limited trade agreement, with officials confirming that sensitive sectors like dairy and agriculture are expected to be left out of the current arrangement.Intense discussions are underway between both countries to finalise a mini trade deal before the Donald Trump administration's 90-day reciprocal tariff suspension concludes on July 9.In April, the United States President Donald Trump declared matching tariffs for most US trading partners, calculated on their trade surpluses with America, incorporating a 26% duty on India.Also Read | ‘India has drawn its red lines…’: Ahead of Donald Trump’s tariff deadline, officials say ‘ball in US court’ on trade deal; here’s what’s happening The Indian government seeks complete withdrawal of the 26% tariff, whilst America demands broader market entry across industries, including agricultural and dairy sectors, along with permission to export genetically modified crops to India.""The deal is in its conclusion phase,"" said an official.

As of now, they seem to be out of the ambit of this phase of the deal,"" the official told ET, adding that the agreement could be announced in the next two days.A second official confirmed that the mini trade deal would specifically address trade in goods. The source told the financial daily that both countries might proceed with additional agreements in future as various matters reach resolution.India aims to secure enhanced market opportunities in the US for its workforce-driven sectors, particularly textiles and electronics.

Chiefs owner’s wife Tavia Hunt shares heartbreaking update after Texas flood leaves family devastated and grieving,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chiefs-owners-wife-tavia-hunt-shares-heartbreaking-update-after-texas-flood-leaves-family-devastated-and-grieving/articleshow/122282560.cms,"Tavia Hunt mourns tragic loss as Texas floods devastate her community (Getty Images)

Tavia Hunt’s emotional message stirs hearts as Texas flood takes personal toll on Chiefs owner’s family



Before Tavia Hunt stood in NFL stadiums, supporting the Kansas City Chiefs as their elegant matriarch, she was a woman of deep conviction, faith, and compassion. Born in Texas, her roots are embedded in humility and service — long before the spotlight found her. So when historic floods ravaged her home state this past week, she responded not as a public figure, but as a grieving Texan—one who felt the pain personally.Days of relentless rain turned deadly, sweeping through central and southern Texas with terrifying force. Rivers overflowed, roads vanished under murky water, and homes were ripped from their foundations. Cities like Martindale, New Braunfels, and San Marcos found themselves overwhelmed by a disaster not seen since the Memorial Day floods of 2015. At least six lives have already been lost, and the toll is expected to rise.In the midst of the chaos, Tavia Hunt’s voice rose on social media—not with rehearsed statements, but raw, faithful vulnerability. “Hearts are broken,” she began in her emotional post. “If your heart is broken, I assure you God is near. He is gentle with your wounds. And He is still worthy—even when your soul is struggling to believe it. Trust doesn’t mean you’re over the pain; it means you’re handing it to the only One who can hold it with love and restore what was lost.For we do not grieve as those without hope.”Her words offered comfort where few could. This wasn’t a press release or obligatory sympathy—it was spiritual solidarity from someone who was grieving, too. As she revealed, the tragedy struck far too close. “Our hearts are broken by the devastation from the floods in Wimberley and the tragic loss of so many lives — including a precious little Hunt cousin, along with several friend’s little girls,” she shared.T hat loss, tied to Camp Mystic—a Christian summer retreat near the Guadalupe River—was among the worst of the unfolding disaster. Authorities confirmed that 27 girls from the camp remain unaccounted for. With floodwaters rising as high as 29 feet, more than 850 people have already been rescued. But Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice cautioned, “We will not put a number on the other side because we just don’t know.”For Texans like Tavia, this isn’t just a natural disaster—it’s a spiritual test, one that calls for faith, resilience, and unity. Her heartfelt post reminds us that even in public grief, there is healing in vulnerability. And in moments of devastation, it’s compassion, not celebrity, that makes the difference.Also Read: Bill Belichick’s love life in the headlines again — Jordon Hudson’s stunning reaction flips the media narrative","Kansas City Chiefs owner Tavia Hunt is a woman of deep conviction, faith, and compassion.

Pirate Software claims being made “the villain” boosted petition’s momentum as Stop Killing Games hits 1 million signatures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/pirate-software-claims-being-made-the-villain-boosted-petitions-momentum-as-stop-killing-games-hits-1-million-signatures/articleshow/122247174.cms,"(Image via YouTube/Pirate Software)

Pirate Software claims the villain narrative ignited support in the Stop Killing Games favour



""My videos do not seem to have had any impact on the movement at all.” “Making me the villain did, though,""

How did fans react to Pirate Software not being a villain narrative?



""We need pple like you pirate,”

“speaking about it as a dev from a dev PoV and simply almost no gamer could relate…”

“Sure…”

“Just stop man , just stop killing games.”

“People love drama and they love having a villain to hate.”

“People just look for a scapegoat when their stupid things start failing.”

Stop Killing Games is not an easy fight.



The Stop Killing Games petition has now surged past a million signatures, but there’s an unexpected twist. It’s not just about the milestone. Jason “Thor” Hall, popularly known as Pirate Software, the vocal critic of this moment, claims that social media backlash against him painted him as an antagonist, but truly, that turbocharged the momentum of the SKG movement. Such a counter-intuitive argument added a dramatic layer to the fight to preserve access to the purchased games.Pirate Software has directly countered the claims that his critical analysis video damaged the SKG petition. He presented some data and suggested that interest was already waning before he commented on the issue. He further made a striking assertion, saying the campaign gained crucial traction, as supporters rallied against him.Hall bluntly stated on social media,he further added, suggesting that the controversy which surrounded his stance and all subsequent online firestorm that labelled him an opposition, quite seemingly unified SKG supporters. The common enemy effect, in a manner, injected fresh energy and helped propel the petition to reach its landmark of a million signatures.The online response to Hall’s claim was a whirlwind. The fans, as usual, remain divided. While some accused him of muddying up the waters, the supporters did defend him and his perspective, with a user noting that Louis disapproved of the pile-on that’s against him.The others even acknowledged Pirate Software’s value to developers and urged collaborations. Echoing on it, a comment on X read, “You brought up some good points, and you should work with the movement instead of against it IMO. Developers like you should have a voice in this.” It further added,showing support to Hall.A user even said that they saw many creator videos, and he was surprised how people were not able to relate to what Hall was trying to say through his. For him, it was an unbelievable side to this entire ongoing drama. As per the user, he wasWhile some followers felt that Pirate Software’s impact on the movement was undeniable, despite his denial, other fans and critics just ignored all his claims. A user even responded with a one-word comment on the post, saying,Not all stood with Pirate Software, though, and skepticism did kick in amidst fans. There were direct attacks made on Pirate Software. A user on his post commented,Many X users even saw a broader human tendency here at play. As per their observation,While the other added,The idea that Pirate Software became an unintentional catalyst resonated with many and they didn't stay behind to express their words. Some even theorized that he was just a convenient target who got in the middle of the drama, due to his firm stand. As per them, people needed a bogey man and they latched on to him.Beyond all drama, there is the core aspect that was in the middle of the discussion. It’s about the petition’s core challenge- European Union copyright law. While many legal experts and Pirate Software pointed out that the goal of SKG is to force publishers to release tools that allow games to work offline indefinitely, their stance clashes fundamentally with the EU directives, which protect Digital Rights Management (DRM).The Information Society Direction of the EU mandates a strong legal shield against circumventing DRM, the action needed to preserve many games after they are shut down. Also, the existing EU consumer laws are focused on upfront information and product conformity at the purchase, and not perpetual service obligations.To grant SKG’s demand would need a radical and legally complex overhaul of all established intellectual property and contract law hierarchies in the EU, which is far beyond what the petition could achieve alone. The reality presents many hurdles, irrespective of the signature count. It shows and proves that the fight is just far from over, especially as the Stop Killing Games petition deadline is still far away.","The Stop Killing Games petition has now surged past a million signatures, but there’s an unexpected twist.

‘I couldn't support Elon Musk any longer…’: Tesla employee resigns after 7 years citing moral conflict with Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/i-couldnt-support-elon-musk-any-longer-tesla-employee-resigns-after-7-years-citing-moral-conflict-with-musk/articleshow/122188860.cms,"Tesla employee resigns after 7 years citing moral conflict with Musk

‘Tesla gave me a future’: Ex-employee on how the company transformed his life

Ex-Tesla employee quits due to Musk’s politics

An emotional exit after 7 years



Respect for the company, not the leadership

After seven years of working at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, former engineering technician Trae Cervantes has made the difficult decision to step away from the company, citing moral discomfort with CEO Elon Musk ’s recent actions. Cervantes, who began his career as a production associate in 2018, steadily advanced to an engineering technician role before formally resigning in March 2025. His departure was not spurred by workplace conditions or job dissatisfaction, but rather by a growing unease over Musk’s political involvement and public conduct.In an interview with Business Insider, Cervantes reflected on both the opportunities and challenges he experienced at Tesla. He joined the company during the high-demand ramp-up of the Model 3 production line and described his early days as physically taxing but professionally rewarding.“I started out on their production line for the Model 3 and I moved up from there,” Cervantes said. “When I started out, it was gruelling work. It was pushing heavy things up and down aisles. I was on my feet for 12 hours a day, but they also give you three to four days off a week to recover.”Tesla supported Cervantes' growth over the years, offering him access to professional development programs, including certifications in advanced manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma through local college partnerships.Cervantes credits Tesla with helping him build a career despite having no formal education or technical training before joining the company.“I was getting paid the most I'd ever gotten in my adult life,” he said. “No education, no real skills to speak of, and Tesla offered me opportunities to take charge of my life and grow my career.”He highlighted how the work culture at Tesla—particularly among peers and supervisors—was largely positive and focused on efficiency, learning, and advancement.“I stayed because they kept treating me well. I didn’t have a reason to leave for a long time,” Cervantes noted.However, Cervantes' sentiment toward the company began to shift as Musk became more active politically and made several high-profile public moves, including acquiring Twitter and engaging in voter-related controversies.“What I took issue with the most was the giveaway for prospective voters,” he said, referring to a public campaign Musk promoted. “It seemed so morally wrong. I didn't want to be associated with that.”The turning point for Cervantes came when Musk's public image, behaviour, and political commentary became more prominent in association with Tesla’s identity.“Last year, I started to be ashamed to tell people where I work,” he admitted.While Cervantes did not go into detail about every incident that caused concern, he made it clear that the cumulative effect of Musk’s public actions led him to feel ethically conflicted about remaining with the company.Cervantes decided to leave Tesla without securing another job. He described his final conversation with his supervisor as emotional and honest.“I have to leave. I can't do this anymore. It's getting to a point where I feel like I'm compromising myself morally by walking through those doors every day,” he recalled telling his manager.The decision was not taken lightly. “I’m not going to lie, I cried a little. Seven years is a long time, and Tesla wasn’t always a bad thing for me,” Cervantes shared.While Cervantes walked away from his position at Tesla, he was careful to clarify that his issue was not with the company’s workforce or its mission, but with its leadership.“There are plenty of good people at Tesla. I didn’t leave the place because of the company. I left because of the face of the company,” he stated, referring directly to Elon Musk.","Trae Cervantes worked as an engineering technician at Tesla's Gigafactory in Nevada for seven years.

What is the Einstein visa? How Melania Trump qualified for a visa reserved for Nobel-level talent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-einstein-visa-how-melania-trump-qualified-for-a-visa-reserved-for-nobel-level-talent/articleshow/122204926.cms,"

What is the EB-1 or 'Einstein' visa?

How did Melania Trump qualify for the Einstein visa?

The larger debate: Loopholes, privilege, and policy





When Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the “Einstein visa,” in 2001, it raised eyebrows and continues to stir debate. Reserved for individuals with “extraordinary ability” in fields such as science, arts, education, business, or athletics, the EB-1 green card is typically associated with Nobel laureates, Olympic medalists, or globally recognized experts. Melania, a Slovenian model at the time, was not widely known for groundbreaking accomplishments, prompting questions about how she met the high bar required. So, what exactly is the Einstein visa, and how did the former First Lady qualify for a program meant for the world’s best and brightest?The EB-1 visa is a US employment-based green card designed for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in specific fields, or who are recognized as outstanding professors, researchers, or multinational executives. Applicants must prove “sustained national or international acclaim” and either win a major international award (like a Nobel Prize) or meet at least three of ten criteria set by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). These include published work, media recognition, contributions to a field of major significance, or commanding a high salary compared to others in the same field.While the standards are rigorous, the process is subjective.Immigration officers ultimately decide if the evidence supports a claim of extraordinary ability. This subjectivity has sparked debate over how consistently the criteria are applied and who benefits most from its loopholes.Melania Trump, then known as Melania Knauss, was living in New York as a model when she applied for the EB-1 visa in 2000. It was approved the following year. Though she was featured in magazines and had some runway experience, she had not received prestigious modeling awards or reached the supermodel status typically associated with international acclaim. Critics argue her qualifications were modest compared to the visa's intent.Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett recently reignited the controversy, questioning whether Melania’s case truly exemplifies merit-based immigration. Her approval has drawn comparisons to other questionable EB-1 recipients, including Playboy models and niche artists who managed to craft narratives aligning with the visa’s requirements.Experts note that while the visa is often seen as exclusive, it can be awarded to applicants whose accomplishments, though not widely known, are well-documented and strategically framed within a narrow field. In Melania’s case, her successful petition may have emphasized uniqueness in her modeling niche, media presence, or professional trajectory.The EB-1 program, limited to around 40,000 visas annually, has been praised for attracting top global talent. But its subjective evaluation process has also made it vulnerable to exploitation. Legal experts and immigration attorneys admit that certain applicants with the right legal guidance can tailor their portfolios to meet the criteria, even without widely celebrated achievements.Adding to the irony, Melania later used her citizenship to sponsor her parents for green cards through “chain migration,” a policy her husband, Donald Trump, has publicly opposed. This contradiction has further politicized her immigration journey and raised broader questions about fairness, privilege, and transparency in the US immigration system.","Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the ‘Einstein visa,’ in 2001.

TOI





MUMBAI: Nearly a year after India’s accreditation system came under scrutiny for rewarding institutions with questionable ease, National Assessment and Accreditation Council (Naac) is preparing to turn the page. In about 10 days, Naac will formally start its Basic Level Accreditation system —a reset that promises to bring thousands of previously unaccredited colleges and universities into its fold.At the same time, the policy of Maturity Based Graded Level accreditation will be unveiled for public feedback. Unlike the broadbrush grades of the past, this new system divides the climb into tiers, each stacked with parameters that make reaching the summit—Level 4 or 5—a challenge for even the most seasoned institutions, said Naac chairman Anil Sahasrabudhe.Naac has announced accreditation will be a binary process. This means universities and colleges will be tagged as either ‘accredited’ or ‘still-to-be accredited’. While basic accreditation will be open to institutes graded for the first time, those already accredited earlier can opt for Maturity Based Graded Level accreditation.“The new methodology is layered with multiple parameters, making it difficult for institutes to make it to level 4 or 5, the highest an institute can score.It is not like the earlier system when it was easy to get an A or an A++,” explained Prof Sahasrabudhe. “There are strong benchmarks and growing from level 1 to 4, forget 5, will be very tough.”The new methodology was drawn up on the recommendations of Dr Radhakrishnan Committee, which was set up afterwrote a series of reports on corruption in grading system.While the future opens up, the past is quietly being put to rest. Around 50 institutions still awaiting accreditation under the old regime will finally receive theirs, after which the old portal will shut down. “A new accreditation portal for India is ready,” said Prof Sahasrabudhe. He added that this is more than just a procedural update. “It’s a reset in how educational quality is understood — not as a fixed badge of honour, but as an evolving continuum. ”NAAC will release the draft policy of Maturity Based Graded Level accreditation to encourage accredited institutions to “raise their bar, continuously improve”. The maturity based graded levels will be implemented later in the year.",Naac has announced accreditation will be a binary process.

Microsoft’s middle management is the target in its second largest ever round of layoffs



Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees Wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year. The cuts, affecting less than 4% of Microsoft's global workforce, hit the Xbox gaming division particularly hard, with several high-profile game cancellations and studio closures announced alongside the layoffs.The job cuts span multiple teams across geographies and tenure levels as Microsoft seeks to streamline operations and reduce management layers. The company cited ""organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace"" as the primary driver for the workforce reduction.The layoffs eliminated hundreds of positions across Microsoft's gaming subsidiaries, including King (makers of Candy Crush), ZeniMax, Raven Software, Sledgehammer Games, Halo Studios, and Turn 10 Studios. Microsoft also shuttered The Initiative studio and canceled the highly anticipated Perfect Dark reboot and fantasy game Everwild after years of development.Microsoft's Stockholm-based King division is cutting 10% of its workforce, eliminating approximately 200 positions.

The gaming division employed about 20,000 people as of January 2024.The latest cuts represent Microsoft's fourth mass layoff in the gaming division within 18 months, following the company's $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition in October 2023. Microsoft previously eliminated 6,000 positions in May, targeting product and engineering roles, plus an additional 300 workers in June.The company cited the need to ""remove layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness"" while redirecting resources toward artificial intelligence development.

Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan may be planning this 'big change' in company's chip manufacturing business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-may-be-planning-this-big-change-in-companys-chip-manufacturing-business/articleshow/122214957.cms,"Why Intel’s new CEO may not be ‘happy’ with chipmaking process promoted by ex-chief



Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers. This potential shift deviates from his predecessor's plans and could involve substantial investment. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, two sources familiar with the matter revealed that this new strategy for Intel's foundry business would involve offering outside customers a newer generation of technology. Analysts also reportedly believe that this next-generation chipmaking process would position Intel more competitively against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) in securing large clients like Apple or Nvidia.After taking over as the company’s new CEO in March, Tan has been reassessing the company's investment in its 18A chip manufacturing process, which was promoted by former CEO Pat Gelsinger .The Reuters report cited sources to claim that Tan has expressed concerns that 18A is not attracting enough external clients and may result in a major financial write-off if Intel stops marketing it to new customers. Intel has already spent billions on developing 18A and its variant, 18A-P.While Intel continues using 18A for in-house chips and select commitments to companies like Amazon and Microsoft , Tan may be shifting focus to the 14A process, the Reuters report claims.Intel believes 14A could offer a stronger competitive position against Taiwan-based rival TSMC, whose N2 and N3 technologies are already in production or close to it, the report adds.As per the Reuters report, Tan is expected to present strategic options to Intel’s board, potentially by this month. However, a final decision may not come until later in the year due to the high stakes involved.Meanwhile, Intel continues restructuring under Tan’s leadership, with steps including new engineering hires and streamlined management. Last year, Intel posted a net loss of $18.8 billion, which was its first unprofitable year since 1986, as it works to regain ground lost in past tech transitions.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers.

Stable forests key to south India's unique biodiversity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/stable-forests-key-to-south-indias-unique-biodiversity/articleshow/122288857.cms,"



HYDERABAD: A mix of stable tropical forests and ancient climate changes led to peninsular India's unique biodiversity over millions of years, according to a study by researchers at the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad. By examining 33 groups of animals and plants, scientists discovered that some species slowly evolved thanks to long-term ecosystem stability, while others were shaped by drastic changes in climate and landscape between 11 and 3 million years ago.Peninsular India extends from the Aravalli mountains southwards, including the Satpuras and Vindhyas, the Eastern Ghats, the Deccan Plateau and global biodiversity hotspot of Western Ghats. It harbours highly diverse groups of animal and plant species, many of which do not occur anywhere else in the world.The study published in Ecology Letters uncovered how species evolved and disappeared across South Asia and the wider Asian region.By analysing the 33 well-studied groups of animals and plants using mathematical models, the team traced patterns of species formation (speciation) and loss (extinction) across the region.""Each of the groups comprises closely related endemic species and a common ancestor that existed at some point in time. Through millions of years, their descendants spread across the landscape and diversified into multiple species, many of which exist today,"" said CCMB scientist Dr Jahnavi Joshi.The researchers found a high disparity in how species are formed or lost across groups of animals and plants. They found evolutionarily related groups, such as different kinds of lizards, exhibited similar rates of forming and losing species.They also found that half of animal and plant groups accumulated diversity gradually over millions of years.""The stability of the tropical forest ecosystems in Peninsular India has allowed for such steady diversification. As a result, this area has served as a refuge for species from severe climate changes,"" said Joshi.Pragyadeep Roy, first author of the study, added: ""The stability of this ecosystem is surprising given the turbulent geo-climatic past of the landmass. Peninsular India was once part of the Gondwanaland supercontinent with land masses such as Africa and Australia. It broke away 100 million years ago, drifted northward, and collided with Asia, forming the Himalayas. Despite drastic geo-climatic shifts from this movement, the biodiversity changed steadily. This highlights the resilience of its forest habitats.""""Global temperatures have been very dynamic across millions of years, and our analysis suggests earth's temperature strongly influences how species are formed in many groups,"" explained Roy.The study found that some groups experienced abrupt changes in the rates of forming new species within the time range of 11 to 3 million years ago. ""This period was marked by high aridification and monsoon seasonality in Peninsular India with a major expansion of grasses, leading to shrinkage of evergreen forests to the Western Ghats and mountaintops of the Eastern Ghats. These events inflicted changes in the ranges and habitats of organisms, disrupting their earlier evolutionary trends,"" the study said.",Researchers at CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad studied 33 groups of animals and plants.

HYDERABAD: Deputy chief minister Bhatti Vikramarka on Sunday stated that the Congress govt will be spending 22,500 crore on the implementation of the Indiramma housing scheme, under which 4.5 lakh houses are being constructed for the poor in Telangana. Construction is already underway for 1.1 lakh Indiramma houses, with work on the remaining units set to begin soon.The govt has sanctioned 4.5 lakh housing units in the first phase of the scheme. The govt is extending 5 lakh financial assistance to the scheme beneficiaries for the construction of houses.Addressing a public meeting held as part of the distribution of Indiramma housing sanction letters in the Madhira assembly constituency, Bhatti noted that of the 1.1 crore families in Telangana, approximately 93 lakh are benefiting from one or more welfare schemes implemented by the Congress govt.""The opposition is fearful and conspiring against us because our welfare programmes are transforming the lives of the poor for the better. Regardless of their conspiracies, this govt will continue to work tirelessly for the people. The aspirations of the poor can only be realised through the Congress govt,"" he said.He added that had the previous BRS govt fulfilled its promise to build 2-BHK homes for the poor during its 10-year tenure, there would have been no need for the current administration to invest thousands of crores in the Indiramma Housing Scheme.The present govt, he asserted, will boost revenues and channel them into welfare initiatives, enabling the poor to live with dignity.He further stated that 93 lakh families across the state are currently receiving fine rice free of cost through fair price shops. ""We are providing gas cylinders at 500 each and supplying free electricity up to 200 units for the poor. The govt is also distributing Cheyutha monthly pensions to the elderly, persons with disabilities, and single women,"" he added.","Congress govt will be spending 22,500 crore on implementation of the Indiramma housing scheme.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
