Singapore is very well plugged into the global semiconductor ecosystem. It has experience of more than 20 years in this area. This is an area that we are very keen to get into, and already we are seeing how we can cooperate with Singapore. If Singapore is already setting up facilities in India and there will be many other areas of the semiconductor itself which will be discussed and cooperation moved forward during the visit, we expect the visit to give thrust to this particular area in our cooperation...""The MEA official also said that from the point of trade and investment, the Prime Minister's visit to Singapore is significant. Singapore is India's largest trading partner in Asean. Singapore is India's 6th largest trade partner worldwide and the largest source of FDI during the last financial year.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi embarked on a three-day visit to Brunei Darussalam and Singapore on Tuesday.

'9th fail leading Bihar's development': Prashant Kishor targets Tejashwi Yadav over educational qualifications,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/9th-fail-leading-bihars-development-prashant-kishor-targets-tejashwi-yadav-over-educational-qualifications/articleshow/113007774.cms,"NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor attacked Bihar's deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav 's ability to lead the state's development. Kishor didn't mince words as he questioned Yadav's educational qualifications , pointing out that he failed to clear the 10grade despite his privileged background.Speaking at a gathering in Bhojpur, Bihar, Kishor said, ""If someone could not get educated because of lack of resources, it is understood.But if someone's parents are chief minister and he could not pass 10th class, then this shows their approach towards education.""Kishor further criticised Yadav's educational background and highlighted the irony, saying, ""A 9th fail is showing the way to Bihar's development. He (Tejashwi Yadav) doesn't know the difference between GDP and GDP growth and he will tell how Bihar will improve?""Kishor challenged Yadav's credentials, arguing that his only claim to leadership is being the son of former chief minister Lalu Yadav and a leader in RJD due to family ties . He highlighted that Yadav must work hard and prove himself through actions to build a reputation beyond his family name.Kishor also questioned Yadav's upcoming state tour, set to begin on September 10, urging him to connect with constituents on foot instead of relying on a convoy of vehicles and staged photo opportunities.He criticised Yadav's promises of government jobs as misleading, pointing out that the existing 23 lakh government employees in Bihar only account for 1.97 per cent of the population, and even if Yadav delivers on his promises, 98 per cent of the people would remain unaffected.Kishor also challenged Yadav to speak about socialism for five minutes without reading from a paper, implying that Yadav lacks the necessary understanding to discuss such concepts.Speaking on the caste census, Kishor supported its implementation but criticised the current political discourse surrounding it as a tool for political gain. He suggested that parties genuinely concerned about the issue should first implement the census in states where they hold power and provide economic benefits to the respective communities, including the Congress party in the states they govern.","Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor attacked Bihar's deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav's ability to lead the state's development.

Garud Commando Force

Ghatak Force

COBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action)

Special Frontier Force (SFF)

Special forces , or Special Operations Forces (SOF), are elite military units designed for high-stakes missions that require specialised skills and tactics. Emerging in the early 20th century and expanding significantly during World War II, these forces have become vital for disruptive operations, including sabotage and covert strikes. Their primary role is to handle high-risk situations that demand precise and strategic intervention.Established by the Indian Navy in 1987, MARCOS excels in direct actions, special reconnaissance, amphibious warfare, and counter-terrorism.Known for their rigorous training and mental toughness, MARCOS are often referred to as the ""Dadiwala Fauj"" (Bearded Army) due to their disguises.India's premier counter-terrorism force, the NSG, is tasked with VIP security, anti-sabotage checks, and neutralising threats to critical infrastructure. With a demanding selection process that sees a 70–80% dropout rate, the NSG is split into the Special Action Group (SAG) and the Special Rangers Group (SRG).Formed in 1966, the Para SF is part of the Indian Army 's elite Parachute Regiment. These commandos specialise in rapid deployment behind enemy lines to disrupt and destroy key defensive positions.Created in 2004, the Garud Commando Force is the Indian Air Force’s special operations unit. It boasts the longest training period among Indian special forces—three years. Garud commandos are responsible for protecting air force bases, conducting rescue operations, and supporting air operations.Operating within the Indian Army, the Ghatak Force consists of elite infantry platoons that lead assaults and spearhead strikes. Each battalion has a Ghatak Platoon, composed of highly motivated and physically fit soldiers trained for counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations.A specialised unit of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), COBRA was formed to combat Naxalism. It is one of the few Indian forces exclusively trained in guerrilla warfare and has played a significant role in countering Naxalite groups.Established in 1962, the SFF was created for covert operations behind enemy lines, particularly in conflicts with China. Operating under India's external intelligence agency, RAW, the SFF reports directly to the Prime Minister and the Directorate General of Security.","Special forces, or Special Operations Forces, are elite military units designed for high-stakes missions that require specialised skills and tactics.

"Govt approves mega Rs 26,000 crore deal for 240 aero-engines for Sukhoi-30MKI fighters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-approves-mega-rs-26000-crore-deal-for-240-aero-engines-for-sukhoi-30mki-fighters/articleshow/113001721.cms,"NEW DELHI: A mega over Rs 26,000 crore deal to procure 240 aero-engines to power and sustain the Sukhoi-30MKI jets was cleared by the PM-led cabinet committee on security on Monday, at a time when the IAF is grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons when at least 42 are needed to tackle the twin threat from China and Pakistan.The 240 AL-31FP aero-engines will be procured from defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), which in turn will source some components from Russia .“The aero-engines will have an indigenous content of over 54%, enhanced due to indigenisation of some key components. The engines will be manufactured at the Koraput division of HAL ,” a defence ministry official said.The delivery of these aero-engines is slated to begin after one year, with the entire order being completed over eight years. The IAF currently has 259 Sukhois, the bulk of them licensed produced by HAL for over $12 billion from Russia, which constitute the backbone of its combat fleet.Another 12 new Sukhois along with associated equipment are now being ordered for around Rs 11,500 crore to replace the ones that crashed over the years.The CCS in Feb has also cleared new engines for the around 60 MiG-29 fighters in the IAF fleet for Rs 5,300 crore, which too will be manufactured by HAL with Russian collaboration.The IAF is now ordering aero-engines in bulk, instead of the earlier piecemeal orders, to bring down the costs and enhance the indigenous content. Engines need to be replaced at least two to three times during a fighter’s operational life.“Sukhois constitute one of the most powerful and strategically significant fleets of the IAF. The supply of these aero-engines by HAL would meet the fleet sustenance requirement to continue unhindered operations and strengthen the country’s defence preparedness,” the official said.India’s failure to indigenously produce aero-engines for fighters, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, has been a major problem over the years. The delay in supply of GE-F404 turbofan jet engines by US firm General Electric, for instance, has hit the delivery timeframe of 83 indigenous Tejas Mark-1A jets to IAF, contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore contract in Feb 2021.India and the US are now, of course, also conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for the co-production of GE-F414 jet engines for the planned Tejas Mark-II fighters in India, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion, as reported by TOI earlier.On the Sukhoi front, there is also a major indigenous upgrade plan to make the existing fighters much more lethal with advanced radars, avionics, longer-range weapons and multi-sensor fusion to ensure they are capable of air combat for another 30 years. This Rs 63,000 crore project will also soon head for the final clearance by the CCS, as was earlier reported by TOI.","A mega over Rs 26,000 crore deal to procure 240 aero-engines to power and sustain the Sukhoi-30MKI jets was cleared by the PM-led cabinet committee on security on Monday.

CJI pitches for all-India judicial services to fill vacancies and reduce pendency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-pitches-for-all-india-judicial-services-to-fill-vacancies-and-reduce-pendency/articleshow/112974896.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud on Sunday said district courts working with 30% vacancy in judicial officers had achieved 95% disposal rate and said to tackle the monstrous backlog of 4.5 crore cases, time had come to think of implementing All India Judicial Services (AIJS) for quick filling of vacancies for expeditious disposal of cases and reducing pendency .Speaking at valedictory ceremony of the two-day national conference of district judiciary to mark 75 years of SC, the CJI said, ""Our current national average disposal rate stands at 95%.""""Despite progress, tackling pending cases remains a challenge. Increasing our disposal-to-filing ratio hinges on attracting skilled personnel. At district level, vacancies in judicial personnel stand at 28% and of non-judicial staff at 27%. For disposal to outweigh the institution of cases, courts must work beyond the capacity of 71-100%.""""Time has come to think of national integration by recruiting members to judicial services across narrow walls of regionalism and state-centred selections,"" he added. Centre's AIJS, proposed in 2015, had virtually no takers, as only Haryana and Mizoram govts and HCs of Tripura and Sikkim had favoured it. Others opposed it on grounds of linguistic barrier and federalism.The CJI said though women were outnumbering men in recent recruitments of judicial officers across states, sadly only 6.7% district court infrastructure are female friendly. ""Is this acceptable in a nation where basic level of recruitment in some states sees over 60-70% women joining?"" he asked & said judiciary's focus areas were on increasing accessibility measures which could be understood by carrying out infrastructure audits, opening medical facilities and creches in court and technological projects.""Inclusivity in judiciary is a reflection of our broader commitment to equality and justice. Some key measures are developing a comprehensive framework for gender equality in decision making; adopting measures to recruit, retain and promote members from diverse and vulnerable groups; and monitoring impact of gender equality initiatives,"" he said.He said panel on reducing arrears of cases had devised an action plan for reducing pendency through case management. Stages of tackling pendency are - preparatory stage of forming district level case management committees to identify target cases, undated cases, and reconstruction of records; resolve cases which have been pending for 10-20 years, 20-30 years and over 30 years.He said from Jan to June 2025, judiciary shall execute third phase of clearing the backlog of cases pending for over a decade in courts.",Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said district courts working with 30% vacancy in judicial officers had achieved 95% disposal rate.

"Groundwater Contamination: High Levels of Arsenic, Uranium, Iron, and Nitrate Contaminate Groundwater in Amritsar and Tarn Taran, Punjab",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/high-levels-of-arsenic-uranium-iron-and-nitrate-contaminate-groundwater-in-amritsar-and-tarn-taran-punjab/articleshow/112960513.cms,"Research highlights grave health risks from high arsenic, uranium, iron, and nitrate levels in Punjab’s Majha region groundwater. Amritsar is notably the worst affected, demanding urgent mitigation measures to address the contamination and protect public health as revealed in the analysis.

CHANDIGARH: High levels of arsenic, uranium, iron, and nitrate have contaminated groundwater in the Amritsar and Tarn Taran areas of Punjab’s Majha region. The joint research of Pondicherry University’s earth sciences department and Fatehgarh Sahib’s World University has revealed alarming indicators for public health.These institutes had evaluated the levels and spatial distribution of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) — arsenic (As), iron (Fe), uranium (U), and nitrate (NO3-) — in 2,709 groundwater samples that the state’s water supply and sanitation department had drawn from Majha’s Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Gurdaspur, and Pathankot districts.The analysis of this data suggested that arsenic levels in 16% or 334 of the locations in the study zone had surpassed the safe limit of 0.05 parts per million (ppm). Amritsar was the worst case, followed by Gurdaspur and Tarn Taran. Pathankot was the only district within safe limits.The iron concentrations in the groundwater varied widely and 12.4% of those samples had this element in levels higher than the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) recommended limit of 0.3 ppm. Amritsar was again the most impacted, followed by Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, and Pathankot. Uranium concentration was maximum in Tarn Taran, followed by Amritsar, Gurdaspur, and Pathankot. Nitrate concentration breached the WHO and Bureau of Indian Standards’ respective safe marks of 50 ppm and 45 ppm in 6.7% of the samples.The water quality index was grimmest in Amritsar, which puts its population at significant health risk. The hazard quotient for arsenic exceeded 1 for both adults and children, indicating a high non-carcinogenic risk associated with consumption. In contrast, the hazard quotient for other PTE’s was below 1, suggesting negligible non-carcinogenic health effects. However, the health index for arsenic, which considers oral and dermal exposure, indicated a very high risk for 44.10% of the samples, affecting both adults and children.These findings of Sridharan Mouttoucomarassamy, Hardev Singh Virk, and Senthil Nathan Dharmalingam are published in the international journal, Environmental Geochemistry and Health. They have concluded that the arsenic and nitrate doses in groundwater are highest in Amritsar, so the risk to that district’s population is also the gravest. Even Tarn Taran district with its elevated uranium levels has a lower cancer risk. Carcinogenic properties make these elements a major concern for human health. The study laid stress on the need for targeted mitigation strategies.","Research highlights grave health risks from high arsenic, uranium, iron, and nitrate levels in Punjab’s Majha region groundwater.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Dinesh Karthik disclosed that in his opinion youngsters Shubman Gill and Sarfaraz Khan have the potential to replace veteran batters Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane for the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, beginning on November 22 in Perth. Karthik revealed this potential squad change on Cricbuzz, attributing it to the younger players' strong performances earlier this year.""Shubman Gill and Sarfaraz Khan.Both of those batters have done really well against England in the home series that recently happened at the start of the year. I have a feeling both of them will definitely be on that flight to Australia and will be trying to do their best. We will know if they're able to replace both Ajinkya and Pujji (Pujara). Big shoes to fill, but they have the quality and calibre in them,"" Karthik stated.Gill has already made a significant impact at the international level, especially in Tests. Known for his ability to handle pressure in challenging conditions, Gill's previous performances in Australia, especially during the memorable 2020/21 series win, underscore his potential to succeed Rahane and Pujara.On the other hand, Sarfaraz Khan has emerged as a standout performer in domestic cricket, consistently scoring runs and proving his worth against formidable bowling attacks. His impressive showings in the home series against England earlier this year have drawn the attention of selectors, bolstering his case for inclusion in the squad for the rigorous Australian tour.The 2024/25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, a five-match series, promises to be a stern test for India's batting lineup.

Goa will be the first state in the country to implement a deposit refund system ( DRS ), which will protect the environment, reduce the load on oceans, forest ecosystems and result in cleaner beaches.In the DRS, if anyone purchases a non-biodegradable product in the state, the consumer has to pay an additional fee on that product. This fee will be refunded when the consumer returns the product packaging at a collection point.“DRS is currently applicable only in Goa, the first state in the country to implement it,” a senior officer said.“The deposit may vary based on the type of DRS-eligible product. Presently, a deposit of Rs 5 will apply to plastic bottles and aluminium cans, while Rs 10 will apply to any glass bottles. When you buy a DRS-eligible product, this small, fully refundable deposit will be collected on top of the MRP ,” the officer said.DRS-eligible products currently include glass bottles, aluminium cans and plastic bottles. “You can identify these containers through a unique QR code and DRS logo printed on their packaging. However, more categories can be added as the scheme moves forward,” the officer said.Goa receives tourists, nearly 10 times its population, and this puts a load on municipalities while cleaning. DRS will strengthen the existing collection and processing ecosystem.“DRS puts an onus on all the polluters, whether locals or tourists. DRS will develop the recycling industry in the state, create green jobs and add to the local economy,” the officer said.DRS is a process where a refundable deposit amount is collected while purchasing the products (non-biodegradable garbage) and is fully refunded once the consumer brings back the empty container to an authorised return point—collection or drop points established across the state.“The ease with which a consumer is buying a product, with the same ease the consumer can return the empty container. DRS enables seamless collection of post-consumer products by incentivising consumers,” the officer said.State govt has cleared the way for the implementation of DRS by issuing a notification for the procedure for collection and deposit of the non-biodegradable garbage. Govt will invite bidders to set up a system to implement DRS. “The bidder has to set up the system at his cost, and he has to recover his money from recycling the waste collected,” the officer said.",Goa will be the first state in the country to implement a deposit refund system ( DRS) DRS is a process where a refundable deposit amount is collected while purchasing the products (non-biodegradable garbage) and is fully refunded once the consumer brings back the empty container to an authorised return point.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113003186,imgsize-82626,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/113003186.jpg"

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Previous recipients include Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.In a post on the Atlantic Council’s website in February, fellows Kaush Arha and Paolo Messa credited Meloni with being “instrumental in ensuring much-needed European aid to Ukraine.” Since taking office, they added, “the Italian leader has emerged as a powerful interlocutor across Europe and the world stage.”Musk and Meloni have met on a number of occasions, including at a political festival last December thrown by the prime minister’s right-wing Brothers of Italy party.Appearing on stage, Musk discussed Italy’s demographic crisis — the country has one of the lowest birth rates in Europe — and exhorted the crowd to “make more Italians.”“As simple as it sounds, if people do not have children there is no new generation,” Musk told the audience, echoing a prominent concern of Meloni’s. The billionaire also warned of the dangers of the “woke mind virus” — a favorite talking point — and unchecked migration.The Atlantic Council event won’t be the only meeting this month between Meloni and the world’s richest man.

Toddlers should not be allowed to watch screens at all, Sweden told parents on Monday. Children under the age of two should be kept away from digital media and TV completely, the country's Public Health Agency said. Kids between the ages of two and five should be limited to a maximum of one hour of screen time a day, it said in new recommendations, while those aged six to 12 should spend no more than an hour or two a day in front of a screen.Teenagers aged 13 to 18 should be limited to two to three hours per day, the agency said. Public health minister Jakob Forssmed said Swedish teens aged 13 to 16 spend six and a half hours a day on average in front of their screens, outside of school hours. He said that didn't leave ""a lot of time for communal activities, physical activity or adequate sleep"", and lamented a Swedish "" sleep crisis "" noting that more than half of 15-year-olds did not get enough sleep.RMS Titanic, a Georgia-based company that holds the legal rights to the 112-year-old underwater wreck, has completed its first trip to the site since 2010 and released images from the expedition on Monday.

Kimchi no more? Climate change puts South Korea's beloved cabbage dish at risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/kimchi-no-more-climate-change-puts-south-koreas-beloved-cabbage-dish-at-risk/articleshow/113007804.cms,"GANGNEUNG: South Korea 's famous kimchi is falling victim to climate change , with scientists, farmers and manufacturers saying the quality and quantity of the napa cabbage that is pickled to make the ubiquitous dish is suffering due to rising temperatures.Napa cabbage thrives in cooler climates, and is usually planted in mountainous regions where temperatures during the key growing summer season once rarely rose above 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit).Studies show that warmer weather brought about by climate change is now threatening these crops, so much so that South Korea might not be able to grow napa cabbage one day due to the intensifying heat.""We hope these predictions don’t come to pass,"" plant pathologist and virologist Lee Young-gyu said.""Cabbage likes to grow in cool climate and adapts to a very narrow band of temperatures,"" Lee said. ""The optimal temperatures are between 18 and 21 Celsius.""In the fields and in kitchens - both commercial and domestic - farmers and kimchi makers are already feeling the change.Spicy, fermented kimchi is made from other vegetables such as radish, cucumber and green onion, but the most popular dish remains cabbage-based.Describing the effect of higher temperatures on the vegetable, Lee Ha-yeon, who holds the designation of Kimchi Master from the Agriculture Ministry, said the heart of the cabbage ""goes bad, and the root becomes mushy.""""If this continues, then in the summer time we might have to give up cabbage kimchi,"" said Lee, whose title reflects her contribution to food culture.Data from the government statistics agency shows the area of highland cabbage farmed last year was less than half of what it was 20 years ago: 3,995 hectares compared to 8,796 hectares.According to the Rural Development Administration, a state farming think tank, climate change scenarios project the farmed area to shrink dramatically in the next 25 years to just 44 hectares, with no cabbage grown in the highlands by 2090.Researchers cite higher temperatures, unpredictable heavy rains and pests that become more difficult to control in the warmer and longer summers as the cause for the crop shrinkage.A fungal infection that wilts the plant has also been particularly troublesome for farmers because it only becomes apparent very close to harvest.Climate change adds to the challenges facing South Korea's kimchi industry, which is already battling lower-priced imports from China, which are mostly served in restaurants.Customs data released on Monday showed kimchi imports through the end of July was up 6.9% at $98.5 million this year, almost all of it from China and the highest ever for the period.So far, the government has relied on massive climate-controlled storage to prevent price spikes and shortages. Scientists are also racing to develop crop varieties that can grow in warmer climates and that are more resilient to large fluctuations in rainfall and infections.But farmers like Kim Si-gap, 71, who has worked in the cabbage fields of the eastern region of Gangneung all his life, fear these varieties will be more expensive to grow in addition to not tasting quite right.""When we see the reports that there will come a time in Korea when we can no longer grow cabbage, it was shocking on the one hand and also sad at the same time,"" Kim said.""Kimchi is something we cannot not have on the table.

Hailing from MRC Nagar, Raja Annamalai Puram in Chennai, Maya has captivated audiences worldwide with her extraordinary talent and innovative musical style. Her journey began at the tender age of six when she picked up the guitar under the influence of her father, who, though not a professional musician, had a passion for playing riffs from iconic metal bands like Metallica and Slayer. This early exposure to rock music sparked Maya's interest, and soon she was learning to play her first song, ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" by Metallica.Maya's multicultural background has played a significant role in shaping her musical identity. Her father, an IT company owner with a background in astrophysics, and her mother, Lorina, an Australian entrepreneur, met in Australia. Maya’s diverse heritage and her family's musical inclinations inspired her to explore various genres, blending them seamlessly in her performances. At nine, she began formal training in Carnatic music with Prasanna Ramaswamy, a renowned Tamil guitarist based in New York. Prasanna's mentorship helped Maya develop a profound understanding of Carnatic music, which she skillfully integrates with her heavy metal renditions.Maya’s talent soon caught the attention of the global music community. In 2022, her cover of ""7empest"" by the Grammy-winning rock band Tool went viral on her YouTube channel, which her father had set up to showcase her skills. This performance impressed Adam Jones, Tool's guitarist, who became an admirer of her work.

Simon Cowell, known for his critical eye, hailed her as a ""rock goddess,"" while Howie Mandel predicted that her performance would go viral.Beyond her television appearances, Maya has continued to develop her musical style, drawing on her dual love for heavy metal and Carnatic music. She credits her grandmother for introducing her to Carnatic music at the age of two, a genre that has remained close to her heart even as she explored the world of metal. Maya's ambition to merge these two seemingly disparate styles has driven her to create a unique sound that reflects her diverse influences and her desire to push musical boundaries.","Maya Neelakantan is a young guitar prodigy renowned for her unique fusion of heavy metal and Carnatic music.
