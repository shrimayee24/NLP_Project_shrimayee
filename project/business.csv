NEW DELHI: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and National Conference supremo Farooq Abdullah on Thursday joined a group of singers to perform the devotional song, ""Tune Mujhe Bulaya Sherawaliye, Main Aaya Main Aaya Sherawaliye.""The NC leader was attending a religious event at Mata Vaishno Devi shrine at Jammu's Katra. He was seen donning a traditional red-coloured scarf associated with the shrine.During the event, Abdullah addressed the contentious issue of the ropeway construction project in Katra, voicing his support for local residents protesting against it. He targeted the Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board for proceeding with the project without adequately considering the interests of the community.""Those running the shrine's operations should not take actions that harm the interests of the local people or create problems for them,"" Abdullah said. He praised the residents of Katra for their resilience in opposing the project, saying, ""You showed courage and fought bravely to stop it. They have realised that power lies with the people, not the government.""Former J&K CM also highlighted the power of collective action, pointing out that the people have the ultimate authority to shape or dismantle governments. He mentioned that officials are now consulting the community to determine a more suitable location for the ropeway.He also expressed concern for locals who rely on the shrine for their livelihood. ""The people living in these hills come here to earn their livelihood with the blessings of Mata, but they have been forgotten. Those in power think they are everything, but they are not. When the power of God prevails, all else fades. Just look at what is happening in California,"" he said.Abdullah also mentioned the universality of religious teachings, saying that all faiths share common core values but are often misused by individuals for personal gain.","Farooq Abdullah was attending a religious event at Mata Vaishno Devi shrine at Jammu's Katra.

""If something is not received well, and it is inappropriate and felt as unwelcome behaviour affecting the other sex, namely the women, no doubt it would fall under the definition of sexual harassment,"" HC added, citing a US court judgment.The definition of sexual harassment, as seen from the PoSH Act, has given significance to the act more than the intention behind the same, Justice Manjula said.""It is the fundamental discipline and understanding with which employees of different genders are expected to interact with each other where decency is the yardstick and nothing else.

"Brand bar lifted, Kolkata's yellow 'kings of the road' set to stay on",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/brand-bar-lifted-kolkatas-yellow-kings-of-the-road-set-to-stay-on/articleshow/117502032.cms,"KOLKATA: Yellow taxis are here to stay in Kolkata, but the future may not be Ambassador. State govt has allowed all light commercial vehicles with taxi permits to be painted yellow, in a move aimed at preserving the cultural identity of an iconic mode of city transport. A 'light commercial vehicle', as per road rules, is any vehicle that can carry between three and six passengers. Hitherto, any such vehicle, which also had a taxi permit, could only be painted white.State govt's rule tweak - under Notification No. 3112-WT, issued by issued by transport secretary Saumitra Mohan - came in response to calls from various quarters to allow more flexibility in light passenger vehicles' colour scheme.Kolkata's yellow taxis, introduced in 1962 with Hindustan Motors' Ambassador cars, have been a cultural staple for decades. Referred to as the ""kings of the road"" for their reliability and charm, these taxis once dominated the city's transport landscape. However, their numbers have sharply declined - from 18,000 a decade ago to just 7,000 in 2024. With 4,493 vehicles scheduled to be phased out this year because of the mandatory 15-year service limit for commercial vehicles, fewer than 3,000 yellow taxis will remain by end-2025, it has been estimated. The 15-year age limit, enforced after a 2008 Calcutta HC order, has ensured adherence to green standards, but it also hastened the end of the Ambassador, the last of which was manufactured in 2014.Nostalgia aside, yellow taxis have struggled to compete with app-based cab-hailing services, which offer greater convenience and affordability, and technological advancements. Dynamic pricing and GPS tracking, among other options, have significantly reshaped Kolkata's urban commute. Experts viewed govt's move as a ""happy compromise"" - one that balances the need to preserve the city's heritage with the demands of a modern transportation system. ""Yellow taxis are an integral part of Kolkata's identity, and this decision ensures their continuation while addressing the practicalities of modern commuting,"" said Sourish Ghosh, a transport historian.Also, by allowing new car models to adopt the iconic yellow, govt has ensured that a certain part of the city's cultural identity will endure, even though the days of the Ambassador taxi may be numbered. Additionally, companies, firms or individuals who register 20 or more vehicles in a month can now choose custom colours, insignia or rooftop designs, subject to transport department's approval.","Kolkata's yellow taxis introduced in 1962 with Hindustan Motors' Ambassador cars.

Noida land acquisition: SC seeks report in 2 months

NEW DELHI: Smelling a rat in the functioning of Noida Authority and suspecting a nexus between its officials and landowners, Supreme Court on Thursday constituted a special investigation team (SIT) comprising senior IPS officers to probe the working of the Authority as well as likely payment of ""excess compensation"" for land acquired by it.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh picked three senior UP-cadre IPS officers hailing from other states - additional DGP S B Shiradkar, CB-CID IG M Rajesh P Rao and DIG Hemant Kutiyal - to form the SIT and tasked it with also probing whether the overall functioning of New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) ""lacked transparency, fairness and objectivity"".While instances of farmers not being paid adequate compensation for land acquired by the Authority were known, it now transpires there were as many as 20 instances where complaints were lodged about payment of excess compensation to some. UP Police had registered FIRs in 12 such cases.The SC bench said the SIT will probe ""whether the quantum of compensation paid was higher than the entitled amount and, if so, who the officers/officials responsible are,"" adding that the SIT was free to probe any allied issue that may arise during the inquiry.The SIT will investigate whether there was any connivance between landowners and Noida officials. It will also investigate whether overall functioning of Noida lacks transparency, fairness and objectivity,” the bench ordered, adding that the special probe team was free to probe any allied issues that may arise during the inquiry.The Justice Kant-led bench asked the SIT to submit its report in sealed cover within two months.The issue arose from the anticipatory bail petitions filed by a legal advisor and an assistant law officer of Noida, who were booked by UP Police four years ago for wrongdoings in payment of compensation for acquisition of land. The police had alleged that they had connived with landowners to release huge amounts of compensation, prima facie for extraneous considerations or on quid pro quo basis.","Supreme Court has constituted a special investigation team (SIT) comprising senior IPS officers.

"Tamil Nadu may be the birthplace of Iron Age, says study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-findings-in-state-push-iron-age-back-by-1000-years/articleshow/117496995.cms,"Turning point in Indian archaeology: ASI ex-DG

CHENNAI: Iron Age could well have begun in today's Tamil Nadu, at least 1,000 years before it was earlier estimated, recent dating of samples from burial urns at Sivagalai in Tuticorin district show.The two charcoal samples found along with iron objects at the site have been dated to 3,345 BCE and 3,259 BCE, which makes the Iron Age here the oldest in the world. Earlier, people of the Hittite Empire (in today's Turkiye) were believed to be the first to use iron, in 1,380 BCE. ""We have scientifically established that iron was introduced 5,300 years ago in the Tamil landscape. The Iron Age began from Tamil land,"" said chief minister M K Stalin, releasing the study ‘Antiquity of Iron: Recent Radiometric Dates from Tamil Nadu' by K Rajan and R Sivananthan on Thursday.Samples from Sivagalai were analysed by three leading research labs — Beta Analytics in US, Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, and Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences in Lucknow. “They all dated the objects to around the same period,” Stalin said, asserting that more metallurgical analysis of the iron objects and future excavations in iron ore-bearing zones could further strengthen these findings.Scholars believe these dates suggest a contemporary Iron Age civilisation in southern India during the same period as Indus Valley civilisation in north and northwest India. “When cultural zones located north of Vindhyas experienced Copper Age, the region south of Vindhyas might have entered Iron Age due to limited availability of commercially exploitable copper ore,” the report said.Tamil Nadu archaeology department study has revealed that more than 90% of the ancient graffiti marks found at 140 archaeological sites in the state have parallels or similarities with those of Indus Valley (also known as Harappan civilisation) that existed from around 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE.“The recent radiocarbon dates indicate that when Indus Valley experienced Copper Age, south India was in Iron Age. In this sense, Iron Age of south India and Copper Age of the Indus were contemporary,” said archaeologist Rajan, the report’s co-author.ASI’s former director general Rakesh Tewari described the findings from Sivagalai as “a turning point” in Indian archaeology. “Once it appeared that when Indus Valley was flourishing in the western part of the country, other areas did not have contemporary cultures. But now things are changing,” he said. Before the latest findings, the earliest known iron objects in Tamil Nadu were dated to 2172 BCE from excavations at Mayiladumparai in Krishnagiri district.The samples from Sivagalai were analysed using advanced techniques such as accelerometer mass spectrometry radiocarbon (AMS14C) dating for charcoal and optically stimulated luminescence (OLS) dating for ceramics. A total of 11 dates were obtained from the site, with six dating earlier than 2400 BCE.More than 85 iron objects, including knives, arrowheads, rings, chisels, axes, and swords, were collected from various levels within and outside the urns.Another notable finding from the region was at Adichanallur, also in Thoothukudi district, where a charcoal sample linked with an iron object was dated to 2517 BCE.In comparison, sites like Brahmagiri in Karnataka and Gachibowli near Hyderabad have yielded Iron Age dating of 2140 BCE and 2200 BCE, respectively.“For the first time in the world, smelted iron has been dated back to the middle of the third millennium BCE. It is not just a significant discovery in the Indian context, but also in the context of archaeology of the world,” said Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, emeritus professor of South Asian Archaeology at Cambridge University, adding, “About 60 years ago, the antiquity of iron in India did not go beyond the 6th century BCE. From then to the 25th century BCE is a big jump.”"," charcoal samples found along with iron objects at the site have been dated to 3,345 BCE and 3,259 BCE.

"Crypto scam: Payment gateways Paytm, Razorpay under ED lens",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crypto-scam-payment-gateways-paytm-razorpay-under-ed-lens/articleshow/117499567.cms,"NEW DELHI: Razorpay, PayU, Easebuzz and Paytm are among eight payment gateways that have come under investigation with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) freezing around Rs 500 crore in their virtual accounts over the last two years in connection with 10 Chinese nationals running one of the biggest cryptocurrency scams, HPZ Token, from India.The accused allegedly collected over Rs 2,200 crore from people across 20 states and remitted the 'proceeds of crime' out of the country, a part of which was frozen with the payment gateways before they were remitted to beneficiaries. While making bulk payments, the amount remained with the gateways for a day or two, during which ED had frozen around Rs 500 crore.The agency is investigating the money trail and also checking if the payment gateways had generated suspicious transaction reports (STR), and alerted the RBI and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). All financial institutions have to generate STRs and report them to the RBI periodically, which forwards them to the FIU for enforcement agencies to investigate further. Of the total Rs 497 crore frozen in the virtual accounts of payment gateways, PayU had highest at Rs 130 crore of the alleged 'proceeds of crime' related to the HPZ Token scam, followed by Rs 33.4 crore with Easebuzz, Rs 18 crore with Razorpay, Rs 10.6 crore with CashFree and Rs 2.8 crore with Paytm, a senior official said. The other payment gateways where ED has frozen the alleged scam money, include WunderBaked, AgreePay and SpeedPay.The accused ran a pan-India operation with companies incorporated in at least 20 states, where people were given the option to invest in the mining of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoins, through mobile app HPZ Token. More than 50 companies were registered in Delhi having 84 bank accounts, 26 firms in Karnataka with 37 bank accounts, 19 in Haryana and 11 in UP, besides Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.In this case, a PMLA court in Nagaland on Jan 22 declared a Delhi resident, Bhupesh Arora, as a fugitive economic offender as he refused to appear before the agency despite a non-bailable warrant against him. ED said Arora fled to Dubai in 2022 after it began investigations.

He said he had planned his escape route from Meghalaya and crossing Mulki river to Barisal Sardar in Bangladesh,"" a police source told TOI. Last year, Shariful had entered India by crossing Dawki river on the India-Bangladesh border at Meghalaya, paid Rs 10,000 to an agent to have him taken to Assam, and then took a bus to Kolkata, where he stayed for three days before taking a train to Mumbai in May.On Wednesday, police completed the crime scene reconstruction with the recovery of a white plastic bag near Bandra Talao. ""The bag contained various tools including a screwdriver, hammer, hacksaw blade, and a broken knife piece, which the accused had discarded near Bandra Talao, around 1.4km away from Khan's Satguru Sharan building on St Teresa Road,"" said a police officer.During the re-enactment, Shariful demonstrated to the police team his entry method: scaling a 4-ft wall to enter Satguru Sharan premises, using a ladder to climb 12ft to access the duct, reaching the fourth floor where he cut the rat mesh with a knife. He then used the staircase to reach the 10th floor, from where he climbed through the duct pipe to enter the bathroom in Khan's 11th floor flat. He used the same route to escape. He showed police that he used the same duct from fourth floor to scale down before he jumped 12ft after noticing that the ladder was missing.The probe team visited multiple locations with Shariful, including Bandra Talao, his Khar sleeping spot, Bandra station, Dadar and Worli-Koliwada, where they documented statements from the salon worker who cut his hair.

Poll What Do You Think About the Attack on the Indian Consulate in San Francisco? A Criminal Act That Should Be Addressed A Serious Matter That Needs Accountability

He added that the country expected accountability from the US in the matter.""The arson attack on our consulate in San Francisco is a very, very serious matter, and it is something for which we expect accountability. We would like to see that people who did it are held responsible,"" Jaishankar said at a press conference in Washington DC.On March 19, 2023, the Consulate General of India in San Francisco faced a series of attacks. Early in the morning, assailants attempted to set the consulate building on fire by sprinkling inflammable substances.Later that day, a group of attackers engaged in criminal trespass, vandalized public property, and targeted consulate officials, escalating the severity of the incident.The video, which surfaced on social media, showed suspected pro-Khalistani protestors gathered outside the Indian Consulate, shouting slogans and heckling staff as they exited the diplomatic mission.Three months later, in July, Khalistan extremists made another attempt to set the Consulate on fire. Following this incident, an investigation was launched.The attack was condemned by the US as ""criminal offence"".Later that year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had assured the National Investigative agency that it was 'aggressively' looking into the attack."," External affairs minister S Jaishnakar on Thursday addressed the attack on Indian consulate in San Francisco, which took place in 2023.

Though the project's initial cost was estimated to be Rs 43,000 crore when the ""acceptance of necessity (AoN)"" was granted several years ago, it will be around Rs 70,000 crore now. ""It will be the task of the MoD's contract negotiation committee (CNC) to arrive at a reasonable cost,"" a source said.This comes after the ministry of defence's (MoD) technical oversight committee held the MDL-TKMS bid was ""compliant"" as per the technical parameters laid down in the tender, while the L&T-Navantia was ""non-compliant"" in the competition. The committee cleared the field evaluation trials conducted by the Navy last year, during which the German submarine demonstrated ""a fully-functional"" AIP system at sea. The Spanish submarine, however, could not exhibit a sea-proven AIP system.AIP gives a diesel-electric submarine the stealth capability to remain underwater for around two weeks, unlike a boat without it that has to surface or 'snorkel' every couple of days to get oxygen to recharge its batteries. It will, of course, take time for the actual P-75I contract to be inked, with the delivery of the first submarine slated for six-seven years after that, the sources said.MDL, of course, is also gearing up for construction of another three French-origin Scorpene submarines with AIP at a cost of around Rs 38,000 crore. The PM-led cabinet committee on security is set to clear the deal before this fiscal ends on March 31, as earlier reported by TOI.These three new boats will add to the six Scorpene or Kalvari-class submarines already built at MDL, without AIP, under the over Rs 23,000 crore 'Project-75'.Both P-75 (additional Scorpenes) and P-75I are crucial for the Navy because it is left with just six old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW submarines in its conventional underwater fleet, apart from the six new Scorpenes.",Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) in partnership with German company ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) The defence ministry will now begin techno-commercial negotiations with MDL for'Project-75 India'to build the six stealth conventional submarines.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117499787,imgsize-53150,width-400,resizemode-4/117499787.jpg"

The operation of Shinkansen trains on the entire corridor — the foundation stone for which was laid in Sept 2017 — would be possible only by 2033, sources said.The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two “indigenous” high-speed trains by the end of 2026. These trains will have the Vande Bharat base and will be designed to run on standard gauge tracks.This became evident after the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHRSCL) last week published the tender for the signalling system for running Vande Bharat trains , which are being developed as India’s indigenous bullet trains. As per the tender document, the successful bidder will have to design, manufacture, supply, install and maintain the signalling and train control system. This will be the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level-2, different from the Japanese DS-ATC signalling for Shinkansen trains.The contract period for ETCS-2 is seven years from the date of award of work. Sources said the deployment of ETCS-2 on the corridor will ensure utilisation of the infrastructure. The plan is to start commercial operations of Vande Bharat trains on this track in 2027.“There is no point in keeping this high capital-intensive project unutilised for want of Japanese trains. Even, when our own high-speed trains are operational, the installation of the Japanese signalling system for Shinkansen trains can be carried out. The timeline for introduction of the E-10 series trains (an advanced version of bullet trains) in 2030 or later can be finalised once the trains meeting Indian conditions are made available,” a source said.As per the plan, once the Shinkansen trains are fully operational, the advanced versions of Vande Bharat trains and the ETCS would be shifted to other projects.Neither the railway ministry nor the NHSRCL respond to queries about the signalling tender and the timeline of Shinkansen train operation on this corridor. However, officials said they are confident of getting the best Japanese bullet trains for the project by 2030, and that the indigenous trains, to be introduced as a stopgap arrangement, would meet the expectation of passengers.","The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two ‘indigenous’ high-speed trains by the end of 2026.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Equal parts folk hero and villain, Patel’s aggressive approach to national security has made him a darling of MAGA’s hardcore base, even as whispers about his heritage linger in the fringes.

Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the Stanford professor who loudly opposed COVID-19 lockdowns, has been embraced as the intellectual backbone of MAGA’s pandemic skepticism. He’s proof that desi academics can still dominate a debate when handed the mic.

Sriram Krishnan, the Silicon Valley darling, was tapped to shape Trump’s AI policy—a sign of the administration’s grudging acknowledgment that America’s future competitiveness hinges on talent, regardless of ancestry.

Tulsi Gabbard, while not Indian-American, is a Hindu who often gets honorary desi status. Her appointment as Director of National Intelligence feels almost like a nod to MAGA’s internationalist ambitions, even as it makes the evangelical right queasy.

Vivek Ramaswamy , MAGA’s golden child of economic policy, remains a paradox: a darling for his brash anti-woke rhetoric but suspect for his unapologetic Hinduism. He was recently dropped as co-lead of DOGE, making many wonder if his race played a part.

Admiration and Resentment: The Duality of Success



As Usha Vance stood beside her husband, Vice President JD Vance, during his historic inauguration, she exuded quiet confidence, her sari-clad presence a vivid marker of a changing America. But if you peered into the murkier corners of MAGA’s digital ecosystem that day, you’d find something far uglier than the inauguration festivities.“Christ is King, not some stinky Indian idol,” a MAGA-aligned commentator snarled online. Another chimed in with, “Will there be a cow in the White House soon?” These crude attacks weren’t just casual trolling—they were a reflection of a deeper discomfort with Usha Vance’s Hindu faith, a simmering resentment among segments of MAGA toward high-profile Indian-Americans who don’t fit the Christian nationalist mold.It’s not just Usha. Vivek Ramaswamy , the biotech entrepreneur-turned-political firebrand, and Sriram Krishnan , the Silicon Valley techie now advising Trump on artificial intelligence, have also been in the crosshairs. Despite their policy alignment with MAGA’s cherished ideals—free markets, innovation, and an America-First approach—they remain outsiders in the movement. Their sin? Being unapologetically Hindu, visibly Indian, and symbolizing a multicultural America that MAGA’s core supporters fear is slipping away.Usha Vance, the first Indian-American Second Lady of the United States, epitomizes the immigrant success story that politicians love to parade when it suits their narratives. A Yale-educated attorney and mother of three, she is a testament to America’s melting pot. But for MAGA’s more nativist wings, Usha’s Hindu identity is a red flag.“I thought Vance was a Christian,” read one comment, dripping with righteous indignation, as if interfaith marriage was the harbinger of the apocalypse. Others labeled her beliefs “pagan idolatry,” turning centuries-old evangelical hostility toward Hinduism into a 21st-century meme war. Beneath the snark and disdain lies a broader discomfort: a worldview where non-Christian religions, especially one as visually rich and philosophically pluralistic as Hinduism, are incomprehensible and, therefore, threatening.MAGA’s relationship with Indian-Americans is, to put it politely, complicated. On one hand, Donald Trump has strategically elevated several high-profile desis into key positions, making them ambassadors of a diverse MAGA 2.0. On the other hand, the nativist undercurrent within MAGA often bristles at their presence.These figures underscore Trump’s calculated attempt to woo the Indian-American demographic—a group with outsized clout in technology, academia, and finance. But their inclusion also sparks fierce resistance among MAGA’s nativists, who view them as emblematic of an America they no longer recognize.When Trump appointed Sriram Krishnan as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence, the move was hailed as a victory for pragmatism—until Laura Loomer and her ilk showed up. The far-right commentator accused Krishnan of betraying Trump’s “America First” ethos, claiming that his support for immigration reforms like removing country caps on green cards would disadvantage American workers.“Another tech bro taking over America,” sneered one tweet, weaponizing the model minority stereotype. MAGA’s digital trolls weren’t just attacking Krishnan’s policies—they were signaling their discomfort with his very presence. After all, nothing says “threat to white Christian dominance” quite like a brown immigrant revolutionizing the way America leads in global AI innovation.If MAGA were a frat, Vivek Ramaswamy would be the overachieving pledge who parties harder than the brothers and aces every exam, yet still gets left out of the group photo. Ramaswamy’s commitment to free markets and his sharp critiques of woke ideology make him a natural fit for MAGA, but his Hindu identity complicates things. Evangelical Christians, a core MAGA constituency, view Hinduism with deep skepticism. Ramaswamy’s references to the Bhagavad Gita have been criticized as relativistic—a dangerous departure from the evangelical insistence on biblical exclusivity. He’s the perfect candidate on paper, but in practice, his unapologetic Hinduism and Indian heritage keep him at arm’s length.At the heart of MAGA’s discomfort with figures like Usha Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Sriram Krishnan lies what some evangelical leaders have long referred to as “The Pagan Problem.” Hinduism, with its polytheistic traditions, vibrant rituals, and richly symbolic deities like Ganesha and Kali, has historically been framed by Christian conservatives as idolatrous and antithetical to Western values. This narrative, rooted in colonial-era missionary rhetoric, still permeates parts of the MAGA movement. For evangelical Christians, who form a significant portion of MAGA’s base, the visual and philosophical differences of Hinduism evoke suspicion and alienation. These deep-seated biases fuel the movement’s broader struggle to embrace Indian-Americans who refuse to downplay their heritage or faith, viewing them instead as symbols of an increasingly pluralistic America they fear losing control over.Indian-Americans are increasingly drawing comparisons to Jewish-Americans of the 20th century: influential, successful, and often resented. “Our clout comes from the fact that the Indian community constitutes what I call the ‘next Jews’ of America,” said Prof. Jagdish Bhagwati in 2000, and his words have only grown more prescient.Indian-Americans are the highest-earning and most educated ethnic group in the US. Their dominance in Silicon Valley—Sundar Pichai (Google), Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Arvind Krishna (IBM)—and leadership in academia, medicine, and politics mirror the Jewish-American ascent in earlier decades. But with success comes envy and suspicion, particularly in an era of economic insecurity and resurgent nationalism.Indian-Americans embody the American Dream, but that dream comes with a price. Just as Jewish-Americans faced accusations of wielding too much influence, Indian-Americans now navigate similar waters. MAGA, for all its professed meritocratic values, struggles to reconcile its admiration for their achievements with a visceral resentment of their visibility and cultural distinctiveness. MAGA’s relationship with figures like Usha Vance, Sriram Krishnan, and Vivek Ramaswamy exposes its identity crisis. The movement wants to project an image of inclusion and modernity but remains tethered to a foundation of Christian nationalism and ethnocentrism.","Usha Vance, the first Indian-American Second Lady of the United States, is a testament to America’s melting pot. “Christ is King, not some stinky Indian idol,” a MAGA-aligned commentator snarled online.

American Birthright citizenship curtailed even for legal immigrants: Over 1 million Indians in green card queue impacted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/citizenship-by-birth-curtailed-even-for-legal-immigrants-over-1-million-indians-in-green-card-queue-impacted/articleshow/117419508.cms,"Poll What’s Your Biggest Concern About the Recent Executive Order? Legal Challenges and Constitutionality Impact on Legal Immigrants

Trump signs executive order ending birthright citizenship, other immigration actions

President Donald Trump’s executive order (EO) - ‘Protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship ,’ has left the Indian diaspora stunned. Many believed that Trump’s speeches during his campaign trail of ending ‘ citizenship by birth ’ would apply only to children of illegal immigrants. The overarching belief of many Indian families was that documented (legal) immigrants like the H-1B holders, or those on other work visas like the L (intra-company) visa, or even a F (student) visa, would not be impacted. They are in for a rude shock.Over a million Indians who are in a decades-long queue for an employment-linked green card will be impacted going forward, as a child born in a family (thirty days from the date of the EO) where the mother is here lawfully but temporarily (eg: as a visitor or on a non-immigrant visa – be it a dependent visa like H-4 or even a work visa) and the ‘father’ is not a green card holder or US citizen will not get automatic American citizenship.The Times of India, in its edition dated November 7, 2024, was one of the few newspapers to correctly predict this plan of action. We had said, that if the EO is signed, it would spell a huge set-back for the Indian diaspora, as at least one parent would be required to be a US citizen or green card holder.According to an analysis of the US Census (2022) done by Pew Research, the US was home to about 4.8 Indian Americans, of whom 34% or 1.6 million were born in the US (and became American citizens by virtue of birth).The proposed plan of action is now a reality. Currently, those children who are not born in the US, and whose families are caught in the decades long green card backlog have to self deport on turning 21 or have to opt for another visa – say an international student visa. Citizenship by birth at least gave Indian couples waiting endless in queue for a green card a breather, If their child was born on American soil.Trump’s executive order points out that the 14th Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the US. It has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the US but not ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’In the context of legal immigrants, it adds: “The privilege of US citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the US: When the mother’s presence in the US at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the US under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a US citizen or lawful permanent resident (which means a green card holder) at the time of said person’s birth.”According to immigration attorneys ‘citizenship by birth’ is enshrined in the 14th amendment to the US constitution. The first lawsuit challenging this executive order has been filed by immigration right activists such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and others.Cyrus D. Mehta, New York based immigration attorney told TOI: “If both parents are in the US in a non-immigrant status, such as in H-1B and H-4 (dependant visa) status, under Trump’s EO the State Department will not issue a US passport to the child as they are no longer regarded as ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’. This EO will obviously be challenged in court, but I can see the Trump administration taking this all the way to the Supreme Court in the hope that the majority of conservative justices could agree with Trump’s new interpretation of the 14th Amendment.”“If the courts agree with Trump’s interpretation, going forward children of H-1B and H-4 non-immigrants who are born in the US, will not be recognized as US citizens. There is a ripple impact. Many Indians are caught in 100 year employment-linked green card backlogs, and so their only hope was for their child born in the US to sponsor them, when he/she attained 21 years. Now this will not be possible”Also read: Hiring freeze could lead to immigration processing delays, say experts Greg Siskind, co-founder of Siskin Susser, an immigration law firm, said: “The unconstitutionality of this is stunning. The term ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’ was never intended to apply to those targeted by the EO. It was meant to apply to diplomats who are not subject to the jurisdiction of the US. This is going to be litigated and I predict it will be enjoined before it is effective in 30 days. But obviously there's no guarantees here,”Fiona McEntee also pointed out the gender-play here, “And yes, the EO uses the terms father and mother because obviously every child is born into a family with a mother and father!!!!”Ashwin Sharma, immigration attorney told TOI, “The phrase ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’ has been consistently interpreted to include nearly all individuals born on US soil, irrespective of their parents’ immigration status, other than children of enemy occupiers or diplomats. A landmark Supreme Court case reaffirmed this interpretation, granting citizenship to a child born in the US to Chinese immigrant parents who were not US citizens. This decision established a precedent which leaves little room for reinterpretation.”The fate of children who have non-citizen, non-green card holder parents now vests with the US courts.","Many believed that Trump’s speeches during his campaign trail of ending ‘ citizenship by birth ’ would apply only to children of illegal immigrants.

Lakers legend Magic Johnson is reportedly exploring a role in NBA expansion as part of an ownership group. According to reports, Johnson could join efforts to bring a new team to Las Vegas or Kansas City. His involvement would be a significant step for the Hall of Famer who has been a successful businessman following his retirement from the league. While the legendary NBA star already has his stakes in sports ventures, the new ownership of an NBA team would bring him back to the league in a new role. Magic Johnson is widely regarded as one of the most successful athletes in business after his playing days. Along with his various business ventures, he has stakes in teams like the Los Angeles Dodgers, Washington Commanders, and LAFC.However, owning an NBA team has never been on Johnson’s radar, at least not until now. Despite his love for the Lakers, Johnson previously teased that the New York Knicks would be his top choice if given the chance.Now, that might be changing. Reports suggest Johnson could join an ownership group for an NBA expansion team in either Las Vegas or Kansas City. According to the latest report by DailyMail.Com, the 1.6 billion rich (according to Forbes’ Real Time Net Worth) NBA legend is considering joining the group of owners for the NBA’s franchise expansion.“Several investment groups in Las Vegas are interested in partnering with him. His extensive experience in sports ownership and his business acumen positions him as a formidable candidate,” Jack Bezants of The Daily Mail reported about Johnson’s potential move.The NBA Hall of Famer’s return to the league with the new league has sparked conversation among fans. Additionally, Lakers legend LeBron James previously shared his interest in bringing a new team to Las Vegas. The conversations surrounding the new team shows positive pathways for the beginning of a Las Vegas franchise in the league. As it is being considered, many investors are looking to own their share including the two Lakers legends.“It just makes sense. Obviously you have the Raiders here. You have the Knights here. You have the Aces here. You got F1 coming very soon. All-Star Weekend has been here a few times, you got the NBA Summer League that’s very popular,” James said (via: Spectrum SportsNet).He went on to add, “Sports is here and I think adding an NBA franchise here would just add to the momentum that’s going on in this town. It’s an attraction. You don’t have to worry about getting fan support, nothing like that. They show every single time, every year, every summer, like you said even if its USA Basketball or the NBA coming here for Summer League whatever the case may be,"" James continued, adding, ""I think it’s only a matter of time, and I hope I’m part of that time.”Also Read: LA Clippers fan who called out LeBron James ends up embarrassed in front of a full crowd If the Los Vegas NBA team gets a green light, the addition of two Lakers legends would make the team’s inception year interesting.

Tom Brady’s Ex Wife, Gisele Bündchen Was Not Okay With Tom Moving On



Tom Brady Continues To Be Officially Single



Tom Brady, former NFL player and sports analyst, has enjoyed a pretty successful career but it’s his marriage trouble that has been in the news lately. Tom and his ex wife, Gisele Bündchen, divorced each other in 2022 after spending thirteen years of married life together. While Gisele has now moved on with her new boyfriend Joaquim Valente and is currently pregnant with his child, she was disappointed in Tom when he started dating Irina Shayk back in 2023.After Tom and his ex wife, Gisele, divorced each other in 2022, he had been linked with many high profile women. One of them was famous supermodel Irina Shayk and according to TMZ, Gisele was “not happy at all” with this relationship of Tom’s.However, later TMZ reported that a source close to Gisele had denied such claims and said, ""Why wouldn't she be happy for Tom? She divorced him.

KOLKATA: The father of Shariful Fakir, the illegal Bangladeshi immigrant arrested by Mumbai police for allegedly stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan during a burglary attempt at his Bandra home, has claimed that the police have framed his son.""They have arrested my son as a suspect, but he is not the one whose photograph the police had released after the incident... They have picked him up as he has some similarities. He is also an easy target just because he had entered India illegally,"" Md Rohul Amin, 55, also a village level BNP functionary, told TOI over a WhatsApp call from Bangladesh.The man in the photograph had long hair that touched his eyes. But my son has always had shorter hair raised upwards. Amin, who is also a village level Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) functionary, said he is already speaking to senior leaders in his country to raise the ""false arrest"" of his son as a diplomatic issue.Shariful is the second among Rohul's three sons. While his elder son works at a private firm in Dhaka, the younger son still studies in school. Shariful had dropped out from school after Class 10 and started doing odd jobs after Rohul lost his job at Khulna jute mill.""We may be poor, but we are not criminals. In Bangladesh, he used to ride a bike taxi for a living. But during the era of Awami League, there was a lot of political turmoil in our village and after Sheikh Hasina's government came back to power early last year. Since my son was an active supporter of Khaleda Zia, he faced immense backlash and so he decided he had to leave Bangladesh for better earning and living prospects,"" said Rohul.He said Shariful got in touch with an agent who helped him illegally cross the border and enter India in April last year. While police in Mumbai said he crossed Dawki river to reach Meghalaya and then reach West Bengal via Assam, his father couldn't specify the details.""He hadn't shared with us about how he had exactly entered India but there are multiple persons like him who leave Bangladesh and head for India illegally for work. Once he reached India, he went to West Bengal and worked at a restaurant for a few days, before he went to Mumbai and started working at a bar. He had also met a relative of ours in Bengal but he refused him accommodation,"" said Rohul, who now works as a farmer at Rajabaria village in Jhalokhathi district of Bangladesh.Rohul said that on Friday evening, more than 38 hours since the stabbing incident at Saif Ali Khan's Bandra residence, Shariful called home and told his father that he had transferred 10,000 Bangladeshi taka via a hawala agent leaving only 3,000 taka for himself.""He can never loot or attack someone. Police have framed him just because he is an easy suspect. We demand justice,"" he said, breaking down into tears.","Shariful Fakir, an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant, was arrested by Mumbai police for allegedly stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan during a burglary attempt at his Bandra home.
