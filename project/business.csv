"Judicial officers get array of tax-free allowances, Supreme Court forces states to pay allowance arrears by summoning chief secretaries",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judicial-officers-get-array-of-tax-free-allowances-supreme-court-forces-states-to-pay-allowance-arrears-by-summoning-chief-secretaries/articleshow/112851813.cms,"NEW DELHI: Judicial officers get an impressive array of tax-free allowances over and above their salaries and states agreed to pay up to four weeks' arrears of allowances to district court judges as per Second National Judicial Pay (SNJP) Commission after chief secretaries and finance secretaries of defaulting states were made to appear before the Supreme Court on Tuesday.If a judicial officer is tasked with additional charge, then she/he gets an additional allowance for that purpose. If the judicial officer has a higher degree, like LLM or equivalent against the required qualification of LLB, he/she gets three advance increments in his pay scale. An entry level judicial officer, as per SNJP, gets a monthly take home of around Rs 90,000. There are around 23,000 judicial officers distributed unevenly in different states, where as many as 4.5 crore civil and criminal cases are pending. Of these 38% of cases are less than one year old.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra agreed to examine the grievance raised by judicial officers that states do not pay advance increment for higher qualification on promotion under assured career progression (ACP), if the increments had been paid once. This means, with every promotion, they would be getting three increments if they had a higher qualification, which the CJI-led bench said prima facie it finds to be legitimate.In addition to the usual allowances like - DA, HRA, medical allowance during service and after retirement, earned leave encashment, LTA, conveyance, telephone and mobile phone allowance, the judicial officers are entitled to hill area/tough location allowance.If they are posted in trouble torn/ militancy infested or border areas, they are entitled to a risk allowance. Nagaland said it was not paying risk allowance to judicial officers as it has disentitled civil servants from getting the same. Judicial officers of the state protested the withdrawal of this allowance and the SC asked the committee of the Gauhati HC to examine this grievance of the trial court judges.The judicial officers also get sumptuary allowance and children's education allowances which include hostel subsidy. The electricity and water consumed by them and their families at residence is also substantially subsidized by the govts. Interestingly, the domestic help/home orderly allowance given to them while serving as judicial officers gets extended to them beyond retirement.Apart from these, they get furniture and air conditioner allowance, newspaper and magazine allowance and even an allowance to stitch or buy the judicial robes. They are also entitled to a grant for shifting to another town on transfer and can encash earned leave up to 300 days on retirement.","An entry level judicial officer, as per SNJP, gets a monthly take home of around Rs 90,000.

"Can currency and medicine wrappers be in Braille, asks Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-currency-and-medicine-wrappers-be-in-braille-asks-scseeks-responses-from-centre-and-states-in-4-wks/articleshow/112851625.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Union and state govts whether currency notes and medicine strips be integrated with braille system to enable 100% visually impaired people not remain dependent on others to ascertain denominations of currency notes and expiry dates of medicines.On a PIL by 12-year-old 100% visually impaired whiz kid Medhansh Soni, filed through his mother Ramta Soni, a bench of Chief Justices D Y Chandrachud, and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra sought responses from the Centre and the states within four weeks.Medhansh, who won eight gold medals across diverse subjects – general knowledge, mathematics, science and English - in international Olympiads, has sought “guidelines for the implementation of Braille Integration System and to address the nuance of indirect or hostile discrimination against visually impaired persons.”.The petitioner said failure to enact a comprehensive braille integration system throughout institutions in India has significantly disadvantaged visually impaired individuals, rendering access to public information elusive. “As a result, a substantial segment of society is subjected to undue hardship and exclusion from vital resources and opportunities,” he said.Visual impairment significantly hinders normal functioning in human beings, especially in the participation & economic productivity domains, he said. “According to the National Blindness and Visual Impairment Survey, almost 6.2 million People are blind in India. The prevalence of blindness varies by region and demography with rural areas having a rate that is 1.37 times higher than urban areas. But the problem is not that someone is blind, but it is the society which is acting blind towards the needs and problems of such blind people,” Soni said.“India being the biggest democracy of the world for more than 70 years it is sad to note that the country is lagging behind other nations in providing them adequate facility to live life with dignity and equal opportunity even though the advent of braille and other supportive technologies have provided some succor against loss of vision,” he said in the petition filed through Nishant Kumar.Among the difficulties faced by visually impaired persons, the petitioner listed some of them - difficulty in identifying currency notes, inability to read product labels and medicine management challenges in navigating public places, and barriers in accessing information. He said demonetization has resulted in reduction of currency note sizes making it doubly difficult for blind persons to ascertain the value of currency notes.","The Supreme Court asked the Union and state govts whether currency notes and medicine strips be integrated with braille system.

NEW DELHI: India has now inked another contract for the import of an additional 73,000 SiG Sauer assault rifles from the US, which will add to the 72,400 such guns bought earlier for frontline Army troops, amid the continuing military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh.“The SiG-716 `Patrol’ rifles, which are 7.62x51mm caliber guns with an effective ‘kill’ range of 500-metre, are meant for infantry battalions deployed along the borders with China and Pakistan.It is a repeat order valued at Rs 837 crore,” a source told TOI on Tuesday.The delay in the manufacture of Russian AK-203 Kalashnikov rifles in India had led to the import of the first lot of 72,400 SiG-716 rifles (66,400 for the Army, 4,000 IAF and 2,000 Navy) under a Rs 647 crore contract inked with US firm SiG Sauer under the fast-track procurement route in Feb 2019.The Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council (DAC) had given the nod for the procurement for the additional 73,000 SiG-716 rifles in Dec last year. Parallelly, the Army is also buying 40,949 light machine guns, which were cleared by the DAC in Aug 2023 at an estimated cost of Rs 2,165 crore.On the assault rifles front, the first 35,000 Kalashnikov AK-203s were finally delivered to the Army earlier this year after being assembled at the Korwa ordnance factory in Amethi district of UP under the joint venture called Indo-Russia Rifles Private Limited.In all, six lakh AK-203 rifles have to be manufactured at the Korwa factory over 10 years. These 7.62x39 mm caliber rifles, with an effective range of 300-metre, are supposed to cater to the overall needs of the over 11-lakh strong Army as well as the IAF and Navy.The AK-203 project was first announced in 2018 but was hit by huge delays due to costing, royalty, technology transfer, indigenisation level and other issues, as was earlier reported by TOI.The Army in the past has dismissed reports of glitches in the SiG-716 rifles, stressing that the US-origin rifles have “longer effective range, more lethality and higher recoil” as compared to the indigenous INSAS (5.56x51 mm) or AK-47 rifles.The Army says it has been using ammunition manufactured by Indian ordnance factories for the SiG-716 rifles. “The rifles are also fitted with Picatinny rails to facilitate mounting of various equipment and accessories, such as optical sights, UBGL (under-barrel grenade launchers), forehand grips, bipods and laser pointers, without any modifications,” an officer said.","India has now inked another contract for the import of an additional 73,000 SiG Sauer assault rifles from the US.

Separately, a White House spokesperson said Biden discussed with Modi prospects for moving forward in accordance with Zelensky's plan for a ""just peace"". India, however, is yet to endorse Zelensky's peace plan.The US readout skipped any reference to Bangladesh, amplifying the differences with India over the latter's eastern neighbour. Indian side said the two shared concern over the Bangladesh situation and emphasised the need to ensure safety and security of the minorities, particularly Hindus.Unlike India, which had a deep-rooted relationship with deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, the US was quick to welcome the formation of interim govt under Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus. Hasina had a difficult relationship with the US which didn't approve of her undemocratic and authoritarian ways even though she was said to have kept a check on extremism in the country.The US readout said Biden also discussed UNGA meetings in Sept.

Soren, who previously served as the chief minister of Jharkhand , is set to make his transition to the BJP this Friday, August 30, in Ranchi.The weeks of speculation were finally laid to rest on Monday when Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma shared a picture of Champai Soren sitting with home minister Amit Shah.This development came after Soren said, he was compelled to step down as Jharkhand's chief minister, paving the way for Hemant Soren’s return to power after getting bail in an alleged land scam case.Champai Soren, who is a prominent Adivasi leader, is widely respected for his significant influence in the Kolhan region of Jharkhand.In his announcement, Soren addressed his supporters with the words, ""Johar friends,"" and reflected on the difficult decision he had made. In his tweet, he wrote, ""Last week (18th August) I had put forth my views in front of the people of the entire country including Jharkhand through a letter. After that, I kept meeting the people of Jharkhand and trying to know their opinion. The people of Kolhan region stood with me at every step, and they rejected the option of taking sanyaas.""Soren expressed his frustration with the current political scenario, stating, ""There was no such forum/platform in the party where I could express my pain and leaders senior to me are away from politics due to health reasons."" Talking about the issue of Bangladeshi infiltration in Santhal Pargana, a region he described as the ""holy land of Baba Tilka Manjhi and Sido-Kanhu."" He further added, ""What can be more unfortunate than the fact that these infiltrators are occupying the lands of the descendants of those heroes who never accepted slavery of the foreign British in the fight for water, forest, and land.""Highlighting the grave danger he perceives for the tribal community, Soren noted, ""If these intruders, who are causing economic and social harm to the tribals and natives, are not stopped, the existence of our society in Santhal Pargana will be in danger. In many areas including Pakur, Rajmahal, their number has become more than that of tribals.""Soren went on praising the BJP as the only party that appears serious about addressing these issues, criticising other parties for ""ignoring it for the sake of votes.""

The apex court also ordered her to submit her passport to the trial court and regularly attend the trial proceedings.The bench, consisting of justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan, ordered her immediate release while imposing various conditions, including not tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses.Kavitha also has to furnish a bail bond of Rs 10 lakh each in both cases.“The appellant is directed to be forthwith released on bail in both (CBI and ED) cases on furnishing bail bond of Rs 10 lakh each. She shall not make any attempt to tamper with evidence or influence the witnesses. The appellant shall deposit her passport with the trial court,” SC ordered.SC questioned CBI and ED about the evidence they have against Kavitha during her bail plea hearing.""Investigation is complete and chargesheet has been filed. Custody of the appellant is not necessary. She has been behind bars for 5 months. The likelihood of trial being concluded in near future is impossible.

He also cited the Supreme Court's decision to grant bail to AAP leader Manish Sisodia, who is a co-accused in both cases.However, S V Raju, the additional solicitor general representing the investigating agencies, alleged that Kavitha had destroyed or formatted her mobile phone, which he claimed amounted to evidence tampering.

Following directives from the Ministry, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) set up an ad-hoc panel to manage the federation, but the panel has since been dissolved. However, the Ministry has not lifted its suspension of WFI.""If WFI is allowed to do its work independently and a couple of institutions stop interfering in our functioning, we can get the country four to five medals in women's wrestling in the next Olympics,"" Sanjay Singh told PTI.Sanjay Singh's comments come just days after India's U17 women’s team won the World title in Amman. Five Indian wrestlers emerged as world champions, and additionally, one wrestler won a silver and two won bronze medals.Sanjay Singh also called on wrestler Vinesh Phogat to reconsider her retirement decision. Vinesh had announced her retirement from wrestling after missing out on a medal at the Paris Olympics. She was disqualified due to being 100 grams overweight before the women's 50kg final.""If Vinesh Phogat has to play pure wrestling, she should reconsider her decision of retirement as the new generation of women wrestlers will get inspiration from her and move forward.""The way she is sharing a political platform nowadays, if she has to do politics (in future), then she should not do politics in wrestling.""Regarding speculations that Vinesh might enter the political arena, Sanjay Singh chose not to comment, acknowledging that it was a personal matter for the 30-year-old.He affirmed that he would fully support Vinesh if she decided to return to competitive wrestling.Sanjay Singh highlighted the lessons learned from the events of 2023, which saw a significant movement launched by Indian wrestlers against the former WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over an alleged sexual harassment case.""We were expecting Indian wrestlers to win six medals in the Paris Olympics but wrestling activities were stopped for 18 months under the conspiracy of anti-national forces. Due to this movement, the country could get only one medal in the Olympics,"" he said.""I want to keep wrestling and politics separate. So I don't want to name anyone who started this movement, but it is because of politics entering wrestling that this fate has happened to wrestling at the Paris Olympics,"" he said.He also informed that WFI is considering opening a wrestling academy in Ujjain, the religious city of Madhya Pradesh.The state Chief Minister Mohan Yadav is the president of the state wrestling association.""Initial discussion with the chief minister regarding the plan to open a wrestling academy in Ujjain is already underway,"" he added.","Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) had its suspension lifted by the world governing body UWW in February.

He implied that these critics were worried about losing control over international cricket.""When Greg Barclay announced his decision not to go for a third term, which he was entitled to, there were reports in the media of the Old Powers that Barclay's decision had been forced by Shah,"" Gavaskar explained. ""Only when the perennial cribbers were questioned about what the representatives of their Old Powers were doing did it suddenly occur to them that if indeed Barclay was forced to not seek a third term, then what were their own representatives at the ICC doing at the meeting?""The former cricketer criticized these ""Old Powers"" further, suggesting their objections were driven by fears of losing influence.""Their basis of criticism was only because they realized they won't be having power over the game anymore,"" he stated. ""Where were their voices of objection? And if there were none, then they were as culpable as the one they were unnecessarily pointing a finger at. It's called the Tall poppy syndrome as well as the realization that they don't run the international game anymore.""In praise of Shah, Gavaskar highlighted the strong collaboration between players and administrators within the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ). He attributed this teamwork to the flourishing state of Indian cricket.""The way Indian cricket has shaped up over the years is also a tribute to the BCCI and its administration,"" Gavaskar remarked. ""The kind of cricket that the teams, both men and women, have been playing is another huge reason why the sport is flourishing in India. If the team was not winning, the sponsors would stay away.

Gangster Kapil Sangwan: W Delhi firing orchestrated from UK after businessman refused to pay ₹2cr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/w-delhi-firing-orchestrated-from-uk-after-businessman-refused-to-pay-2cr/articleshow/112789033.cms,"NEW DELHI: Friday’s shooting incident at a popular confectionery outlet in west Delhi's Tilak Nagar was orchestrated by UK-based gangster Kapil Sangwan after the businessman refused to pay Rs 2 crore as protection money . Sangwan was guiding the shooters in real time through chat application Jangi, a probe has revealed.The crime branch on Sunday said it had arrested one of the main shooters, Vishu Kranti (25), involved in the incident.Confirming the arrest, special commissioner R P Upadhyay said a manhunt was underway to catch others.Sources said that Kranti and his aides, Vijay Gehlot and Sonu Filmy, were in touch with Sangwan through Jangi, and receiving instructions about targets.On Friday, they first carried out a shooting—despite a PCR van being in the vicinity—at an empty plot belonging to a builder and then arrived at the outlet and started firing, leaving customers and employees in panic.The first shooting was the fallout of a property dispute. A man named Pankaj who was present at the plot was left wounded as the shooters fired indiscriminately to instil fear in residents and the plot owner.Thereafter, Sangwan asked the shooters to proceed towards 'Singla Sweets' in Tilak Nagar and repeat the act. The bike-borne men then did exactly that and fled the spot. The incident took place at 11 pm. The shooters fired through the shop's front glass.Realising the sensitivity of the incident, the crime branch was assigned to crack the case. Six teams, led by additional commissioner Sanjay Bhatia and DCP Satish Kumar, started tracking the suspects.An informer tipped off the cops about the movement of one of the shooters in Dwarka, after which technical surveillance was mounted. ACP Ravinder Rajput, inspector Akshay and others laid a trap near a school. “The suspect was spotted and flagged down. He tried to flee by firing at the police team. However, our team chased and nabbed him. He was found using an automatic pistol, which was seized from the spot,” Bhatia said.Meanwhile, the crime branch and special cell are also working on the brazen shooting incident at a jewellery outlet in Mukherjee Nagar on Saturday, which happened within 24 hours of the Tilak Nagar incident. Motorcycle-borne miscreants had fired shots at the jewellery store and threw in a typed slip of paper in which they demanded Rs 1 crore.The probe has revealed the involvement of Sangwan's rival gang in the shooting. “Jailed gangsters Neeraj Bawana and Naveen Bali are suspected to be behind the shooting. They are in alliance with the Bambiha syndicate whose name was written on the paper,” said an investigator.The incarcerated gangsters may have hired shooters from UP for the job, cops suspect. The shooters fled towards Loni, analysis of CCTV footage revealed. Sangwan is currently hiding in the UK with his family. He has a Red Corner Notice by Interpol for his involvement in a string of violent crimes.Sangwan has occupied a place in the list of top five wanted gangsters after he orchestrated the murder of INLD Haryana unit chief Nafe Singh Rathi. The fugitive has been operating a lucrative extortion racket through shooters recruited via social media. His brother, Jyoti Baba, is currently serving time in Tihar jail.Sangwan has a rivalry with rival gangster Manjeet Mahal ever since the latter bumped off Sangwan's brother-in-law in 2015. Sangwan hit back and the siblings carried out a series of murders in the last decade. Sources say efforts are underway to bring him back to the country.Sangwan's association with gangsters Lawrence Bishnoi and Kala Jathedi has made him a rival of Neeraj Bawana and Bali as well. Delhi seems to have turned into a battleground as both groups aim to establish supremacy.","Kapil Sangwan was guiding the shooters in real time through chat application Jangi, a probe has revealed.

When arrested Telegram CEO Pavel Durov claimed he has fathered 100 kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-arrested-telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-claimed-he-has-fathered-100-kids/articleshow/112799226.cms,"Who is Pavel Durov?

Legal troubles surrounding Telegram

Durov's revelation: Father to over 100 children

Pavel Durov , the enigmatic founder and CEO of Telegram , has recently made headlines not only for his business ventures but for a startling personal revelation. The billionaire, who was detained by French authorities following his arrival at Le Bourget Airport, claimed during his arrest that he has fathered over 100 children. This revelation, alongside his legal troubles, has added another layer of intrigue to the life of one of the most controversial figures in the tech world.Pavel Durov is a Russian-born entrepreneur known for his innovative contributions to the digital world.Born on October 10, 1984, in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), Durov is best known for co-founding VKontakte (VK), Russia's largest social networking site, and Telegram, a globally popular messaging app.Durov’s journey in the tech industry began with the launch of VK in 2006. The platform quickly became Russia's leading social network, drawing comparisons to Facebook for its widespread popularity. However, Durov’s refusal to comply with Russian government demands, particularly concerning censorship and surveillance, led to his ousting from VK in 2014. Following his departure, Durov turned his focus to Telegram, which he had launched in 2013. Telegram distinguished itself with its strong emphasis on privacy, offering features like end-to-end encryption and self-destructing messages. These features quickly attracted a massive user base, particularly in regions like Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet states.Telegram’s rapid growth has not been without controversy. The platform’s robust privacy features have made it a preferred tool for individuals and organisations concerned about surveillance. However, these same features have also attracted criminal elements, leading to widespread criticism. As per reports, Telegram has been accused of being a haven for illegal activities, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, and the distribution of child exploitation material. The platform’s lack of sufficient moderation has been a focal point of concern for law enforcement agencies worldwide.The complaints filed by Telegram users, particularly about the app's failure to moderate content effectively, led to Durov's recent detention in France. This arrest has intensified the spotlight on Durov and the platform he created, raising questions about the responsibilities of tech entrepreneurs in moderating content on their platforms.Amidst his legal troubles, Pavel Durov made a shocking personal revelation that has captured global attention. In a post on Telegram, Durov claimed that he has fathered over 100 children across 12 countries through sperm donation. This disclosure has added a surprising and personal dimension to the public's perception of the tech mogul.Durov explained that his journey into fatherhood began 15 years ago when a close friend struggling with infertility asked him to donate sperm. Intrigued by the request, Durov visited a clinic where he was informed that he was considered ""top-tier donor material."" The clinic suggested that his donations could help couples around the world who were facing similar challenges. Although initially hesitant, Durov was persuaded by the unconventional nature of the proposal and agreed to become a sperm donor.In his Telegram post, Durov expressed surprise upon learning that he had fathered over 100 children, particularly given his personal lifestyle choices. “I just found out I have over 100 biological kids. How is this possible for someone who has never been married and prefers to live alone?” Durov wrote. This revelation has not only surprised the public but has also led to widespread discussions about the implications of sperm donation and the responsibilities of donors.","Pavel Durov is the founder and CEO of messaging app Telegram.

'International education loans not a bar to tax relief for Tata fund',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/international-education-loans-not-a-bar-to-tax-relief-for-tata-fund/articleshow/112850576.cms,"MUMBAI: The Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal has recently held that grant of loan-scholarships by JN Tata Endowment for higher education of Indian students overseas will not debar it from income-tax (I-T) exemption.The trust, which was established in 1892 by Tata Group founder J N Tata, awards merit-based loan scholarships to students across India for higher studies overseas.Every year, 90 to 100 scholars are selected across disciplines ranging from the sciences (applied, pure and social) to management, law, commerce and the fine arts.According to JNTE's website, selected students enter into a legal agreement with the foundation. The loan-scholarship agreement is for seven years and the student is required to repay the full amount in five equal instalments between the third and seventh year. JNTE has a corpus of Rs 200 crore.For FY11, JNTE had filed an I-T return declaring a nil income, owing to its tax exempt status. However, the I-T officer had held that 'application of income' and 'charitable purpose' should both be confined to India.According to the I-T officer, mere payment to an Indian student in India was not sufficient for the purpose of exemption, as the education itself (which denotes application of income) was availed outside India.In his assessment order, the I-T officer had added that - ""If there is a charitable purpose, education (in this case), which tends to promote international welfare in which India is interested, an order from the Central Board of Direct Taxes is required..."" for the purpose of claiming the tax exemption.On these grounds, he held that the loan-scholarship amount of Rs 4 crore given to students for education abroad will not be exempt. Penalty proceedings for filing inaccurate particulars of income were separately initiated.When the Commissioner (Appeals) ruled in favour of JNTE, the I-T officer filed an appeal with the ITAT. The tax tribunal ruled in favour of JNTE, holding that the education grant given to Indian students, in India, for higher education abroad fulfils conditions of application of money for such purpose in India.

As a precautionary measure, a 100-metre stretch has been barricaded, covering nearly two lanes.This has left one lane for traffic on the elevated section , restricting vehicular flow. The service road beneath the flyover has also been closed to avoid any mishaps due to falling rubble or plaster during the repair work.""This is routine maintenance work to ensure long-term safety of the road. As a precautionary measure, we have barricaded the area and are working to complete the repairs as soon as possible,"" a senior NHAI official said.Despite the NHAI's assurances, the ongoing maintenance work has only added to the woes of those who rely on this route for their daily commute.The lane closure resulted in long tailbacks on Tuesday morning, with traffic stretching for over half a kilometre during peak hours on the elevated section.This prompted the highways authority to ease restrictions on another lane to help alleviate the traffic.Many office-goers returning to work after the long weekend found themselves stuck in the gridlock.The situation was worse for those commuting on the service lane.Dharmendra Mishra, a resident of GLS Arawali Homes, who commutes daily to Manesar, said, ""Traffic was moving slowly due to the restriction.

GUWAHATI: The BJP-led govt introduced a new bill in the assembly on Tuesday, proposing compulsory registration of Muslim marriages and divorces , which, it states, will help in preventing marriages of minors and curbing polygamy and strengthen the institution of marriages.Assam Compulsory Registration of Muslim Marriage and Divorces Act, 2024, will replace the Muslim Marriages and Divorces Act of 1935 that allowed child marriages and was silent on polygamy.The British-era law has already been repealed by an ordinance in March and last Thursday the govt tabled the bill to repeal this law.Once the law comes into force, marriages will have to be registered only after fulfilling six conditions, which requires the couple to be living together as husband and wife since the solemnization of their marriage, they have been residing within the district of the marriage and divorce registrar for at least 30 days preceding the date of marriage, completed 18 years of age in case of girls and 21 one years in case of boys on the date of solemnization of the marriage.The other conditions state the marriage has been solemnized on free consent of both the parties, and neither the husband or wife is incompetent or insane or of unsound of mind at the time of solemnization of marriage and both are free from any kind of legal disability i.e., the parties shall not be within the prohibited degree of relationship as per Shariat or Muslim law. The application of marriage will have to be accompanied by documents proving the identity of the couple, their ages and place of residence.For either solemnized or intended marriage, the married couple or bride and bridegroom have to declare their status whether they were unmarried, divorced or widow or widower at the time of marriage. This provision was also not there in the earlier law.The bill also proposes prevention of marriages without the consent of the parties and states that once implemented as a law, it will enable ""married women to claim their rights to live in the matrimonial house, maintenance etc.""The proposed law will enable widows to claim their inheritance rights and other benefits after the death of their husbands, desist men from deserting women after marriage and strengthen the institution of marriages.","The BJP-led govt introduced a new bill in the assembly on Tuesday, proposing compulsory registration of Muslim marriages and divorces.

SpaceX: Is Elon Musk’s SpaceX reign over? Rocket Lab’s Neutron set to rival Falcon 9 in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-elon-musks-spacex-reign-over-rocket-labs-neutron-set-to-rival-falcon-9-in-2025/articleshow/112850570.cms,"Peter Beck’s vision for Neutron

The growing

rivalry

in the space industry

As Elon Musk ’s SpaceX continues to dominate the space industry , a new contender is gearing up to challenge that supremacy. Peter Beck, CEO of Rocket Lab USA, Inc., is set to launch the Neutron rocket in mid-2025, a move that could potentially shake up the market. Designed to directly compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9 , the Neutron rocket promises partially reusable transportation of cargo into orbit at a lower cost, aiming to provide a viable alternative in an industry where SpaceX has long held the upper hand, reported Business Insider.Peter Beck shared his strategic vision for the Neutron rocket, emphasizing its dual importance. He was quoted by Business Insider as saying, “Neutron is really important for two reasons. One, we need to bring some balance to the market with the Falcon 9, but we also need a vehicle of our own to launch our own satellites and put our own stuff in orbit,” Beck stated. He believes that offering an alternative to Falcon 9 is crucial, particularly for businesses developing competitors to SpaceX’s satellite internet service, Starlink.Beck’s path to becoming a formidable rival to Musk is unconventional. Without a college education and a background that includes working at a dishwasher manufacturer, Beck has transformed Rocket Lab into one of the top space companies globally, second only to SpaceX in commercial rocket launches. The recent celebration of the 50th launch of Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket marks a significant milestone, with the upcoming Neutron launch expected to propel the company’s capabilities even further.As Beck prepares for Neutron’s launch, Elon Musk’s SpaceX continues to push forward, with plans to ramp up its operations by executing missions every two days in 2025. Musk’s ambitions extend far beyond Earth’s orbit, as he remains focused on colonizing Mars using SpaceX’s Starship rocket.In the face of growing competition , Musk recently dismissed the idea that traditional aircraft companies like Boeing could dominate the space industry. He likened it to how car manufacturers cannot dominate the aircraft business, emphasizing SpaceX's unique position.His comments followed NASA's decision to return astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore from space via a SpaceX vehicle, despite their launch on Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft. Technical issues during docking delayed their return, leading NASA to opt for a SpaceX vehicle for their safe return in February.With the Neutron rocket on the horizon, Rocket Lab’s challenge to SpaceX’s market dominance is becoming increasingly apparent. As the space industry evolves, Beck’s Rocket Lab is poised to offer a competitive alternative, providing businesses with more choices for satellite deployment and other space missions. The rivalry between Rocket Lab and SpaceX is set to intensify, marking a new chapter in the race for space exploration.","Peter Beck, CEO of Rocket Lab USA, Inc., is set to launch the Neutron rocket in mid-2025.

"Jay Shah elected ICC chief unopposed, emphasises on gobalisation of cricket",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/jay-shah-elected-icc-chief-unopposed-emphasises-on-gobalisation-of-cricket/articleshow/112852075.cms,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Indian cricket board’s incumbent secretary Jay Shah on Tuesday became the youngest independent chairman of the International Cricket Council ( ICC ). Shah, 35, was elected unopposed after current chairman Greg Barclay refused to seek a third term.He is the fifth Indian – after Jagmohan Dalmiya, Sharad Pawar, N Srinivasan and Shashank Manohar – to be elected to this high-profile position.“I am humbled by the nomination as the ICC chair,” Shah said. He will have to quit as BCCI secretary before taking up the ICC job.Shah, who also serves as president of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), will assume office at the ICC headquarters in Dubai on December 1. An ICC chairman is eligible for three terms of two years each, and Barclay, a New Zealand-based attorney, has completed four years.ICC had announced that elections for the chairman’s post would only occur if multiple candidates were nominated. However, with Jay Shah being the sole nominee, the election process was straightforward.Shah’s popularity among the ICC’s more than 100 member nations was evident at the ICC’s annual conference in Colombo in July.“Shah’s election marks a new chapter for the ICC as it seeks to expand the game’s reach and continue its evolution on the global stage,” the council stated in its release.BCCI will now have to look for Shah’s replacement since the board’s constitution doesn’t permit a person to hold two posts. He is into his second term as BCCI secretary after being first elected in October 2019. According to the BCCI Constitution, Shah was supposed to go into a mandatory cooling-off period in the BCCI next year.Shah, who is currently heading the ICC’s Finance and Commercial Affairs Committee (F&CAC), said globalisation of the game, keeping the inclusion of cricket in LA Olympics 2028 in mind, would be his priority.“I am committed to working closely with the ICC team and our member nations to further globalise cricket. The inclusion of our sport in the Olympics at LA 2028 represents a significant inflection point for the growth of cricket, and I am confident that it will drive the sport forward in unprecedented ways,” he said.Shah also pointed to the need to find a way to sustain all formats of the game.“We stand at a critical juncture where it is increasingly important to balance the coexistence of multiple formats, promote the adoption of advanced technologies, and introduce our marquee events to new global markets. Our goal is to make cricket more inclusive and popular than ever before,” he claimed.As far as the BCCI is concerned, a candidate to replace Shah can be finalised by November after thorough discussion. From the current set of office-bearers, treasurer Ashish Shelar is seen as a strong candidate ahead of joint secretary Devajit Saikia.It will be interesting to see if Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman Arun Dhumal, who served as BCCI treasurer in the previous term, is considered for the role. It will be a tricky challenge with the mega IPL auction looming. There is speculation over Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) president Rohan Jaitley being a potential candidate.It remains to be seen if the board decides to elect someone new for the post or elevates one of its existing office-bearers.“These calls are taken when all board members meet with other important stakeholders in Indian cricket. Things change at the last moment in BCCI. Nothing can be said till then,” a senior BCCI functionary told TOI.Son of India’s home minister Amit Shah, Jay has been in cricket administration since 2009 when he was part of a district body in Gujarat before assuming the role of joint secretary in Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) in 2013. He first assumed BCCI office, along with Sourav Ganguly as president, at a time when the board came through rocky waters after being run by the Supreme Court’s appointed Committee of Administrators for nearly three years.His experience of being an administrator at GCA, where he oversaw the making of the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, came in handy when the board had to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic up front in his tenure as BCCI secretary.Hosting a successful IPL in UAE in 2020 and the ICC T20 World Cup in the same country in 2021 came as a major shot in his arm. Another highlight of his BCCI tenure was the 2022 IPL media rights auction, which saw astronomical bids reflecting the growing global appeal of Indian cricket. Shah spearheaded the negotiations, resulting in a recordbreaking deal worth Rs 48,390 crores for a five-year period.In the last year, Shah has been instrumental in the growth of women’s cricket in India as BCCI brought in pay parity for its international cricketers besides raising the match fees of both men and women domestic cricketers. He played a key role in the launch of the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in 2022.Shah was also instrumental in building the new National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bangalore on a large piece of land acquired by the BCCI in 2008. Shah said recently that a lot of attention needs to be given to cricket for the disabled.As chair of ICC, his first challenge is to get to the root of the mismanaged T20 World Cup in USA and West Indies a couple of months ago. He has been vigilant about the excessive budget used for the USA leg and raised the red flag as ICC’s F&CAC head.","Jay Shah becomes youngest independent chairman of the International Cricket Council.

The Early Days

Leading the Asian Cricket Council

Innovations and Initiatives

NEW DELHI: BCCI secretary Jay Shah is set to assume the role of ICC chairman in December, as announced by the international cricket governing body on Tuesday. Shah was the only candidate nominated for this prestigious position.The 35-year-old Shah, who has been the BCCI secretary since 2019, is now the youngest ever to reach the pinnacle of global cricket body.Shah has been nominated by all the 15 members of the ICC Board.Shah's tenure will commence on December 1, 2024, succeeding the current Chair, Greg Barclay , who opted not to pursue a third term.This appointment marks a pivotal moment for the sport, with Shah becoming the sole nominee and inheriting the leadership role at a time of significant opportunity and evolution for cricket.He has served as the honorary secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) since October 2019, a period marked by significant changes and advancements within Indian cricket.Furthermore, his role as the Chair of the Asian Cricket Council since January 2021 has provided him with valuable experience in navigating the complexities of international cricket administration within a diverse region.Upon his election, Shah emphasized his commitment to expanding cricket's global footprint and capitalizing on its inclusion in the Los Angeles 2028Olympic Games .“I am humbled by the nomination as the Chair of the International Cricket Council . I am committed to working closely with the ICC team and our member nations to further globalize cricket. We stand at a critical juncture where it is increasingly important to balance the coexistence of multiple formats, promote the adoption of advanced technologies, and introduce our marquee events to new global markets. Our goal is to make cricket more inclusive and popular than ever before,” Shah was quoted as saying in an ICC media release.Shah's election ushers in a new chapter for the ICC, one that will be defined by its efforts to expand cricket's reach and navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by a rapidly evolving sporting landscape.His focus on globalization, technological integration, and leveraging the momentum of the LA 2028 Olympics signals a proactive approach to securing cricket's future on the world stage.Jay Shah’s immediate challenge will be overseeing the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. As the chairman of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), Shah was a strong advocate for the Hybrid Model, which saw Pakistan and Sri Lanka co-host the Asia Cup ODI event in 2023. How Shah, now the ICC chairman, navigates this situation will be crucial, especially given the possibility that the Indian government might not permit the national team to travel to Pakistan.There is speculation that the Hybrid Model could be revisited, allowing Pakistan to play its matches at home while facing India in Dubai.In the long term, Shah will need to address several critical issues: safeguarding the future of Test cricket by securing dedicated funding, ensuring the sustainability of ODIs, and preventing the exodus of core talent to freelance in T20 leagues around the world.Crafting an effective calendar that balances players’ well-being with financial opportunities will also be a top priority. Another significant challenge on his agenda will be promoting cricket’s inclusion in the Olympics, as it is set to debut at the Los Angeles Games in 2028.Jay Shah's initial involvement in cricket administration commenced in 2009 at the district level, focusing on cricket development in Gujarat through the Central Board of Cricket, Ahmedabad (CBCA).His journey progressed to the state level, where he served as an Executive with the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA). Recognized for his administrative skills, work ethic, and progressive mindset, Shah was appointed as the Joint Secretary of the GCA in 2013.At the time, Gujarat cricket was poised for significant changes but faced challenges such as inadequate infrastructure and the absence of systematic pathways for nurturing talent.Shah played a pivotal role in advocating for enhanced facilities, alongside initiating talent scouting and coaching programs. His efforts during this period contributed to a notable enhancement in the state's cricket standards, with Gujarat becoming a formidable contender in domestic cricket competitions.This era was foundational, establishing Shah's approach to cricket administration, which emphasizes the development of talent from the grassroots level, modernization of infrastructure, and the creation of a sustainable ecosystem for cricket.In January 2021, Jay Shah assumed the role of President of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), a position marked by initiatives aimed at broadening cricket's influence throughout Asia, with a focus on developing countries. Under his guidance, the ACC has seen significant efforts to enhance the sport's presence and accessibility in less-established cricketing nations.This strategic direction not only aimed to elevate the game's status across the continent but also sought to foster a more inclusive environment for emerging cricketing communities.The effectiveness of Shah's leadership and his commitment to the expansion of cricket in Asia have been recognized by the ACC membership.Jay Shah has significantly impacted the Indian Premier League's (IPL) growth and global reach. His leadership has been instrumental in transforming the IPL from a domestic cricket tournament into a major international sporting event with substantial economic influence.Shah's negotiation expertise secured record-breaking broadcasting and sponsorship deals, significantly bolstering the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI) financial standing.The 2022 IPL media rights auction, overseen by Shah, achieved a historic ₹48,390 crore ($6.2 billion) for a five-year period. This landmark deal positioned the IPL as the second most valuable sports league globally in per-match value, trailing only the US National Football League (NFL).This accomplishment solidified Shah's reputation as a capable administrator with a strong grasp of cricket's commercial potential.",Shah is the youngest ever to reach the pinnacle of global cricket body.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals.

Is droplets a source of Mpox transmission? What we know so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/is-droplets-a-source-of-mpox-transmission-what-we-know-so-far/articleshow/112851080.cms,"What are the different virus clades and how do they differ in impact?

If a person with the mpox virus talks to somebody and spats out droplets , it might not spread as it is a minor transmission source compared to physical contact , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) said on Tuesday.Addressing a briefing in Geneva, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said that mpox spreads between people mainly through close physical contact which includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), according to AFP news agency.She said that if a person with the virus had lesions, ""if you're talking closely to someone, breathing on them, physically close, face-to-face, there is a possibility"" of viral spread, ""but this is a minor source"".Instead, ""what we're seeing is the close, physical skin-to-skin"" contact as the chief route of transmission, she told a briefing in Geneva.""When you're talking to somebody, you're spitting out droplets,"" but ""it's not a very major form of transmission -- and it's not a... through-the-air, long-distance sort of transmission"".""More research is needed to fully understand the transmission dynamics,"" Harris added.According to the WHO, during the global outbreak that began in 2022, the virus mostly spread through sexual contact. More research is needed on how mpox spreads during outbreaks in different settings and under different conditions.The virus can also spread during pregnancy to the fetus, during or after birth through skin-to-skin contact, or from a parent with mpox to an infant or child during close contact.As Harris said that more research is needed, the team is studying on two subtypes of mpox: Clade 1, endemic in the Congo Basin in central Africa; and Clade 2, endemic in West Africa.The Democratic Republic of Congo is experiencing a surge in mpox cases, driven by two distinct strains of Clade 1.In the northwest region, an outbreak of the previously identified Clade 1, now referred to as Clade 1a, is occurring.Simultaneously, a new variant of Clade 1, designated as Clade 1b, has emerged in the northeastern part of the country since September last year and is rapidly spreading.The WHO's decision to raise the highest level of emergency alert was primarily influenced by the rapid spread of Clade 1b and its detection in neighboring countries.As for whether Clade 1b is more dangerous than Clade 1a, Harris said: ""We don't have that data.""""Studies are under way to understand the properties of the new strain. But available epidemiological data doesn't really suggest that the clade 1b variant causes more severe cases and deaths.""","World Health Organisation says mpox spreads mainly through close physical contact.

In 2024, notable countries with free healthcare systems include Canada , Australia , and the UK . These nations foster healthier, more motivated, and productive workforces by reducing the burden on employers related to healthcare costs and sick leave.With rising interest in countries offering free healthcare and its positive effects on businesses and employees, here are the top 9 countries providing free healthcare in 2024, guiding expats looking to live and work abroad.Countries like the UK, Australia, and Canada are among those that offer free healthcare. While entirely free healthcare is rare, most developed nations provide government-funded universal health care to their citizens and residents.The UK’s National Healthcare Service (NHS) offers free, universal healthcare, known for its accessibility and efficient primary care. The NHS is regionally structured and funded by government taxation, ensuring that all citizens and residents have access to free healthcare, including hospital care, doctor visits, medical consultations, maternity care, prescriptions, mental health services, and more.Canada's universal healthcare system , Medicare, is publicly funded and managed by individual provinces and territories. Free healthcare services are available to Canadian citizens and residents, covering doctor visits, lab tests, hospital care, and prescription medications.Australia’s Medicare, funded through general taxation, provides free healthcare to local citizens and permanent residents.
