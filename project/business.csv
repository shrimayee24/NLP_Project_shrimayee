White House trade advisor Peter Navarro on Monday claimed that ""Indian special interests"" were trying to ""interfere"" in the US domestic dialogue with ""lies about India buying Russian oil. "" This came after he slammed Elon Musk after his social media platform put up a fact-check note on Navarro's post regarding New Delhi's purchase of oil from Moscow.""On earlier post, you can see Indian special interests trying to interfere with domestic dialogue with lies about India buying Russian oil. Should X present this crap as comments from 'diverse viewpoints'?"" he questioned.""Should X put up posts like one below where foreign interests masquerade as objective observers and interfere with domestic US economics and politics?"" he added.""Elon Musk is letting propaganda into people's posts. That crap note below is just that. Crap. India buys Russia oil solely to profiteer. It didn't buy any before Russia invaded Ukraine. Indian govt spin machine moving high tilt. Stop killing Ukrainians. Stop taking American jobs,"" he had earlier said in a post on X.Musk defended his platform saying that people decide the ""narrative"" on X.""On this platform, the people decide the narrative.

India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. US taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins. Leftist American fake news.”Navarro grew frustrated after a Community Note appeared beneath his post on X, stating: “India's Russian oil purchases are for energy security, not just profit, & don't violate sanctions. While India has some tariffs, the U.S. has a trade surplus with it in services. US also continues to import certain commodities from Russia which is hypocritical.”On X, Community Notes are written by contributors to add context to posts that may be misleading. When enough contributors with differing perspectives rate a note as useful, it is made visible to the public.Navarro has repeatedly attacked India over its trade ties with Russia, accusing it of profiting from the war and undermining peace efforts. India has dismissed his remarks as misleading and emphasized its commitment to advancing bilateral relations on the basis of mutual respect and shared interests.","White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said ""Indian special interests"" were trying to ""interfere"" in the US domestic dialogue with ""lies about India buying Russian oil"" This came after he slammed Elon Musk after his social media platform put up a fact-check note on Navarro's post regarding India's purchase of oil from Moscow.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123755965,imgsize-993047,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
US tariffs: Trump signs order granting exemptions; zero duties begin Monday for aligned partners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tariffs-trump-signs-order-granting-exemptions-zero-duties-begin-monday-for-aligned-partners/articleshow/123736960.cms,"PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports.The move covers key materials such as nickel, gold, pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals, according to a Reuters report.Since assuming power in January, Trump has unleashed a global trade war, announcing reciprocal tariffs on most major countries around the world. After announcing high tariffs on most countries in April, the Trump administration later used these as tools to negotiate trade deals which it says are favourable to the US.The new directive identifies more than 45 categories of goods that will qualify for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who agree to framework deals reducing Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security law.It also brings US tariffs into line with commitments under existing arrangements with allies including Japan and the European Union. The exemptions for countries covered by these agreements will begin at 12:01 AM EDT (0401 GMT) on Monday.In the order, Trump notes that any decision to reduce tariffs will hinge on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and broader US national interests.According to the White House, the tariff cuts apply to goods that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or where domestic production is insufficient. Officials said the order also introduces carveouts for certain agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented pharmaceutical articles.Once a reciprocal trade deal is in place, the US trade representative, Commerce Department and customs will have authority to waive tariffs on qualifying imports without requiring a new executive order, a White House official added.The zero-tariff list includes graphite and different forms of nickel, crucial for stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries. It also covers pharmaceutical compounds such as lidocaine, used as an anaesthetic, and reagents used in medical diagnostic testing, as per Reuters.Gold imports in multiple forms, including powders, leaf and bullion, are also exempted. Switzerland, a major supplier, has been hit by tariffs of 39% as it has not yet secured a deal with Washington.Other categories benefiting from the changes are natural graphite, neodymium magnets and LEDs. At the same time, the order scraps earlier exemptions for certain plastics and polysilicon, a material vital for solar panels.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday.

Taliban back upgrade in ties as India explores ministerial visit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/taliban-back-upgrade-in-ties-as-india-explores-ministerial-visit/articleshow/123751546.cms,"MEA Spokesperson Says India Maintains Contact With Afghan Authorities Amid Taliban Rule

NEW DELHI: The Taliban have backed high-level engagement with India, amid efforts by the Indian government to host Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi despite the travel ban imposed on him by the UNSC. India remains in touch with the Taliban for an early visit by Muttaqi.The Taliban head of political office and Afghan ambassador to Qatar, Suhail Shaheen, told TOI there’s a need for both countries to upgrade and strengthen their ties.“For that, high level visits of the foreign ministers’ level is a need. It will pave the way for exploring various fields of cooperation including trade between the two countries,” said Shaheen, who this week urged the UN to give Afghanistan’s seat to the Taliban-led Islamic Emirate.India is likely to approach the UNSC with a request to waive the travel ban on Muttaqi to allow him to visit the country, once the dates for the visit are finalised.The Afghan media had reported late last month that the visit was called off after the Security Council denied him waiver. However, it’s learnt that while dates were discussed for a visit by Muttaqi in August last week, these eventually didn’t work out.TOI had reported on August 28 that Muttaqi was likely to travel to India soon, for what would be the first such high-level visit from Afghanistan to India since the Taliban took control of Kabul in August, 2021.India’s ties with the Taliban have improved dramatically in the past few years with the Taliban fully appreciating India’s continued humanitarian assistance, consistent with its historical relations and friendship with the Afghan people. India sent more humanitarian aid to Afghanistan last week after the country was hit by a 6.0 magnitude earthquake.With Taliban not wavering in its security guarantees to India, including assurances that it won’t allow Pakistan-based terror groups to use Afghanistan for anti-India activities, India believes it’s now time to further expand its footprint in the country, despite remaining in consonance with the international community on the issue of recognition.India had already upgraded its engagement with the Taliban as foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Muttaqi in Dubai this year and external affairs Jaishankar spoke to him twice. The visit by Muttaqi will still be a landmark event, as it will signal India’s intention to take the development partnership, which includes over 500 projects spread across the country in critical sectors, to the next level.","The Taliban head of political office and Afghan ambassador to Qatar, Suhail Shaheen, told TOI there’s a need for both countries to upgrade and strengthen their ties.

And as both sides intensify efforts to finalise a game-changing free trade agreement (FTA) by the year-end, the 13th round of negotiations will be held this week in Delhi, followed by the next round in Brussels in October.The EU’s vision document - which is expected to reinforce strategic partnership in areas like technology, trade, mobility and defence and security - will be a precursor to the joint strategic agenda that will be formalised at the next India-EU summit here early next year. Ahead of the summit, a series of high-level engagements have been planned to boost cooperation in areas ranging from trade to counterterrorism and the Indo-Pacific.The FTA is also expected to be formally signed at the summit. As external affairs minister S Jaishankar said last week, the India-EU FTA can help stabilise the global economy. In PM Narendra Modi’s joint call with European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, both sides stressed immediate progress to achieve the agreement this year.The leaders had also discussed the Russia-Ukraine war with the EU saying India has an important role to play in bringing the war to an end.Unlike the Americans though, the EU is not looking to punish India for purchasing, or even “profiteering” from, Russian crude. Its main objective, as official sources said on condition of anonymity, is to prevent such products from reaching Europe. As Germany’s foreign minister Johann Wadephul said last week, the purpose is to not allow Russia “detours” to slip in Russian refined crude products into Europe.On the FTA, while only 12 of the 24 chapters - including SMEs, transparency, dispute settlement and customs and trade facilitation - have been closed till now, both sides are confident a lot of ground will be covered in the next couple of rounds. To impart some urgency into the negotiations this week, European commissioners for trade and agriculture, Maroš Šefčovič and Christophe Hansen, will also visit India this week.“There has been progress in all rounds and now momentum is there to meet the year-end deadline,’’ said an official, adding there’s new thrust in the relationship and that India-EU ties are not determined by others.The next round of counterterrorism dialogue is also expected to take place again this week in Brussels. The meeting will address issues like cross-border and state sponsored terrorism, while intensifying counterterrorism cooperation through exchange of information and capacity building. India is expected to bring up the role of Pakistan-based The Resistance Front (TRF) in carrying out the Pahalgam terrorist attack. The EU political and security committee is also expected to visit India this week.Jaishankar is also expected to visit Brussels for the EU Indo-Pacific ministerial on November 20-21, the 4th such meeting since the EU launched its Indo-Pacific strategy in 2021.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas will also travel to India ahead of the India-EU summit. A meeting of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC), an important forum for deepening cooperation in strategic technologies like reliable AI and semiconductors, is also scheduled for this fall. The meetings will focus on possible deliverables for the summit.","The EU will unveil its vision for a new strategic agenda with India on September 17.

BHUBANESWAR: Police on Sunday served a notice to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF), seeking details of its financial records and foreign contributions, in connection with a case registered earlier this year in Jharsuguda against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his alleged “anti-national” remarks.Police said notice has been issued under section 94 of BNSS. The foundation director has been summoned by the police as well. Police have sought a range of documents, including year-wise foreign contributions since the foundation’s inception in 1991, details of bank accounts, authorized signatories, names and contacts of auditors, a copy of the FCRA license, and clarifications on specific donations.Jharsuguda police have specifically asked the foundation if it has brought foreign donations from controversial preacher Zakir Naik and the Chinese government.Additionally, an explanation has been sought regarding the alleged diversion of the PM relief fund during the UPA era. “Failure to comply with the notice could result in penal action under Section 210 of the BNSS,” a police officer said.An FIR had been lodged on February 7 against Gandhi in Jharsuguda after his speech at the inauguration of the new Congress headquarters in Delhi on January 15, where he accused the BJP and RSS of capturing national institutions and stated, “We are now fighting the BJP, the RSS, and the Indian State itself”.The complaint was filed by local BJP units and allied organizations, alleging that Gandhi's remarks incited subversive activities and undermined India's sovereignty.Inspector General (Northern Range) Himanshu Lal said, “Police are well within their scope to investigate the case. The case is progressing well”.This case is notable as it is one of the first high-profile cases under the BNSS, which replaced the Indian Penal Code in July 2024, marking a significant shift in legal proceedings related to national security and public order.","Odisha cops serve notice to Rajiv Foundation seeking foreign contribution details.

PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

Poll Do you think the positive remarks between PM Modi and Trump will improve US-India relations? Yes, it will help strengthen ties No, tensions over tariffs remain

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday responded to US President Donald Trump ’s recent remarks describing him as a “great Prime Minister” and a “friend” amid tensions over tariff row. PM Modi said he “deeply appreciate and fully reciprocates” Trump’s sentiments.The remarks by the two leaders come at a time of strained bilateral ties, following Washington’s move to impose a 50% tariff on India.Reciprocating the sentiment, PM Modi wrote in a post on X: “Deeply appreciate and fully reciprocate President Trump’s sentiments and positive assessment of our ties. India and the US have a very positive and forward-looking Comprehensive and Global Strategic Partnership.”Hours earlier, speaking to reporters at the Oval Office, Trump underlined the strength of the relationship. “I always will. I’ll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He’s a great Prime Minister. I’ll always be friends, but I just don’t like what he is doing at this particular moment. But India and the United States have a very special relationship,” Trump said.“There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,” he added.Trump also addressed his earlier post on Truth Social in which he claimed the US had “lost India and Russia to China.”He reiterated his concerns over India’s oil trade with Moscow. “I’ve been very disappointed that India would be buying so much oil from Russia. I let them know that. We put a very big tariff on India — 50 per cent, very high tariff. I get along very well with (PM) Modi as you know. He was here couple of months ago, in fact we went to the Rose Garden and had a press conference,” he said.The comments follow PM Modi’s recent visit to China for the SCO Summit, amid ongoing trade tensions with Washington.Trump has imposed a 25 per cent reciprocal tariff on India, along with an additional 25 per cent penalty for Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.India, for its part, has called the US tariffs “unjustified and unreasonable.”Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar also praised India-US relations after Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded to remarks made by US President Donald Trump.""PM Modi attaches enormous importance to our partnership with the US,"" Jaishankar said.Speaking about ties between the two leaders, he added, ""Where President Trump is concerned, he (PM Modi) has always had a very good personal equation with President Trump.

Kejriwal dares PM Modi to impose 75% tariff on US imports to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kejriwal-dares-pm-modi-to-impose-75-tariff-on-us-imports-to-india/articleshow/123747608.cms,"Kejriwal Demands PM Modi Hit Back at US With 75% Tariff on Cotton and Other Imports

RAJKOT: Aam Aadmi Party's convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ""show some courage"" and impose 75 per cent tariff on imports from the US in response to its 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports.At a press conference here, Kejriwal claimed the Centre's decision to exempt 11 per cent duty on cotton imports from the US till December 31, 2025 would hurt the Indian cotton farmers. It will make the US farmers rich and Gujarat cultivators poor, he added.India currently has an import duty exemption for raw cotton until December 31 this year to support the textile industry and lower input costs.Kejriwal said, ""We demand from the prime minister to show courage, the whole country is standing behind you. America has imposed 50 per cent tariff on exports from India. You impose 75 per cent tariff on imports coming from America, the country is ready to bear it. Just impose it. Then see if Trump bows down or not.""He also demanded 11 per cent duty on cotton imported from the US, fixing Minimum Support Price and procurement of cotton at Rs 2,100 per 20 kg, as well as subsidy on fertilizers and seeds to help the Indian farmers.The former Delhi chief minister claimed USA's 50 per cent tariff on India has also affected diamond workers because the Modi government has ""fallen on its knees"" in front of President Donald Trump The Centre last month said its decision to extend the import duty exemption on cotton until December 31 will strengthen India's position in export markets, reviving orders for small and medium enterprises as well as export-oriented units.The move comes at a time when the steep 50 per cent tariffs imposed on Indian goods by the US come into effect, with America being the largest export market for the country's textile and apparel exports.Kejriwal was in Gujarat to attend 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' at Chotila in Surendranagar district, which was adjourned due to heavy rains.When Trump imposed 50 per cent tariff on India, Modi did not increase it in return but reduced it (on cotton imports from the US) by 11 per cent, Kejriwal said and questioned why the PM ""bowed down"" and became weak.India is the world's biggest market and people here stand behind Modi, the AAP leader pointed out.""The whole country is standing behind Modiji. He (Trump) imposed 50 per cent tariff, Modiji should have imposed 100 per cent tariff on cotton. Trump would have had to bow down. Trump is a coward, a timid person. He had to bow down to all countries that defied him. Shut down four American companies and they will be in trouble,"" he claimed.Due to India's policy decision to remove 11 per cent duty on cotton imported from the US, the produce of Indian farmers will not be sold when they take it to the market in October-November, Kejriwal said.""When cotton from the US will arrive (in India), farmers here will get less than Rs 900 in the market. This is what is happening with the farmers -- their (US) farmers are being made rich and the farmers of Gujarat are being made poor,"" he further claimed.The central government first removed this duty for 40 days - from August 19 to September 30. But now it has been extended and removed till December 31, Kejriwal said.""Now, farmers of our country have no way to sell their cotton. The farmer of our country has bought seeds and fertilizers by taking a loan, has paid money to (farm) labourers, now how will he repay the loan? He will have no option left except to commit suicide,"" the AAP convener claimed.He also questioned India's ""helplessness"" in front of America.""Under Trump's pressure, our central government forced farmers of the country to commit suicide, by removing the 11 per cent duty,"" he charged.The other countries on which Trump imposed tariffs responded strongly and the US president had to ""bow down"" and remove tariff, but India did not take any action, Kejriwal claimed.","Aam Aadmi Party's convener Arvind Kejriwal urges PM Narendra Modi to impose 75% tariff on imports from the US.

‘Crap Note’: Navarro Slams Musk After His X Post On India’s Russian Oil Purchases Gets Fact-Checked

Navarro targets India on oil trade

The US runs a trade surplus with India in services.

The US itself continues to import billions in Russian goods, including uranium, despite its criticism of India, exposing what they called a ""clear double standard.""

India did not breach international law with its sovereign decisions on energy imports.

Navarro hits back — and blasts Musk



Tariff war strains ties



PM Modi's measured response



US President Donald Trump's senior trade adviser, Peter Navarro, has renewed his attacks on India, accusing New Delhi of profiteering from Russian oil imports, only to be publicly fact-checked by X, which flagged his claims as misleading and ""hypocritical. ""The episode is the latest flare-up in Washington's tense trade and foreign policy standoff with India, following Trump's decision to impose punitive secondary tariffs of over 50 per cent on Indian exports.In his latest post, Navarro accused India of driving Moscow's war machine by importing discounted Russian crude.""FACTS: India highest tariffs costs US jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. US taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins,"" Navarro wrote in a late-night post.Navarro, a longtime hawk on global trade, has made India a frequent target in recent weeks, labeling the Russia-Ukraine war ""Modi's war"" and accusing New Delhi of running a ""laundromat for the Kremlin."" He has gone so far as to call Prime Minister Narendra Modi the ""Maharaj of tariffs"" and, in one controversial outburst, invoked caste to allege Indian refiners were ""Brahmins profiteering at the expense of the Indian people.But this time, Navarro's claims didn't go unchallenged. X appended multiple community notes under his post, correcting his assertions.The fact-checks stressed that India's Russian oil purchases are made for ""energy security"" and do not violate any international sanctions. They also highlighted that:""Navarro's claims are hypocritical,"" one note bluntly said.The Trump aide was quick to fire back, accusing Elon Musk of allowing ""propaganda"" into the platform's fact-check system.""Wow. @elonmusk is letting propaganda into people's posts.

Hours after Trump's new tariffs took effect, Navarro blamed New Delhi for fueling Russia's invasion and accused it of ""profiteering"" at the expense of the West.Recently, PM Modi attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin, China. In widely circulated images, PM Modi was seen warmly greeting Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a moment that underscored the shifting balance as Trump tightened trade screws on India.Days later, Trump appeared to second-guess his own hard line. He initially claimed the US had ""lost India to China"" but quickly walked it back.""I don't think we have (lost India),"" Trump said. ""I've been very disappointed that India would be buying so much oil from Russia. I let them know that. We put a very big tariff on India — 50 per cent, a very high tariff.

NEW DELHI: At an age when many women are busy caring for their grandchildren, a 55-year-old from Rajasthan’s Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.The birth at the Community Health Centre in Jhadol block has turned Lilavas village into a talking point. Relatives, neighbours and villagers crowded the hospital to see Rekha, amused at the unusual sight of grandchildren greeting their new baby aunt, PTI reported.Rekha, married to scrap dealer Kavara Ram Kalbelia, has given birth 17 times over the years. Five of those children – four sons and one daughter – died soon after birth, leaving the couple with 12 surviving kids: seven boys and five girls.Their household spans three generations under one roof. ""Two of my sons and three of my daughters are married. Each of them has two or three children,"" Kavara said, his voice carrying both pride and weariness.This means while Rekha tends to her newborn, she is simultaneously grandmother to several toddlers.Behind the curiosity, however, lies hardship. Kavara makes a meagre living by selling scrap and admits to taking high-interest loans to pay for his children’s weddings. “No member of the family has ever gone to school,” he said, highlighting how poverty continues to dominate their lives.Doctors at the Jhadol centre described the delivery as a challenge. Rekha initially told them it was only her fourth pregnancy. Block CMHO Dr Dharmendra noted that the case reflects the difficulties in tribal-dominated areas, where lack of education and awareness often fuel such situations.“This is a nomadic family that keeps moving. Eleven surviving children were found with them. We will work to link them with government schemes and provide support,” he said.Gynaecologist Dr. Roshan Darangi, who handled the delivery, confirmed the truth later: “It turned out to be her 17th childbirth. Now, we will counsel her for sterilisation.”Another doctor, Mukesh Garasiya, added that Rekha had been admitted on August 24 without sonography or pre-delivery tests. “She could have died from excessive bleeding. With so many deliveries, the uterus weakens and the risk of haemorrhage rises.

'Let's reiterate commitment to spread Bhupen Da's message',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lets-reiterate-commitment-to-spread-bhupen-das-message/articleshow/123755138.cms,"Today, 8th September, is a very special day for all those who are passionate about Indian culture and music. It is particularly more special for my sisters and brothers of Assam. After all, it is the birth anniversary of Bhupen Hazarika, one of the most extraordinary voices India has ever known. As you are all aware, this year marks the beginning of his birth centenary celebrations. It is an occasion to revisit his monumental contributions to Indian artistic expression and public consciousness.What Bhupen Da gave us extends far beyond music. His works embodied emotions that transcended melody. More than just a voice, he was the heartbeat of the people. Generations have grown up listening to his songs, each word resonating with themes of kindness, social justice, unity and deep-rooted belonging.From Assam emerged a voice that flowed like a timeless river, crossing borders and cultures, carrying with it the spirit of humanity. Bhupen Da travelled the globe, rubbed shoulders with the who's who across all spectrums of society, but he remained deeply connected to his roots in Assam. The rich oral traditions, folk melodies and community storytelling practices of Assam deeply shaped his early childhood. These experiences formed the bedrock of his artistic vocabulary.He always carried the spirit of Assam's indigenous identity and the ethos of its people.Brilliance came to Bhupen Da at a very young age. At the age of just five, he sang at a public event and quickly caught the attention of none other than Lakshminath Bezbaruah, the pioneering figure of Assamese literature. By the time he was a teenager, he had recorded his first song. But music was only one part of his personality. Bhupen Da was as much an intellectual at heart... curious, articulate and driven by an insatiable desire to understand the world. Cultural legends like Jyoti Prasad Agarwala and Bishnu Prasad Rabha left a deep impression on his mind and also deepened his spirit of enquiry. It was also this desire to learn that made him excel at Cotton College, Banaras Hindu University and took him to the United States, where he interacted with leading academics, thinkers and musicians of those times. He met Paul Robeson, the legendary artist and civil rights leader. Robeson's song ""Ol' Man River"" became the inspiration for Bhupen Da's iconic composition 'Bistirno Parore.' The much-admired former American First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt awarded him a Gold Medal for his performances of Indian folk music.Bhupen Da had the option of remaining in the US, but he returned to India and immersed himself in music. From radio to theatre, films to educational documentaries, he was well-versed in each of these media. Wherever he went, he emphasised supporting young talent. His works combined lyrical flair and also gave social messages, touching upon justice for the poor, rural development, strength of common citizens, to name a few. Through his music, he gave voice to the aspirations of boatmen, tea garden workers, women, farmers, etc. In addition to being nostalgic, Bhupen Da's works also became a powerful lens to view modernity. A lot of people, especially from the socially backward classes like him, derived strength and hope from his music.The spirit of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat' found powerful expression in Bhupen Hazarika's life journey. His works transcended linguistic and regional boundaries to unite people across the country. He composed for films in Assamese, Bengali and Hindi. He made Assam visible and audible to the rest of India. It is no exaggeration to say that he helped shape the cultural identity of modern Assam, both for those within the state and for the Assamese diaspora across the globe.Bhupen Da, although not really a political person, did remain connected to the world of public service as well. In 1967, he was elected as an independent MLA from Nauboicha constituency in Assam, demonstrating how deeply his public persona was rooted in the people's trust. Though he never became a career politician, his passion for serving others was highly impactful.The people and Government of India have recognised his enormous contributions over the years. He was conferred with several awards, including the Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, Dadasaheb Phalke Award and more. In 2019, it was an honour for me personally and for the NDA government that the Bharat Ratna was conferred upon him during our tenure. People from across the world, especially those from Assam and the Northeast, expressed joy that this honour was conferred upon him. This honour celebrated the principles that Bhupen Da held dear to his heart - that music, when grounded in truth, can transcend all barriers. That a song can carry the weight of a people's dreams and move hearts across the world.I remember the time Bhupen Da passed away in 2011. I had seen on television how lakhs of people attended his funeral. Every eye was moist that time. Even in death, like in his illustrious life, he brought people together. It was thus fitting that he was cremated at the Jalukbari hillock overlooking the Brahmaputra, the very river that had been the lifeline of his music, metaphors and memories. It is gladdening that the Assam Government has supported the work of the Bhupen Hazarika Cultural Trust, which is working to popularise his life journey among youngsters.Bhupen Hazarika's life teaches us the power of empathy, of listening to people and of staying rooted. His songs continue to be sung by young and old alike. His music teaches us to be compassionate and courageous. It asks us to remember our rivers, our labourers, our tea workers, our Nari Shakti and our Yuva Shakti. It encourages us to believe in unity in diversity.Bharat is blessed to have Bhupen Hazarika. As we celebrate the beginning of his centenary year, let us reiterate our commitment to spreading his message far and wide. May it also inspire us to keep working to support music, art and culture, to encourage young talent and make India a nurturing ground for creativity and artistic excellence.It is only fitting that one of India's most significant infrastructure projects, the bridge connecting Dhola and Sadiya, bears the name of Bhupen Hazarika. Just as his songs connected hearts across regions, this bridge connects lands and people.The author is the Prime Minister of India",This year marks the beginning of Bhupen Hazarika's birth centenary celebrations. His works transcended linguistic and regional boundaries to unite people across the country. He made Assam visible and audible to the rest of India. The Government of India has over the years recognised his enormous contributions with several awards including the Padma Shri.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123755259,imgsize-20702,width-400,resizemode-4/bhupen-hazarika.jpg"

Sharing a picture of Modi, Gorakhpur MP Ravi Kishan said, ""This is BJP's strength that everyone here is a karyakarta (worker).""Modi later said on X, ""Attended the 'Sansad Karyashala' in Delhi.

UAE telecom providers confirm slowed services

“Dear valued customers, you may experience slowness in data services due to an interruption in the international submarine cables. Our technical teams are currently working to address the issue. We will keep you updated with the latest developments as they occur.”

Regional scale of the disruption and technical context

“A series of subsea cable outages in the Red Sea has degraded internet connectivity in multiple countries… the incident is attributed to failures affecting the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems near Jeddah.”

Causes, risks, and timeline for recovery





A major undersea cable disruption in the Red Sea has triggered widespread internet slowdowns across the UAE and several parts of the Middle East since Saturday, September 6, 2025. UAE telecom providers du and Etisalat (e&) confirmed the issue, which has also impacted Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, leading to latency in network services. While providers are working on alternate routing and mitigation, full restoration could take time.On Saturday, September 6, a series of cable outages in the Red Sea severely disrupted internet infrastructure relied upon by multiple Middle Eastern countries, including the UAE. The incident, which began at 5:45 UTC (9:45am UAE time), has been confirmed by Microsoft and regional telecom providers as a result of undersea fibre cuts.Microsoft, which operates Azure, the world’s second-largest cloud computing platform after Amazon Web Services—reported increased latency in traffic routes traversing the Middle East. Although the company rerouted network traffic via alternate paths to avoid a full outage, users have still experienced a noticeable slowdown.Microsoft said in a statement on its website.Microsoft committed to providing daily updates, or sooner if conditions change, and clarified that traffic not routed through the Middle East remains unaffected.Telecom operators e& (Etisalat) and du, the two main service providers in the UAE, acknowledged the impact of the Red Sea cable cuts on their services.Etisalat, in a public statement issued via social media on Sunday, said:du released a similar message, saying:“Dear Valued Customers, You may experience some slowness in our data services due to an International submarine cable cut. Our technical teams are working with international providers to resolve the issue. We will keep you updated with the latest developments.”Both operators assured customers that restoration efforts are underway, although specific timelines were not provided.Between 6pm on Saturday, September 6 and 3am on Sunday, September 7, users across both networks reported major slowdowns or complete unavailability of internet services, according to data from Downdetector.The effect of the outage extended well beyond the UAE, with slowdowns also reported in countries such as India and across the wider Middle East.According to NetBlocks, a global internet observatory tracking cyber infrastructure:The SMW4 (SEA-ME-WE 4) and IMEWE cables are among the major subsea systems that handle vast amounts of internet traffic between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Their disruption left a significant portion of regional traffic needing rerouting.NetBlocks also noted visible slowdowns across both du and Etisalat networks on Saturday evening, with intermittent access and poor speeds experienced by users.While Microsoft Azure managed to avoid complete disruption by activating alternate routes, the rerouting has still led to noticeable lag and service degradation in data-intensive applications and cloud-based platforms.While the exact cause of the cable damage remains unclear, historical data shows that around 70% of undersea cable incidents are caused by ship anchors, accidental rather than deliberate. Nonetheless, there have been ongoing fears about the vulnerability of cables in the Red Sea, particularly with the Houthi conflict in Yemen. Although the group has denied targeting cables, the region remains geopolitically sensitive.Subsea cable repairs are logistically complex and can take several weeks, involving the deployment of specialised ships and crews to locate and mend the damage.As of Sunday morning, September 7, some services in the UAE showed signs of improvement, although user reports on DownDetector.ae indicated continued instability. Neither the UAE government nor regulators have issued formal statements on the incident as of now.","A series of cable outages in the Red Sea severely disrupted internet infrastructure relied upon by multiple Middle Eastern countries, including the UAE.

The Rhode Island farmhouse that inspired the Hollywood horror film The Conjuring is going up for auction on Halloween.According to JJManning Auctioneers, the Burrillville property will be sold in a mortgage foreclosure auction on October 31.The house, known worldwide for its alleged paranormal activity, has long attracted ghost hunters and horror fans.

She turned the 18th-century house into a ghost tourism business, offering overnight stays and paranormal tours.perrBut the venture quickly ran into trouble. In 2023, Nuñez accused her property manager of theft after claiming she received the information from a spirit, WPRI reported. That dispute led to a legal battle with former employees over pay and treatment. Later that year, town officials revoked her entertainment licence, citing safety concerns and irregularities in her paperwork.Despite losing her licence, Nunez continued to run tours. Visitors complained of not receiving refunds for cancelled events, and she also clashed with figures in the paranormal community, including TV ghost hunter Jason Hawes, who accused her of harassment.By this summer, the business had collapsed under financial strain, leading the lender to move for foreclosure.Meanwhile, comedian Matt Rife and YouTuber Elton Castee, both known for their interest in the paranormal, have expressed interest in buying the house. The pair already owns another haunted property in Connecticut once linked to Ed and Lorraine Warren.The Burrillville farmhouse remains a magnet for believers, who speak of shadows, whispers, and sudden chills.","The Burrillville property will be sold in a mortgage foreclosure auction on October 31.

Blackwater founder Erik Prince is seeking business deals in Ukraine’s drone sector amid reports of Donald Trump’s administration considering using American private military contractors in the country, The Guardian reported, citing multiple sources.According to the report, Prince, a longtime Trump ally, has been meeting industry players in Kyiv and pitching himself to acquire local drone companies. He has been aggressively looking to buy firms involved in Ukraine’s drone technology, which has become central to the war.Prince’s interest comes at a time when Trump is pushing for a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow, though without results so far. Drones have accounted for nearly 80% of Russian casualties in the conflict, turning Ukraine into a hub for Western investors and defence firms eager to tap battlefield data and technology.The Guardian noted that Prince has a history of profit-seeking in conflict zones. His company Blackwater rose to prominence during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but was blacklisted after a 2007 massacre in Baghdad carried out by its contractors. Since then, Prince has been linked to controversial operations, including advising a drone assassination programme in Haiti this year.Meanwhile, the Pentagon has announced plans to massively expand America’s drone production, with edfence secretary Pete Hegseth declaring in July that the US must “unleash drone dominance.” Business leaders, including former Google chief Eric Schmidt and ex-CIA director David Petraeus, have also entered the field with their own ventures.","Erik Prince is seeking business deals in Ukraine's drone sector.

Travel dreams, bureaucratic nightmares





A seemingly routine US tourist visa application by a financially secure Indian family has gone viral after their unexpected rejection triggered a wider debate on Reddit about fairness, bias, and transparency in American visa processes.In a detailed Reddit post that has since gained traction, a 36-year-old IT professional, posting under the handle @Fun-Mind8782, shared his dismay after being denied a B-2 tourist visa at the US consulate in New Delhi, despite what he described as a strong application backed by financial stability, international travel history, and a clear travel plan.But what began as a personal grievance has since evolved into a broader conversation about how US consular officers wield the little-understood, but immensely powerful, Section 214(b) clause of the Immigration and Nationality Act.According to the Redditor, he had applied for a two-week tourist visa for himself and his elderly parents to vacation in the US over Christmas. The family had already traveled to countries including the UK, France, Switzerland, Dubai, and Singapore. Financially, they were on solid ground, with over Rs 50 lakh (~$60,000) in savings between them, and confirmed hotel bookings across New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.“We wanted to go for a vacation,” he wrote. “I even had hotel reservations and an itinerary.”However, the visa interview, held at the New Delhi consulate, took a sharp turn. The man, whose parents are in their 70s and not fluent in English, offered to translate. Instead, the visa officer called in an official translator.After a few basic questions, particularly around whether the family had relatives in the US (they acknowledged having a grandniece, though stated they would not visit her), the officer abruptly denied the visas, citing Section 214(b). Their passports were returned on the spot.The incident has reignited scrutiny around Section 214(b), a provision that assumes every applicant for a non-immigrant visa intends to immigrate, unless they can prove strong ties to their home country.Critics argue that this standard is vague and inconsistently applied.The man, who shared his experience on Reddit, described how the interview unfolded. “I greeted him nicely, with a smile and gave him our Passports. I communicated that my Parents first language wasn't English, so I could translate if he would allow. He replied, no I will get the translator. A lady came and the interview started.”When asked the purpose of their visit, the man replied, “We want to go for a vacation for 2 weeks around Christmas time. We would like to go to New York, LA, SF. I added we have made Hotel reservations and had an itinerary too if it was needed.”The officer then had the translator ask his mother in Hindi where they intended to travel. She answered, “We want to go to New York, LA, San Francisco.”When asked if they had any relatives in the US, she replied, “Yes we have grand niece, but we won't be visiting her.”At this point, the officer interrupted, “You said your parents don't know English, and your mother is speaking fine.”The man responded calmly, “Yes sir she is not fluent in English but she can say few words.”The translator then asked who would sponsor the trip, to which he replied, “We all will be sponsoring ourselves. We have stable jobs, sufficient savings and income from stocks etc too.”After waiting for further questions, the man said, “The officer asked no further questions and translator said your visas have been refused. 214b. Gave us the slip and passports back.”He added that, “No questions were asked about our jobs, about our ties back home, previous travel, nothing.”The man provided background about himself and his parents, “I am 36, single, I am the operations head of an IT company for 3.5 years. I earn 15 LPA. Sufficient savings of 20 lakh plus from savings, stocks. Have 10 year experience in running own business.”“My Parents are 70. Both ran our family business for 30 years. Business shut in covid. After a 1 year break, my Parents joined a Publishing company and worked as Client Managers... Earned salary/commissions of 8 and 7.5 lakh per annum respectively... Have savings in 30 lakhs plus which is sufficient for their age.”“I have travelled to UK, France, Switzerland, Spain, Dubai, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and few more countries.”“Parents love to travel too. have travelled to Uk, France, Switzerland, Dubai, Singapore and recently to Vietnam, Indonesia, Bhutan, Azerbaijan too.”“I co own my apartment with my mother. We have a loan too. My father owns properties too so stable ties! Job, and family too.”On his personal situation, he wrote, “I am single as was focussed on work, and then things didn't work in my long term relationship, but at this age I have no intention of immigrating illegally anywhere. Love my Country and just like to travel.”Concluding, he said, “We weren't even asked questions. Seems like officer had made mind to refuse from start. So, I would really like to know where we went wrong? Or is it even fair to just blame ourselves because of an unfair System?”Thousands of commenters on Reddit shared similar stories—of being denied for traveling with elderly parents, of innocuous ties to US-based relatives turning into red flags, and of interviews that felt more like foregone conclusions than fair assessments.Ben, a former US consular officer who now runs a YouTube channel breaking down the visa process, weighed in on the Reddit post. He explained that while relatives in the US aren’t automatically a negative, they can be “contextual risk factors.”“If the applicant has a sibling working in a Fortune 500 company, it can actually help,” Ben said. “But if there are questions about whether the relative has maintained their visa status or overstayed, that can hurt, even if it’s not the applicant’s fault.”Ben also noted that officers have only minutes, often less than five, to assess applicants, leading to a heavy reliance on “gut instincts” and stereotypes.The broader reaction to the post has been one of empathy but also frustration. Many questioned how applicants are supposed to prove ""sufficient ties"" when employment, property, savings, and return travel plans aren’t enough.“This is why people feel hopeless,” wrote one user. “You do everything by the book and still get rejected without a chance to explain yourself.”Another commenter added, “It feels like the process is rigged to say no, especially if you're from certain countries.”","A 36-year-old IT professional and his elderly parents applied for a B-2 tourist visa to visit the US over Christmas.

"US jobs data: Unemployment hits four-year high at 4.3%; only 22,000 new jobs in August",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-jobs-data-unemployment-hits-four-year-high-at-4-3-only-22000-new-jobs-in-august/articleshow/123732652.cms,"Representative AI image





Employment data for August revealed significant weakening in US job market conditions, with unemployment climbing to 4.3%, marking a nearly four-year peak.This development strengthens expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate reduction this month, according to Reuters.The Friday employment report further disclosed June's first job losses in four and a half years, raising concerns about economic stagnation. Job creation has declined since April, with analysts attributing this to governmental policies, including import tariffs, stricter immigration controls, and substantial public sector redundancies.""The economy is skating as close to the edge of recession as you can get,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. ""Companies are clearly hunkering down and refusing to hire and the blame can be traced back to Washington's economic agenda. The only medicine to help is a rate cut from the Fed,"" he added, quoted by Reuters.August recorded only 22,000 new nonfarm positions, following July's revised increase of 79,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Data revisions indicated June experienced a 13,000 job decrease, contrary to the previously reported 14,000 increase, marking the first decline since December 2020.These adjustments validated concerns raised by substantial downward revisions to May and June figures in July's report, leading to the dismissal of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. The president alleged data manipulation without providing evidence.Analysts attribute these revisions to the BLS ""birth-and-death"" calculation method, which estimates employment changes from business openings and closures.The president maintained his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell regarding interest rates, though avoiding direct comments on the employment figures.""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he's 'Too Late!'"" the president had posted on Truth Social.The situation reflects broader economic uncertainties, with import duties raising average tariff rates to levels unseen since 1934, whilst recent court rulings questioning their legality have created additional business uncertainty.Notably, August’s initial payroll numbers may be revised higher, as seasonal factors often cause a weak bias in the first estimate. Nonetheless, employment growth has slowed considerably, averaging 29,000 jobs per month over the last three months, compared with 82,000 in the same period in 2024. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is expected to publish preliminary revisions to employment levels for the 12 months through March, which could reinforce the trend of slower job growth.Based on the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data, economists estimate employment could be revised down by as much as 800,000. The QCEW draws from employer reports to state unemployment insurance programs.Healthcare added the most jobs in August, with payrolls rising by 31,000, though this was below the 12-month average of 42,000. Social assistance jobs grew by 16,000, while federal government payrolls fell by 15,000, bringing total federal employment down 97,000 since January amid spending cuts. More declines are expected in October when employees on severance pay drop off the rolls.Manufacturing lost jobs for the fourth consecutive month, highlighting the impact of tariffs. Other sectors—including wholesale trade, information, financial activities, construction, and professional and business services—also shed positions.Wages remain a bright spot, supporting economic expansion for now. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in August, matching July, while annual wage growth slowed slightly to 3.7% from 3.9%. However, declining hours worked raise concerns about overall economic growth.“Today’s news probably raises more questions about the growth outlook than about the Fed outlook,” said Michael Feroli, chief economist at J.P. Morgan. “Private hours worked appear to be contracting at about a 0.5% annual rate this quarter. We remain cautious about growth prospects next quarter.”Financial markets are pricing in a quarter-percentage-point rate cut at the Fed’s September 16-17 meeting, with two more expected before the end of 2025. The central bank has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate at 4.25%-4.50% since December. Stocks traded lower on Wall Street, the dollar weakened against a basket of currencies, and U.S. Treasury yields fell.The unemployment rate edged up from 4.2% in July to 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. The household survey indicated 436,000 people entered the labor force, but only 288,000 found employment. Economists noted that the termination of temporary legal status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants and longer bouts of unemployment contributed to weaker labor force outcomes.The average duration of joblessness increased to 24.5 weeks, the longest since April 2022. “The labor market has hit stall speed,” said Nicole Cervi, economist at Wells Fargo, highlighting the slowdown and persistent challenges in job growth.","Unemployment climbs to 4.3%, marking a nearly four-year peak.

Got out at 23 and turned to boxing to change his life. He started his pro career in 1988. Worked hard, trained with discipline, and became a top middleweight fighter, won world titles, and held them for 10 years.His record of 55-8-2 came from fighting big names like Felix Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya, and he made millions from fight purses and TV deals. Unlike most boxers, he kept fighting into his 50s, which made him over 60 million from boxing alone. That money from the ring gave him a good start, but Hopkins knew he had to plan for life after boxing.Also Read: Boxing Worlds: Pawan Barthwal draws first blood; prevails in close bout vs Paris Olympian While making big money in boxing, Bernard Hopkins was smart with his money, not wasting it like many athletes do. He put his cash into safe investments to grow his wealth over time.

Another smart move was joining Golden Boy Promotions, a company founded by Oscar De La Hoya. By helping run this boxing business, Hopkins made money even after he retired in 2016, promoting new fighters and events. These moves kept his wealth growing. Hopkins talks about saving and planning, sharing tips to help others manage their money in high-risk careers like boxing.Bernard Hopkins, however, continues to promote and commentate on boxing since his retirement, and his name is still out there, and his money continues to flow. At Golden Boy Promotions, he sets young boxers on the path and seals deals that contribute to his 2025 earnings.He also makes money from speaking at events and TV appearances, sharing his story of going from prison to success. These activities with endorsements and book deals keep his 40 million net worth strong. Hopkins proves that talent plus smart planning equals a legacy that goes way beyond the ring.","Bernard Hopkins, also known by the name of 'The Executor,' is a renowned boxer who has amassed a fortune of $40 million in 2025.

AGRA: Semi high-speed trains Gatimaan Express and Vande Bharat, which usually run at 160 kmph, have been operating at a reduced speed of 130 kmph for over a year, largely due to the absence of the Kavach system on the Delhi-Agra rail route. The Railway Board had directed the speed reduction from 160 kmph to 130 kmph (maximum speed) until the automatic train protection system (Kavach) became operational.As per an RTI reply by Indian Railways to TOI, clarified: ""Train numbers 12049, 12050, 12001, 12002, 20171, 20172, 22469 and 22470 are currently being operated at a speed of 130 kmph. As per Railway Board letter no. 2021/Sig/Kavach/Vande Bharat dated June 24, 2024, the above-mentioned trains will be operated at a maximum speed of 130 kmph on the Agra-Delhi section until the automatic train protection (ATP) system becomes operational. ""On June 24, the Railway Board issued a letter and stated the issue of speed of these trains was examined, and specifically mentioned three trains: 20171/20172 (Hzt Nizamuddin-Rani Kamalapati Vande Bharat Express), 22470/22469 (Hzt Nizamuddin-Khajuraho Vande Bharat Express) and 12049/12050 (New Delhi-Virangana Lakshmibai Jhansi Gatimaan Express).Gatiman is India's first semi high-speed train, launched in April 2016 to connect Delhi's Hzt Nizamuddin station with Agra Cantt in just 100 minutes, which runs between Nizamuddin and Jhansi.It used to run at a speed of 160 kmph between Delhi and Agra as tracks were laid there to suit the train's speed. In addition, trains 20171/20172 and 22470/22469 also used to run at 160 kmph between Delhi and Agra.Similarly, New Delhi-Rani Kamalapati Shatabdi Exp (12002/12001) used to run at 150 kmph between Delhi and Agra. The RTI stated the combined ""punctuality of these trains between April 1 and July 31 stood at 77.9%."" Giving details about the Kavach system in the Delhi-Agra section, the RTI added: ""ATP work is in progress in the Palwal-Bhuteshwar section of North Central Railway. Equipment has been installed, energised and RFID tags are fixed at the site. An Independent Safety Assessment (ISA) inspection has been done by the inspecting authority and the ISA report is awaited. ATP work is in progress in Bhuteshwar-Agra section of North Central Railway. Tender awarded on March 31, 2025.""Kavach is an indigenously developed automatic train protection (ATP) system. It is a highly technology-intensive system which requires safety certification of the highest order (SIL-4). This system involves the placement of RFID tags on tracks in station areas and other places, installation of stationary 'Kavach' units at several places such as stations, and installation of towers and antennas along the tracks.","Gatiman is India's first semi high-speed train, launched in April 2016 to connect Delhi's Hzt Nizamuddin station with Agra Cantt in just 100 minutes.

"Delhi’s jam sessions: Only 2 corridors get major fixes, 5 others partially eased; full relief still elusive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-traffic-police-implement-urgent-fixes-on-several-critical-corridors/articleshow/123751464.cms,"Delhi Traffic Police have initiated measures to alleviate congestion on 12 critical corridors, implementing partial fixes like jersey barriers and staff deployment

Viral Videos Capture Gurgaon’s Traffic Chaos And Flooded Streets





NEW DELHI: In a city where jams often seem endless, Delhi Traffic Police have moved with urgency to ease congestion. At least five out of 12 critical corridors have undergone partial fixes, including jersey barriers at unsafe cuts, barricades at key spots and extra staff deployment. Two stretches have seen major changes, including a trimmed roundabout and staff deployment. Bigger works remain pending, with letters sent to civic agencies for action.Earlier this year, joint inspections were conducted across all 12 critical corridors. Based on these studies, traffic police said they implemented measures directly in some locations and referred larger interventions to agencies such as PWD, MCD and NHAI.""The exercise began with the first step of identifying the problems. At some locations, changes have already been made, while at others, only partial or temporary measures are in place. Letters have also been sent to the civic agencies. The proposed solutions, once implemented, will bring significant improvements,"" said Dinesh Kumar Gupta, additional CP (traffic, zone II).Among the 12 stretches is the one between Mangi Bridge and Majnu Ka Tila on Ring Road, which would often see bottlenecks on a daily basis.Traffic from four lanes of Outer Ring Road and three of Ring Road converges at Salim Garh Y-point, before crawling past Hanuman Setu towards ISBT Kashmere Gate. Moreover, inflow from the Hanuman Mandir service road adds to the pressure.To reduce the chaos, traffic police have closed the central cut at Hanuman Setu and removed old foot overbridge (FOB) pillars that encroached on usable carriageway near Majnu Ka Tila. However, much remains pending, including new footbridges at Majnu Ka Tila and Monastery Market, dedicated parking spaces, and proper directional signage to control roadside halting.Visible measures have also been implemented on Rani Jhansi Road from Panchkuian to Filmistan. Once crippled by oversized roundabouts at Jhandewalan and Eidgah, the corridor now benefits from reduced circle diameters, a new traffic signal at Eidgah, and fresh markings that lend order to movement. Encroachment removal drives have reclaimed some road space, and 23 personnel are deployed daily for regulation. Yet, the problem is far from solved. Despite repeated reminders to the horticulture department, large trees and park boundaries continue to jut into the carriageway, narrowing the lanes.In the north, GTK Road bears the load of the wholesale market at Azadpur, with trucks, carts, rickshaws and thousands of pedestrians competing for space. Metro construction has further narrowed the carriageway, while uneven surfaces and blocked passages worsen the mess. Safety railings, drainage repairs, merging of bus stops and sealing of unsafe cuts were all recommended in April, but none has been carried out so far.A similar picture emerges at the Libaspur underpass on NH-44, where trucks from multiple directions clash in a tangle of U-turns. Some relief has come in the form of relocated bus stops and the posting of additional enforcement staff, but structural upgrades, such as widening the bridge, installing blinkers and building protective barriers, remain with the highway authority.In Anand Vihar, one of Delhi's busiest transit hubs, uneven stretches have been levelled, central verges repaired and barricades shifted inwards to ease the flow. An FOB project has been cleared by PWD, parking allotted to UP Roadways, and prosecutions against illegal parking stepped up. Regular encroachment drives and daily street vendor clearances are now routine. Even so, the absence of proper pedestrian infrastructure, the short stay time for buses inside ISBT, and the lack of dedicated spaces for autos and app-based cabs continue to choke the hub.Just a few kilometres away, at Khajuri Chowk, where traffic from five directions converges chaotically, only stopgap measures have been put in place. Unsafe cuts have been blocked with jersey barriers, but critical proposals to shift a DTC bus stop, create a U-turn at Signature Bridge and install a signal at the chowk are yet to be implemented.On NH-48 between Shankar Vihar and Shiv Murti — where a maze of road and tunnel projects near Dwarka and the airport feed into the corridor — traffic police worked with NHAI to close or divert several entry and exit points. This eased some pressure, but the area remains under strain from overlapping flows from Gurgaon, Mahipalpur, Rangpuri and IGI Airport. On the Ring Road between Safdarjung Hospital and Dhaula Kuan, resurfacing and signage work is underway, but the proposed widening near the AIIMS loop and bottleneck fixes around the Hyatt Regency and Moti Bagh flyovers remain pending.The western corridors underline the city's chronic struggle with encroachments and civic apathy. From Zakhira to Dwarka Mor along Shivaji Marg, missing central verge grills, unmarked zebra crossings, encroachments and transformers placed on the road all combine to slow traffic. Joint drives with MCD were conducted in May, but most proposals remain on paper.A similar story plays out on Rohtak Road between Zakhira flyover and Mundka, where PWD has been repeatedly urged to shut unsafe cuts, relocate service lanes and create proper U-turns. Ongoing drain work has resulted in debris strewn across carriageways, only worsening congestion.In south Delhi, the Outer Ring Road stretch between Chirag Dilli and Modi Mill flyovers still suffers from damaged verges, missing protective barriers, unauthorised cuts and illegal debris dumping. Some re-carpeting has been completed, but major fixes, such as road widening near Greater Kailash metro station, remain unresolved.Meanwhile, on MG Road, between Andheria Mor and Aya Nagar, the wait continues for a signal-free corridor. Traffic police have proposed closing seven signals and replacing them with controlled U-turns, but the plan awaits approval from the civic agency.","At least five out of 12 critical corridors have undergone partial fixes.

Apple has been accused by authors of illegally using their copyrighted books to help train its artificial intelligence systems, reports news agency Reuters. Authors Grady Hendrix and Jennifer Roberson, as per the report, have filed a lawsuit in the federal court in Northern California. The proposed class action alleges that Apple copied protected works without consent and without credit or compensation.“Apple has not attempted to pay these authors for their contributions to this potentially lucrative venture,” the lawsuit claims.The case is part of a growing wave of lawsuits from writers, publishers, and news outlets who accuse major technology firms of using copyrighted works to train artificial intelligence systems. In June, Microsoft was also sued by several authors who claimed their books were used without consent to train its Megatron AI model. Meta Platforms and Microsoft-backed OpenAI also face legal action over the alleged misuse of copyrighted materials in AI training.Another lawsuit accused Apple of training its OpenELM language models with pirated books.

Gmail Warning: That Urgent Security Notification from Google May Be a Trap

Eugene Ling , a former sales employee at Scale AI, has issued a public apology to his current team and employer, Mercor , after a report emerged that his ex-company is suing them. The lawsuit, filed two months after Scale AI secured a massive $14.3 billion investment from Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, accuses Ling of stealing confidential documents containing customer strategies and other proprietary information.“Just heard I’m getting sued by Scale. Last month, I left Scale to work at Mercor. I know this was frustrating for my old team, and I feel bad about that,” Ling said in a post.Ling also denies any “nefarious intent.” He stated that after leaving Scale, he asked his former employer if he could delete files from his personal drive, but was instructed not to.“When Scale reached out about some files I had in my personal drive, I asked if I could just delete them. But Scale asked that I not do anything with them, so I’m still waiting for guidance on how to resolve this. I’ve never used any of them in this role. It sounds like Scale wants to sue me and that’s up to them,” he said.“I’m really sorry to my new team at Mercor for having to deal with this,” he added.Ling’s post that came after a report by TechCrunch said that Scale AI’s lawsuit alleges that Ling ""stole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale’s customer strategies and other proprietary information"" and attempted to poach one of Scale’s largest clients for Mercor.Surya Midha, co-founder of Mercor, told the publication that Ling may have had possession of the documents but denied that his company had used any of the data.“We have no interest in any of Scale’s trade secrets and in fact are intentionally running our business in a different way,” Midha said. He also revealed that Mercor had reached out to Scale AI days before the lawsuit was filed, offering to have Ling destroy the files.Scale AI's lawsuit claims that the stolen documents contained data that would have allowed Mercor to serve several of its most important clients, including a major customer, referred to in the suit as ""Customer A."" Scale alleges that winning this client away would be “worth millions of dollars to Mercor.”The legal action comes just weeks after Meta's significant investment in Scale AI. Zuckerberg’s company now holds 49% of Scale AI and also hired its CEO Alexandr Wang as well as some other employees as part of the deal. Wang is now chief AI officer of Meta.","Eugene Ling, a former sales employee at Scale AI, has issued a public apology to his current team and employer, Mercor.

Larry Ellison’s billion-dollar real estate empire: From Japanese palaces to Hawaiian island mansions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/larry-ellisons-billion-dollar-real-estate-empire-from-japanese-palaces-to-hawaiian-island-mansions/articleshow/123712643.cms,"Image: Getty Images

Lanai: The crown jewel of Larry Ellison’s empire

Woodside estate: A Japanese-inspired masterpiece











Malibu’s Carbon Beach: Billionaire’s Row



Record-breaking Florida deals

Historic and international holdings





Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle and one of the richest men in the world, is almost as famous for his vast real estate empire as he is for building one of Silicon Valley’s most influential companies. According to Forbes, Ellison’s net worth surpasses $270 billion, and he has funneled more than $1 billion into acquiring homes, resorts, private islands, and historic estates across the globe. His portfolio spans from Hawaii’s remote island of Lanai to oceanfront Malibu mansions and palatial estates in California, Florida, and beyond. Each property is not just a luxury purchase but also a reflection of Ellison’s love for art, culture, and architecture, making his holdings some of the most unique among the billionaire class.In 2012, Ellison stunned the world by buying 98% of the Hawaiian island of Lanai for $300 million from Dole Food chairman David Murdock, as reported by Forbes. He didn’t stop there—Ellison has since invested close to half a billion dollars in the island, transforming it into both a luxury retreat and a hub for sustainability. His projects include the exclusive Sensei Retreat, which charges around $3,000 per night, Nobu Lanai restaurant, and sprawling hydroponic farms powered by renewable energy.Ellison often describes Lanai as a “laboratory for sustainability,” where experimental agriculture and wellness tourism coexist. With a private airport, pristine beaches, and luxury resorts operated by Four Seasons, Lanai has become the ultimate showcase of Ellison’s wealth and vision.Ellison’s 23-acre estate in Woodside, California, is widely considered his architectural crown jewel. Modeled after a 16th-century Japanese imperial palace, the estate cost over $200 million to design and construct, as reported by Fortune. It features an 8,000-square-foot main house, koi ponds, man-made lakes, and an authentic tea house—all designed to reflect Ellison’s fascination with Japanese culture. The home is surrounded by more than 1,000 cherry trees and maples, making it a living, seasonal work of art. The project reportedly took nearly a decade to complete and is so extensive that Ellison once joked it could be mistaken for a small village. For Ellison, this wasn’t just a residence but a personal tribute to Japanese architecture and aesthetics.Ellison is also the largest individual landowner on Malibu’s Carbon Beach, famously known as “Billionaire’s Beach.” According to The Wall Street Journal, Ellison owns at least 10 properties on this coveted stretch, valued collectively at more than $180 million. His holdings include sleek modernist mansions with private beach access and homes he rents to celebrities and high-profile figures. One of his most notable acquisitions was a $48 million estate in 2017, featuring a pool and tennis court. Carbon Beach, where homes regularly sell for over $20 million, has long been a playground for tech moguls, Hollywood stars, and financiers. Ellison’s dominance here reflects his strategy of concentrating ownership in ultra-exclusive neighborhoods, giving him unmatched privacy and prestige.Ellison has also turned his attention to Florida’s luxury coastline. In 2022, he shattered records with his purchase of a $173 million estate in Manalapan, the most expensive home ever sold in the state at the time, according to Forbes. Not stopping there, Ellison also acquired the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa for $277 million, cementing his presence in South Florida’s hospitality market. His total Manalapan investments exceed $450 million. Earlier, in 2021, Ellison purchased an $80 million North Palm Beach mansion, giving him one of the largest oceanfront properties in Palm Beach County. These acquisitions underscore his interest not only in trophy homes but also in entire resorts that generate long-term value and influence.Ellison’s taste for grandeur extends to historic estates and international properties. In Newport, Rhode Island, he owns the Beechwood Mansion, once home to the Astor family, which he bought for $10.5 million. According to Fortune, Ellison has spent more than $100 million restoring Beechwood to serve as a private art museum for his collection. He also owns the Cal Neva Lodge at Lake Tahoe, once co-owned by Frank Sinatra, and has holdings in San Francisco and Aspen. Internationally, Ellison has purchased properties in Japan, a country that has deeply influenced his architectural choices. His investments abroad further reflect his blend of cultural appreciation and ambition to create lasting landmarks.Ellison’s real estate strategy goes beyond luxury—it’s about vision. He often treats his properties as experimental grounds. On Lanai, he tests sustainable food production and eco-tourism. In Woodside, he celebrates Japanese culture. With Beechwood, he turns a historic estate into a private art museum. His Malibu holdings consolidate his position in one of the world’s most prestigious beaches. Unlike many billionaires who simply collect trophy properties, Ellison’s empire reflects his belief that real estate can combine art, culture, technology, and sustainability. For him, every home is not just a residence but a statement.","Larry Ellison is the co-founder of Oracle and one of the richest men in the world.

Elon Musk: Tesla’s $1 trillion package for Elon Musk could make him the world’s first trillionaire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/teslas-1-trillion-package-for-elon-musk-could-make-him-the-worlds-first-trillionaire/articleshow/123731417.cms,"Elon Musk’s record-breaking pay plan



Targets and milestones

Raising Tesla’s market capitalization from roughly $1.1 trillion to at least $8.5 trillion.

Delivering one million autonomous “robotaxis” into commercial operation.

Deploying one million humanoid robots.

Increasing Tesla’s annual profits from $17 billion to $400 billion.

Achieving 20 million vehicle deliveries per year.

Approval & legal considerations







Elon Musk could potentially become the world’s first trillionaire under a newly proposed Tesla pay plan, which ties his compensation entirely to ambitious long-term performance milestones. The package, if fully realized, could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade, contingent on Tesla achieving unprecedented targets in market capitalization, vehicle deliveries, and robotics deployment. The plan relies exclusively on Tesla stock and requires Musk to remain at the company for up to 10 years to receive the full payout. Analysts describe it as the largest executive compensation in history, combining immense reward with extraordinary risk.The proposed compensation package could award Musk nearly 12% of Tesla’s total stock, approximately 423.7 million additional shares, if he meets the set targets. All compensation would be delivered in Tesla shares, with partial vesting requiring 7.5 years of continued leadership and full vesting requiring a full 10-year commitment. The ambitious nature of the plan underscores Tesla’s confidence in Musk’s leadership and its vision for exponential growth.Tesla has outlined unprecedented targets for Musk to achieve, including:These goals are widely regarded as extraordinary and challenging, pushing the boundaries of current automotive, AI, and robotics technologies.The Tesla pay plan must be approved by shareholders in a vote scheduled for November 6, 2025. Experts note that the proposal mirrors Musk’s 2018 pay plan, which faced legal hurdles, but Tesla’s relocation to Texas may help it withstand scrutiny this time. If approved, the plan could roughly double Musk’s existing Tesla stake to nearly 29%, consolidating his influence over the company’s strategic direction.Financial experts emphasizes both the extraordinary opportunity and the extreme difficulty of Musk achieving trillionaire status under this plan. Observers praise the plan as a strategic tool to secure Musk’s long-term focus at Tesla while also expressing concern over massive shareholder dilution and the feasibility of reaching such ambitious targets. If successful, the package would not only make Musk the first trillionaire in history but also fundamentally reshape executive compensation expectations in global business. This proposal could redefine not just Musk’s legacy but the future of corporate leadership itself.It highlights a new era where technology visionaries are rewarded on a scale once unimaginable.","Elon Musk could potentially become the world’s first trillionaire under a newly proposed Tesla pay plan.

Wait for selectors, coaches and support staff continues

Unrest has gripped Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) corridors again as former secretary Vinod Tihara has urged president Rohan Jaitley and other members of the Apex Council to call for a Special General Meeting for fresh elections for the secretary post. Following up on his previous emails to the cricket body, Tihara has highlighted how current secretary Ashok Sharma will be disqualified to hold the position after September 30.In a 28-page document addressed to all the office bearers, Tihara attached annexures supporting his claims and reiterated how Sharma will complete his cumulative tenure of nine years in office as Apex Council Member by September 30.""Mr Ashok Sharma, a current Director and Secretary of the DDCA will by 30th September 2025, complete a cumulative tenure of 9 years (3288 days) in office as Apex Council Member.

One says something, one says another. Whatever it is, let's get done with it now. The season is on us and the last thing DDCA needs right now is more confusion and chaos.

Asian markets opened the week on a firm note on Monday, with Tokyo leading gains after Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation, sending the yen lower and boosting exporters.At the same time, oil prices edged higher as Opec+ signalled a slower pace of output increases.Tokyo’s Nikkei index surged 1.9 percent, supported by a weaker yen, which slipped to 148.14 per dollar from 147.07 on Friday.Analysts said Ishiba’s decision to step down after less than a year in power fuelled political uncertainty in Japan, putting pressure on the currency and government bonds.According to news agency AFP, Michael Brown of Pepperstone said the timing of Ishiba’s announcement was “certainly unexpected” and added that it “introduces significant downside risks for the Japanese yen and for long-end Japanese government bonds.”Other regional markets also traded higher, with Hong Kong and Shanghai up 0.3 per cent, Taipei gaining 0.5 per cent and Seoul advancing 0.3 per cent. Singapore and Wellington inched 0.1 percent higher, while Sydney slipped 0.3 per cent.Investors also weighed weak US labour data as it strengthened expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut later this month. “Most investors remain aligned on a 25 basis point cut at the September Fed meeting, but a 50bp cut is now in play,” said Harun Thilak of Validus Risk Management, as cited by Reuters.On the commodities front, oil prices recovered part of last week’s losses after Opec+ agreed to raise output more modestly from October.As per Reuters, Brent crude rose 0.5 per cent to $65.84 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate climbed 0.5 percent to $62.17. Eight Opec+ members will lift production by 137,000 barrels per day from next month, a slower pace compared with recent months.Toshitaka Tazawa of Fujitomi Securities said the modest increase offered “relief” but warned that “downward pressure is likely to persist as Opec+ continues to raise production and supplies ease.”","Tokyo's Nikkei index surged 1.9 percent, supported by a weaker yen.

BSE Sensex was at 80,905.32, up 195 points or 0.24%.Market experts indicate that whilst global trade uncertainties and tariff increases pose external challenges, the streamlined GST structure coupled with robust domestic economic indicators should sustain market momentum in the immediate future.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The heightened uncertainty surrounding the US - India trade relations will continue to weigh on markets. President Trump’s recent statements regarding the “special US- India ties” and that “there is nothing to worry” indicate improvement in the strained relationship. However, Trump’s comments on the second round of sanctions against Russia and Peter Navarro’s continuing tirade against India are negative factors. ”“Also there are rumours of probable restrictions on India’s IT exports even though trade in services has so far been untouched by reciprocal tariffs.These concerns will continue to influence the market which got a morale boost from the GST reforms.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.
