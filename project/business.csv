SSC Recruitment Scam: Massive Protest In Kolkata, Police Detains Protesting Teachers Amid Scuffles

NEW DELHI: Amid protests over glitches and irregularities in the conduct of computer-based govt recruitment examinations by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan on Monday assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” and no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.Gopalakrishnan said around 5.5 lakh candidates had appeared in the first exam, the first to be held after M/s Eduquity replaced M/s TCS as the exam conducting agency (ECA) in July 2025, with questions being set by other content agencies and delivered digitally from a vault. Some candidates at two of the total 194 centres faced issues due to bugs, like duplication of questions, repeat of same options, etc.“A detailed analysis by CDAC identified about 59,000 candidates affected by system disruptions. They will now retake the exam in three shifts on August 29, 2025,” he said adding that the stenographer exams conducted from Aug 6-8 had witnessed no disruptions. SSC has also rescheduled the Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Exam from August 13 to mid-September.On Congress alleging “rigging” of government recruitment exams under the Modi government and slamming the “brutal lathicharge” on those protesting against it, SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.Elaborating on the recent SSC examination reforms, Gopalakrishnan said aadhaar-based authentication at the application level and exam venue has helped prevent impersonation and repeated attempts by candidates to appear in multiple sessions or to take the role of scribes and exam functionaries. Also, deviation from old question patterns had denied the coaching institutes undue advantage. Rather than a single agency like TCS performing all tasks, SSC, has, from July onwards, entrusted different aspects of the examinations to four agencies.Eduquity is now the ECA, even as content agencies set the questions, CDAC handles IT security and detects hacking/malpractices and an independent agency monitors the exams. The idea is that no single agency can hijack or compromise the exams, and to maintain transparency and fairness, according to Gopalakrishnan.He further noted that the content providers, ECA and monitoring agencies are subject to deterrent penalties for any shortcomings in performance.The multiple agency system, it was highlighted, has resulted in certain entities (led by some online tutors or coaching institutes) attributing the initial system hiccups to ECA and demanding that TCS be brought back. Gopalakrishnan however explained that Eduquity was selected through a tender, with TCS listed only at third position in the bid.","SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been ‘stabilised’ SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123514961,imgsize-418059,width-400,resizemode-4/123514961.jpg"

Framing norms shouldn’t be knee-jerk reaction: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday said online shows by influencers and YouTubers do not enjoy the protection that free speech does. Saying so, it asked five popular content creators to tender public apologies on their channels - they have already apologised to the court - for ridiculing people with disability in their shows.""Influencers commercialise speech. When a speech falls in the ambit of commercial or prohibitive categories, the immunity under right to free speech is not available,"" a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi ruled.The case that started with Ranveer Allahbadia's vulgar comments was expanded to cover these five: Samay Raina, Vipul Goyal, Balraj Paramjeet Singh Ghai, Sonali Thakur and Nishant Jagdish Tanwar.AG R Venkataramani said he has held consultations with stakeholders, including I&B ministry, for framing guidelines for speeches on the web world, but added the issue required sensitive handling since it concerns free speech.SC said framing of guidelines should not be a knee-jerk reaction to infractions by a few influencers but must be broad-based, considering the advances in communication technology and the challenges that might arise in future and would need to be tackled to ensure an inclusive society.“Unless effective guidelines are in place, the young generation’s fertile mind would enable them to step around it. Consequences for breaching the line should be proportional to the harm/damage caused. Otherwise, they would think that they would be off the hook by tendering an apology,"" SC said.The influencers faced SC’s heat after SMA Foundation accused them of ridiculing the exorbitant cost of treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, a rare disease and disability. Senior advocate Aparajita Singh said influencers must be responsible in their speeches as what they say matters a lot to the younger generation.Singh suggested that apart from tendering apologies, they must carry out activities towards creating an inclusive society.Kant and Bagchi said the influencers present in the courtroom must tender public apologies on their channels and file affidavits detailing the activities they have undertaken towards mainstreaming people with disability. “Degree of repentance should be proportionate to the degree of violation,” the bench said. It said the question of appropriate penalty/cost that may be imposed on them would be considered later.",Supreme Court says online shows by influencers and YouTubers do not enjoy the protection that free speech does.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Monday set aside order directing CBSE to provide information under the Right To Information (RTI) about whether Smriti Irani had cleared her 10th and 12th examinations in the year 1991 and 1993.Justice Sachin Dutta ruled that the entire approach of the Central Information Commission (CIC) in the impugned order was ""thoroughly misconceived"".""The conclusion that information relating to degree/marks/results of any particular individual is in the nature of ‘public information’, is in direct and utter contravention of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Central Public Information Officer, Supreme Court of India v.

In December 2016, the CIC had allowed people to inspect the records of all students who passed the BA exam in 1978, the same year PM Modi completed his graduation.The Delhi high court had earlier put a stay on the CIC order on January 23, 2017. During the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing Delhi University (DU), argued that the CIC order should be cancelled.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday directed five social media influencers, including India’s Got Latent host Samay Raina, to issue a public apology for mocking persons with disabilities. The apex court observed that freedom of speech and expression can't be applicable to commercial speech hurting sentiments of other community.The court asked the Centre to frame guidelines for social media to curb speeches offending or ridiculing disabled, women, children and senior citizens.The top court also said that it will impose penalties on the social media influencers, including Raina for targeting persons with disabilities.Guidelines for social media regulations shouldn't be knee jerk reaction but based on broad parameters having views of all stakeholders, the SC observed, as reported by PTI.Also read - Row over joke on disability: SC pulls up Samay Raina, 4 others; observes 'many free advisors in market' According to LiveLaw, counsel for the respondents undertook that each of them would display an apology on their YouTube channels and podcasts and also file affidavits confirming compliance.

Emphasising the difficulty of enforcing such guidelines, the bench remarked, “Article 19... can’t overpower Article 21,” adding, “Suppose a race takes place between Article 19 and 21, Article 21 has to trump Article 19.”Justice Kant had stressed the need to protect dignity: “What we are doing is for posterity. You have to ensure that not a single word is misused by anyone... A framework must be there that the dignity of anyone is not violated.”The petition was filed by NGO Cure SMA Foundation of India. The court previously warned that mocking the disabled cannot be allowed under the guise of free speech and termed the influencers’ actions “damaging” and “demoralising.”Raina, along with podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia, was booked by Maharashtra and Assam police.

The agency then sent the seized NRI certificates to Indian embassies and missions for verification. Most of them were found to be forged or fake. The probe further revealed these medical colleges were paying agents to have fake NRI documents prepared.The agents also prepared fake family trees of NRIs, wherein these unrelated NRIs were shown as relatives of students to help secure admissions under the NRI quota. In some cases, the agents and medical colleges used documents of one NRI for admissions of multiple candidates, who were unrelated to the NRI sponsor and to each other.The promoters of these medical colleges were found to be behind the illegal admission racket, with their agents spread across the country bringing ""clients"" and helping them generate huge ""proceeds of crime"".The Centre has since revised its NRI admission policy, with the DG of health services issuing fresh guidelines wherein each NRI certificate has to be authenticated by embassies and missions before admission is granted on its basis. This happened after coordinated action involving multiple Union ministries.The MEA too has issued fresh guidelines to its embassies and missions abroad, for strict due diligence in issuance of NRI certificates, outlining the eligibility criteria and clearly delineating 'first degree' and 'second degree' relatives in respect of whom NRIs can get certificates for admissions under the quota in India.The involvement of some NRIs has also come to light. They allowed their names to be used after receiving bribes from the agents of the medical colleges. ""The agents approached and obtained credentials of unrelated NRIs by paying money to them,"" the investigation found.The existing rules specify that the fees of the NRI student must be paid by the NRI sponsor. However, the investigation found that in a majority of the cases fees were paid by the family of the student and not the NRI sponsor, thereby defeating the very purpose of the policy, which is to earn foreign exchange, sources said.Probe revealed many NRI sponsors were not present in India on the dates affidavits were notarised and signed, a senior official said.","ED had conducted searches at various medical colleges in West Bengal and Odisha.

NEW DELHI: Senior BJP leaders have objected to the Karnataka government’s decision to invite Booker Prize-winning author and activist Banu Mushtaq to inaugurate this year’s Mysuru Dasara celebrations. Karnataka minister G Parameshwara, however, countered the criticism, saying, ""This is not a religious issue.""Former minister and BJP MLC CT Ravi argued that it was inappropriate for someone ""whose faith is uncertain"" to lead a religious ceremony.Former Mysuru MP Pratap Simha said while he respects Mushtaq’s achievements, she should preside over literary events, not Dasara. ""It is acceptable when she chairs the Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana but not Dasara, a Hindu religious event which begins with pooja to Goddess Chamundeshwari. Does she have faith in Chamundeshwari Devi? Is she following our traditions?"" he asked.Expelled BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal echoed similar views on X. ""I personally hold respect for Banu Mushtaq madam as a writer and activist. However, her inaugurating Dasara by offering flowers and lighting the lamp to Goddess Chamundeshwari seems to be in conflict with her own religious beliefs,"" he said. Yatnal added that Mushtaq should clarify whether she continues to follow Islam or believes in a broader path that aligns with Hindu traditions, stressing that such clarity was necessary before she performed the inaugural rituals.""She may certainly inaugurate cultural or literary events within Dasara festivities, but the religious inauguration itself should be refrained from,"" Yatnal said, using the hashtag #KarnatakaDasara2025.In another post on X, written in Kannada, he said, ""It is not right for the Dasara inauguration to be done by those from other religions who do not believe in Hindu dharma and practices, and who consider flower worship and idol worship to be 'haram'.""However, BJP MP Tejasvi Surya struck a slightly different note, saying, ""I don’t have an objection to anybody. But Mysuru Dasara is an important religious festival of Karnataka, and we only expect that whoever inaugurates it and offers the first prayers should make their belief in Goddess Chamundeshwari public and clear.""Congress-ruled Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara hit back at BJP's objections to Banu Mushtaq inaugurating Mysuru Dasara, saying, ""It is not right to oppose this. This is not a religious issue. Dasara is a national festival.""Chief minister Siddaramaiah had recently announced Mushtaq’s name to inaugurate the Nada Habba (state festival) Dasara celebrations, which traditionally begin with rituals at the Chamundi Hill temple.Mysuru Dasara, the Royal Festival, marks the triumph of good over evil, celebrated for ten days with Vijayadashami as the grand finale when Goddess Chamundeshwari is believed to have slain Mahishasura.Festivities peak from the sixth day, with rituals dedicated to Saraswati, Durga, and Lakshmi, culminating in a grand procession from Mysuru Palace to Bannimantap.Recognised as Karnataka’s Nada Habba (state festival), the event is led by the Mysuru royal family, who continue centuries-old traditions and pujas.","Banu Mushtaq is a Booker Prize-winning author and activist.

New Delhi: Marks obtained, grades and answer sheets are ""personal information"" protected under the exemption clause of the Right to Information Act, Delhi high court held Monday as it set aside CIC orders to disclose details of PM Modi's bachelors degree from DU, reports Abhinav Garg.HC drew a distinction between ""something which is of interest to the public"" and ""something which is in the public interest"" and pointed out that ""public interest override would not be attracted"" where the information sought has no bearing on the discharge of responsibilities by the concerned public official/functionary (whose personal information is sought).In a 175-page verdict, HC allowed appeals filed by DU in PM Modi's case & CBSE, which had challenged the direction to furnish copies of Class 10 and 12 records of ex-Union minister Smriti Irani.""Thus, it is unambiguously clear that the 'marks obtained', grades, and answer sheets, etc, are in the nature of personal information and are protected under Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act, subject to an assessment of overriding public interest... information pertaining to an individual's educational qualifications falls within ambit of 'personal information' under Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act,"" Justice Sachin Dutta noted.""Public interest considerations would prevail if the information sought has a bearing on the performance of official responsibilities/functions entrusted to a public functionary, or where the information sought concerns exposure of wrongdoing in the discharge of official functions, financial impropriety, inefficiency and/or has a bearing on the very eligibility (as prescribed under law) for holding a particular office,"" it clarified.Dealing with a batch of petitions stemming from CIC rulings, Justice Datta observed that the ""entire approach of CIC was thoroughly misconceived"". Following an RTI application by one Neeraj, CIC had in 2016 asked DU to allow inspection of records of all students who cleared BA exam in 1978 - the year the PM passed out. HC, however, had stayed the CIC order on Jan 23, 2017.In its verdict on Monday, HC stressed that RTI Act was enacted to promote transparency in govt functioning and not to ""provide fodder for sensationalism"" and further observed that ""what may superficially appear to be an innocuous or isolated disclosure"" could open ""floodgates of indiscriminate demands, motivated by idle curiosity or sensationalism"" instead of an objective ""public interest"" consideration.Citing the landmark K S Puttaswamy verdict on right to privacy by Supreme Court, HC emphasised 'disclosure of academic details sans any overriding public interest, would amount to an intrusion into the personal sphere which is constitutionally protected post. The fact that the information sought pertains to a public figure does not extinguish privacy/confidentiality rights over personal data, unconnected with public duties'.DU challenged the CIC order on grounds that it held the information of students in a fiduciary capacity and ""mere curiosity"" in the absence of public interest did not entitle anyone to seek private information under the RTI law. The applicants had previously defended the CIC's order on grounds that RTI Act provided for disclosure of the PM's educational information in greater public good.In Irani's case, it cited the same exemption clause and said that her educational qualifications were not in the nature of any statutory requirement for holding any public office or discharging official responsibilities.","RTI wasn't enacted to 'provide fodder for sensationalism': HC. Marks obtained, grades and answer sheets are ""personal information"" protected under exemption clause of the Right to Information Act.

SC tears into NGT for ordering ED probe in violation of law & beyond jurisdiction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-tears-into-ngt-for-ordering-ed-probe-in-violation-of-law-beyond-jurisdiction/articleshow/123512078.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Quashing a National Green Tribunal order that had directed ED to examine a matter against a polluting company, which was also slapped a fine of Rs 50 crore, the Supreme Court has observed that the tribunal devoted 145 pages to writing a ruling which was in violation of law and beyond its jurisdiction, and said that ""application of mind is not proportionate to the number of pages"".A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran also appealed to courts and tribunals to refrain from engaging in mere rhetoric by stating the law in general without reference to the facts of the case.Finding fault with NGT's order to involve ED in a pollution case where no scheduled offence was in question, the bench said SC had earlier too questioned the jurisdiction of NGT to direct prosecution of individuals under the PMLA.""NGT should act within the contours of the powers conferred on it which is Section 15 of the NGT Act. Though such power would be available to a court constituted under PMLA or to constitutional courts, it would not be available for exercise by NGT, constituted to ensure effective and expeditious consideration of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources, including enforcement of any legal right and giving relief and compensation for damages to persons and properties.We hence set aside the direction issued to ED; but say nothing on whether there is an offence made out or not, which at this stage is not within our ken,"" the bench said.It also said that there was no basis for NGT to impose a penalty of Rs 50 crore on the company and held that imposition of penalties cannot be done on the basis of the annual turnover of a firm.""The methodology adopted by NGT for imposition of penalty was held to be totally unknown to any principle of law. We fully agree with the observation and add that the rule of law does not permit the state or its agencies to extract a 'pound of flesh', even in environmental matters. Though in the present case there is an observation made that there was admitted turnover of Rs 550 crore; we still notice the absence of nexus between the turnover and the pollution alleged,"" it said.""Before we leave the matter, with some anguish, we cannot but indicate that application of mind is not proportionate to the number of pages. The impugned judgment deals elaborately with environmental law, numerous pollution prevention measures, guidelines and publications issued by various states as also decisions in that regard. It also extracts various reports filed by the Joint Committee, interim orders of NGT and objections raised by industry; which would anyway be available in the records of the case. In the context of the last of the reports having found complete compliance, we cannot but observe that unfortunately this was an exercise in futility. Judicious consideration is the sum and substance of adjudication and the courts/tribunals should restrain themselves from engaging in mere rhetoric by stating the law in general without particular reference to the facts,"" it said.","NGT devoted 145 pages to writing a ruling which was in violation of law and beyond its jurisdiction, says Supreme Court. A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran also appealed to courts and tribunals to refrain from engaging in mere rhetoric.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123512079,imgsize-42646,width-400,resizemode-4/123512079.jpg"
Collegium picks Chief Justices of Bombay & Patna HCs as judges of SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/collegium-picks-chief-justices-of-bombay-patna-hcs-as-judges-of-sc/articleshow/123512046.cms,"Bombay high court chief justice (CJ) Alok Aradhe and Patna high court CJ Vipul M Pancholi

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court's five-judge collegium led by CJI B R Gavai on Monday recommended to the govt to appoint Bombay high court chief justice (CJ) Alok Aradhe and Patna high court CJ Vipul M Pancholi as SC judges.The collegium also comprises Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, J K Maheshwari and B V Nagarathna. Justice Aradhe is from Madhya Pradesh HC and is fifth on the seniority list of HC judges. Justice Pancholi, who is from Gujarat HC, figures at number 57 on the seniority list.Gujarat HC already has two judges - J B Pardiwala and N V Anjaria - in SC. The arrival of Justice Pancholi will give the HC disproportionate representation. While Justice Pardiwala would have a long two-year-and-three-month tenure as CJI from May 3, 2028, till Aug 11, 2030, Justice Pancholi, on appointment as SC judge, would have a tenure of over one year and seven months from Oct 3, 2031, till May 27, 2033In a span of five years, starting from May 3, 2028, two judges from Gujarat HC would be CJIs and enjoy a tenure of more than four years. The last CJI from Gujarat HC was Justice A M Ahmadi, who served from Oct 25, 1994, to March 3, 1997.Aradhe was appointed as a judge of Madhya Pradesh HC in 2009. Pancholi was appointed as a judge of Gujarat HC in Oct 2014, which makes him one of the quickest to climb the ladder in the hierarchy-sensitive constitutional courts to reach the highest court. When they get appointed by the President, the SC will reach its full strength of 34 judges.Aradhe's career path meandered through the J&K HC where he was first a judge and then acting CJ, a responsibility he was to handle also in Karnataka HC before becoming CJ of Telangana HC in July 2023. He took oath as Bombay HC CJ on Jan 21 this year. Pancholi's career progression has been smoother. He was transferred in July 2023 to Patna HC, where he became its CJ a month back.SC sources said the collegium also decided to transfer as many as 14 judges from different HCs, which included two from Delhi HC - Justices Arun Monga and Tara V Ganju. Sources said while Justice Monga is recommended to be transferred to Kerala HC, Justice Ganju has been recommended to be transferred to Patna HC.It has also decided to transfer Atul Sreedharan from MP HC to Chhattisgarh HC, Sanjay Agrawal from Chhattisgarh HC to Allahabad HC, J Nisha Banu from Madras HC to Kerala HC, Dinesh Mehta from Rajasthan HC to Delhi HC, Avneesh Jhingan from Rajasthan HC to Delhi HC, Sanjay Kumar Singh from Allahabad HC to Madras HC, Rohit Ranjan Agarwal from Allahabad HC to Calcutta HC, Manavendranath Roy from Gujarat HC to AP HC, Donadi Ramesh from Allahabad HC to AP HC, Sandeep Natvarlal Bhatt from Gujarat HC to MP HC, Chandrasekharan Sudha from Kerala HC to Delhi HC and Subhendu Samanta from Calcutta HC to AP HC.","The Supreme Court's five-judge collegium led by CJI B R Gavai on Monday recommended to the govt to appoint Bombay high court chief justice (CJ) Alok Aradhe and Patna high court CJ Vipul M Pancholi as SC judges.

PM: Countries following self-centred economic policies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-countries-following-self-centred-economic-policies/articleshow/123511924.cms,"File photo

AHMEDABAD: Just two days ahead of the Aug 27 deadline for US President Donald Trump's proposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods, PM Narendra Modi on Monday underlined the challenge of ""self-centred economic policies"" and called on citizens and businesses to embrace Swadeshi - urging them to buy and sell only 'Made in India' products to make the country self-reliant and developed.""I am asking our shopkeepers and traders. Do not sell foreign goods. This will provide a huge boost to the Make in India movement,"" the PM said, adding that he would not cave in to pressure.The pitch for Swadeshi came at a time of uncertainty over whether Trump would Wednesday carry out his threat to slap an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, with many considering the remark about “self-centered economic policies” to be a reference to Washington’s switch to extractive mercantilism.Modi avoided mentioning names but made plain his intent not to succumb to pressure, emphasising that the interests of farmers and small businesses was paramount. “For Modi, the interests of farmers, cattle-rearers and small-scale industries are paramount. Pressure on us may increase, but we will bear it all,” the PM affirmed. He hit out at Congress, saying the party which ruled India for 60-65 years, made the nation dependent on other countries in order to indulge in “import scams”.Seeking to promote Swadeshi, he said : “Festivals are coming... From the land of revered Bapu Mahatma Gandhi, I am repeatedly urging countrymen to make it their life mantra — whatever we buy will be Made in India, it will be Swadeshi. Whatever items are for home decoration, let them be Made in India. If you want to give a gift to friends, let it be a gift made in India, made by the people of India,” urged Modi, addressing a public meeting in east Ahmedabad.PM laid foundation stones and unveiled projects worth Rs 5,477 crore for Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Mehsana districts in Gujarat.",PM Narendra Modi calls on citizens and businesses to embrace Swadeshi.

I am directing my officers to display details of contractors, officials and the defect liability period of each stretch along highways, so that they are also held accountable,” he said, emphasising the need for quality project preparation and construction.Umashanker, while citing the example of how NHAI had to incur extra expenditure in Gurgaon to take up additional work on NH-48, said that the highway project report did not anticipate the future problems and also did not factor in the need to provide safe and adequate crossings for people given that the highway divides the city into two parts.",Nearly 30% of private cars and jeeps taking the Delhi-Chandigarh highway are using the FASTag Annual Pass.

Ethel Caterham: The world’s oldest living person witnessing a century of change



Ethel Caterham: Family, lifestyle, and what her longevity inspiring the world

Ethel Caterham, a British centenarian residing in Lightwater, Surrey, has officially become the world’s oldest living person at 116 years old. Born on 21 August 1909, Caterham has lived through some of the most transformative events in modern history, including the Titanic disaster, the Russian Revolution, and both World Wars. She is also the last surviving subject of King Edward VII, representing a living connection to early 20th-century British monarchy. Recognised by King Charles III with a birthday card in 2024, Caterham’s milestone has captured global attention. Her story highlights the remarkable combination of longevity, resilience, and historical perspective, inspiring people worldwide to reflect on the extraordinary possibilities of human life, the evolution of society, and the enduring spirit of individuals who witness over a century of change.Ethel Caterham was born in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, as the second youngest of eight siblings. Growing up in a large family in early 20th-century England meant learning responsibility, cooperation, and resilience from an early age. Raised in Tidworth, Wiltshire, she witnessed a rural way of life during a time of social change and industrial expansion. Her childhood coincided with technological advances like the spread of electricity and the automobile, shaping the early experiences of a girl who would live through over a century of innovation.These formative years likely influenced her adaptability and endurance—traits that contribute significantly to longevity.As a teenager, Caterham worked as an au pair in India, an experience that not only broadened her cultural understanding but also introduced her to independence and responsibility at a young age. As reported by BBC, later in life, she moved to Hong Kong and Gibraltar, accompanying her husband Norman, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the British Army. These postings exposed her to diverse climates, cuisines, languages, and social customs, fostering mental agility and adaptability—qualities that studies suggest are linked to longer life expectancy. Living abroad during politically and socially dynamic periods also provided her with firsthand knowledge of global events, enriching her personal and historical perspective.Ethel Caterham’s life spans some of the most significant events of the last century. Born three years before the Titanic sank in 1912, she experienced the societal upheaval of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and lived through both World Wars. As reported, she has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the advent of commercial aviation, the digital revolution, and major advances in medicine. Caterham’s personal story reflects the resilience and adaptability of individuals living through periods of profound uncertainty and change. Being a living archive of these events, she offers a unique perspective on how human society evolves over time.Caterham’s extraordinary longevity has been officially recognized by the British royal family. King Charles III sent her a birthday card to celebrate her 115th birthday in 2024, a gesture highlighting both her personal achievements and her historical significance. Such recognition is rare and symbolic, connecting Caterham to a lineage that stretches back to King Edward VII. The acknowledgment of her life by the monarchy underscores the cultural and historical importance of longevity and demonstrates society’s admiration for those who live exceptionally long lives.Now living in a care home in Lightwater, Surrey, Caterham enjoys her days surrounded by family and close friends. According to her care home, she prefers to celebrate birthdays quietly, at her own pace, reflecting a peaceful and stress-free lifestyle that research shows can support longevity. Her family has expressed gratitude for the outpouring of public interest and kind messages, emphasizing the role of emotional support, social connection, and family bonding in maintaining mental and physical health in extreme old age.While Caterham is the oldest living person today, the record for the verified oldest human remains with Frenchwoman Jeanne Louise Calment, who lived to 122 years and 164 days. Caterham’s age, however, is still remarkable, placing her among the very few documented centenarians to surpass 115. Her life contributes valuable insights into the factors associated with longevity, including genetics, lifestyle, adaptability, and mental resilience. Researchers studying supercentenarians like Caterham aim to understand how humans can live longer, healthier lives, offering inspiration and guidance for aging populations worldwide.","Ethel Caterham, a British centenarian residing in Lightwater, Surrey, has officially become the world’s oldest living person at 116 years old.

Flesh-eating parasite resurfaces in US: Maryland confirms first human screwworm case — what makes it so dangerous?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/flesh-eating-parasite-resurfaces-in-us-maryland-confirms-first-human-screwworm-case-what-makes-it-so-dangerous/articleshow/123508953.cms,"A disturbing diagnosis

The parasite from nightmares

Why ranchers are on edge

Racing against time

A medical mystery in Maryland has jolted health authorities. A traveler returning from Guatemala was found infected with the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite long thought banished from American soil.According to Reuters, it is the first confirmed human case in the United States since the parasite began creeping north from Central America last year.The case, disclosed last week on a CDC call with state veterinarians, has been confirmed but cloaked in secrecy. Officials said the patient has been treated and preventive steps are underway, but privacy laws have kept names, locations, and medical details hidden.The screwworm fly earns its chilling name for good reason: its larvae burrow into open wounds, spiraling deeper into living flesh as they feed.Left untreated, the infestation can be fatal, with doctors often forced to extract hundreds of wriggling larvae from a single patient.Though humans can fall victim, the parasite’s main target is livestock and wildlife. And that’s what makes this Maryland case alarming.The US cattle herd is already at its smallest in seven decades, and beef prices are soaring.An outbreak of screwworms—once eradicated in the 1960s through a pioneering sterile fly program—could devastate the $100-billion beef industry. Experts warn billions of dollars in losses, food shortages, and further price spikes could follow if the parasite gains a foothold.The Department of Agriculture is scrambling to contain the threat. Secretary Brooke Rollins announced plans for a new sterile fly plant in Texas, though it could take years to build. At present, the only operational facility is in Panama, producing 100 million sterile flies a week.Scientists say five times that number is needed to halt the northward march. Mexico, too, has launched a $51 million project to build its own defenses.","A traveler returning from Guatemala was found infected with the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite long thought banished from American soil.

GAYA: Recent initiative by the state tourism department to introduce an online Pind Daan service has sparked strong opposition from traditional stakeholders in Gaya, including the Gayawal Pandas and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The scheme, aimed at facilitating remote participation in the sacred Pitrapaksh rituals, has been criticized for undermining religious traditions.Under the new scheme, people unable to visit Gaya in person can opt for rituals of the Pind Daan by paying a one-time fee of Rs 23,000. Local priests would perform the rites on behalf of the absentee devotees, and a video recording of the ceremony would be provided via a pen drive. The department has also launched an online portal for booking these services ahead of Pitrapaksh, which begins on Sept 6.However, the move has drawn sharp criticism. Gaya Town MLA and cooperative minister Prem Kumar acknowledged the concerns raised by the Pandas and assured that their sentiments would be respected. He said that the matter would be reviewed at the appropriate level.VHP district president Mani Lal Barik condemned the concept, citing religious texts such as the Garuda Purana, which stipulate that only a son or male descendant can perform Pind Daan in person. ""The rituals must be conducted at sacred altars like Vishnupad, Falgu, and Akshay Vat. Performing them remotely contradicts the scriptures,"" Barik said, adding that he has formally registered his opposition.Echoing similar sentiments, Mahesh Lal Gupt, a respected Panda with religious clients across Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Nepal, questioned the authenticity of online rituals. ""During Pind Daan, the performer chants ‘asmat pita' (my father). Can a proxy truly say that?"" he asked, arguing that the practice compromises the essence of Sanatan Dharma. Gupt urged the state govt to withdraw the scheme, emphasizing that those who understand and respect Hindu traditions would reject such offerings.Shambhu Lal Bitthal, president of the Vishnupad Prabandhkarini Samiti, accused the tourism department of commercialising a deeply spiritual event. ""The govt claims it has no business in business, yet here it is monetizing religion,"" he said.Bitthal also pointed out that only Gayawal Pandas are authorised to perform Pind Daan, whereas the scheme vaguely refers to ‘Purohits', a term that includes non-Panda Brahmins.As the debate intensifies, the future of the online Pind Daan scheme remains uncertain, with religious leaders and devotees calling for its reconsideration in light of traditional values and scriptural mandates.",The state tourism department has introduced an online Pind Daan service.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s pay package legal disputes



“I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned. Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla,”

Realme P4 Pro: Gaming Performance Anyone?

Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s younger brother, Kimbal Musk, has said that the world’s richest man ""deserves to be paid,"" amid an ongoing legal dispute over his brother’s compensation package. Elon Musk does not receive a salary or cash bonuses from Tesla, but is instead compensated through “performance awards” of costly stock options. In an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, Kimbal Musk said,Earlier this month, Tesla's board approved anpay package of 96 million shares for Elon Musk, currently valued at around $29 billion. The shares are set to vest over two years, provided he remains in a key executive role. The pay plan was approved by a special committee of the board, from which both Elon and Kimbal Musk recused themselves, the report added, citing board members Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson’s letter to shareholders.These ""performance awards"" came after a Delaware judge in December 2024 ordered Tesla to cancel Musk’s $56 billion pay package from 2018, which had been a record compensation plan for a public company executive in the US. Before the Delaware court decided on his 2018 package, Musk had posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, in January 2024 that he was seeking greater pay and more control over Tesla.Musk wrote at that time.However, Musk’s new pay package was approved without a shareholder vote. The SOC Investment Group urged Nasdaq to investigate, saying Tesla’s board should have sought shareholder approval. Meanwhile, Tesla board members said a longer-term CEO compensation plan will be presented for a shareholder vote at the November 2024 annual meeting. Apart from this, Musk is also working on products at his AI firm, xAI.","Kimbal Musk says his brother, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, ""deserves to be paid"" Kimbal Musk made the comments in an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Elon Musk does not receive a salary or cash bonuses from Tesla, but is instead compensated through “performance awards” of costly stock options.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123482273,imgsize-853655,width-400,resizemode-4/Elon-Musk-brother-Kimbal-Musk-on-Tesla-CEOs-salary-fight-It-is-very-unfair-that-.jpg"

50% US tariffs impact on India: It’s advantage China, Vietnam

India faces a severe reduction in exports to the US, with projections showing a decline from $86.5 billion in FY2025 to $49.6 billion in FY2026.

GTRI analysis indicates that whilst 30% of exports ($27.6 billion) will remain duty-free and 4% ($3.4 billion) in auto parts will attract a 25% tariff, a significant 66% ($60.2 billion) comprising apparel, textiles, gems & jewellery, shrimp, carpets, and furniture will face a 50% tariff.

This substantial tariff is expected to reduce competitiveness, potentially causing a 70% reduction in these sectors to $18.6 billion, resulting in an overall 43% decline in US-bound exports and significant job losses.

This development poses a critical challenge to India's established position in US labour-intensive markets, threatening substantial unemployment in export-focused regions and potentially diminishing India's role in global supply chains.

Nations including China, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, alongside Pakistan, Nepal, Guatemala, and Kenya are positioned to benefit, possibly securing long-term market advantages even after tariff revisions, says GTRI.

US is still biggest market for India

The Donald Trump administration’s move to impose 50% tariffs on India effective August 27, will pose a significant export challenge for the world’s fifth largest economy. The US administration has released a draft notification outlining its strategy to enforce the supplementary 25% duty on goods from India, following President Donald Trump's earlier declaration.The draft directive, released by the Department of Homeland Security on Monday, specified that the heightened duties would affect Indian merchandise that are ""entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on August 27, 2025"".According to a report by Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), the duties will affect $60.2 billion worth of Indian exports, encompassing textiles, gems and jewellery, shrimp, carpets and furniture.Alternative suppliers, particularly China, Vietnam and Mexico, are positioned to capture market share in sectors where Indian exports face higher tariffs. The labour-intensive sectors in India anticipate a possible 70% reduction in export volumes.GTRI believes that the US tariffs implementation represents a substantial trade challenge for India's economy. The measures affect roughly 66% of India's total exports to the US, approximately $86.5 billion! This situation necessitates strategic adjustments to maintain India's economic growth whilst managing the impact on employment and industrial competitiveness, it says.India's nominal GDP stood at $4,270 billion in FY2025 and would typically achieve 6.5% growth in FY2026 under standard circumstances. The reduction in US exports by $36.9 billion adjusts the FY2025 baseline to $4,233.1 billion. Calculating 6.5% growth from this revised figure results in FY2026 GDP of $4,508.25 billion, yielding an actual growth rate of 5.6%—reflecting a decline of 0.9 percentage points, in the worst case scenario, says GTRI.","GTRI believes that the US tariffs implementation represents a substantial trade challenge for India's economy.

JM Financials initiated coverage on ITC Hotels with a sell rating and a target price of Rs 215. Analysts said although the hotels major delivered good numbers over FY23-25, due to limited incremental inventory getting commissioned till FY28, growth will be limited in the near term. The company has an asset-light pipeline to further expand its footprint to over 200 hotels and about 20,000 keys by 2030. Analysts feel while robust cash generation can enable it to accelerate growth by way of inorganic acquisitions, they believe such an outcome is adequately priced in at current valuations.Kotak Institutional Equities has a buy on Reliance Industries with the target price at Rs 1,555. Analysts feel with a significant 33% decline in capex, R-Jio became free cash flow (FCF) positive and also enabled RIL to be FCF positive on a consolidated basis in FY25. However, due to the higher retail/O2C (oil to consumers)/new energy capex, overall capex was flat on an annual basis at Rs 1.3 lakh crore. With capex not likely to rise much, and amid improving profitability of key businesses (ex-E&P), expect FCF to rise further.Goldman Sachs has a neutral call on TVS Motors with the target price raised tο Rs 3,430. Analysts said rare-earth metal shortage eases for Indian EV makers but no upside from GST cuts yet, as policy is still awaited.TVS Motors’ launches are likely to strengthen leadership in ICE and EV scooter segments. The company is expected to launch an NTORQ 150 scooter and a new electric scooter soon. Analysts believe these launches should extend TVS’ market share leadership in Indian Electric and ICE scooter markets.Jefferies has a buy on Bajaj Finance with the target price at Rs 1,100. Analysts said that the management clarified that while the SME segment is seeing some pressure, stress isn't as high as feared; credit cost for FY26 can be near the guided range of 185-195 basis points of loans and loan growth can be 23-24% on an annual basis. Rajeev's role as MD is till Mar-2028 and thereafter there would be a new CEO from internal candidates. Bajaj Finance is among few large caps with +20% growth and return on equity (ROE).HSBC maintained a buy rating on Trent with the target price at Rs 6,500. Analysts feel for Zudio, only 12 cities (out of 235) have more than 10 stores each, with minimal (20%) store overlap. Assume 6% same-store sales growth (SSSG) over FY25-28, versus five-year average in high-double digits.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"‘You never see the person again’: Trump signs executive order to block cashless bail — why some call it fair, others dangerous",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-never-see-the-person-again-trump-signs-executive-order-to-block-cashless-bail-why-some-call-it-fair-others-dangerous/articleshow/123511986.cms,"What cashless bail is

Where it’s been implemented

When it’s applied

The crime debate

What comes next

President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order threatening to withhold or revoke federal funding from state and local governments that offer cashless bail, framing the practice as a direct threat to public safety.“No cash. Come back in a couple of months, we’ll give you a trial. You never see the person again,” Trump said moments before signing the order.The directive requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to submit a list within 30 days of jurisdictions that have “substantially eliminated cash bail as a potential condition of pretrial release from custody for crimes that pose a clear threat to public safety and order.”Cashless bail policies allow defendants to be released from jail without paying money while awaiting trial. Traditionally, defendants pay bail and recover the money if they appear in court as required. Supporters of reform argue cash bail penalizes the poor, keeping low-income defendants behind bars while wealthier individuals can pay their way out. Critics, however, say removing bail risks releasing violent offenders and undermines court compliance.The Constitution’s Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive bail, but it does not eliminate it as a condition of release.Illinois became the first state in 2023 to abolish cash bail after its Supreme Court upheld the SAFE-T Act, a sweeping criminal justice reform passed in 2021. Judges in Illinois now determine pretrial release based on factors such as public safety and flight risk rather than financial means.Other states and jurisdictions, including New Jersey, New Mexico, and Washington, DC, have also largely eliminated or reduced reliance on cash bail. Many supplement the system with measures such as court date reminders, flexible scheduling, transportation assistance, and on-site childcare to improve attendance rates.Policies differ by state, but many jurisdictions exclude serious crimes such as murder and other violent offenses from eligibility. Judges may also deny release if there is a high risk of flight. In some cases, cashless bail is automatically granted for misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies.The effect of cashless bail on crime remains contested. A 2024 Loyola University of Chicago report on Illinois’ law, one year after implementation, concluded that crime had not increased, with some counties reporting declines in violent and property offenses. Similarly, a 2024 Brennan Center for Justice study covering 33 cities between 2015 and 2021 found “no statistically significant relationship” between bail reform and overall crime rates.Still, the Trump administration cites evidence to the contrary. A 2022 study from the Yolo County, California, district attorney’s office analyzed a temporary cashless bail system introduced statewide during the pandemic. Of 595 defendants released between April 2020 and May 2021, 70.6% were rearrested, with more than half arrested multiple times.Trump’s executive order is expected to trigger legal challenges, as criminal justice reforms remain largely state-driven. Advocates for eliminating cash bail argue that the president’s move criminalizes poverty and undermines reforms that promote fairness. Critics of cashless bail, however, welcome the federal intervention, insisting it is necessary to protect communities from repeat offenders.The order underscores a deepening national divide over how best to balance fairness in the criminal justice system with public safety concerns.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order threatening to withhold or revoke federal funding from state and local governments that offer cashless bail.

‘Forced to look into the camera’: US teacher jailed for 215 years after videotaping abuse of students; school district sued,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/forced-to-look-into-the-camera-us-teacher-jailed-for-215-years-after-videotaping-abuse-of-students-school-district-sued/articleshow/123510636.cms,"Abuse hidden behind 'broadcasting club'

Eligibility for release despite sentence

District sued for failing to act

A Sacramento elementary school teacher who preyed on his students for years has been sentenced to 215 years to life in prison after admitting to sexually abusing children and recording the assaults, prosecutors announced, as reported by US Today.Kim Kenneth Wilson, 64, a longtime teacher at Del Paso Heights Elementary School, pleaded guilty in February to nine counts of committing lewd acts on children. Judge Satnam Rattu delivered the sentence on Aug. 22, describing the crimes as spanning years of calculated abuse.According to prosecutors, Wilson lured students into a private media and broadcasting club he created, where he assaulted them and often filmed the acts. Some abuse also took place at his home during school-related events.When detectives searched his home, they uncovered child-sized sex toys and a large cache of VHS tapes, DVDs, and digital files documenting the assaults. Prosecutors said the videos showed Wilson coercing children to perform sex acts and forcing them to look into the camera.Under California law, Wilson could become eligible for release after serving 20 years.With credit for time already served since his 2023 arrest, he may face parole hearings in about 17 years.The sentencing comes as Wilson and his former employer, the Twin Rivers Unified School District, face lawsuits from former students. One 2023 lawsuit alleges a 7-year-old girl was repeatedly assaulted during the 2013–2014 school year in the same secluded broadcast room prosecutors described.The complaint accuses the district of mishandling or ignoring student complaints of misconduct. Attorney Lauren Cerri, who previously represented another victim, told The Sacramento Bee: “Sadly there’s a repeated pattern of schools putting their image and reputations over the safety of students, turning a blind eye to complaints and ignoring red flags.”That earlier lawsuit settled this month for $6 million. The second case, filed in June 2023, is still pending.USA Today reported that the district has not responded to requests for comment. Wilson, who no longer appears on the school’s staff page, does not have an attorney listed in either his criminal or civil cases.","Kim Kenneth Wilson, 64, a longtime teacher at Del Paso Heights Elementary School, pleaded guilty in February to nine counts of committing lewd acts on children.

. The risk to public health in the US is considered very low.

The parasite reemerged near the Southern border, prompting a major emergency response including a multi-million dollar biosecurity plan led by USDA and state governments.

Efforts include sterile fly production to halt reproduction, enhanced surveillance, and cross-border cooperation to prevent spread.

An $850 million initiative in Texas aims to protect livestock by producing hundreds of billions of sterile flies weekly to disrupt parasite breeding.

Symptoms of screwworm infestation

Screwworm larvae burrow into flesh, causing painful wounds.

Wounds can become very inflamed, painful, and infected due to the larvae feeding on living tissue.

If untreated, infestations can lead to severe tissue damage and death.

Treatment involves laborious removal of larvae and thorough wound disinfection.

Early intervention generally leads to survival, but delayed treatment is life-threatening.

Comparison to flesh-eating bacteria ( necrotizing fasciitis )

Necrotizing fasciitis, caused by bacteria, has symptoms like intense pain around wounds, swelling, redness, fever, and rapid tissue damage.

In contrast, screwworm infestation is caused by fly larvae physically eating living tissue.

is caused by fly larvae physically eating living tissue. Both conditions cause very painful, spreading tissue damage and require urgent treatment.

The first human case of the deadly flesh-eating parasite known as the New World screwworm has been detected in the United States, specifically in Maryland, in a person who recently returned from El Salvador. This parasitic fly lays eggs in wounds of warm-blooded animals. The larvae hatch and burrow into living flesh, feeding on it and causing serious tissue damage, which can be fatal if untreated. The infection is rare but extremely painful and dangerous. Emergency preventive measures are underway to contain any further spread and protect livestock and humans.The New World screwworm (Cochliomyia hominivorax) is a parasitic fly whose larvae invade open wounds and live flesh of warm-blooded animals, including cattle, wildlife, pets, and now humans. The female fly deposits eggs in wounds, and larvae burrow using sharp mandibles, feeding on living tissue for about a week before falling to the ground to mature. It was eradicated in the US decades ago but reemerged recently in Central America and Mexico, spreading northward toward the US border.Public health experts emphasize the importance of early detection in preventing fatal outcomes. Increased global travel and climate change could raise the risk of reintroducing parasites like the screwworm in new regions","The New World screwworm (Cochliomyia hominivorax) is a parasitic fly whose larvae invade open wounds and live flesh of warm-blooded animals.

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.
