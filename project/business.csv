World's most expensive Indo-US NISAR satellite likely to be launched in March: Nasa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/worlds-most-expensive-indo-us-nisar-satellite-likely-to-be-launched-in-march-nasa/articleshow/116610692.cms,"An illustration of NISAR satellite

NEW DELHI: After much delays, Nasa has announced that the world’s most advanced and expensive earth observation satellite NISAR, jointly developed by India and the US for over a decade, is “likely to be launched in March” next year. It was earlier scheduled for launch in 2024.In a statement, the US space agency said, “Nasa and Isro are looking at a likely launch date in March 2025. Short for Nasa-Isro Synthetic Aperture Radar, NISAR will scan nearly all of Earth’s land and ice surfaces twice every 12 days to measure changes in the planet’s ecosystems, its land and sea ice, and its solid Earth. The NISAR satellite will launch from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on India’s southeastern coast.”The 2.8-tonne Nisar satellite, whose development started after India and the US signed an agreement in 2014, is designed to monitor planetary changes with unmatched precision. The over Rs 5,800-crore imaging satellite is first of its kind in the world as it features dual-frequency radar—Nasa’s L-band (1.25 GHz) and Isro’s S-band (3.20 GHz), which will deliver unparalleled data accuracy. Its critical components were transported from the US to India in Oct 2024, marking a significant logistical feat. However, the mission faced delays due to technical complexities with its 12-metre radar antenna reflector.NISAR's data can help people worldwide better manage natural resources and hazards, as well as provide information for scientists to better understand the effects and pace of climate change. It will also add to the scientists’ understanding of the Earth's hard outer layer, its crust.Observations from NISAR will benefit humanity by helping researchers around the world better understand changes in the Earth’s surface, including its ice sheets, glaciers and sea ice. It will also capture changes in its forest and wetland ecosystems as well as movement and deformation of the Earth’s crust such as earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity, Nasa said.The global and rapid coverage from NISAR will provide unprecedented opportunities for disaster response, producing data to assist in mitigating and assessing damage, with observations before and after disasters in short time frames. Its data will also help scientists understand solid Earth movements and their implications, it said.The satellite’s key capabilities include generating high-resolution images using radio signals, functioning effectively in darkness and adverse weather, detecting surface changes as small as one inch, and penetrating dense vegetation for comprehensive mapping.","NISAR will scan nearly all of Earth’s land and ice surfaces twice every 12 days.

He cited Ambedkar's resignation letter, which criticised then PM Jawaharlal Nehru for ""focusing on Muslim appeasement"" while neglecting the welfare of SCs.""I have been wondering whether there is any other parallel in the world to the condition of Scheduled Castes in India. I cannot find any. And yet, why is no relief granted to Scheduled Castes? Compare the concern the govt shows over safeguarding Muslims. The PM's attention is devoted to the protection of Muslims. I yield to none, not even the PM, in my desire to give Muslims of India the utmost protection. But what I want to know is, are Muslims the only people who need protection?"" Prasad quoted Ambedkar as asking in his resignation letter.Prasad demanded an unconditional apology from Congress for its ""historical ill-treatment of Ambedkar"", branding its recent actions as mere political tactics that the public would see through. He accused Congress of double standards, especially in light of recent events in Parliament where a scuffle resulted in injuries and legal action against Rahul Gandhi, which Congress netas have portrayed as a stand for Ambedkar's honour.Prasad accused Congress of historical bias by not awarding Ambedkar honours like Bharat Ratna or Padma awards while honouring those who opposed him, like Narayan Sadooba Kajrolkar.

Crippling IAF gaps force government to set up panel for new road map,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crippling-iaf-gaps-force-government-to-set-up-panel-for-new-road-map/articleshow/116576095.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the IAF grappling with an acute shortage of fighter aircraft as well as force-multipliers, the govt has constituted a high-level committee under defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh to chalk out a roadmap to plug the major operational gaps in the force.The committee will examine the IAF's overall capability development through several indigenous design and development as well as direct acquisition projects. ""Among the three Services, IAF has the most critical capability voids. The committee will submit its report by the end of Jan,"" a source said.DRDO chief Samir V Kamat, secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar and IAF deputy chief Air Marshal Tejinder Singh, among others, are the members of the committee.The need to fast-track projects has been reinforced by the way the Chinese air force has deployed additional fighters, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones at all its airbases facing India, like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping, after upgrading them with new runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities.With the IAF currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised to tackle the threat from China and Pakistan, one of the major challenges before the committee will be to break the logjam over the long-pending project to manufacture 114 new 4.5-generation fighters, at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore, with foreign collaboration. ""Some jets will be directly acquired, while the bulk will be produced in India,"" a source said.Then, there is also the induction of indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters, which has taken a hit primarily because of the continuing delay in supply of engines by US major General Electric.Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) will be able to deliver only two to three Tejas Mark-1A fighters instead of 16 promised to the IAF in the 2024-25 fiscal, under the Rs 46,898 crore deal for 83 such single-engine jets inked in Feb 2021. The order for another 97 TejasMark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore is also in the pipeline.Meanwhile, GE has promised to begin the deliveries of the contracted 99 GE-F404 turbofan jet engines by March 2025 now, around two years behind schedule.HAL and GE, of course, are now also conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the more powerful GE-F414 aero-engines in India for the planned induction of at least 108 Tejas Mark-II fighters, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion.Induction of force-multipliers is also crucial. IAF, for instance, has just six IL-78 mid-air refuelers, inducted in 2003-04, when it requires at least 18 such aircraft to extend the operational range of its fighter jets.In the ""eyes in the sky"" arena, India is even behind Pakistan, let alone China. IAF has just three indigenous 'Netra' airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, apart from the three Israeli Phalcon AWACS inducted in 2009-11. Consequently, the plan to develop six Mark-1A and six Mark-2 versions of the Netra aircraft also needs to be fast-tracked.","The committee will examine the IAF's overall capability development through several indigenous design and development as well as direct acquisition projects.

"Khalistan Zindabad Force chief hails from J&K, is now in Pakistan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/khalistan-zindabad-force-chief-hails-from-jk-is-now-in-pakistan/articleshow/116609434.cms,"NEW DELHI: Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), to which the three pro-Khalistan terrorists killed in UP are being linked, is a radical Sikh outfit founded in 1993 by Ranjeet Singh @ Neeta, hailing from Simbal camp in Jammu, but currently ensconced in Pakistan. The outfit's aim is to establish a sovereign Khalistan state. It mostly drew its cadre from among radicalised Sikhs based in the Jammu region.According to former J&K DGP S P Vaid, Neeta had developed strong links with Pakistan's ISI during the eighties, when Punjab militancy was at its peak. He would head-hunt members of the sizeable Sikh population in the Jammu region, particularly the Simbal camp and R S Pora, and brainwash them into embracing violent extremism. In the nineties, when Neeta had struck a deal with ISI and taken shelter to Pakistan, KZF's modus operandi was to target buses/trains plying on the roads to Jammu, Punjab or Delhi.In 2009, the group turned to targeted killing of religious leaders in Punjab - Rashtriya Sikh Sangat chief Rulda Singh in July 2009 - and even abroad (Sant Ramanand of Dera Sachkand Ballan in Vienna). Since 2017-18, there have been intelligence inputs about Neeta using KZF cadre to target police facilities in Punjab. The UP encounter shows that the terrorists, after having carried out the recent bomb blasts at police facilities in Punjab, headed for Pilibhit where there is a sizeable Sikh community. ""It's a very positive development. Apart from putting the Khalistanis on the backfoot, the encounter highlights the good coordination between the Punjab and UP police,"" a former top officer of the Punjab Police told TOI.KZF is listed as a terrorist organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. With international presence and associates spread across Pakistan, the UK, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, the US, Canada, Austria, Belgium, Nepal and Malaysia, it is also banned in European Union nations. These associates, as per the Union home ministry, carry out radicalisation of Sikh youths in Khalistan ideology , mostly through social media.Neeta was declared as an individual terrorist under the UAPA in 2020. As per a gazette notification, Neeta has been aiding, abetting, spearheading, operationalising and funding terrorist activities and pushing in consignments of arms, ammunition, explosive materials laced with narcotics from across the border into India to promote terrorism and support their actions against India. An Interpol Red Corner Notice had been pending against Neeta since 2000.Among attacks in India, in which KZF activists have been involved, are bomb explosions in two buses at Pathankot in April and June in 1997, which had killed and injured several passengers. A bomb was exploded by KZF on the Shalimar Express train in June 1998.One of the 20 terrorists that India wants Pakistan to deport, Neeta is alleged to have been involved in the killing of DSP Devinder Sharma in Kathua in J&K in Oct 2001.","Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) is a radical Sikh outfit founded in 1993 by Ranjeet Singh @ Neeta, hailing from Simbal camp in Jammu, but currently ensconced in Pakistan.

"500 years on, Vasco da Gama hailed in Lisbon, ignored in Kochi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/500-years-on-vasco-da-gama-hailed-in-lisbon-ignored-in-kochi/articleshow/116609965.cms,"Post-colonial takes depict Da Gama as glorified pirate



KOCHI: At St Francis Church in Fort Kochi, history seems to have been dead, buried and forgotten. There is just a nondescript blue board at the church that reads, ""Remembering Vasco da Gama , Portuguese navigator; he arrived in Cochin ...where he died and was first buried"".On Tuesday, it will be 500 years since the man who discovered the sea route to India in 1498, and thereby revolutionised global trade and cultural exchange, died during his third voyage to India. As ceremonies to commemorate the 500th anniversary are in full swing at Jeronimos Monastery in Lisbon, where his remains were repatriated from Kochi in 1539, in the actual place of his death amnesia reigns. There are no commemorative events, not even a candle lit as votive offering.The reason for this could be an attritional process of historical revisionism. Once hailed as the man who catalysed the East-West entente (the incredible exchange of goods and ideas) and paved the way for the Estado da India (the Portuguese maritime empire), post-colonial studies are increasingly depicting da Gama as a glorified pirate, a pillager who treated the Malabar coast's natives brutally, and as an unabashed tool of imperialism and religious persecution. Historian Fr Pius Malekandathil, an expert in Indo-Portuguese history, said that when da Gama came for the last time to Kerala, he was ageing and ill. ""At the time of his death, Kochi was still the capital of Portuguese establishments. It was moved to Goa only later,"" he said. Fr Pius added that a commemoration may not have been possible in Kochi because of the existence of communities who have faced great suffering due to the Portuguese. ""Back in 1998, when there was an attempt to celebrate 500 years of the arrival of da Gama in India, there was strong opposition. The question was about whether it was domination or subjugation that was to be celebrated. People may not be able to see the multi-layered reality at times. A similar issue arose when there was a celebration of the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus. Many were there also who asked whether exploitation was being celebrated,"" he said.Even as da Gama's voyage paved the way for colonialism, it also triggered the movement of ideas, commodities, plants, and culture.""When we ask what early modernity is, scholars say that it was cultural, geographical, and societal connectedness. All this began with this pioneering voyage of da Gama,"" said Fr Pius. The channel that was opened up by da Gama eventually led to the arrival of plants from South America, like papaya, pineapple, etc, to Kerala. ""If not for that explorative voyage, the Indian agrarian landscape itself would have been different,"" he said.Most Fort Kochi residents in the church's vicinity, especially the young, know little of who da Gama was, or his significance. Vasco House, believed to be the house where he stayed during his visits to Kochi, right until his death in 1524, is now a homestay. Santhosh Tom, who runs the homestay, says that the building came to his family at the time of his grandfather. ""I didn't hear anyone talking about any memorial. We only know the story, which is that da Gama stayed here, died here, and he was buried at the church which is close to the house,"" said Tom.St Francis Church itself is now under the Church of South India (CSI). Since CSI lacks any Portuguese influence, unlike the Latin Church here, a memorial from the side of the church also became unlikely. Clergy Secretary of the Cochin Diocese of CSI, Rev Praise Thaiparambil, said that for the church da Gama doesn't hold much significance other than the fact that the tomb exists in their church. ""At the time of the Portuguese, it was a Catholic church and the burial happened then. The Dutch then took over the church and it became a Dutch Reformed Church. Later, during the time of the English, it became an Anglican church. When they left, the English churches were handed over to CSI. That is how this church came to us,"" said Thaiparambil, who added that the church's name was not changed by CSI.Fr Pius said that history shouldn't be forgotten and it was the access, openness, connectedness, and arrival of global culture initiated by Vasco da Gama that needs to be celebrated.","On Tuesday, it will be 500 years since the man who discovered the sea route to India in 1498, died during his third voyage to India. Post-colonial studies are increasingly depicting da Gama as a glorified pirate, a pillager who treated the Malabar coast's natives brutally, and as an unabashed tool of imperialism.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116609979,imgsize-1614103,width-400,resizemode-4/116609979.jpg"
"After Kejriwal's Delhi snub, Congress stares at RJD challenge in Bihar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-kejriwals-delhi-snub-congress-stares-at-rjd-challenge-in-bihar/articleshow/116606298.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress, which had mixed electoral fortunes in 2024, braces for a challenging 2025 - with assembly elections scheduled in Delhi and Bihar. While the Congress failed to open its account in Delhi in the last two assembly elections, in Bihar, the grand-old-party won 19 out of 243 seats in 2015 with a vote share of around 10%.From the high of Lok Sabha gains in June, the Congress was pushed to the corner by the end of 2024 after first losing Haryana to the BJP followed by a humiliating defeat in Maharashtra - where the grand-old-party could win only 16 of the nearly 100 seats it contested as part of INDIA alliance.Riding high on its success in Lok Sabha elections in the two states, the Congress spurned Arving Kejriwal's AAP in Haryana and did hard bargaining with its allies Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP(SCP) in Maharashtra. However, after its dismal performance in the two states - the Congress came under severe attack from its allies - with some even questioning its leadership position within the alliance.During the just concluded winter session of Parliament, the Congress found itself isolated by regional allies - like the Samajwadi Party and Trinamool Congress - who refused to toe the line of the grand-old-party on some key issues.The Congress faces an uphill, if not impossible, task in Delhi where AAP supremo Kejriwal has already said no to any tieup for the assembly elections. However, Bihar may offer a glimmer of hope for the grand-old-party provided it can manage to reach seat-sharing deal with Lalu Prasad's RJD and other INDIA bloc partners in the state.The assembly elections in Bihar are almost a year away, but the INDIA partners have already raised the pitch. We all heard Lalu Prasad not just backing West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee as leader of the INDIA bloc but also making light of any objections that Congress would raise over the issue. The message was loud and clear for the Congress. Lalu's remarks had perhaps not much to do with the national politics of the INDIA bloc but was possibly a reaction to the remarks made by some Congress leaders who had started seeking parity in seat sharing for assembly elections in Bihar by citing the party's strike rate in the Lok Sabha elections.The RJD had contested 23 Lok Sabha seats and won four, yielding a strike rate of 17%, while the Congress fought on nine seats and won three, achieving a strike rate of 33%. The CPI (ML), with the highest strike rate, contested three seats and won two, marking 67% success. However, the RJD has been the single largest party in the state in the last two elections winning 80 seats in 2015 and 75 seats in 2020.Congress leader Shanawaz Alam, who is also the Bihar co-incharge, raised the pitch earlier this month by asserting that there was no big brother in Bihar coalition, obliquely referring to the RJD which has been the dominant partner in the state.“We must reinforce the ideological foundation of the coalition, rather than a hierarchy of power. Congress workers should not view themselves as subordinate to other alliance partners. Any decisions within the alliance would incorporate the input of Congress workers,” Alam had said at a meeting of party workers.The AICC secretary also demanded that the distribution of seats in assembly elections should be based on the strike rate—a metric reflecting the performance of parties in recent elections, particularly the Lok Sabha polls.He then fired another salvo at the Bihar ally saying his party would like to have ""two deputy chief ministers, including a Muslim"" if the coalition formed the next government in the state.All these statements irked the RJD, which criticised Congress for ""violating coalition dharma"". The fallout perhaps was Lalu's strong remarks against the Congress.The Congress has suffered in states like Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh by allowing its leaders to take a strong pitch against the allies. While the Congress needs to assert for rightful share from the RJD, it will have to ensure that strong posturing does not result in snapping of ties in the state.Two assembly elections was all it took for the Congress to lose its Lok Sabha advantage not just as the principal challenger to the BJP but also as the leader of the opposition's INDIA bloc. The big question is: Has the grand-old-party learnt from its mistakes?","The Congress failed to open its account in Delhi in the last two assembly elections. In Bihar, the grand-old-party won 19 out of 243 seats in 2015 with a vote share of around 10%. From the high of Lok Sabha gains in June, the Congress was pushed to the corner by the end of 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116606954,imgsize-1784689,width-400,resizemode-4/116606954.jpg"
'I may live 110 years': Dalai Lama amid health concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-may-live-110-years-dalai-lama-amid-health-concerns/articleshow/116606733.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Dalai Lama dismissed concerns about his recent health challenges and the future of Tibetan Buddhism, saying that he dreamt of living for 110 years.In an interview with Reuters from his Himalayan residence in Dharamshala, the 89-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate assured devotees there was no reason for alarm.“According to my dream, I may live 110 years,” he said.The Dalai Lama underwent knee surgery in New York this June, prompting speculation about his well-being. Addressing these concerns, he stated, “The knee too is improving,” while walking gingerly with the aid of assistants.Despite his age and health issues, he continues to bless hundreds of visitors weekly, demonstrating resilience and dedication to his followers.Born in 1935 and identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor at just two years old, the 14th Dalai Lama’s spiritual leadership has been central to the Tibetan cause. Since fleeing to India in 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese rule, he has lived in exile, advocating for Tibetan autonomy through a “Middle Way” approach that emphasizes peaceful negotiation.China insists it will determine the Dalai Lama’s successor, but the spiritual leader has suggested his reincarnation could occur in India, rejecting any Chinese-appointed successor. Tibetan Buddhists believe in the reincarnation of learned monastics, a tradition that continues to hold profound significance.The Zurich-based Gaden Phodrang Foundation, established by the Dalai Lama in 2015, is tasked with overseeing the selection and recognition of his successor.The Dalai Lama’s return to public audiences in September, after a three-month hiatus for recovery, has provided solace to his followers.The Tibetan leader’s influence extends beyond his religious role. He remains a symbol of resistance against Chinese authority in Tibet, a stance that has earned him both admiration and criticism.The Dalai Lama has long been a unifying force for Tibetans, championing substantial autonomy and safeguarding Tibetan culture. However, his absence casts uncertainty over the continuity of these efforts. Penpa Tsering, president of the Tibetan government-in-exile , candidly remarked, ""Post-fourteenth Dalai Lama we don't know what will happen.""As the spiritual leader ages and China takes an assertive stance on his succession, concerns about a leadership vacuum loom large over Tibet’s future.","Dalai Lama says he dreamt of living for 110 years.

Plan to put Hasina on trial

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh on Monday sent India a note verbale (formal diplomatic note), requesting extradition of its ousted PM Sheikh Hasina ""We sent a note verbal (diplomatic message) to the Indian government saying that the Bangladesh government wants her (Hasina) back here for judicial process,"" foreign adviser Touhid Hossain told The Daily Star at the foreign ministry this afternoon.Home affairs adviser Lt Gen (retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury told Dhaka Tribune: ""We have a prisoner exchange agreement with India. It will be carried out under that agreement.""The ministry of external affairs also confirmed receiving a note verbal from Dhaka and refused to offer further comment on the matter.""We confirm that we have received a Note Verbale from the Bangladesh High Commission today in connection with an extradition request. At this time, we have no comment to offer on this matter,"" the ministery of external affairs spokesperson said.Last month, Bangladesh's interim head Muhammad Yunus had announced that the government would seek Hasina's extradition from India. Hasina fled to India on August 5 this year after mass protests against her regime.The Nobel Laureate while addressing the nation on his 100th day in office, said that his administration would prosecute those accountable, including Hasina, for the numerous casualties during the student protests that concluded her 15-year leadership.""We will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,"" Yunus said.""I have already discussed the issue with chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan,"" he added.Muhammad Yunus-led interim government, under the extradition treaty with India, plans to bring Hasina back ""to try her for mass killings during the student-led protests in July and August"".Md Tajul Islam, the newly-appointed chief prosecutor of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), has said that Dhaka will file an application with ICT to issue an arrest warrant against Hasina. The extradition of Hasina, who faces 51 cases, including 42 for murder, is governed by the extradition treaty signed between Bangladesh and India in 2013 and amended in 2016. The treaty states that ""extradition may be refused if the offence for which it is requested is an offence of a political character.""However, it also specifies that certain offences, such as murder, ""shall not be regarded as offences of a political character"" for the purposes of the treaty. One ground for refusal of extradition is if the charges being pressed have not been ""made in good faith, in the interest of justice,"" according to the BSS report.","Bangladesh sent India a note verbale (formal diplomatic note), requesting extradition of its ousted PM Sheikh Hasina.

The bills were adopted by Lok Sabha with 269 votes in favour and 198 against.The lack of support, however, highlighted the govt's challenge as a constitutional amendment requires two-thirds majority in both Houses.Opposition parties, including Congress, DMK and others, have criticised the legislations as an assault on federalism and the democratic ethos of India. They also pointed to logistical challenges, including the need for extensive constitutional amendments and procurement of electronic voting machines on a massive scale.The JPC will have 90 days to scrutinise the legislation, review feedback and propose recommendations. The govt's argument for simultaneous elections centres on reducing the financial and administrative burden of frequent polls, minimising disruptions to governance, and allowing more focus on development rather than perpetual electioneering.","The panel, led by BJP's P P Chaudhary, aims to delve into the implications and benefits of synchronising elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies.

One of them was to stop ‘wasooli' at toll barriers. We were getting complaints about this and we are putting an end to it. We will not tolerate corruption. Govt till take action at any level required,"" the CM said, adding that good governance is a priority.The CM's promise of action comes at a time when Lokayukta's Special Police Establishment (SPE) has uncovered crores in cash, jewellery and property from the house of a retired RTO constable, Saurabh Sharma , in Bhopal.SPE's Bhopal unit has formed a three-member team to probe the alleged disproportionate assets of Sharma and his associates. This decision follows income-tax department's seizure of 54kg gold biscuits, Rs 10 crore in cash and documents revealing transactions worth over Rs 150 crore.Lokayukta is now collaborating closely with I-T department to examine these assets and incorporate them into the ongoing investigation. I-T sources said they have found documents indicating transactions of more than Rs 20 crore per month.The Lokayukta investigation , being conducted under Prevention of Corruption Act, centres around allegations of corruption and illegal accumulation of wealth by Sharma.DG Lokayukta Jaideep Prasad confirmed that investigations are on and Sharma's family members, including his wife, have been summoned for questioning.Sharma was granted compassionate appointment as a constable in the transport department following the death of his father, govt doctor R K Sharma, in 2015. During his service, Sharma was posted at various check posts across the state and allegedly accumulated significant wealth through corrupt means. He opted for voluntary retirement in June 2023Investigators say Sharma used his ‘illicit earnings' to purchase benami properties in the names of his wife, mother, sister-in-law, and close associates, including Chetan Singh Gaur and Sharad Jaiswal. Sharma is also linked to businesses, including hotels and a school in Bhopal.The investigation began after a tip-off, and the Lokayukta team obtained a search warrant for Sharma's properties. On Dec 19-20, 2024, search operations were carried out at two of Sharma's houses in Arera Colony. In one house, investigators found assets worth over Rs 3.8 crore, including foreign and Indian currency valued at Rs 1.1 crore, gold and diamond jewellery worth Rs 50 lakh, and household items and vehicles valued at Rs 2.2 crore. At the second house, used for official purposes, daily-use items and luxury goods worth Rs 30 lakh, 234kg of silver valued at Rs 2.1 crore, and Rs 1.7 crore in cash were discovered. The total inventory from the second property amounted to Rs 4.12 crore.Preliminary investigations suggest Sharma's total movable assets could be worth Rs 7.9 crore. Summons have been issued to Sharma's wife, mother, and close associates, including Sharad Jaiswal and Chetan Singh Gaur.Additionally, income-tax department uncovered further evidence adding another layer to the investigation. The department seized a significant amount of cash and gold from an Innova registered in Gaur's name.Investigators are scrutinizing bank accounts linked to Sharma and his aides. The probe is expanding to include a review of the operations of the hotels and school linked to Sharma and his associates.Some politically influential individuals are said to be under scrutiny. There are allegations that I-T officials did not receive support from local police during the searches. In order to recover the car loaded with gold and cash, they had to rely on SAF jawans deployed for other cases.Speculation is swirling among higher ups about how Lokayukta missed the car during its searches. Even more intriguing is who tipped off the I-T department about the abandoned SUV loaded with cash and gold late at night.","Lokayukta's Special Police Establishment (SPE) has uncovered crores in cash, jewellery and property from the house of a retired RTO constable, Saurabh Sharma.

NEW DELHI: The road transport and highways ministry is planning to take up the construction and maintenance of national highway stretches directly rather than giving the tasks to public works departments (PWDs), a move that may lead to a face-off between the Centre and states.At present, around 63,000-odd km of the 1.45 lakh km NH network is managed by central govt agencies NHAI and NHIDCL, while the remaining 60% is managed by state PWDs on behalf of the ministry.The ministry gets the development and maintenance of around 80,000 km of NHs done by PWDs. It funds such works and pays agency charges to PWDs. Most of these NHs are two-lane roads or two-lane with paved shoulders.TOI has learnt that the fresh move is aimed at speeding up construction and better maintenance. They added that the plan is to bring NH networks with PWDs of only a few states directly under the ministry. “This will be done only in the case of states where the pace of construction and award is very slow. This will not be applicable for all states,” a source said.For this, it plans to set up project units for different stretches that would be taken up for widening. States such as Karnataka and Punjab may be the first few to be brought under this scheme of things.But sources said this may face backlash as states play a key role in land acquisition and forest clearances, the two most important pre-conditions for a project to take off and its completion. “If states don’t provide enough support, we won't be able to execute wider highway and expressway projects, as these require fresh land acquisition. Only time will tell how the move will play out and how states would take it,” an official said.At present, the maximum construction and award of highway stretch come from roads managed by state PWDs.","At present, around 63,000-odd km of the 1.45 lakh km NH network is managed by central govt agencies NHAI and NHIDCL.

He also underlined that divisive forces are still active in the country,Delivering the '37th Intelligence Bureau Centenary Endowment Lecture', Shah said a country where social unity does not exist cannot progress in any meaningful way.Responsibility for addressing these challenges and preparing the entire police force to tackle them now lies with the country's information warriors, he said.He said that by identifying and eliminating threats promptly, the intelligence ecosystem helps maintain trust and stability within society.He said if challenges such as Naxalism, terrorism, organised crime, divisive forces, communalism, narcotics, and antisocial elements are to be fully controlled, ensuring the security of society is of paramount importance.Shah said there was a need for a robust ecosystem to counter misinformation, and in order to reduce the spread of propaganda to zero, there is a need for a strategy, technology, and readiness in place.The home minister said for the Intelligence Bureau (IB) to realise the vision of a developed India, it must prepare itself to become a cutting-edge agency.He also claimed that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India will become the world's third-largest economy by 2027.Shah said that as we progress, competition intensifies, threats increase, and obstructive forces emerge. He said that building a robust infrastructure to counter these threats, from headquarters to police stations and constables is the responsibility of young officers.In order to achieve a fully developed India by 2047, we must visualise all potential threats and prepare a comprehensive roadmap to safeguard the nation from them, he said.Shah said that inclusive development, along with peace and stability in the country, is only possible if we reshape our work under this expanded definition, prepare anew, and remain vigilant.Over the past 10 years under the Modi government, significant successes have been achieved in combating terrorism, Naxalism, insurgency, narcotics, and anarchic elements, he said.He said that under the current government, a major focus has also been placed on improving coordination between states and agencies and they have been strengthened with the backing of the law and amendment to several legislations.Shah said the Modi government introduced three new criminal laws starting from July 1 after discussing with all the stakeholders in many meetings over the last five years.He said he was involved throughout in the drafting of the laws.Once they are fully implemented, India's criminal justice system will become the most modern in the world, justice will be delivered within three years of the filing of any FIR, right up to the Supreme Court, the minister claimed.","Amit Shah said a country where social unity does not exist cannot progress in any meaningful way.

The ongoing protest was luanched on February 13 by two forums including SKM (non political) led by Jagit Singh Dallewal and Kisan majdoor morcha led by Sarwan Singh Pandher and this is the first time that SKM gave a open call to protest at district level in the nation to support their counterparts.Farmers gathered at Ambedkar Chowk and take out a procession till the Mini Secretariat despite inclement weather in Jind. The protest was aimed at demanding the protection of farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal’s life, who is on hunger strike unto death since November 26, repression against farmers heading towards Delhi, immediate release of all farmers from Luksar Jail in Noida and Greater Noida, withdrawal of the national agricultural market policy , and an immediate dialogue with farmer organizations and others. The protestors submitted a memorandum to Mohammad Imran Raza, deputy commissioner of Jind district quoting president Draupadi Murmu. Prior to the submission of the memorandum, the farmers burned copies of the National Agricultural Market Policy.The protest was led by Master Balbir Singh, State President of the Kisan Sabha, Jogender Nain, State President of BKU Ghasi Ram, Baru Ram from BKU Tikait and Azad Palwa, Haryana SKM member.Addressing the farmers, the leaders stated that the NDA-3 government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not following democratic principles and is intentionally avoiding discussions with farmer organizations and platforms, which has led to widespread resentment among farmers against the central government. The NDA-2 government shamelessly violated the agreement signed with the Samyukt Kisan Morcha on December 9, 2021, which had assured the repeal of the three farm laws, in the wake of the historic farmer struggle at the borders of Delhi. Following the formation of the NDA-3 government after the 18th Lok Sabha elections, SKM had submitted memorandums to the Prime Minister, opposition leaders, and members of both houses of Parliament on July 16 and18, 2024. On August 9, 2024, farmers staged nationwide protests against corporate control over agriculture.The farmer leaders also highlighted that 109 farmers from Noida and Greater Noida have been falsely implicated in cases and have been in jail for the past 21 days.

The US government supported India's request to extradite Tahawwur Rana, a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai attacks . The government called upon the top US court to reject ""the petition for a writ of certiorari"" submitted by Rana.Rana, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, recently petitioned the Supreme Court to block his extradition. The US Solicitor General, Elizabeth B. Prelogar , filed a response on December 16 urging the court to deny the petition.Rana had previously appealed his extradition in lower courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, but was unsuccessful. ""The (India US Extradition) Treaty permits Rana's extradition,"" the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had ruled in August.He then filed a ""petition for a writ of certiorari"" with the Supreme Court on November 13. This petition represents Rana’s final legal attempt to avoid extradition.A writ of certiorari is a request to a higher court to review a lower court's ruling. The term ""certiorari"" comes from Law Latin, meaning ""to be more fully informed.""Rana's ""petition for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"" contends that he was previously tried and cleared in the federal court of Northern District of Illinois (Chicago) regarding the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. His petition states, ""India now seeks to extradite him for trial on charges based on the identical conduct at issue in the Chicago case.""However, Prelogar argued that Rana is not exempt from extradition. She contends that the Indian charges against Rana are not fully identical to the charges he faced in a US federal court in Chicago. ""The government does not concede that all of the conduct on which India seeks extradition was covered by the government's prosecution in this case. For example, India's forgery charges are based in part on conduct that was not charged in the United States: petitioner's use of false information in an application to formally open a branch office of the Immigration Law Centre submitted to the Reserve Bank of India,"" she said as quoted by news agency PTI.She further explained that the prior US case against Rana, which resulted in an acquittal on some charges, does not cover all the conduct India intends to prosecute. ""It is not clear that the jury's verdict in this case - which involves conspiracy charges and was somewhat difficult to parse - means that he has been 'convicted or acquitted' on all of the specific conduct that India has charged.""","Tahawwur Rana is a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

20 greatest Brock Lesnar moments: WWE Top 10 Special Edition, March 17, 2022

WWE's Ruthless Aggression is widely regarded as the most beloved period in the company’s history, known for its hardcore wrestling style, unfiltered verbal exchanges, unforgettable rivalries, and a roster filled with talent. While the era featured numerous superstars, two names stand out as its true dominators: Brock Lesnar and The Rock. These icons delivered legendary clashes, memorable segments, and electrifying, over-the-top wrestling styles that have left a lasting impact on WWE fans.Beyond the ring, both superstars have built massive global fan bases over the years, with their names alone generating immense hype for WWE's premium events. However, amidst all the admiration for their matches and rivalries, one question frequently arises within the wrestling community: Who is the richest superstar? This article dives into the details to settle the debate and reveal the wealthier icon between The Rock and Brock Lesnar.Let’s dive into Brock Lesnar’s net worth. As of 2024, ""The Beast"" is estimated to have a net worth of approximately $20 million. Reports from Sportskeeda and Celebrity Net Worth highlight that Brock Lesnar is among the wealthiest wrestlers in WWE. According to Paycheck, Lesnar earns about $12 million annually from WWE, making him the highest-paid wrestler on the roster. Additionally, he ranks as one of the highest-paid heavyweights in UFC history. Over the years, Lesnar has endorsed several brands during his WWE and UFC careers. Currently, he is associated with notable names like Dymatize Nutrition and Death Clutch.Let’s dive into the net worth of The Rock, also known as The Final Boss. As reported by Celebrity Net Worth and Sportskeeda, his estimated net worth in 2024 is a staggering $800 million. While his WWE career contributed significantly, it’s his Hollywood journey that has propelled him to financial heights. One of the world’s highest-paid actors, The Rock earns nearly $100 million annually from his film projects. Additionally, he rakes in seven-figure royalties through his clothing and shoe lines, as well as a lucrative headphones deal with Under Armour. Notably, he earned an upfront salary of $22.5 million for his role in Red Notice.Beyond wrestling and acting, Dwayne Johnson is also a thriving entrepreneur. He owns Seven Bucks Productions, the studio behind his film Black Adam. Furthermore, he co-owns the American football league XFL, which he acquired from former WWE Chairman Vince McMahon. Adding to his ventures, The Rock launched an energy drink brand called Zoa Energy.When comparing Brock Lesnar's 2024 net worth of $20 million to The Rock's staggering $800 million, it's clear that The Rock takes the crown as the richest WWE Superstar of the year. However, while The Rock dominates in wealth, Brock Lesnar reigns supreme in the ring. Known as ""The Beast Incarnate,"" Lesnar has a reputation for crushing his opponents with unmatched ferocity. In terms of wrestling style, Lesnar's dominance far surpasses The Rock's, making him a more formidable force inside the squared circle.Also read: Roman Reigns vs. John Cena: Whose Net Worth Reigns Supreme?","WWE's Ruthless Aggression is widely regarded as the most beloved period in the company's history.

federation approaches ministry

Manu applies for Padma Bhushan, Padma Shri

Father lambasts ministry, committee

RICH HAUL OF MEDALS IGNORED

OTHER OLYMPIC MEDALLISTS ALSO NOT IN KHEL RATNA LIST

NEW DELHI: Double Olympic medallist shooter Manu Bhaker ’s name missing from the recommendation list of the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award has created a furore. Caught on the back-foot, the sports ministry is now considering nominating her name for the country’s highest sporting honour by using its executive powers vested in the provisions of the National Sports Day awards scheme, TOI has learnt.Manu created history at the Paris Games 2024 after clinching back-to-back medals (bronze) in the women’s individual 10m air pistol and in the mixed team event partnering Sarabjot Singh, cementing her place as one of the greatest Indian athletes in Olympic sports. The 22-year-old from Haryana’s Jhajjar district became the first Indian to achieve such a feat at a single Olympic edition since India attained independence.Her omission from the list of athletes recommended for the Khel Ratna – as highlighted by TOI in its exclusive report on Monday – thus came as a huge surprise. The 12-member selection committee failed to take cognizance of her incredible achievements during the awards cycle period, where she won several medals at major multisport and international events.The committee recommended ace drag-flicker Harmanpreet Singh, who captained the Indian men’s hockey team to a bronze medal-finish in Paris, and para-athlete Praveen Kumar, who won gold in the men’s high jump T64 class with an Asian record at the Paris Paralympics, for the Khel Ratna.The authorities forgot that in the past, Olympic medallists were awarded the Khel Ratna upon their return to the country right after their successful campaign at the Summer Games. In 2021, all the medallists from the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games – who had not yet been awarded the Khel Ratna – were awarded with the honour by the govt. Strangely, the same gesture or rule wasn’t applied in the case of a deserving athlete as Manu.While the officials in the ministry claimed that the shooter didn’t apply for the award, Manu’s father Ram Bhaker maintained that she had indeed sent in her application. The point is, even if Manu had not applied for the award, why did the selection panel fail to take cognizance of her stupendous achievements as a shooter over the years?It’s been learnt that the ministry might invoke Articles 5.1 and 5.2 of the ‘Scheme for the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award’ which state: “Sportspersons eligible in accordance with award guidelines will be permitted to self-apply without the recommendation of the authorities/persons. Notwithstanding the above, the government reserves the right to nominate up to two nominations in deserving cases.”According to sources, sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya is expected to go through the names of Khel Ratna, Arjuna, Dronacharya and Dhyanchand nominees and give his approval to the list on Wednesday. Sources said the minister, who has been travelling, has already been informed about the controversy surrounding Manu’s exclusion from the list.While the scheme provides that applicants should self-apply on the ministry’s portal for awards, the respective national sports federation (NSF) of athletes can also send the names of deserving sportspersons to the ministry online by filling up the details. The National Rifle Association of India ( NRAI ) did not nominate Manu for the Khel Ratna when ideally it should have.A source in the federation told TOI that it has now approached the ministry with a request to include Manu’s name.“Manu said she had applied on the portal. If that was the case, then the committee must have considered her name. Whatever the situation, the federation has approached the ministry and requested the officials to include her name,” the source said.Whether Manu’s name will feature in the final list of Khel Ratna awardees is yet to be seen, but it can be confirmed that she has also applied for the country’s third and fourth highest civilian awards – Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, respectively. Manu’s twin applications for these awards are in possession of TOI. She applied on the Padma awards’ portal on Sep 15.Manu’s father on Monday lambasted the ministry and selection committee for ignoring his child’s achievements. “I regret putting her in the sport of shooting. I should have instead made her a cricketer. Then, all the awards and accolades would have come her way. She won two Olympic medals in a single edition, no one has ever done that. What else do you expect my child to do for the country? The govt must recognise her efforts. I spoke to Manu, and she was disheartened by all this. She told me ‘I shouldn’t have gone to the Olympics and won medals for the country. In fact, I shouldn’t have become a sportsperson’,” Bhaker told TOI.The govt’s note of October 24, 2024 inviting applications for Khel Ratna says: “To be eligible for Khel Ratna award, the spectacular and most outstanding performance in the field of sports by a sportsperson over a period of four years immediately preceding the year during which award is to be given will be considered for award for excellence in sports and games at international level i.e. Olympic/Paralympics/Asian/Commonwealth Games/Championships/World Cup/World Championships and equivalent recognised international tournaments. Accordingly, sports achievements for the period from January 1, 2020, up to the conclusion of the Olympics/Paralympics Games 2024 will be taken into consideration.”During this four-year awards cycle, Manu won several international medals of repute, the twin Olympic bronze medals in Paris topping the chart. During the period, Manu won 17 gold, six silver and five bronze medals spread across different editions of shooting World Championships, World Cups, Asian Games, Asian Championships, Junior World Championships, Junior World Cup and World University Games.Except for Harmanpreet Singh, not a single Paris Olympic medallist was recommended for the Khel Ratna by the committee. Even the bronze-winning shooting duo of Swapnil Kusale and Sarabjot Singh and wrestler Aman Sehrawat were not considered for the award and were instead recommended for Arjuna – the second highest sporting honour.In 2021, all the medallists (gold, silver & bronze) from Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics – who weren’t honoured with the Khel Ratna previously – were given the award by the ministry.",Double Olympic medallist shooter Manu Bhaker’s name missing from the recommendation list of the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award has created a furore. The sports ministry is now considering nominating her name for the country's highest sporting honour.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
