"For 20 years, Thar getting more rain than normal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-20-years-thar-getting-more-rain-than-normal/articleshow/114199152.cms,"‘With warming climate, Rajasthan to get more rains’

NEW DELHI: West Rajasthan , land of Thar desert and the driest region in India's plains , was among two subdivisions out of 36 that received excess rainfall during this monsoon. Surprisingly, this was hardly an unusual monsoon for west Rajasthan, which has been getting higher-than-normal rainfall for at least the past two decades in an indication of shifting monsoon patterns in a warming world.As per IMD data analysed by TOI, west Rajasthan has got above-normal or excess monsoons for six years in a row. In last 20 years, June-Sept rain there has been excess/above normal in 12 years, normal in five and deficient in three. On average, monsoon has been 19% above normal during 2005-2024. Just how exceptional this kind of rain is in region can be gauged through a comparison with two contiguous subdivisions, Punjab and Haryana, during this period.Just how exceptional this kind of rainfall is in the region can be gauged through a comparison with two contiguous subdivisions, Punjab and Haryana, during this period. Punjab registered just one above-normal year, 12 normal years and seven years when monsoon was deficient, that is, 20% or more below normal. On average, the June-Sept rainfall was 13.5% below normal in the state during 2005-2024.Haryana’s monsoon pattern resembles that of Punjab. Since 2005, it has seen three above-normal years, eight years of normal rainfall and as many years of deficient rains. In addition, monsoon was ‘large deficient’ (or scanty) in one year. On average, monsoon has been 13.3% below normal in these 20 years.Even in India as a whole, monsoon during this period has on average been 1.5% less than normal.However, it must be noted that, being the driest subdivision (SD) in the country, the ‘normal’ rainfall figure for west Rajasthan is significantly lower than that of the other two SDs — 283.6mm at present as compared with 439.8-mm in Punjab and 430.7mm in Haryana.Yet, the divergence is significant and in several recent years west Rajasthan has received higher rainfall even in absolute terms than either Punjab or Haryana.“Rainfall over Rajasthan and Punjab-Haryana is decided by the position of the monsoon trough and the westward movement of low-pressure systems in the rainy season. During recent years, we have seen that the monsoon trough was positioned south of its normal position with more westward movement of low-pressure systems. In such situations, Rajasthan gets more rain and Punjab-Haryana less,” explained M Rajeevan, veteran meteorologist and former secretary of the Union earth sciences ministry.Rajeevan said the region could be drawing rain-bearing clouds towards itself due to changes in soil moisture, land use patterns and, possibly, the addition of water bodies in recent decades, such as the Indira canal.“Local soil moisture feedback over Rajasthan also helps to tie-up the monsoon trough in that position and attract more low-pressure systems over that region. There is growing evidence of increasing soil moisture in Rajasthan and its interaction with monsoon,” he said.Finally, more rain over the Thar desert in recent years may just be a sign of things to come in an era of climate change. Said Rajeevan, “Future climate projections suggest Rajasthan and its desert will get more rain in a warming climate.”","West Rajasthan has got above-normal or excess monsoons for six years in a row.

Caste-based labour & limited food: Dalits recount jail horror,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/caste-based-labour-limited-food-dalits-recount-jail-horror/articleshow/114199002.cms,"Apex court verdict signals a long-awaited dawn of justice, says UP DGP

MEERUT/DEHRADUN: Daulat Kunwar has been imprisoned several times. Once behind bars, it was the same story each time for the Dalit activist. “Caste discrimination starts the moment an inmate steps into a prison, it is real and it has been going on for many years,” Kunwar told TOI in shocking revelations that were echoed by other prisoners, including undertrials, who spent time in the jails of UP and Uttarakhand.Now, though, Dalits in India’s jails see hope of better treatment following Supreme Court ’s landmark order on Oct 3 striking down a series of “colonial-era” rules mentioned in prison manuals across the country which “reinforced caste-based division of labour, particularly targeting marginalised communities”.Kunwar said, “Officials first enquire about a prisoner’s caste and note it down along with other personal details. The information about one’s caste will then be circulated in the entire jail and based on that an inmate will be assigned ‘work’. Dalits are mostly tasked with cleaning and sweeping. If anyone refuses, he is beaten up by other inmates on the directions of the jail administration.” It was worse for Hapur resident Inder Pal, 43. “I was jailed for 67 days. It felt like 67 years to me. I saw how inmates were forced to do low-grade labour they had never done in their lives. All of us were criminals. But some were considered superior. For two weeks, I was made to sweep. When I fell ill and couldn’t work, I was told to clean toilets. Without a brush. I was asked to use a cloth or my bare hands.”The inequality went beyond work. Monu Kashyap, 23, who spent seven days in a UP jail for possessing an illegal weapon, said, “Food was limited for prisoners belonging to the so-called lower castes, while others ate freely. Complaints were met with threats or beatings.” Ram Bahadur Singh, 38, also lodged in a UP jail, added that Dalit inmates were often told to form a separate queue for food.It is like feeding us with the leftovers... like animals,” he said.The recent apex court ruling has sparked optimism within police ranks, too. UP DGP Prashant Kumar, who hailed the decision, told TOI: “It’s a bold stride towards restoring the dignity of labour within Indian prisons. The verdict signals a long-awaited dawn of justice. For centuries, caste and occupation were wrongly fused, reducing entire communities to lives of subjugation and indignity.”UP’s top cop added, “With this ruling, anchored in Article 21, the court calls for an end to the chains of caste-driven labour in prisons, urging reforms that nurture equality.”Several social activists praised the ruling. Satish Prakash, a Dalit activist and associate professor at Meerut College, said changing jail manuals is only the beginning. “The real issue is the mindset. In a caste-ridden society, dominance persists both inside and outside the jail. Social engineering is must,” Prakash said. Kishore Kumar, an advocate and NCR-based Dalit activist, added, “For jail wardens, the term ‘Dalit’ is inseparable from what they call ‘hereditary trades’, such as manual scavenging, sweeping and cleaning...”However, some prison authorities TOI spoke to said “prejudice” wasn’t allowed in their jails. Dadhiram Maurya, DIG (prisons) in Uttarakhand, said, “There is no caste-based job assignment in our jails. It was stopped as per our new jail manual last Nov.”Additional district judge Shehzad Ali, secretary of the District Legal Services Authority, Bulandshahr, meanwhile, said the SC ruling will strengthen the hands of lawyers and activists to ensure compliance. “We’ve visited jails regularly to address complaints. Now, we’ll ensure strict compliance and take immediate action against violations,” Ali added.","Dalits in India’s jails see hope of better treatment following Supreme Court ’s landmark order on Oct 3 striking down a series of “colonial-era’ rules. “Caste discrimination starts the moment an inmate steps into a prison, it is real and it has been going on for many years,” says Dalit activist Daulat Kunwar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114199026,imgsize-219592,width-400,resizemode-4/114199026.jpg"

Ratan Tata's legacy





I dedicate my last years to health: Ratan Tata in Assam

NEW DELHI: Ratan Tata , chairman emeritus of one of India's biggest conglomerates Tata Group , died at 86 after prolonged illness. He was admitted to the hospital due to his age and related medical conditions.In a statement, Tata's family said, ""We his brothers, sisters, and family take solace and comfort in the outpouring of love and respect from all who admired him. While he is no longer with us in person, his legacy of humility, generosity and purpose will continue to inspire future generations.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi mourned Ratan Tata and called him a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being.""Shri Ratan Tata Ji was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being. He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond the boardroom. He endeared himself to several people thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.""One of the most unique aspects of Shri Ratan Tata Ji was his passion towards dreaming big and giving back. He was at the forefront of championing causes like education, healthcare, sanitation, animal welfare to name a few,"" he added.Ratan Tata, who is also known for his charitable work, served as the chairman of the Tata Group from 1991 to 2012. During his tenure, he made significant contributions to the conglomerate founded by his great-grandfather over a century ago.In 1996, Tata established Tata Teleservices, the telecommunications arm of the group, and in 2004, he led the initial public offering of Tata Consultancy Services, the group's IT company.After stepping down as chairman in 2012, Tata retained the honorary title of chairman emeritus for several Tata companies, including Tata Sons , Tata Industries, Tata Motors , Tata Steel, and Tata Chemicals.Tata was awarded two of India's highest civilian honors: the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.One of India's most successful business tycoons, he is also renowned for his philanthropic endeavors. His personal involvement in philanthropy began in the 1970s with the initiation of The Aga Khan Hospital and Medical College project, which laid the foundation for one of India's premier healthcare institutions.After becoming the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, Tata's philanthropic efforts gained new momentum. He actively guided the Tata Trusts, established by his great-grandfather Jamsetji, towards addressing crucial social needs and established institutes of excellence such as the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, while also funding educational initiatives across India.Despite his reputation for class and elegance, Tata was not immune to controversies. Although the Tata Group was not directly implicated in the 2008 scam involving the allocation of second-generation telecom licences, Tata was drawn into the controversy through leaked recordings of purported phone calls he made to lobbyist Nira Radia. However, he was not implicated in any wrongdoing.In December 2012, Tata handed over control of Tata Sons to Cyrus Mistry, his deputy at the time. However, the owners had issues with the functioning of the first non-Tata family member, leading to Mistry's ouster in October 2016. Ratan Tata was said to be one of the shareholders who disagreed with Mistry on several projects, including Mistry's decision to discontinue the loss-making small car Nano, which was a pet project of Ratan Tata.Since 2017, Tata has been the emeritus chairman of Tata Sons. During this time, he has taken on a new role, supporting young entrepreneurs of the 21st century by investing in new age tech-driven start-ups that will play a significant role in shaping the future of the country. In his personal capacity and through his investment company RNT Capital Advisors, Tata has invested in over 30 start-ups, including Ola Electric, Paytm, Snapdeal, Lenskart, and Zivame.One wet monsoon evening not many moons ago, dog-lover Tata had decreed that any strays outside the conglomerate's HQ in downtown Mumbai be allowed shelter. Some never left but their benefactor is no more.","Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Group, dies at 86 after prolonged illness.

Navy setting up base to control submarines on long-range patrols,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/navy-sets-up-base-to-control-submarines-on-long-range-patrols/articleshow/114196990.cms,"Also read:

NEW DELHI: With India recently commissioning its second nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat as part of the plan to expand both the strategic as well as conventional underwater combat fleets, the Navy is now setting up a new advanced facility to seamlessly communicate with its stealthy predators out on long-range patrols.The project for the very low frequency (VLF) transmitting station at Vikarabad in Telangana is slated for inauguration by defence minister Rajnath Singh on October 15.“The strategically-important VLF facility, once it becomes fully operational in two-three years, will provide round-the-clock encrypted communication connectivity to submerged submarines across India’s entire area of interest,” a source told TOI.“VLF radio waves, which operate in a frequency band of 3 to 30 Kilohertz, can penetrate seawater to a certain depth for such purposes,” he added. Only a few nations have such VLF capabilities, which are especially critical for “command and control” of nuclear submarines deployed on long-range deterrent patrols.The Navy has been running a VLF station at Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu since 1990. The new state-of-the-art VLF facility at Vikarabad is necessary for “maintaining 24x7x365 communication” for the planned induction of both diesel-electric as well as nuclear submarines, with an eye firmly on China’s increasing naval forays into the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).On Aug 29, India had inducted its second 6,000-tonne SSBN (nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles) INS Arighaat, which is also capable of carrying some 3,500-km range K-4 missiles. Her forerunner INS Arihant is armed only with the 750-km range K-15 missiles.India plans to induct the third SSBN, with a displacement of 7,000-tonne, as INS Aridhaman early next year, while a fourth is also under construction under the secretive advanced technology vessel (ATV) project. There is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors, as reported by TOI earlier.Moreover, the PM-led cabinet committee on security on Oct 9 also cleared the long-pending Rs 40,000 crore ' Project-77 ' to construct two nuclear-powered attack submarines (called SSNs in naval parlance). It will take 10-12 years to build these SSNs, with 190 MW reactors and displacement of 9,800-tonne, meant for conventional (non-nuclear) warfare.On the diesel-electric front, the Navy will commission the sixth French-origin Scorpene submarine 'Vagsheer' in Dec under the over Rs 23,000 crore ' Project-75 ' underway at Mazagon Docks (MDL). While the Navy has six old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW submarines, India is now finalising with France the construction of another three Scorpenes at MDL for over Rs 30,000 crore.Then, Germany and Spain are in contention for the long-pending over Rs 42,000 crore`Project-75-India’ to build six advanced diesel-electric submarines, with AIP (air-independent propulsion) for greater underwater endurance and land-attack cruise missiles.","The project for the very low frequency (VLF) transmitting station at Vikarabad in Telangana is slated for inauguration by defence minister Rajnath Singh on October 15.

NEW DELHI: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is expected to land in Pakistan on Tuesday evening for the SCO heads of government meeting, well in time for a welcome dinner that will be hosted by Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif for the delegates.While both sides have ruled out any formal bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the SCO event, the minister as of now is expected to participate in the dinner and exchange pleasantries with host Shehbaz and counterpart Ishaq Dar, before the main summit on Wednesday.Even though it won’t be a fleeting visit as was previously thought, Jaishankar will likely spend not more than 24 hours in Pakistan before flying back to India.The minister will be in Pakistan on October 15-16 for what will be the first visit by any Indian foreign minister to the country in nearly a decade. However, a day after India confirmed his visit to Pakistan, Jaishankar said he wasn’t going to Islamabad to discuss India’s ties with Pakistan but to be a ``good member’’ of the SCO, which counts India and Pakistan apart from Russia, China, Iran and 4 Central Asian countries as member-states.India hasn’t allowed its differences with Pakistan on the issue of cross-border terrorism , or even the border tensions with China, to come in the way of its participation in the Eurasian bloc that is seen as playing an important role in ensuring regional security. Russia’s presence in the group has also been a motivating factor for India.While a structured bilateral meeting is ruled out, a quick pull aside, possibly behind the scenes, on the margins could still take place but India will expect Islamabad to propose any such meeting. India has continued to maintain that the onus for any forward movement in the relationship, which has not seen any substantive engagement between the 2 countries for the past 9 years, is on Pakistan. For any rapprochement, India sees as essential verifiable and irreversible action by Pakistan against terrorism, and also a review of its decision to downgrade ties after the Indian government revoked the special status of J&K.Pakistan, however, has remained focused on the issue of Kashmir with Dar saying Sunday Islamabad under Shehbaz hasn’t lost an opportunity to raise it along with the plight of the Palestinians in Gaza.Chinese Premier Li Qiang will also be present at the event but there’s no confirmation yet of any bilateral meeting between him and Jaishankar.In his SCO address, Jaishankar is expected to underscore India’s concerns about terrorism, the need to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity while undertaking connectivity and infrastructure initiatives and also to take up concerns of the Global South. The SCO Charter doesn’t allow any member-state to raise bilateral issues and it’s unlikely he will name Pakistan. The minister will represent PM Narendra Modi who had been invited by Shehbaz to participate in the meeting. However, Modi only participates in the heads of state summit and normally deputes the foreign minister to stand in for him at the heads of government meetings.",India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is expected to land in Pakistan on Tuesday evening for the SCO heads of government meeting.

Concern grows as Uttarakhand's 'skeleton lake' is shrinking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/concern-grows-as-uttarakhands-skeleton-lake-is-shrinking/articleshow/114196899.cms,"DEHRADUN: Climate change is believed to be impacting one of Uttarakhand 's foremost trekking destinations, Roopkund Lake , situated 16,500ft above sea level at the base of Mt Trishul in the Garhwal Himalayas . Known as the ""lake of skeletons"", the glacial body conceals hundreds of human skeletons - some with preserved flesh - which become visible when the snow melts in the area.The lake caught the world's imagination after a forest official, HK Madhwal, stumbled upon the presence of human bones in its frozen waters in 1942.Since then, many theories have been propounded on the skeletons' origin. A 2019 study by scientists from India, the US and Germany debunked the popular theory that the skeletons were of a single group that died in one catastrophic event. Instead, it claimed the individuals were genetically diverse, and their deaths separated by as much as 1,000 years.What is now worrying forest officials, who have been deployed in that area for over two decades, is that the lake - spread over an area of around two acres and has a depth of around 9ft - is shrinking.Divisional forest officer (DFO) of Badrinath forest division in Chamoli, Sarvesh Dubey, said, ""The lake is shrinking in width and depth by about 0.1% to 0.5% annually. Traditionally, the area around Roopkund would experience snow flurries during rainfall, but now rain is more common, causing loose moraine to slide down into the lake. We believe this shift in precipitation pattern is directly linked to climate change and global warming, which is altering the natural balance of the region.""He added: ""We are reaching out to experts at Forest Research Institute and Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) for solutions as this year saw excess rainfall and consequently, more silting.""Glaciologists also attributed the shift in precipitation patterns to climate change and global warming.Senior glaciologist at WIHG, Dehradun, Manish Mehta, said, ""According to the glacier inventory made by WIHG in 2013, we have around 1,200 lakes in the region. These are classified either as pro-glacial lakes, because they are located at the snout (front edge) of a glacier, or peri-glacial lakes, as they lie on the periphery (sides) of the glacier. Roopkund is a peri-glacial lake, and due to climate variations, the Himalayas are experiencing both decrease and increase in snow precipitation. In this case, it seems that reduced precipitation has led to the flow of unconsolidated loose moraine material into the lake, resulting in a reduction in both the lake's volume and its area.""Scientists believe that this phenomenon could lead to the greening of areas at high altitudes and also increased heat in the region.","Roopkund Lake is situated 16,500ft above sea level at the base of Mt Trishul in the Garhwal Himalayas.

We fight only when someone insults or tries to harm our integrity and sovereignty; when war is waged against religion, truth and human values,” Singh said, performing shastra pooja (worship of weapons) on Dussehra at Sukna military station in West Bengal.“This is what we have inherited. We will continue to preserve this heritage. However, if our interests are threatened, we will not hesitate to take a big step.

Star Health , the largest health insurer in the country, was hit with a data breach that exposed sensitive customer information, including medical records and tax details. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the company has now revealed that the hacker responsible for the leak demanded a $68,000 (nearly 57.21 lakhs) ransom in August. The company noted that ""the threat actor demanded a ransom of $68,000 in an email"" addressed to its managing director and chief executive.The breach, which was first reported in September, has led to a reputational and business crisis for the company. Star Health’s shares have since declined by 11%. The company launched internal investigations and has also taken legal action against the messaging app Telegram and the hacker. The report claims that the hacker’s website continues to share samples of Star customers' data.This statement comes after stock exchanges asked Star Health for clarification over another Reuters report which claimed that the company was investigating allegations about its chief security officer being involved in the data leak.Later on, the company announced that it had found no wrongdoing by the official, Amarjeet Khanuja. However, the internal investigation stays open.The hacker exploited Telegram chatbots and a dedicated website to disseminate the stolen data and continues to share samples of customer information. In response to the breach, Star Health launched internal investigations and initiated legal action against Telegram and the hacker. The company is also collaborating with Indian cyber security authorities to address the situation.Despite receiving multiple notices from the insurance company, Telegram has refused to share information about the hacker's accounts or permanently ban them from the platform, Star Health said. The company also identified the hacker as ""xenZen"" in their latest statement.However, earlier, the Dubai-based messenger app said that it removed the chatbots as soon as it was flagged to the platform.","Star Health, India's largest health insurer, was hit with a data breach that exposed sensitive customer information, including medical records and tax details.

"Passion missing, players don’t want to work hard, lament former intl’s",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/passion-missing-players-dont-want-to-work-hard-lament-former-intls/articleshow/114196310.cms,"Former international players from Goa like Padma Shri awardee Brahmanand Shankhwalkar, Beevan D’Mello, Keenan Almeida and Denzil Franco discussed ‘player perspectives’ at the GFDC Football Summit 2024

Panaji:

Former India defender Denzil Franco recalled not being paid his salary for more than a year, yet he never stopped training. He performed like there’s was a bonus on offer and even made it to the national team.“My goal was to reach the highest level, money was never on my mind,” Denzil said during the GFDC Football Summit in Margao last week.“I was never a technically sound player. I had dedication and passion for the game. My hard work helped me achieve what I wanted.”Denzil did achieve quite a lot. He played for the biggest clubs – Salgaocar, Sporting Clube, Churchill Bros, Mahindra –won all the big trophies and picked up international trophies like Nehru Cup and SAFF Championship.When he retired, without any regret, Denzil realised that coaching wasn’t his cup of tea, so he invested his energy in starting a football school and took charge of his village team. Here, the difference in approach struck him.“I would like to see more passion (from the modern generation). They just come, play, take the thousand rupees and go home. We tried to bring in professionalism in the third division, provided a new approach with even gym sessions, but nothing worked. Once the third division was over, players didn’t stay in touch (with the game).”The lack of hunger in Goan footballers and the unwillingness to work hard was a common lament during the panel discussion on player perspectives at the Summit. Former India midfielder Lector Mascarenhas – who was the moderator – recalled how Brahmanand Shankhwalkar, now a Padma Shri awardee, trained on his own, even in the room.“I was Brahmanand’s roommate and often saw him throwing a rubber ball on the wall and catching it. The drill helped him improve reflexes and become a better goalkeeper,” said Lector, former general secretary of the Goa Football Association .Even Beevan D’Mello didn’t hold back.“Hard work is always the key if you want to have a successful career. Besides, discipline can take you to a very high level. Football has changed. The level of hard work has also changed. (In the past), 80% were willing to work hard, the remaining 20% counted on their talent. Now, if I am honest, it’s exactly the opposite. Very few players want to really work hard,” said Beevan, a former international who made a name for himself scoring eye-catching goals.In all fairness, along with the work ethic, salaries have plummeted as well. With Salgaocar FC, Dempo and Sporting Clube all pulling out of the I-League in 2016 in protest against the AIFF decision to make ISL the top-tier league, players get paid very little.“Few who have worked hard have directly jumped from Goa to (cash-rich) ISL. We have to educate the youngsters. The next two-three years is a good opportunity for the youngsters,” said Beevan.Also part of the panel was Keenan Almeida, former international and now coach at newly-launched Goa Professional League (GPL) club Clube de Salgaocar . He “disagreed to some extent” with Beevan that players were not putting in enough hard work.“The passion is still there, I see it every morning on the ground (during training),” felt Keenan. “Out of 20 players, 15 are hungry and passionate. Maybe five are casual. Are we talking of the five, or focusing on the 15? There’s a proper pathway (now). Four five years ago, we had just two clubs from Goa at the top level. The opportunities were less. When the opportunities are less, maybe the motivation drops.“Players should use the Goa Professional League as a platform to move higher. Look at it as an investment into yourself, showcase yourself, move up. Then money will follow you there.”There’s a silver lining at national and state level. While Dempo are back in the I-League and Sporting are pushing hard to make it to the top again, the emergence of Geno SC and Clube de Salgaocar – both corporate teams who took direct entry into the GPL – has provided hope, and better opportunities for the players. Now it’s all in their hands.","Denzil Franco, Beevan D’Mello, Keenan Almeida and Brahmanand Shankhwalkar discussed ‘player perspectives’ at the GFDC Football Summit 2024 in Margao last week.

"How tomato, potato, onion influence food inflation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-tomato-potato-onion-influence-food-inflation/articleshow/114196431.cms,"Why are tomato, onion and

potato prices

high?

How has production of these crops risen?

Possible policy interventions to tame price volatility in TOPs...

High food inflation has been a challenge for policymakers. Food has a high share of 45.9% in the consumer price index and supply shocks influence the overall retail inflation numbers. The focus in recent months has been on the surge in tomato, onion and potato (TOP) prices. TOP accounts for 4.8% in the retail food and beverages group and 2.2% in the overall CPI but fluctuation in their prices influences overall retail inflation.A recent RBI working paper has tried to examine the price dynamics in these commodities and offers some solutions to tame the high volatility.Short seasonal crop cycles, storage problems due to their perishable nature, regional concentration of production and supply chain issues and extreme weather have a bearing on the price situation. Rising demand and growing preference for these vegetables in specific areas have added to the price surge. Extreme weather conditions such as heat waves and floods add to the supply chain issues.A patchy supply chain for these vegetables is also a crucial factor in how prices fluctuate. For example, studies have shown that during lean season, consumers are confronted with high prices and short supply and during a bumper season, farmers are forced to dump their produce, resort to distress sales as prices fall below the production costs. Fluctuating demand-supply scenarios also have a bearing on prices.Production has grown rapidly and in 2022-23, tomato, onion and potato production was estimated at 20.4 million metric tonnes (MMT), 30.2 MMT and 60.1 MMT, according to the paper. India now is the second largest producer of tomato and potato in the world. It has also overtaken China as the largest producer of onion in the world and in 2022 contributed 28.6% of global production, the paper said, citing FAO data.The RBI paper has suggested several measures such as agriculture marketing reforms, storage solutions, processing and raising productivity of tomato, onion and potato.Under marketing reforms, the paper has suggested increasing private mandis to increase transparency for these perishable commodities and these entities will provide a wider choice to farmers to sell their crops. Competition is also expected to improve the state of Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC).It has suggested re-launching potato futures, which were traded in the country's commodity exchange but were banned in 2014. Authorities should also consider launching future trading in onions for better price discovery and managing risks. Storage should be expanded across the country as cold storages for potato are largely in UP while those for onions are mostly in Maharashtra.","Food has a high share of 45.9% in the consumer price index and supply shocks influence the overall retail inflation numbers.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Jet fighters can reach astonishing speeds and perform complex movements, making them a symbol of military power and technological prowess. These aircrafts are designed for precision and dominance in the skies, and some of the fastest jets ever built show remarkable feats of human engineering.From the iconic warplanes like the F-22 Raptor and to NASA’s cutting-edge experimental aircraft X-43, and even the famous F-14 Tomcat, which starred in the Tom Cruise movie Top Gun, these jets depict unbelievable speeds ranging from Mach 2.25 to an unbelievable Mach 9.6, making them a pinnacle of aviation technology.Each aircraft has left a lasting mark on history. Explore the list of ten of the fastest jets ever created in the world according to a BBC report.The F-22 Raptor is a single-seat stealth fighter with formidable capabilities, including a top speed of Mach 2.25 and exceptional long-range cruising ability. Loaded with advanced weaponry, it stands out as a powerful force in modern air combat. However, its cutting-edge stealth technology is so sensitive that the U.S. government prohibits its sale to other countries.Despite its speed and stealth, the F-22 has been outpaced in versatility by the slower F-35 Lightning II. Production of the F-22 was capped at just 187 aircraft, making it a rare sight in modern air fleets.Designed by the USSR to compete with the F-15 Eagle during the Cold War, the MiG-29 Fulcrum is a lightweight fighter with a top speed of Mach 2.3 and a range of 1,500 km on a single tank of fuel. It can also be refuelled mid-air, making it a combat favourite for many air forces.Renowned for its agility, the MiG-29 has seen extensive action over the years and can take off and land on rough runways. With continuous upgrades, it remains in service with numerous countries worldwide.The F-14 Tomcat is perhaps most famous for its starring role in the 1986 movie Top Gun. This two-seater fighter was launched from aircraft carriers, delivering some of the most iconic take-off and landing sequences in aviation history. Powered by two jet engines, it boasts a top speed of Mach 2.34.In service for over 30 years, the F-14 became one of the best-known jets in the world, recognized for its agility and versatile combat capabilities.The MiG-23 Flogger is easily recognizable due to its variable-sweep wing design, which contributes to its exceptional agility in dogfights. Capable of reaching speeds of Mach 2.35, this Soviet-era jet was a popular choice for many air forces, with over 5,000 units built over 18 years.Despite being nearly 60 years old, the MiG-23 is still in service in some nations due to its sturdy construction and high performance.Although the Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker misses out on the top five, it is renowned for more than just speed, with a top speed of Mach 2.35. This versatile fighter jet features excellent manoeuvrability and a strong operational range, making it a highly valuable aircraft for a variety of missions.The Su-27's rapid ascent ability is legendary, reaching an altitude of 12 km in less than a minute. It remains in production today, over 40 years after its debut.The F-15 Eagle has been in service for nearly 50 years, yet it remains one of the fastest jets, with a top speed of Mach 2.5. Its combination of low weight and high wing area enables it to execute tight turns without losing speed, making it perfect for dogfights. The F-15 has earned its place as a staple at airshows and in combat missions around the world.The MiG-31 Foxhound is one of the oldest jets still in operation, designed as an improvement over the MiG-25 for stability at lower altitudes. Although not as agile as other jets, it compensates with formidable firepower, including long-range missiles, and can reach a top speed of Mach 2.83.Its continued service underscores the success of its design, though its radar detectability limits its stealth capabilities.First introduced nearly 60 years ago, the MiG-25 Foxbat remains one of the fastest fighter jets in existence, with a top speed of Mach 2.83. It was designed during the Cold War as a high-speed interceptor, and its capabilities have ensured its ongoing use in some countries, even though its design is now considered outdated. Over 1,200 MiG-25s were produced, marking it as one of the most successful jet fighters of all time.The SR-71 Blackbird, known for its incredible speed and stealth, was capable of outrunning missiles. When it entered service in 1966, it was a marvel of technology, with a top speed of Mach 3.3. Primarily used for reconnaissance missions during the Cold War, the SR-71 still holds the record for the highest sustained flight altitude at nearly 26 km.NASA was the last operator of the Blackbird, retiring it in 1999. Its rumoured successor, the SR-72, is expected to debut in 2025.NASA's X-43, an experimental scramjet that achieved an unprecedented speed of Mach 9.6, or 11,854 km/h. The X-43 was launched from a Boeing B-52 and only flew for 10 seconds before gliding for 10 minutes and intentionally crashing into the ocean.Despite its short flights, the X-43 remains the fastest jet ever built, showcasing the future of high-speed aircraft design.","The F-22 Raptor is a single-seat stealth fighter with formidable capabilities, including a top speed of Mach 2.25 and exceptional long-range cruising ability.

Over 100 children die in Pakistan from diphtheria amid shortage of life-saving Antitoxin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/over-100-children-die-in-pakistan-from-diphtheria-amid-shortage-of-life-saving-antitoxin/articleshow/114185488.cms,"Pakistan: Over 100 children die due to Diphtheria in Karachi amid lack of facilities

More than 100 children have died in Karachi , Pakistan , this year due to diphtheria, a preventable disease, largely because of the unavailability of Diphtheria Anti-Toxin (DAT), according to a report by Geo News. Despite the availability of vaccines, the shortage of the crucial antitoxin has led to these tragic deaths.Sindh health officials confirmed that 140 cases of diphtheria were recorded last year at the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital, with 52 fatalities.Experts say that the lifesaving antitoxin needed to treat the disease is unavailable across Sindh, including Karachi, with treatment costs estimated at 250,000 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) per child.Diphtheria, caused by a bacterium that affects the respiratory tract and skin, produces a toxin that can damage the heart and nerves, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease is vaccine-preventable, but requires multiple doses and boosters to maintain immunity. Those who are unvaccinated or under-immunized are at the highest risk.Health experts in Pakistan have raised concerns about the lack of vaccine coverage and the dire need for intervention. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Director of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI), Muhammad Arif Khan, stressed the importance of timely vaccination to prevent diphtheria outbreaks, emphasizing that the disease can cause severe complications, including difficulty breathing and swallowing.WHO data shows that symptoms of diphtheria, such as sore throat, fever, and swollen neck glands, typically appear 2-5 days after exposure. Without proper treatment, the disease can be fatal in 30% of cases, with young children especially at risk.Global immunization rates have been disrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic, further exacerbating the issue. In Pakistan, immunization coverage remains uneven, with some areas like Balochistan reporting rates as low as 38%, well below global standards. The World Bank notes that Pakistan’s immunization coverage ranks among the lowest compared to similarly wealthy countries in Eastern and Southern Asia.Efforts to improve vaccination rates and provide adequate medical resources remain critical to preventing more deaths from this preventable disease.","Sindh health officials confirmed that 140 cases of diphtheria were recorded last year at the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital, with 52 fatalities.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been cautioned by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) to take prompt actions against corruption and political harassments related to corruption cases in the country, ARY News reported on Saturday.On September 25, the executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) authorised Pakistan's 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreement, which is valued at around $7 billion.As per ARY News, the 37-month EFF agreement was made with a focus on key policies like sustainable public finances , lower inflation , and improved external buffers with an aim to support Pakistan's economic growth and stability.According to specifics, the financial fund has highlighted the importance of having a strong investigative system to combat corruption. It has also recommended that the National Accountability Bureau ( NAB ) be strengthened in order to better align with the ruling of the top court and has requested the creation of an action plan aimed at curing corruption by June 2025.Additionally, the international financial body has emphasised how crucial it is that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) be digitalised in order for all public declarations of assets made by government officials, including parliamentarians, ARY News reported.The fund has pointed out corruption is undermining Pakistan's efforts to bring reforms, whereas NAB is not being provided with accurate data for investigations against corruption.The fund has shown how corruption undermines Pakistan's attempts to implement reforms, and the NAB is not receiving reliable data for its anti-corruption investigations, as per ARY News.""The government must ensure that NAB is provided with accurate data to investigate corruption cases effectively,"" the IMF stated.On Friday, the IMF revealed Pakistan's new borrowing requirements and reported that it had urged the Pakistani government to take required steps to stabilise the macroeconomic environment in accordance with the terms of the loan arrangements.The government of Pakistan has been requested to provide economic reforms and favourable circumstances for the private sector to catalyse the economy. Along with increasing its revenue base and cutting government spending, the foreign lender has also pushed Pakistan to accelerate reforms in government-owned businesses, ARY News stated.According to the report, Pakistan's GDP is expected to stay between 4 and 4.5 per cent from FY2024-2025 to FY2029-2030, while inflation is expected to stay between 6.6 and 9 percent, ARY News reported.The IMF has emphasised how important it is to put the economic reform ideas into action.Following the approval of a 37-month Extended Fund Facility totalling $7 billion by the IMF Executive Board, Pakistan received the first tranche of the IMF on September 27.As per ARY News, on Friday, the State Bank of Pakistan ( SBP ) said that it has received the first tranche of SDR 760 million, or $1026.9 million, from the IMF.",Pakistan has been cautioned by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to take prompt actions against corruption and political harassments.

Macao's former top judge elected as Chinese casino hub's first leader born in mainland China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/macaos-former-top-judge-elected-as-chinese-casino-hubs-first-leader-born-in-mainland-china/articleshow/114181238.cms,"Macao’s former top judge, Sam Hou Fai (AP Image)

MACAO : Macao’s former top judge, Sam Hou Fai , was chosen as the Chinese casino hub ’s next leader in a largely ceremonial election on Sunday, setting him up to become the city’s first chief executive born in mainland China.Almost the entire election committee stacked with Beijing loyalists — 394 of 398 — voted for Sam, the sole candidate, in a departure from the long-standing custom of having chief executives who were born in the former Portuguese colony, typically from influential business families.The remaining four were blank votes.The shift in the city’s leadership to someone from the legal profession is likely to create expectations of a declining influence from business circles, which critics have often accused of colluding with officials, analysts say. They anticipate Beijing’s policy agenda for the city will take priority.Sam, 62, is widely seen to have Beijing’s blessings. During the nomination period, he had already secured endorsements from 386 election committee members who voted in batches in a conference hall on Sunday.Influential figures among the 400-strong committee were Shun Tak Holdings’ group executive chairperson Pansy Ho, daughter of late casino tycoon Stanley Ho, lawmaker Angela Leong, one of Ho's widows, and former chief executives Edmund Ho and Fernando Chui.Sam is expected to meet reporters later Sunday.Most of the territory’s 687,000 residents lack voting rights, leading to mixed sentiments about the election. Some hope Sam will heed public opinion and avoid prioritizing business interests, while others feel disconnected from an election process they can’t participate in.Still, political observers said many residents are comfortable with Sam’s non-local origin in a city that has been home to migrants for decades.With Sam’s victory guaranteed, the real challenges await in the governance hurdles that lie ahead.Macao is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Beijing has called for the city to diversify its gambling-reliant economy.Sam has promised to accelerate the current government’s plan to boost tourism and other sectors such as traditional Chinese medicine, finance, exhibitions and commerce. However, the city will still need to rely on the gambling industry for government revenues to support the city's welfare and accomplish other goals laid out by Beijing, analysts say.China wants Macao to develop into a world-class tourism and leisure center and play a bigger role as a bridge for trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.Small local businesses have been hurt by residents who spend money in the neighboring mainland city of Zhuhai, which offers a wider selection of items with good value for money. Chinese tourists are also now spending less than before.It remains to be seen whether Sam, with a lack of government leadership experience, can form a capable cabinet to tackle these pressing issues.Sam was born in neighboring Guangdong province in 1962. He graduated from the prestigious law school of Peking University in Beijing. He also studied the Portuguese language, culture and law at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, and once practiced law in mainland China.When Macao returned to Chinese rule in 1999, Sam was appointed the city’s top judge, a role in which he served for nearly 25 years before resigning in August to participate in the election.He handled some politically sensitive cases, including rejecting an appeal of a police ban on a vigil commemorating China’s bloody 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. His court also upheld a decision to bar pro-democracy figures from running in the 2021 legislative elections.",Sam Hou Fai was chosen as the Chinese casino hub ’s next leader in a largely ceremonial election on Sunday.

Importantly, Thursday was the seventh day of Durga puja when the goddess is worshipped as Kalratri, one of the forms of Kali.The theft coincided with the recitation of Islamic songs by a group, including two clerics, at a Durga puja pandal in Chattogram. The songs included one proclaiming the universal victory of the Islamic revolution.The theft has heightened fears gripping Hindus after the regime change in Aug, putting a question mark on chief advisor Mohammad Yunus's promise to provide security to the minority community and safeguard their rights.Anger among Hindus ran high in Chattogram after a group of six, including Shahidul Karim, who teaches at Tanzimul Ummah Madrasa, and Mohammad Nurul Islam, a teacher of Darul Irfan Academy, recited Islamic songs after misleading the organisers. The group was allowed on the dais after they told the organisers that they intended to sing nationalist songs.The two clerics have been detained. The six are members of Chattogram Cultural Academy, a pro-Jamaat-e-Islami body, according to sources. Jamaat, however, denied any links with those detained.Chattogram deputy commissioner Farida Khanom visited the puja venue Thursday and assured that the administration would nab the absconding accused within 48 hours.The puja committee expelled two of its senior functionaries for not being vigilant enough. The anger was shared by others. ""Why would an Islamic group sing in a puja celebration? Who gave them this right?

An 18-year-old Nepali mountaineer Nima Rinji Sherpa set a new world record by becoming the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres.As per the news agency ANI, his historic feat was completed on Wednesday when he successfully scaled Tibet's 8,027-metre-high Shisha Pangma , marking the culmination of his two-year mission to conquer the most daunting mountains on the planet.Summiting all 14 ""eight-thousanders"" is considered the ultimate achievement in mountaineering, requiring climbers to cross into ""death zones,"" where oxygen levels are too low to support human life for long periods. Nima’s success at such a young age has been hailed as a remarkable testament to his strength and determination.Looking back at his journey, Nima posted about the achievement on his Instagram page. He said, ""This summit is not just the culmination of my personal journey, but a tribute to every Sherpa who has ever dared to dream beyond the traditional boundaries set for us. Mountaineering is more than labour; it is a testament to our strength, resilience, and passion.""Wanting this feat to be an inspiration for the younger generation, he further said, ""Through #SherpaPower, I want to show the younger generation of Sherpas that they can rise above the stereotype of being only support climbers and embrace their potential as top-tier athletes, adventurers, and creators.

His ascent of Shisha Pangma on October 9, 2024, completed his record-breaking achievement.The record for the youngest person to summit all 14 peaks was previously held by Mingma Gyabu 'David' Sherpa, who achieved the feat at the age of 30 in 2019. Nima Rinji, however, accomplished the same feat at just 18 years and five months, completing his journey in two years and ten days, according to Seven Summit Treks, the expedition organiser.Nepali climbers, particularly Sherpas, have long been considered the backbone of the climbing industry in the Himalayas, often carrying equipment and setting up routes for foreign climbers. However, in recent years, Sherpas have gained recognition in their own right, taking centre stage in some of the most challenging climbs.","Nima Rinji Sherpa is the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres. His historic feat was completed on Wednesday when he successfully scaled Tibet's 8,027-metre-high Shisha Pangma. Nima’s success at such a young age has been hailed as a remarkable testament to his strength.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114082342,imgsize-559266,width-400,resizemode-4/114082342.jpg"

These demands come in the wake of comments made by Barbados prime minister Mia Mottley , who has been a vocal advocate for reparations, calling for them to be part of a ""global reset.""Speaking at the United Nations, Mottley highlighted the importance of addressing the legacies of slavery and colonialism in shaping modern global relations.Reparations estimates range from $261 billion to as much as $24 trillion.UN Judge Patrick Robinson has emphasised the moral responsibility of governments to offer reparations for historical injustices, further strengthening calls for financial compensation.Earlier this month, Mottley met with King Charles in London to discuss the issue ahead of the Commonwealth meeting. While Buckingham Palace has not disclosed the details of their discussion, Mottley praised the king's openness, stating that he acknowledged the importance of addressing Britain’s role in the slave trade, calling it “a conversation whose time has come.”King Charles has reportedly taken his family's historical connections to slavery very seriously. This follows the discovery of a ledger by historian Dr Brooke Newman, which revealed that King William III received shares in the Royal African Company, a business heavily involved in the slave trade. The 1689 document shows a transfer of $1,300 in shares from Edward Colston, the company’s governor, to William of Orange.Buckingham Palace has expressed deep regret over Britain’s historical role in slavery. A spokesperson for the palace told RadarOnline, “I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many, as I continue to deepen my own understanding of slavery's enduring impact.” The palace has partnered with Historic Royal Palaces in an independent research project exploring the British monarchy's ties to the transatlantic slave trade during the 17th and 18th centuries, with access to the royal collection and archives supporting this initiative.UK foreign secretary David Lammy, whose ancestry is linked to the legacy of slavery, has also reflected on how his ancestors endured “the twisted lies of imperialism,” recalling how they were stolen from their homes, shackled, and turned into slaves.",King Charles III and prime minister Keir Starmer are set to face demands for reparations totalling an astonishing $261 billion for the United Kingdom's historical involvement in the transatlantic slave trade.

A bizarre incident took place in the United Kingdom where a grocery shopper was taken to hospital after she was reportedly knocked unconscious after a cauliflower fell on her head.Sammi Mai, 42, a resident of Kingston-upon-Thames said that a discounted cauliflower fell from a height of four to six feet, striking her on the back of her head. The impact caused her to fall and lose consciousness.Mai, who spoke to GB News about the incident, stated, ""Suddenly a really large and heavy item fell down on the top of my head, and hit my head.I fell and when I woke up, I was suffering [from a] concussion and was knocked out.""The shopper, who also shared her story with the Sun, revealed that she continues to experience various symptoms, including neck pain and anxiety, which have negatively affected her health and ability to work.Expressing her concerns about the store's handling of the situation, Mai said, ""I was very unwell, and I'm still suffering and unable to work. I don't know how the cauliflower fell but they should not store heavy, roundish items like that on the top shelf.""She also noted that the staff simply returned the cauliflower to the top shelf, suggesting that they did not take the incident seriously. As a result, Mai is considering taking legal action against the grocery chain.Expressing her dissatisfaction with the supermarket's handling of the situation, Mai stated, ""she was disappointed by the supermarket's response."" Furthermore, she mentioned that she had not utilised the gift card provided by the establishment.In response to the incident, a Waitrose spokesperson told Fox News Digital, ""Our customer was seen immediately by a trained first-aider at the time of the accident, and we are sorry to hear she is unwell. We take customer safety incredibly seriously and have thoroughly investigated this case – but will consider any new information she wishes to share with us.""Dr Marc Siegel, a Fox News medical contributor, explained that while a significant brain injury is unlikely to result from a soft object like a cauliflower falling from a height of four feet, it is not impossible. He also noted that neck pain and nausea are common symptoms following a blow to the head, even if a concussion is unlikely given the circumstances.Dr Siegel advised anyone experiencing symptoms such as headache, visual changes, dizziness, nausea, or confusion after a blow to the head to seek medical attention, as these could indicate a possible concussion. In such cases, a CT or MRI may be required, and the individual should decrease their activity while experiencing these symptoms.","Sammi Mai, 42, a resident of Kingston-upon-Thames said that a discounted cauliflower fell from a height of four to six feet, striking her on the back of her head.

Demis Hassabis , Britain’s recent Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry, has a remarkable background that bridges the worlds of video games and artificial intelligence . Unlike most teenagers, who typically spend their time playing video games, Hassabis spent his formative years developing them. His big break came in 1994 when he co-designed the hit game Theme Park , a simulation where players manage amusement parks.Born in London to a Greek Cypriot father and a Singaporean mother, Hassabis excelled academically. He earned a double first in computer science from Cambridge University, later launching his own video game company. His intellectual curiosity led him to pursue a PhD in cognitive neuroscience , which became a stepping stone to co-founding the AI startup DeepMind . This venture was eventually acquired by Google for £400 million in 2014.Now 48 years old, Hassabis holds the position of Chief Executive at Google DeepMind, the company’s advanced AI unit. He was knighted in 2023 for his services to artificial intelligence, and his work has culminated in the Nobel Prize, which he shares with colleague John Jumper and US academic David Baker. Their award stems from groundbreaking work in using AI to predict and design the structure of proteins, a significant achievement in both the scientific and AI communities.Hassabis has long emphasised the connection between gaming and artificial intelligence, describing games as an entryway to the world of AI. His early passion for chess, coupled with a fascination for chess computers, sparked ideas about how machines learn, which would later influence his pioneering work in AI. His startup, DeepMind, achieved global recognition by building AI systems that outperformed humans in complex games like Go, chess, and Starcraft II.Beyond gaming and research, Hassabis’s expertise is highly valued by governments and thought leaders. In 2020, he was called upon to provide advice to the UK government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies during the Covid-19 pandemic. His reputation as a forward-thinking AI expert led figures like Dominic Cummings and Tony Blair to seek his counsel on national and global matters.As a leader in Google’s AI research, Hassabis is at the forefront of the global AI race, with major US tech companies such as Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft competing for breakthroughs. While deeply involved in advancing AI technologies, Hassabis is acutely aware of the risks. In recent years, he has voiced concern over the potential dangers of AI, likening its risks to those of pandemics and nuclear war. In 2023, he signed a statement urging global leaders to treat the threat of uncontrolled AI systems as seriously as they treat other existential challenges, such as climate change.However, Hassabis remains optimistic about AI’s potential for good. The Nobel Prize itself is a testament to this, particularly his work with AlphaFold, an AI system that accurately predicts protein structures . This development has far-reaching implications for medical research and drug development, showcasing the profound ways in which AI can benefit society.Despite his caution regarding AI's dangers, Hassabis continues to champion its capacity to address complex global problems. His leadership in both AI innovation and ethical considerations ensures that he will remain a key figure in the future of technology.","Demis Hassabis is the CEO of Google's AI division, DeepMind.

The Port of Hamburg , which in 2023 witnessed imports of 65.6 million tons and exports of 48.6 million tons with total seaborn cargo handling of 114.3 million tons, has plans for navigating towards zero emission in years to come.The port is working to reduce its emissions including through onshore power supply (OPS) and has set goals to meet climate-neutral logistics, claims the Hamburg Port Authority , which manages affairs at the port.Situated between the River Elbe and two of its tributaries, Alster and Bille, Hamburg Port is Germany’ largest seaport and Europe's third largest container port, behind the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Port of Antwerp-Bruges in Belgium. It is Europe's largest rail port. The emissions spread from the 22% area of the port out of 7200 hectares which is used for industrial purposes and has steel, cement industry, refinery and coal fired thermal plant. It handled container cargo of 7.7 million TEU (twenty-foot equivalent container) in the year 2023.The OPS system provides CO2-neutral electricity to cruise ships and container vessels at berth. In 2023, the OPS system saved 640 tons of CO2, which is equivalent to the emissions of around 270,000 liters of petrol. The port is working to use green fuels to become climate neutral. “Hamburg Port Authority (HPA) monitors its emissions annually and publishes the data in its sustainability report”, Hamburg Port CEO Axel Mattern tells TOI. He says “some carbon emissions are reported from the port, but it is on the way towards net zero in times to come and there are no complaints from the residents of Hamburg of any impact of emission from port operations. As per 2040 port development plans there are goals of added value and quality, sustainability and climate protection with climate protection, circular economy and environment”. The port is also producing wind energy.“The port of Hamburg is the lifeline of the industrial activity in the city state which plays an important role in Germany’ economy. Apart from being the hub of industrial activity, the port attracts tourists in large numbers, who evince keen interest to visit and take a ferry trip”, says Matthias Beer, Hamburg Marketing project manager media relations, economy and innovations.Manal Engrany from digital media and communication at Hamburg Marketing, says the port of Hamburg due to its multifarious business activity and innovations attracts lot of media attention from across Europe.","Hamburg Port is Germany's largest seaport and Europe's third largest container port.

Britons on Thursday were startled by unsettling news when the popular BBC Weather app erroneously predicted winds 150 times more powerful than Hurricane Milton , which was attributed to a data glitch. As television news channels aired footage of Milton pummeling Florida in the United States, the extraordinary wind speeds displayed on the BBC Weather app led many individuals to seek clarification on social media platforms.One X user, posting under the username Larky McRory, shared a screenshot of the app displaying wind speeds of 18,995 mph, accompanied by the comment: ""Go home BBC weather app, you're drunk.It's about 37mph.""Hurricane Milton, classified as a Category 3 hurricane in Florida, had maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 kph).BBC Weather attempted to alleviate public concerns by clarifying that the weather conditions were more likely to resemble a typical autumn day with cold air and gusty showers, rather than hurricane-force winds. BBC Scotland Weather posted on X, saying, ""Don't worry folks, there isn't a hurricane on the way today for Scotland, and Edinburgh isn't going to see wind gusts of an impossible magnitude of 17246mph! There is a major error in the data being ingested into the app.""The app displayed a banner announcement acknowledging the issues with the forecast data and assuring users that they were working to resolve the problem. BBC Weather also acknowledged that some temperatures were being displayed incorrectly and apologized for the inconvenience.The glitch evoked memories among some social media users of the incident in 1987 when Michael Fish, Britain's leading weather presenter at the time, assured viewers that reports of an approaching hurricane were inaccurate, mere hours before hurricane-force winds struck the nation.","BBC Weather app erroneously predicted winds 150 times more powerful than Hurricane Milton.

(AP)

BEIJING : China said Saturday it would issue special bonds to help its sputtering economy, signalling a spending spree to bolster banks, shore up the property market and ease local government debt as part of one of its biggest support packages in years.The plan is part of a series of actions undertaken by Beijing to draw a line under a years-long property sector crisis and chronically low consumption that has plagued the world's second biggest economy.Beijing's planned special bonds are aimed at boosting the capital available to banks -- part of a push to get them lending in the hopes of firing up sluggish consumer spending .China is also preparing to allow local governments to borrow more to fund the acquisition of unused land for development, aimed at pulling the property market out of a prolonged slump.No figures were provided on the planned special bonds announced at a highly anticipated press conference by Finance Minister Lan Fo'an and other officials, following a series of steps launched in recent weeks that have included interest rate cuts and liquidity for banks.But Lan said China still has room ""to issue debts and increase the deficit"" to fund the new measures.Officials have been battling to reverse China's slowdown and achieve a growth target of five percent this year -- enviable for many Western countries but a far cry from the double-digit expansion that for years boosted the Asian giant.On Saturday, Lan said Beijing was ""accelerating the use of additional treasury bonds, and ultra-long-term special treasury bonds are also being issued for use"".""In the next three months, a total of 2.3 trillion yuan of special bond funds can be arranged for use in various places,"" he added.On top of that, Beijing also plans to ""issue special government bonds to support large state-owned commercial banks,"" Lan said, although he did not say how much.Chinese authorities have been urging commercial banks to lend more and lower mortgage rates -- measures that would put more cash into the pockets of consumers.Beijing's bonds would therefore offer banks help to shore up their capital, giving them greater leeway to lend more.- Bonds for buildings -Local governments will be issued special bonds enabling them to acquire unused and idle land for development, Vice Finance Minister Liao Min said.The move would ""help ease liquidity and debt pressures on local governments and real estate companies,"" he explained.Beijing will also encourage the acquisition of existing commercial properties to be used as affordable housing.However, analysts expressed frustration that Beijing had refrained from putting a number on further fiscal stimulus.Beijing was likely ""still working on the minute details of the fiscal stimulus,"" Heron Lim at Moody's Analytics told AFP.""In the meantime, investors might be taking a step back until they are absolutely certain of the direction fiscal policy is taking.""On the streets of Beijing on Saturday though, those who spoke to AFP were largely optimistic.""Everyone has been paying close attention to this meeting, especially since the stock market has recently been experiencing a downward trend,"" said Quan Sheng, a 41-year-old who works in IT.""I believe this is definitely positive news... This provides confidence for investors, who believe that the stock market can gradually strengthen,"" he added.- 'Lack of forward guidance' -China's economic uncertainty is fuelling a vicious cycle that has kept consumption stubbornly low.On Saturday, ""notably absent was any mention of large-scale handouts to consumers"", said Capital Economics' Julian Evans-Pritchard.""The lack of forward guidance on the scale of next year's budget deficit means it is still difficult to judge how large and long-lasting the fiscal boost will be,"" he added.In recent weeks, Chinese policymakers have unveiled a string of stimulus measures including a suite of rate cuts and a loosening of rules on buying homes, but economists have warned more action is needed to pull the economy out of its slump for good.Earlier on Saturday, China's top banks said they would cut lower interest rates on existing mortgages from October 25, following a government call for the action.""Except for second mortgages in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and some other regions, the interest rates on other eligible mortgages will be adjusted"" to no less than 30 basis points below the prime lending rate, the central bank's benchmark rate for mortgages, state broadcaster CCTV said.CCTV reported that major banks had announced that they would make the adjustments ""in batches"".The People's Bank of China last month requested that commercial banks lower such rates by October 31.","China to issue special bonds to bolster banks, shore up property market and ease local government debt.

In a shocking incident, a young boy in China had to undergo a finger amputation after his father took him to a foot massage parlour for treatment of a fungal infection in his nail. The four-year-old, surnamed Lin, was brought to the Luozhendong Foot Massage Parlour in Chongqing, China, in July of the previous year, as reported by China Consumer News on September 26.The massage parlour claimed to possess a "" nail removing cream "" that could effectively treat the boy's condition.They applied the cream to Lin's infected fingernail and wrapped it with an elastic bandage, charging 600 yuan (US$86) for the treatment.However, two days later, the father discovered that his son's finger had atrophied and turned black. He immediately took him to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed gangrene and determined that the boy's left index fingertip needed to be amputated to prevent further infections. Lin was subsequently classified as having a 10th-class handicap.The father sought compensation of more than 200,000 yuan (US$29,000) from the massage parlour, which they refused, deeming the amount excessive.In February, the father reported the incident to the local district consumer council, which found that the ""nail removing cream"" was not properly licensed and only possessed sterilisation properties, lacking the ability to cure any ailments. The council also discovered that the shop's name differed from the one on their business license. The shop was held liable for the boy's handicap, and the council urged them to suspend their business and provide the boy's family with 160,000 yuan (US$23,000) in compensation. The local government advised consumers to seek hospital treatment for health conditions.Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) believes that the foot is the foundation of the body, leading many to consider foot baths and massages as effective remedies for fatigue and minor illnesses. However, some foot massage shops have faced penalties for advertising TCM treatments without proper licensing.In May, Jiancha Daily Newspaper reported that a court in Zhejiang province prosecuted 16 individuals who fraudulently obtained three million yuan (US$428,000) from more than 10 customers at their foot massage shop in 2022. They sold the victims a massage cream, claiming it contained a secret TCM recipe capable of curing various illnesses.On social media, some users criticised Lin's father for his irresponsible behaviour, with one person commenting on Douyin, ""What an irresponsible father, taking his son to a foot massage shop instead of a hospital to treat his disease.""","A four-year-old boy in Chongqing, China, had to have his finger amputated.
