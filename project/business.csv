'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport issued an advisory on Saturday amid heavy smog and low visibility conditions across the capital.The airport assured the flight operations to be normal as 'Low Visibility Procedures' were in progress, and urged the passengers to stay updated with their respective flight schedules.""Low Visibility Procedures are in progress at Delhi Airport. All flight operations are presently normal. Passengers are requested to contact the airline concerned for updated flight information,"" read the advisory.The advisory came as air quality in Delhi deteriorated sharply, with the overall Air Quality Index recorded over 410 on Saturday morning, placing it in the ‘severe’ category. Several areas of the city were blanketed in dense smog, significantly reducing visibility.Other areas like Sansad Marg remained in the ‘very poor’ range with AQI recording to be 365.Officials blamed low wind speeds for trapping pollutants near the ground, while weak western disturbances are unlikely to bring immediate relief.According to the India Meteorological Department, moderate fog is expected to persist, further worsening air quality. Authorities have urged residents to limit outdoor exposure and follow health advisories as Delhi braces for another challenging winter smog episode.","The airport assured the flight operations to be normal as 'Low Visibility Procedures' were in progress.

"Consider bringing back Sunali's husband, 3 others from Bangladesh: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consider-bringing-back-sunalis-husband-3-others-from-bangladesh-supreme-court/articleshow/125942670.cms,"'Examine On Humanitarian Grounds'

NEW DELHI: After ascertaining repatriation of a pregnant Sunali Khatun along with her eight-year-old son to India, Supreme Court on Friday asked the Union govt to consider on humanitarian grounds the pleas for bringing back four others, including her husband, who were deported to Bangladesh in June this year.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi was informed by West Bengal's counsel Kapil Sibal and counsel Sanjay Hegde, who appeared for Sunali's father Bhodu Sekh, that she is back in India and residing with her father. When the bench asked whether adequate healthcare facilities are being extended to her, the state govt said it is providing her with required medical facilities given her advanced stage of pregnancy.Both Sibal & Hegde requested the court & solicitor general Tushar Mehta to consider bringing back the four others, who were deported along with Sunali to Bangladesh, and claimed that they have every document to prove that they were Indian citizens.Mehta said govt will need time to verify documents. The bench said, ""If govt thinks on humanitarian grounds they can be brought back, it can do so. That will be without prejudice to govt's legal arguments in the case.""The SG drew attention to a report on Friday on Sunali and said publication of such reports was meant to create a narrative, which amounts to influencing public opinion. The CJI-led bench said criticising orders of the court & publishing court proceedings in a case is perfectly fine, but attempting to peddle a narrative through a newspaper publication timed to the date of hearing is avoidable.""There should be no running commentary when a matter is sub-judice. Healthy criticism of a judgment is welcome. But publishing opinions on a sub-judice matter... the author and publisher need to be responsible. We judges are totally immune to what is published in newspapers which we go through only in the evening,"" the CJI said.Sibal said, ""Globally, comments are made on sub-judice matters in newspapers. It is not a sacrilege if motive is not attributed to the judge."" The CJI said, ""Problem arises when distorted and half-baked truth is published. It creates a misapprehension in the minds of people."" Hegde said, ""We need to develop thick skin for all these things."" The bench posted the matter for further hearing on Jan 6, when it would consider the plea for repatriation of the other four.","Pregnant Sunali Khatun along with her eight-year-old son were deported to Bangladesh in June this year.

Why India’s New Right To Disconnect Bill Could Transform Work Culture, Protect Millions From Burnout

Key provisions of the bill

Global pioneers in disconnection rights

France leads with early legislation

Portugal enforces strict boundaries

Italy adapts to flexible work

Australia joins the movement

US lacks legal protections amid rising proposals

India's parliament has seen the introduction of a new bill that grants employees the power to ignore work communications outside official hours. The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life. Employees gain the legal right to switch off from calls, emails, and messages without fear of repercussions from employers.Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule introduced this private member's bill in the Lok Sabha. As a non-ministerial proposal, it focuses on creating an Employees' Welfare Authority to oversee implementation and address violations.The legislation mandates that companies establish clear policies on after-hours contact. Workers can decline responses to non-emergency communications, promoting healthier work-life balance. The proposed authority would investigate complaints, impose fines on non-compliant firms, and educate both sides on rights and responsibilities. Supriya Sule's bill applies to private sector employees, ensuring they disconnect without disciplinary action.Several nations adopted similar measures years before India's proposal.These laws emerged amid rising concerns over burnout and digital overload in modern workplaces. Governments recognised the need to protect workers from incessant demands.France became a trailblazer in 2017 by enacting the Right to Disconnect as part of the El Khomri Labour Law, requiring companies—especially larger ones—to negotiate with unions to ensure employees are not pressured to be online after hours, helping combat digital burnout and protect work-life balance. The law requires firms with over 50 employees to negotiate agreements on out-of-hours communications. Workers disconnect from devices, and employers respect rest periods. This stemmed from labour code reforms addressing 35-hour workweeks and overtime boundaries.Portugal introduced robust protections in 2021 (Law no. 83/2021). Employers face bans on contacting staff outside shifts, with fines up to €9,690 for violations. The law covers remote workers, mandating compensation for home office expenses. It prohibits monitoring tools that invade privacy during off-hours.Italy embedded the right in 2017 smart working laws (Law 81/2017). Companies must outline disconnection periods in contracts for remote employees. Unions negotiate terms, ensuring no penalties for unavailability. This applies to public and private sectors, focusing on work-life harmony.Australia implemented its version in 2024. Employees ignore unreasonable after-hours contacts, with tribunals resolving disputes. Small businesses get exemptions initially, but larger firms comply fully. The law builds on fair work acts, shielding staff from overreach.The United States trails far behind, with no federal, state, or local right to disconnect laws enacted as of December 2025. California led the charge in February 2024 with Assembly Bill 2751, mandating policies for ignoring employer communications during non-working hours, defined by job descriptions or agreements. The measure stalled in committee amid pushback from businesses citing global operations and flexibility needs, though it could resurface. New Jersey followed with a similar 2024 bill for firms with 10-plus staff, but it too faltered. Earlier attempts in New York City and Washington met defeat, leaving workers reliant on voluntary policies.This void amplifies US work culture's intensity. Over 80% of employees report job-related stress, with more than half saying it spills into home life, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Salaried roles often exceed 40 hours without overtime pay, fostering a ""hustle"" mentality where unplugging invites guilt. Tech firms like Google offer perks such as flexible schedules and mental health days, but these vary widely, and many sectors demand round-the-clock responsiveness.","The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life.

They also found that Refex Industries received Rs 382.68 crore in equity contributions from 53 individuals and entities, including 15 non-filers and 37 who failed to disclose the transactions in their tax returns. Many of the contributors are employees or associates of the promoters, raising suspicion that the entire investment is unexplained money routed through benami entities.Documents seized during the search showed the group’s US$30 million investment in Swiss pharma firm Astro Viz, the source of which is now being probed. Investigators also flagged Rs 115 crore invested in DN Energy Ltd, which was allegedly diverted immediately after creditThe department further found that the promoter created shell companies in the name of his driver, through which Rs 8.5 crore in cash deposits and over Rs 200 crore in transactions were routed.Officials said he also spent heavily on a Rs 37 crore private jet, Rs 10 crore in luxury cars, and Rs 4 crore in high-end watches.In parallel action, searches were conducted on financier Rajesh Surana, who reportedly advanced Rs 312 crore to Aradhya Infra, which then loaned the funds onward. The role of hawala operators who helped channel more than Rs 10 crore through illegal non-banking routes is also being examined.So far, the department detected over Rs 1,000 crore in unaccounted income and recovered Rs 70 crore in unaccounted cash, gold, and silver. Further investigation is ongoing.“The search and related processes initiated by the authorities are currently under way, and Refex Group, along with all its subsidiaries and employees, is fully cooperating with the officials to ensure a smooth and transparent completion of the procedure.

Amid Flight Meltdown, IndiGo Chairman Denies Claims of Rule Manipulation and Crisis Engineering

NEW DELHI: IndiGo on Friday appointed an external aviation specialist to investigate the ""root cause analysis of the recent operational disruption,"" the airline’s Board said in a statement.The decision follows the recommendation of the Crisis Management Group (CMG) set up by the IndiGo Board shortly after the operational disruptions began in the first week of December.""Captain Illson brings over four decades of aviation experience spanning the FAA, ICAO, IATA, and major global carriers. With an illustrious career in international air transport, he offers deep expertise in aviation strategy, customised consulting, safety leadership, setting global standards, and new aircraft technologies,"" the statement said. The expert is expected to begin work immediately and submit a comprehensive report to the Board.""The objective is to conduct an independent root cause analysis of the recent operational disruption, besides opportunities for improvement,"" the airline added.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is further examining whether IndiGo violated competition norms, reported PTI, citing a senior official.The decision comes after IndiGo’s operations nearly collapsed last week due to non-compliance with new crew duty norms.Earlier today, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) also dismissed four flight operations inspectors who were responsible for monitoring the airline.The issues for the airline stemmed from the airline’s failure to hire additional pilots despite knowing that new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules, affecting crew rostering, were due to take effect on July 1, later revised to November 1. The revised norms would have required more pilots, but IndiGo did not expand its pilot pool. As a result, the DGCA had to put the new FDTL on hold for Airbus A320 aircraft until February 10, 2026, to avoid widespread cancellations like those seen earlier this month.“IndiGo was in discussion with the DGCA on the new FDTL and was aware of the increased pilot requirement. Yet they did not hire pilots. What has happened is inevitable,” said people in the know. Even after the operational crisis, IndiGo has maintained that there is no shortage of pilots. The DGCA has now directed the airline to step up its pilot hiring.The situation has also highlighted internal strains within the airline. “There is a complete disconnect and mistrust between the pilots and the management. The operations control centre (OCC) of the airline is severely disliked by IndiGo pilots. An extra payment was made for night landings which was stopped for a while and so pilots started refusing the same. New contract capped flying. A number of things happened that only widened the gulf between pilots and management,” said sources.Meanwhile, IndiGo said earlier that refunds for most cancelled flights have already been processed, with remaining transactions expected to reflect soon.","IndiGo appoints an external aviation specialist to investigate the ""root cause analysis of the recent operational disruption"" The decision comes after IndiGo’s operations nearly collapsed last week due to non-compliance with new crew duty norms.

'PM Modi Hacks Hearts, Not EVM': Kangana Ranaut Lambasts Rahul Gandhi During SIR Debate In Lok Sabha

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said SIR of electoral rolls, being carried out after more than two decades, cannot be a copy-paste of earlier voter lists and, logically, the voter enumeration by the Election Commission would include an inquisitorial process to ascertain, not determine, citizenship.Senior advocate Raju Ramachandran, appearing for a petitioner challenging the validity of SIR process, said voter enumeration exercise cannot begin with distrust on part of EC to test citizenship of every voter, especially when the statutory task to determine citizenship, upon receipt of a complaint about a foreigner, is vested with other authorities.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, ""EC is constitutionally vested with the power of superintendence of elections, which would include ensuring that only Indian citizens are registered as voters. Would it mean that EC must await a complaint, or undertake an inquisitorial exercise to determine who are doubtful voters? It is better to conduct a summary inquiry rather than await a complaint.""Ramachandran said the SIR for Bihar, according to EC, was necessitated for two reasons - mass migration and rapid urbanisation. ""Reason for Bihar SIR cannot be reason for conducting pan-India SIR as different states have different demography and ground situation relating to electoral rolls,"" he said, adding EC failed to provide detailed reasons for conducting such an exercise.This was the second time when SC had justified updation of poll rolls through SIR. The bench said in the June 24 notification, giving the two reasons for conducting SIR, gives out an intention to carry out pan-India SIR with Bihar as the starting point. ""Migration encompasses both inter-state and cross-border movement of population mainly for economic reasons. For some people across the border, Indian cities are economically more viable. While from India, talented people are migrating to other countries. For citing migration as a reason for SIR, no statistics or research is required,"" it said.Ramachandran said that states like Chhattisgarh and MP, which are going to polls in 2028, are included in SIR exercise, while other states where elections are due in future have been excluded. ""Whole process is arbitrary,"" he added. The arguments would continue on Tuesday.","Supreme Court says SIR of electoral rolls cannot be a copy-paste of earlier voter lists.

Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children, are stranded in India. In some cases, families have been separated, with some members in the US and those in India facing an endless delay to fly back.The uproar is loud; the anguish is palpable across social-media posts and WhatsApp groups. Jobs may no longer exist, schools stand disrupted, children have been torn from their parents…As TOI reported in its edition of December 10, US consulates have cancelled interview slots scheduled for mid- to late-Dec 2025. Many appointments have been pushed to March next year, and some even as far back as June 2026. This sweeping disruption followed a new US Department of State (DoS) policy requiring mandatory social-media screening for all H-1B and H-4 applicants from Dec 15. The additional vetting has sharply reduced the number of interviews that can be conducted each day, triggering mass cancellations.The US Embassy in India posted on X: “If you have received an email advising that your visa appointment has been rescheduled, Mission India looks forward to assisting you on your new appointment date.

H-4 spouses and children will face the same delays, leading to extended separations and tremendous stress.”Calling the policy shift “poorly planned” and “poorly implemented”, he adds: “You cannot claim to support legal immigration while blindsiding H-1B families with six-month delays.

Single higher education regulator closer as Cabinet okays Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhikshan Bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-higher-education-regulator-closer-as-cabinet-okays-viksit-bharat-shiksha-adhikshan-bill/articleshow/125935312.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet on Friday cleared the proposed Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhikshan Bill, paving the way for a major overhaul of higher education regulation and giving legislative shape to a key commitment of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The proposed law seeks to establish a single overarching authority for higher education, replacing legacy regulators such as the University Grants Commission (UGC), the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE). Medical and legal education will remain outside its ambit, it is learnt. The Bill is likely to be placed before the Parliament in the current session.The proposed legislation, earlier referred to as the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) Bill, has now been given Viksit Bharat branding, aligning it with the government’s broader reform narrative. Officials said the new framework ""is aimed at simplifying governance, reducing regulatory overlap and shifting the focus of oversight away from compliance-driven controls towards academic quality and learning outcomes across public and private institutions.Under the proposed law, higher education governance will be reorganised through a clear separation of functions. Regulation, accreditation, academic standard-setting and funding will be handled through distinct verticals, ending the long-standing concentration of multiple powers within a single body.While the new authority will frame norms, quality benchmarks and institutional oversight mechanisms, the disbursal of public funds will continue to rest with the administrative ministry. ""The separation is intended to prevent conflicts of interest, reduce micromanagement and create a more transparent regulatory architecture,"" said an official with the ministry of education.The idea of a unified higher education regulator predates NEP 2020. In 2018, a draft bill proposing the repeal of the UGC Act and the creation of the HECI was placed in the public domain for stakeholder consultation. That proposal, however, triggered concerns within the academic community over excessive centralisation and the possible erosion of university autonomy, and it did not move forward. The NEP 2020 revived the concept in a more calibrated form, arguing that India’s higher education regulatory structure had become fragmented, inconsistent and overly prescriptive. The policy document called for a “complete overhaul” of the system and stressed that regulation, accreditation, funding and academic standard-setting should be performed by independent and empowered bodies. Renewed efforts to translate this vision into legislation gathered pace after Dharmendra Pradhan took charge as education minister in 2021.Supporters of the new bill argue that it addresses long-standing governance distortions in the sector. Multiple regulators with overlapping jurisdictions have often resulted in contradictory rules, delayed approvals and compliance-heavy institutional behaviour. ""A unified regulator could bring coherence to academic standards, ensure uniform quality benchmarks and allow universities greater freedom to innovate in curricula, pedagogy and research, while remaining accountable for outcomes,"" said professor Vinay Pathak, vice chancellor, Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University, formerly Kanpur University.The emphasis on accreditation and learning outcomes, rather than inspections and permissions, is seen as a structural shift aligned with global best practices. By ring-fencing funding from regulatory decision-making, the government aims to create a system where quality assurance is insulated from financial considerations, encouraging institutions to compete on academic merit rather than procedural compliance.At the same time, policy analysts note that the effectiveness of the reform will depend heavily on implementation. ""The composition, independence and transparency of the new authority, and the manner in which its verticals interact with state governments and universities, will be closely watched. Issues related to institutional autonomy, federal balance and the transition from existing regulators are expected to figure prominently when the bill is taken up in Parliament.The proposed Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhikshan Bill could mark a decisive shift in how higher education is governed in India, moving from a fragmented, rule-bound system to one that places governance reform and education quality at the centre.",The proposed law seeks to establish a single overarching authority for higher education. Medical and legal education will remain outside its ambit. The Bill is likely to be placed before the Parliament in the current session. The idea of a unified higher education regulator predates NEP 2020.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125935386,imgsize-1027019,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-3.jpg"

Can check airfares but deregulation must for growth: Naidu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-check-airfares-but-deregulation-must-for-growth-naidu/articleshow/125942594.cms,"'Real-Term Rise In Air Ticket Prices Negative'

NEW DELHI: Amid demands to regulate airfare, civil aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu said in Lok Sabha on Friday that the govt retains the power to intervene in extraordinary circumstances - as seen during the recent spike in ticket prices due to mass-cancellation of IndiGo flights -to protect passengers against opportunistic pricing but emphasised the importance of deregulation and viability of airlines for the sector to grow.Rejecting criticism of soaring air prices, he said in real terms the growth in airfare is actually negative if consumer price index is factored in. In India, it has fallen by 43% compared to 23% in the US and 34% in China, he said, insisting that it is obvious that a certain pricing level has been maintained to keep it affordable for people.""We all feel these are companies which are charging a lot of money. But none of them are making good money. Most of them are in losses. We have to keep this in mind,"" he said, replying to a debate on a private member's resolution on ""appropriate measures to regulate airfare in the country"".Hitting back at opposition members who targeted the govt over instances of exorbitant airfares and the alleged duopoly in the sector, he said no matter how much politics they resort to, the governing alliance is committed to people and ensuring that more and more places are brought on the aviation map.If this was not the case, PM Narendra Modi would not have been elected to office three times in a row, Naidu asserted. He emphasised that deregulation in the sector since 1994 had led to its growth as more airlines joined in and competition rose to the benefits of passengers. Competition Commission of India and courts have also advocated deregulation, he said.Congress MP Shafi Parambil, who had moved the resolution, cited the airfare of over Rs 60,000 in a Srinagar to Delhi flight following the Pahalgam terror attack to bat for regulation but withdrew his resolution as per the standard convention in cases of private members' business.Naidu noted that the govt has a tariff monitoring unit, which is being made more powerful by its inclusion in aircraft rules to lend it statutory provisions. He said the govt had intervened to cap prices for air tickets to Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh this year, and it had taken similar measures after the Pahalgam terror attack.It is not that price surge occurs every day but mostly during festive seasons, he said, stressing that the govt has sat with airlines to augment capacities in specific routes during such occurrences.Aircraft availability is one of the constraints for the sector, and the govt is working at a programme so that aircraft are manufactured in India and the country grows as a leasing hub like Ireland and Singapore, he added.","Civil aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu said in Lok Sabha on Friday that the govt retains the power to intervene in extraordinary circumstances.

Around 100 pilots have written to management, questioning external hiring when internal utilization is low. They worry this will further impact their ability to meet contracted flying hours and affect their overall compensation.

Amid Flight Meltdown, IndiGo Chairman Denies Claims of Rule Manipulation and Crisis Engineering

NEW DELHI: IndiGo troubles are having a ripple effect on India's big airlines. Air India group's attempt to fish in the budget carrier's troubled waters by coming out with an ad for experienced Airbus A320 captains has created anxiety within the former's ranks, especially of Air India Express. The reason: AI Express' under-utilised A320 pilots fear a swelling of their ranks will lead to further decline in their flying hours and adversely affect pay. Close to 100 pilots have so far written to the management of Tata Group's low-cost carrier (LCC) so far to oppose the proposed induction. IndiGo is the world's largest operator of the A320 family of planes.Air India Express currently has a fleet of 110 aircraft, of which 76 are Boeing 737s and the remaining 34 are A320 family planes of Air India and AirAsia India. At least 10 of these A320s will be returned to lessors early next year. While the airline will induct more A320s, the time lag in doing so will mean fewer flying hours - or getting the bare minimum 40 hours' flying allowance.During Covid, erstwhile AirAsia India had reduced fixed hour payment contract of pilots from 70 to 40 hours. Subsequently, Air India also reduced the fixed hours. Only erstwhile Vistara did not do that while going in for a pay cut.IndiGo recently shifted to 50-hour fixed contracts for new junior first officers (JFOs), a reduction from the previous 70-hour standard. Fixed-hour contracts ensure pilots will get paid for a minimum of certain hours in case actual flying is less.AI Express, which has about 1,600 pilots, has its A320 aviators up in arms. ""We've consistently been informed over the past year that the group is surplus on A320 captains, which has also been the basis for maintaining the 40-hour contract and declining the requested 70-hour contract... please clarify the reason for initiating recruitment now,"" the letters say.""Why proceed with external recruitment when internal utilisation remains low?... With multiple recent resignations across the A320 fleet... is there a plan to prioritise retention or re-engagement before hiring externally? Won't any additional recruitment at this stage further impact existing captains' ability to achieve the contractually assumed cost to company based on 70 hours of flying?"" they said.","Air India group's attempt to fish in the budget carrier's troubled waters has created anxiety within the former's ranks.

DGCA removes 4 officials overseeing IndiGo ops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-removes-4-officials-overseeing-indigo-ops/articleshow/125942505.cms,"'Failed To Flag Crew Shortfall Under New Rules'

Amid Flight Meltdown, IndiGo Chairman Denies Claims of Rule Manipulation and Crisis Engineering

Management faced growing rift with IndiGo pilots: Official

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has removed from their positions four flight operations inspectors (FOIs) who were the principal operations inspectors (POI) for oversight on IndiGo Designated specifically for an airline, these FOIs (senior pilots) are supposed to keep a close watch on the airline's requirements and also see if they have the required resources in terms of crew for their operations. Airline pilots go as FOIs to the short-staffed DGCA for some years. In this case, the four have been sent back to their airline before their term got over.In IndiGo's case, officials said, despite new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) or crew rostering rules scheduled to come into effect from July 1, 2025, and then Nov 1, which would have increased pilot requirement, the airline did not hire for the same. The FOIs failed to flag the issue, they said.This led to a shortage, with IndiGo unable to operate as per new FDTL, which was then put on hold for Airbus A320 aircraft till Feb 10, 2026, to avoid the sort of mass cancellations seen earlier this month.""IndiGo was in discussion with DGCA on the new FDTL and was aware of the increased pilot requirement. Yet they did not hire pilots,"" said an official in the know.Even after the fiasco, IndiGo maintains there is no pilot shortage.DGCA has directed the airline to step up its pilot hiring. Meanwhile, IndiGo's operations are nearly back to normal, with over 2,050 flights Friday across 138 destinations.There is a complete disconnect and mistrust between the pilots and the management. The operations control centre (OCC) of the airline is severely disliked by IndiGo pilots. An extra payment was made for night landings which was stopped for a while and so pilots started refusing night flights. New contract had capped flying. A number of things happened that only widened the gulf between pilots and management,"" an official said.The discontent in IndiGo pilots has arisen not merely for deferring FDTL implementation, but also on other fronts like tweaking salary components, medically unfit and sick report policy. Things got worse recently when some Indian carriers wanted restriction on their pilots going abroad to work for foreign airlines, mainly in the Gulf.""It is okay for Indian carriers to hire expat top management people like CEOs and COOs but they have a problem with us going abroad to work. If you want to retain us, then have better relations with employees, better work environment and pay package. Instead, airlines only want to arm-twist us. Maybe things will change now after the IndiGo fiasco,"" added a pilot.",The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has removed from their positions four flight operations inspectors (FOIs) The FOIs are supposed to keep a close watch on the airline's requirements and also see if they have the required resources in terms of crew for their operations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125942505,imgsize-738043,width-400,resizemode-4/125942505.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a fresh push to reform coal sector, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs Friday approved a CoalSETU policy, a dedicated window for long-term auction of coal linkages for industrial use and exports.The new CoalSETU window - Policy for Auction of Coal Linkage for Seamless, Efficient and Transparent Utilisation - will be added to the existing 2016 linkage auction policy for the non-regulated sector. Unlike current system, where coal linkages are auctioned only to specified end users such as cement, steel, sponge iron and aluminium plants, the new window will allow any domestic industrial buyer to bid for coal linkages. Coking coal will not be offered, and traders will be barred to prevent market distortion.Officials said the move aims at simplifying procedures, boosting ease of doing business and ensuring faster utilisation of India's coal reserves at a time when the country is working to cut dependence on imports. It also aligns with the wider opening of the coal sector for commercial mining, where end-use restrictions had already been removed.Existing linkage auctions for specified sectors will continue, but these industries may join the new window. Fuel supply agreements can be signed for up to 15 years, and flexible use of coal linkages within group companies has been allowed.Commercial mining of coal, launched in 2020, has improved domestic availability. India crossed milestone of one billion tonnes of coal production in a year for the first time in 2024-25.Under the policy, coal obtained through this window can be used for own consumption, export (up to 50% of quantity), coal washing or by group companies. Resale within the country will not be allowed. The govt expects the policy to encourage more washed coal production, reduce imports and create export opportunities.","India has launched a new policy for long-term coal linkage auctions aimed at industrial use and exports.

This aims to boost domestic energy production and meet net-zero targets.

PM Modi Announces Major Move Allowing Private Players Into Nuclear Sector To Spur Advanced Reactors

NEW DELHI: Cabinet on Friday approved a bill that seeks to open the highly restricted nuclear power sector to private companies and is also crucial for the country's goal of achieving 100 gigawatt nuclear power capacity by 2047.Officials said Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill proposes amending the civil liability law to shield plant operators and cap equipment suppliers' liability, along with redesigning operator insurance to Rs 1,500 crore per incident under Indian Nuclear Insurance Pool.The bill proposes allowing up to 49% foreign direct investment and creating a unified legal framework for atomic energy, including a specialised nuclear tribunal.Private-sector entry will be governed by clear rules under govt oversight, while department of atomic energy will retain control over core functions such as nuclear material production, heavy water, and waste management.FM Nirmala Sitharaman had announced govt's intent to open the sector to private participation in her Feb Budget speech. She had also unveiled a Nuclear Energy Mission with Rs 20,000 crore for R&D on small modular reactors (SMRs), and a plan to operationalise five indigenously developed SMRs by 2033. PM Narendra Modi indicated last month that govt was preparing to open the nuclear sector to private players.Atomic Energy Act bars private entities and state govts from operating nuclear power plants.Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited, a PSU under DAE, is the sole operator and runs all 24 commercial reactors.Officials said SHANTI bill aimed to address long-standing concerns across the nuclear energy chain. They pointed to rising domestic energy demand, growth of data centres, and India's 2070 net-zero target as factors driving ren-ewed global interest in nuclear power. Officials added scaling nuclear capacity ten-fold in two decades will require private-sector involvement.Anujesh Dwivedi, partner at Deloitte India, said, ""Tariff for nuclear power is governed by the department of atomic energy, in consultation with the central electricity authority. Private sector participation will necessitate governance by an independent regulator, enabling competitive determination of tariffs.""""Involving the private sector in R&D of nuclear technologies for civil use by allowing creation of intellectual property rights would be in line with the approach of several developed countries,"" he added.",Atomic Energy Act bars private entities and state govts from operating nuclear power plants.

'Unemployability': Is India Sitting On Ticking Time Bomb Of Unemployment? Expert's Big Reveal

Govt approves 125-day rural job bill to replace MGNREGA





The Union Cabinet on Friday cleared a raft of legislations aimed at improving social safety by raising the number of days available for work under the jobs guarantee scheme, opening up the civil nuclear energy space to the private sector, and strengthening markets and the financial sector by allowing up to 100% foreign investment in insurance.Govt intends to introduce the Pujya Bapu Gramin Rozgar Guarantee Bill to replace MGNREGA, which will provide assured employment to the rural poor for 125 days against 100 days at present and will require a big increase in outlay.The move, ahead of polls in West Bengal, is expected to help undermine UPA's effort to claim political proprietor- ship of the job scheme.With just a week for winter session to end, govt will push the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (Shanti) Bill - which will allow private sector participation, including possibly overseas investors.The Centre is also set to seek parliamentary nod to allow up to 100% FDI in the insurance sector and reform the distribution network to ensure that more households and individuals have risk covers that go beyond life to health and property.NEW DELHI: Government on Friday approved a bill to replace Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Act - the UPA-era flagship rural employment guarantee scheme - with its own and significantly bigger Pujya Bapu Gramin Rozgar Guarantee Bill.Sources said the Cabinet chaired by PM Narendra Modi gave its nod to the proposed law, which is expected to be tabled in Parliament next week and guarantees 125 workdays per household against the 100 provided under MGNREGA. The central share will be Rs 95,600 crore for the scheme, sources said.The governing NDA has been accused by Congress - which exudes a sense of ownership over the law passed in 2005 - and its regional rivals, especially TMC, of not providing adequate funding. Govt has insisted it is a demand-driven programme and funding is given accordingly.The scheme has emerged as a political flashpoint between BJP and West Bengal's governing TMC as the Centre had withheld funding to the state since 2022 citing alleged financial irregularities. A recent Supreme Court order to the central govt to resume the scheme did not help matters as CM Mamata Banerjee tore a paper outlining the central guidelines.With the wholesale replacement of the UPA-era law with its own legislation, whose complete details remain unclear, the NDA govt is expected to address several constituencies. Its guarantee of minimum 125 workdays to rural household blunts the opposition's argument that the Centre is starving the employment scheme.It will help BJP's political outreach in a predominantly rural state like West Bengal, where polls are due in a few months. The Trinamool Congress govt runs its own employment programme of 'Karmashree', which guarantees minimum 50 days of work.The expanded scope of the bill gives NDA a plank to boost its claim of generating more employment, especially in states with a high rural population like Bihar, where migration emerged as an issue in the recent assembly polls, and large swathes of northern and eastern states.In 2015, Modi had mocked the scheme as a ""living monument"" to the UPA govt's failure, saying the rural population was pushed to doing menial work due to lack of employment opportunities, while highlighting that his govt was going to continue it in an improved form.Sources said all projects to be undertaken under the new scheme will be from Viksit Bharat National Infra Stack, which will be created using PM GatiShakti Master Plan. Priority will be on water security. Work will be taken up through Vikshit Gram Panchayat Plans, they said, adding that to ensure no shortage of workforce in the farming season, states will have to prepare a 60-day plan in advance. If states fail to give work to a household, it will get unemployment allowance.","Government approves bill to replace MGNREGA with Pujya Bapu Gramin Rozgar Guarantee Bill, promising 125 workdays per household.

'Warm And Engaging': PM Modi Holds Phone Call With Trump Amid Trade Talks, US-India Ties Discussed

PM-Trump call signals greater India-US willingness to engage

NEW DELHI: Amidst ongoing efforts by India and the US to finalise a bilateral trade deal, PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation while also discussing regional and global issues.The conversation came within a week of Modi's summit with Russian President Putin and in the middle of renewed efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war on the back of Trump's peace plan.The two sides are looking to arrive at a common understanding on issues amid indications that US is still seeking access for its farm products like corn and soybean, among other issues. The two sides have been in talks for a bilateral trade pact since March.""Had very warm and engaging conversation with President Trump. We reviewed progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments. India and the US will continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity,"" Modi posted on X.PM Modi is learnt to have reiterated India's position that it will support all international efforts for peace.""Modi and Trump reviewed the steady progress in India-US bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments,"" said an Indian readout. This was the first conversation between the two since they had a call days after Diwali.Thursday's telephonic conversation signals a greater willingness on both sides to engage as there has been progress in most areas, barring trade, for which Trump has imposed 50% import duty on Indian products, comprising 25% reciprocal tariff and another 25% secondary tariffs for purchasing Russian oil and defence equipment.The move has hit several Indian exports, including textiles, leather, gems and jewellery and shrimps. While negotiators from the two sides have been engaging in a dialogue to resolve the issue, the Trump administration is yet to ease the tariffs, despite an acknowledgment by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that the offer on the table is the best received so far.The conversation follows recent efforts by both sides to revive bilateral engagements after the trade-related impasse. US also joined India and other Quad nations in condemning the Red Fort terror incident in a Quad counter-terrorism dialogue. Both sides also separately held their own terrorism dialogue.India and US held foreign office consultations this week with a focus on key bilateral issues, including trade and investment, defence, the TRUST initiative for cooperation in critical technologies, energy, including civil nuclear collaboration, and critical minerals.According to US, the meeting was an opportunity to translate President Trump and PM Modi's vision from their Feb meeting this year into ""concrete progress that enhances US security, jobs and competitiveness, while supporting India's long-term goals"".""The Under Secretary emphasised US' aim to deepen cooperation in defense, energy, technology, space, and trusted supply chains and the value of US-India cooperation that fuels US innovation while supporting India's rise as a global technology leader,"" a US embassy spokesperson said.While the US statement did not mention the Indo-Pacific, an Indian readout said that the discussions also covered regional and global developments of mutual interest, with both sides underscoring their shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.","PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation.

NEW DELHI: A court on Thursday granted 15 days' interim bail to northeast Delhi riots conspiracy accused Umar Khalid, allowing him to attend his sister's wedding later this month.Additional sessions judge Sameer Bajpai noted that Khalid had already spent five years and three months in custody since his arrest in Sept 2020 and that the plea was specifically tied to a personal and significant family occasion. ""Considering the fact that the marriage is of the real sister of the applicant, the application is allowed and the applicant is granted interim bail,"" the court said.It added that the interim relief would remain effective from Dec 16 to 29. The former JNU student will be released on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 20,000 along with two sureties of the same amount. The court also emphasised that the interim bail was being granted within a limited and clearly defined timeframe.The court observed that the temporary release would also allow Khalid to briefly reunite with his parents, besides with his elder sister and her children, who stayed abroad and were expected to attend the wedding.The order, however, imposed several conditions. Khalid has been specifically barred from contacting any witness connected with the case, from using social media in any form and from travelling to any place other than visits to his parents and immediate close relatives.Opposing the plea, the prosecution argued that ""considering the act of the applicant, they do not deserve any relief"". It also pointed out that the actual ceremonies were scheduled only between Dec 25 and 27, lasting ""three days"", and questioned the necessity of granting a 15-day relief. The court, however, proceeded to allow the full period sought by Khalid.This is not the first instance in which the former JNU scholar has received limited-duration bail for family functions. Last Dec, he was granted interim bail for seven days to attend a wedding in his family.

How Triple H and Stephanie McMahon accumulated long-term financial strength through wrestling, leadership and corporate expansion

Why their legacy still guides WWE’s future identity

As members of the WWE corporate leadership team and creative team members, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon are important to both the WWE corporate and creative ecosystems. The estimated net worth of Triple H is approximately $250 million, while the estimated net worth of Stephanie McMahon is approximately $250 million.Therefore, the combined estimated value of both Triple H and Stephanie McMahon in 2025 will be approximately $500 million based on the long-term growth of their respective equity interests, as well as the decades they have each spent with WWE.Triple H’s career rarely moved in a straight line, because his shift from performer to executive created a layered income structure through royalties, contract earnings and high-ranking corporate roles. His long involvement in creative planning continues to generate value as global media rights expand and the talent pipelines he built remain central to WWE’s structure.Stephanie McMahon followed a different path, leading branding initiatives, community programmes and global partnerships while earning multi-million-dollar compensation packages across several executive cycles. WWE's merger with Endeavor has provided additional value for its shareholdings as a result of increased activity in the marketplace and the evolution of entertainment entities to include more entertainment-based revenue streams.Due to this growth, WWE and Endeavor's financial momentum have developed over time as a result of the company being able to create global brands and have a consistent presence in the evolution of WWE from within its Entertainment Model.Through WWE Television and Digital showcases, Triple H's fingerprints remain very evident. Many of the strategies that he created while heading up NXT are still being utilized in the creation of talent presentation, match structure, and long-term development of characters for the roster of talent on the main roster.The vision of talent recruitment created by Stephanie McMahon will shape the future stories of multiple main event talents, providing WWE with a solid foundation for character development and storytelling. The previous work of Stephanie McMahon will continue to strengthen WWE's public image and brand as a result of the partnerships, digital initiatives and outreach programs she helped create before transitioning out of day-to-day responsibilities.The combination of Triple H and Stephanie McMahon is now being viewed as a creative foundation and business guideline for the future growth of WWE under TKO and the ongoing economic security that both Stephanie McMahon and Triple H represent.Also Read: WWE in big trouble?

Her name is linked to former coach Sherrone Moore's firing and police detainment due to alleged inappropriate relationship rumors. Shiver's recent significant salary increase and social media silence have fueled speculation amid the ongoing investigation.

Paige Shiver’s rising salary, estimated net worth, and why the timing has fueled public curiosity

The University of Michigan football program is facing its most turbulent moment in years, and at the center of the storm is executive assistant Paige Shiver, an employee who until recently maintained a low public profile. Interest around Shiver has surged after her name became entangled in online speculation connected to the firing and police detainment of former head coach Sherrone Moore.While no university official has identified the staff member involved in the alleged inappropriate relationship, searches such as “Sherrone Moore assistant” and “who did Sherrone Moore have a relationship with” have driven Shiver into the national spotlight. Paige's sudden social media silence and a significant salary increase have added new layers to a story that continues to unfold.Public payroll filings show that Paige Shiver’s salary held steady at $58,025 for two years before climbing to $90,000 for the 2024–25 fiscal cycle, a 55.11% jump that many observers viewed as unusually steep for an executive assistant role. Based on her salary history, limited public records, and the absence of additional disclosed income streams, Shiver’s estimated net worth likely falls in the $150,000 to $200,000 range.As online rumors intensified, Shiver reportedly “switched her Instagram account to private,” a move that social media users interpreted as a sign of the pressure surrounding her. Yet there is no confirmed link between the pay hike and the university’s investigation, and officials have not named her in any formal capacity. Still, the scrutiny grew louder as Moore’s professional downfall accelerated.Sherrone Moore, who became a rising coaching star after stepping in during Jim Harbaugh’s suspension and later leading Michigan to major wins, was abruptly dismissed after allegations surfaced of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.“Ex-Michigan coach Sherrone Moore was detained by police in Saline, Mich. this evening and turned over to police in Pittsfield Township for investigation into potential charges,” according to ESPN’s Pete Thamel via Dan Wetzel..With Biff Poggi appointed interim head coach and speculation swirling around the future of the Wolverines’ program, Paige Shiver’s name remains tied to one of the most chaotic weeks in Michigan football history, even as the facts remain unsettled and the investigation ongoing.Also Read: Why Sherrone Moore ended up in police custody amid Michigan firing him for alleged ‘inappropriate relationship’ scandal",Paige Shiver is an executive assistant at the University of Michigan.

LUCKNOW: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday launched a major crackdown across three states—Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Gujarat—hours after registering an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) against 67 accused in the state’s largest codeine-based cough syrup diversion and trafficking racket.Acting on the ECIR filed by its Lucknow zonal office, ED teams, accompanied by central paramilitary forces, carried out coordinated searches at 25 locations. The raids spanned factories, warehouses, and residences linked to arrested accused and their associates.In Uttar Pradesh, premises in Lucknow, Saharanpur, Varanasi, and Ghaziabad were searched, while parallel operations were executed in Ranchi (Jharkhand) and Ahmedabad (Gujarat)—regions identified as hubs for the illegal manufacturing, bottling, and diversion of codeine-based syrups.Officials said the money-laundering probe marks the beginning of a full-fledged financial investigation into the racket, which allegedly generated crores through illegal sale, forged stock entries, fake billing, and benami distribution chains. The ECIR, ED’s internal equivalent of an FIR, empowers the agency to summon suspects, freeze bank accounts, seize digital evidence, and attach properties acquired through illicit proceeds.Sources said the ECIR is based on 24 FIRs registered over the past year by UP Police, STF, and FSDA across districts including Lucknow, Chandauli, Varanasi, Ghaziabad, Sonbhadra, Sultanpur, Kanpur Nagar, Jaunpur, Bahraich, Bhadohi, and Ghazipur. These cases involve large-scale seizures of illegal or mislabelled codeine syrups, fake GST invoices, manipulated stock registers, unregistered transporters, and suspected covert manufacturing units.“Diversion of pharmaceutical consignments to unlicensed markets and cash-based interstate networks indicated layered laundering,” an official said. Investigators have also flagged the use of shell firms, informal cash channels, and benami entities.ED has sought complete case files, bank statements, GST records, ITRs, and property documents of all accused from UP Police, and has begun mapping the financial and logistical chain—transporters, warehouses, pharma distributors, and cash handlers.The alleged kingpin, Shubham Jaiswal, was issued a notice to appear before ED in Lucknow on December 8, 2025. But he did not now. More summonses are expected as the financial probe widens.“This case involves diversion of pharmaceutical stock, illegal manufacturing, smuggling routes, and laundering of profits.

Months-long hunt ends: Leopard roaming Pune airport finally captured,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/months-long-hunt-ends-leopard-roaming-pune-airport-finally-captured/articleshow/125927981.cms,"PUNE: After months of remaining elusive, the fully grown male leopard, which was sighted multiple times at the Pune airport since April this year, was finally caught in the wee hours of Friday by a joint team of forest department and RESQCT members.Forest officials said that the carefully planned operation was assisted by the personnel of the Indian Air Force (IAF). The leopard had been moving on the airside of the airport which is managed and maintained by the IAF.The presence of the leopard was first confirmed on April 28. Over the following months, the animal utilised an extensive network of underground tunnels, dense vegetation and low-footfall zones within the airport premises to move in and out of the area. Given the vast and sensitive nature of the airport landscape, capture efforts posed significant operational and safety challenges. Continuous monitoring was undertaken using camera traps, live cameras and trap cages, though the leopard consistently avoided entering cages.On December 4, monitoring confirmed that the leopard had entered the underground tunnel network. In response, tunnel exits were systematically closed and reinforced, additional live surveillance cameras were installed, and camera traps were repositioned to closely track the animal’s movement patterns within the confined space, officials said.Based on this data, a focused operation was planned on 11 December 2025 involving a 30-member team comprising personnel from the Forest Department, RESQ Charitable Trust and the Indian Air Force. The team executed a coordinated drive to guide the leopard into an approximately 80-foot tunnel, where a controlled chemical immobilisation could be attempted.Despite the highly constrained conditions underground, the leopard was successfully tranquilised by wildlife veterinarian Dr Gourav Mangla. The animal was then safely retrieved from the tunnel and transferred for veterinary observation.The leopard has since recovered well and is currently housed at the Transit Treatment Centre at Bavdhan, Pune, for further observation and assessment.Mahadev Mohite, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Pune Division, said, “This operation reflects strong inter-agency coordination and preparedness. The Forest Department, RESQ Charitable Trust, the Indian Air Force and airport authorities worked seamlessly over several months. Pune has demonstrated that it is equipped to respond to complex wildlife situations within highly sensitive urban and infrastructure settings. ”Neha Panchamiya, Founder and President, RESQ Charitable Trust, added, “Every wildlife capture situation is unique, and responses must be guided by strategy, timing and context rather than urgency alone. This operation shows that wise, measured decision-making, supported by data, technology and teamwork, leads to outcomes that prioritise both human safety and wildlife welfare.”","The presence of the leopard was first confirmed on April 28.

Jamie Dimon the CEO of America’s biggest banks JPMorgan and Chase has now warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation. This in turn is creating risks not only for the continent but also for the United States. As reported by Bloomberg, speaking at the Reagan National Defence Forum, Dimon said, “Europe has a real problem. They do some wonderful things on their safety nets. But they’ve driven business out, they’ve driven investment out, they’ve driven innovation out. It’s kind of coming back.”Along with this, Dimon has also cautioned that a fragmented Europe is one of the biggest challenges faced by the world. Earlier this year, in his annual shareholders letter, Dimon noted that Europe has “serious issues to fix.” While praising the creation of the euro and Europe’s pursuit of peace, Dimon warned that reduced military efforts and difficulties in reaching consensus within the European Union threaten the continent’s stability.“If they fragment, then you can say that America first will not be around anymore. It will hurt us more than anybody else because they are a major ally in every single way, including common values, which are really important,” he said, urging Washington to adopt a long-term strategy to strengthen Europe.“A weak Europe is bad for us.”The comments made by Dimon clings with recent announcement made by JPMorgan to funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next decade — $500 billion more than previously planned.The initiative will mainly focus on supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence and resilience and also frontier and strategic technologies.Along with this, JPMorgan will also invest up to $10 billion of its own capital to enable combines expand and innovate in strategic manufacturing.Separately, Dimon commended President Trump’s efforts to cut government bureaucracy. “There is no question that this administration is trying to bring an axe to some of the bureaucracy that held back America. That is a good thing and we can do it and still keep the world safe, for safe food and safe banks and all the stuff like that,” he said.","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation.

TCS Layoffs: Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar gives written reply in Vidhan Parishad on TCS layoffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/maharashtra-labour-minister-aakash-fundkar-gives-written-reply-in-vidhan-parishad-on-tcs-layoffs/articleshow/125886840.cms,"TCS layoffs: Legislative concerns

TCS HR chief Sudeep Kunnumal on layoffs in future





Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar has now informed that the state legislative council that around 376 employees of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were laid off at the company’s Pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year. The disclosure was made via a hand written reply during the Vidhan Parishad session, after concerns were raised by members over reports of widespread layoffs in the IT sector.Fundkar further clarified that the layoffs were not linked to artificial intelligence or automation, addressing speculation that job losses were part of a broader restructuring driven by new technologies. In the Vidhan Parishad, Fundkar revealed that the company fired 376 employees from its Pune campus and the round of layoffs mainly impacted middle and senior-level managers.As reported by new agency PTI, during the Question Hour, the legislators including Uma Khare and Prasad Lad raised questions about increasing job losses in the technology sector and the impact of AI adoption on employment. The reply by the minister is sought to provide transparency by citing official data received directly from TCS.The Maharashtra government also stressed in the fact that while the layoffs have occurred, they are not on the scale suggested by media reports of mass layoffs across multiple cities.The minister further assured the council that the government is monitoring developments in the IT sector closely, given its importance to employment and state’s economy.Recently, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant. Speaking during the company’s Q2 earnings call earlier this month, Kunnumal said that TCS is not “chasing a target” when it comes to job cuts. Instead, the IT firm said it will evaluate “everyone”.During the earnings call, analyst Surendra Goyal from Citi asked: “The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal replied to the question saying: “So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition. So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”",Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) laid off 376 employees from its Pune campus.

‘Trillions rolling in’: Why Trump’s massive tariffs haven’t resolved American woes — Inside the windchill economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trillions-rolling-in-why-trumps-massive-tariffs-havent-resolved-american-woes-inside-the-windchill-economy/articleshow/125943516.cms,"High-Stakes Modi-Trump Call Attempts To Repair Ties Strained By US Tariffs, Russia Energy Policies

‘Trillions incoming’





Government stakes and market gains





'The richest country'

Trump’s work in US promise





Why do numbers fail to add up?





A messaging gap in the ‘windchill economy’





US President Donald Trump has often pointed to rising government revenues and sweeping investment pledges as proof that his economic strategy is working. However, many Americans, struggling with rising bills, have failed to see this growth materialising.Critics have also argued that the president is talking past households dealing with day-to-day affordability pressures.The disconnect is most visible in what economists describe as a “windchill economy,” a period where headline growth looks healthy, but personal finances feel strained. In the US, while Trump has emphasised strong numbers and future gains, the immediate cost-of-living squeeze remains unresolved for millions.At the heart of Trump’s economic pitch are two claims he repeats frequently: that trillions are flowing into the US because of the ‘tariffs’ and that major corporations have committed trillions of dollars in investment to the American economy.“Let me tell you about the real economy,” Trump told Politico, earlier this week, when asked about affordability.“We’ve got $18 trillion coming into our country.Biden had less than $1 trillion in four years.”Although the president’s figures are widely regarded as overstated, tariff collections have risen by more than $200 billion during Trump’s term compared with the previous administration. At the same time, several companies and foreign governments have announced short- and long-term investment plans in the US, with the total value of pledges running into the trillions of dollars.Trump has also highlighted the launch of a new $1 million “Gold Card” visa programme this week, which he says will bring billions of dollars into the country. Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has said the scheme could raise up to $1 trillion for the US Treasury.Beyond tariffs and visas, Trump has pointed to direct government investments in companies deemed critical to national security. His administration has committed billions of taxpayer dollars to such firms, arguing that the strategy strengthens both the economy and national interests.Because of stock market gains, Trump has said those investments are already increasing in value. Referring to the administration’s 10% stake in Intel, he said, “The price went through the roof. I made $40 million dollars. Nobody talks about that.”The administration’s broader argument is that rising and promised revenues could finance major policy initiatives, including Trump’s proposed $2,000 stimulus cheques and the large tax cut passed earlier this year. Trump has also claimed that tariff revenue could eventually replace income taxes altogether.Officials have gone further, suggesting that sustained tariff income could help pay down the national debt. The US paid $1.2 trillion last year simply to service its debt, which now stands at about $38 trillion, more than the country’s total economic output, according to CNN. Lowering the debt, the administration argues, would reduce interest costs and free up funds for programmes that support affordability.Trump has cited the recent $12 billion bailout for farmers as proof of concept. “We’ve taken in so much money with the tariffs now that it’s such a pleasure,” he said. “Without it, we wouldn’t be able to help you. We’re the richest country in the world now.”Trump has also linked investment pledges and tariffs to job creation, particularly in manufacturing and artificial intelligence. He has argued that higher trade barriers are encouraging companies to bring factories and workers back to the US.“Car companies are moving back that left us years ago. AI is coming in at levels never seen before. Factories are opening up all over the country,” Trump told Politico. “Ultimately, you know what it reduces itself to? Jobs. You’re going to have jobs like you’ve never seen in the United States.”Economists and critics say the financial reality does not support the scale of Trump’s claims. While an extra $200 billion in tariff revenue is substantial, it represents a small share of a $30 trillion economy. It is not enough to fund nationwide stimulus payments, eliminate income taxes or significantly reduce a $38 trillion debt.Investment pledges, meanwhile, are not binding. Companies have a history of announcing high-profile projects alongside presidents only to later scale them back or abandon them altogether. Much of the headline investment value also includes commitments that pre-date Trump’s involvement.Even if all the promised projects move forward, factories across the US are already struggling to find workers, and automation has played a major role in the long-term decline of manufacturing jobs.There is also evidence that tariffs are adding to, rather than easing, cost pressures. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that Trump’s tariffs are solely responsible for inflation running above the Fed’s 2% long-term target this year.That reality undercuts the administration’s argument that tariffs will improve affordability in the near term, especially for households already squeezed by higher prices.The political challenge for Trump lies in the gap between strong economic indicators and lived experience. While he can point to growth and consumer spending, those figures carry little weight for people who struggle to pay their bills at the end of the month.By focusing on future gains and dismissing the affordability squeeze as a “con job” or a “scam”, Trump has made his task harder. His language reflects that of a business executive, where rising revenue signals success.But for many Americans, the economy is not about balance sheets or long-term projections, it is about whether they can afford to live right now.","US President Donald Trump has often pointed to rising government revenues and sweeping investment pledges as proof that his economic strategy is working.
