Focus on green energy as Malaysian PM arrives in India today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/focus-on-green-energy-as-malaysian-pm-arrives-in-india-today/articleshow/112615745.cms,"KUALA LAMPUR: Visiting Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim is expected to make an emphatic pitch for Indian investments to revive his country's economy and amplify its digital and green energy sectors given India's solid experience and skill. Anwar is scheduled to reach Delhi on Monday evening. This will be Malaysia's first prime-ministerial visit to India since 2018.He will meet PM Narendra Modi on August 20.Sources said the two sides are working towards a substantive agreement on the start-ups sector. Currently, Indian start-ups like RazorPay and Pine Labs have nearly 70 percent share of the digital payment market, B2B, in Malaysia. Local start-ups, on the other hand, are tapping into India's digital technology sector.Talking to TOI in Kuala Lumpur, industry leaders and policymakers said two important takeaways for Malaysia on bilateral trade would be - getting India's expertise from its National Skill Development programme, and collaboration and support on Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Artificial Intelligence.India has a robust longterm growth trajectory, aided by new EV policy measures that are wooing investors. But with Tesla recently scrapping its plan to manufacture EVs in Malaysia, government here finds itself in a difficult spot. It has, from time to time, announced its readiness to shift gears in the car market and build an EV ecosystem with battery development. Barring a few wealthy buyers, EVs still face low demand. Experts in the sector believe Anwar will seek investment from India to grow this promising but nascent industry in Malaysia.Other key sectors will include import of palm oil from Malaysia that suffered due to former PM Mahathir Mohamad's trenchant posturing on Kashmir. Anwar will seek to iron this out with PM Modi.India imported Malaysian palm oil to the value of 7.08 billion Malaysian Ringgit between January to August 2023. The two sides will also review the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement to include new items on the list.",Anwar Ibrahim is scheduled to reach Delhi on Monday evening.

Graft case relief for man as CBI errs on gift to son,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/graft-case-relief-for-man-as-cbi-errs-on-gift-to-son/articleshow/112614307.cms,"CHENNAI: A simple, sentimental gift to a 10-year-old boy led to the collapse of a high-value corruption case against a railway engineer . The CBI misclassified this family hand-me-down property as a financial asset, inflating charges and leading to the eventual acquittal of his parents.Judge S Ezhil Velavan found critical mistakes in the investigation against KSSVP Murthy Raju and his wife K Pushpavalli, ruling the property was wrongly included and that the CBI failed to prove the couple's assets exceeded their income.The court then acquitted the couple of all charges.The case against Raju, a deputy chief engineer in the railways, and Pushpavalli spanned over a decade. The CBI accused them of possessing disproportionate assets totalling Rs 54.6 lakh.The CBI's investigation scrutinised every aspect of the couple's finances, including salary slips, property deeds, bank accounts, and personal gifts.Central to this investigation was a Rs 92,900 property gift given to their son Sushanth, when he was 10 years old, by a relative, G Nalini Mohan Raju.This property was not a typical financial acquisition, but a sentimental family hand-me-down intended to secure the boy's future. However, the CBI mistakenly treated this gift as a significant financial transaction , adding it to the list of assets the couple allegedly could not explain.This mistake inflated the family's perceived wealth, contributing to the corruption charges against them. The inclusion of this property as a disproportionate asset tipped the scales in the CBI's investigation, making the case appear stronger than it was.Further, the CBI erred by overvaluing assets like a Rs 1-lakh gold necklace and miscalculating cash and investments, such as Rs 6.4 lakh in a finance firm and Rs 2.2 lakh in a locker. They also failed to properly review documentation, wrongfully including Rs 35,500 in gold jewellery and legitimate investments as disproportionate assets.The defence exposed these errors, proving the property gifted to Sushanth was a non-financial transfer wrongly included as a disproportionate asset.","KSSVP Murthy Raju and his wife K Pushpavalli were accused of possessing disproportionate assets totalling Rs 54.6 lakh.

Full text of Champai Soren's post on X:



NEW DELHI: In a strong indication that former Jharkhand chief minister Champai Soren may quit the party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader penned an emotional letter on X detailing the ""insults and contempt "" he has had to bear recently at the hands of his own partymen that eventually forced him to look for an "" alternative path "".Commenting on the recent media reports over a rift within the JMM and that Champai Soren may leave the party and join the BJP, the senior leader said: ""After so much insult and contempt, I was forced to look for an alternative path.With a heavy heart, I said in a meeting of the legislative party that - 'A new chapter of my life is going to start from today'. I had three options in this. First, to retire from politics, second, to form my own separate organisation and third, if I find a companion on this path, then to travel further with him. From that day till today, and till the upcoming Jharkhand Assembly elections, all options are open for me in this journey.""In another post, Champai reiterated that he had no intention of harming JMM: ""One more thing, this is my personal struggle, so I have no intention of involving any party member in it or causing any harm to the organisation. We can never even think of harming the party which we have nurtured with our blood and sweat.""Recalling how an ""unprecedented turn of events"" led him to being picked as the 12th Chief Minister of Jharkhand, Champai said: ""From the first day of my tenure to the last day (July 3), I discharged my duties towards the state with full devotion and dedication.""He also went into detail about how he was quickly shunted out of official duties once Hemant Soren got bail in a land scam case. Just days after walking out of jail on June 28, Hemant Soren took oath as the Jharkhand CM on July 4.""The day after Hul Diwas [June 30], I came to know that all my programs for the next two days have been postponed by the party leadership. One of these was a public program in Dumka, while the other was to distribute appointment letters to PGT teachers. On asking, I came to know that a meeting of the legislative party has been called by the coalition on July 3, till then you cannot attend any program as CM. Can there be anything more humiliating in a democracy than a Chief Minister's programs being cancelled by another person? Despite swallowing this bitter pill of insult, I said that the appointment letters would be distributed in the morning, while the legislative party meeting would be held in the afternoon, so I would attend it from there. But, I was flatly refused from there. For the first time in my spotless political journey of the last four decades, I was broken from within. I could not understand what to do. For two days, I sat quietly and introspected, kept searching for my mistake in the whole incident. I did not have the greed for power even a bit, but to whom could I show this blow to my self-respect? Where could I express the pain inflicted by my own people?

During the meeting, I was asked to resign. I was surprised, but I had no greed for power, so I immediately resigned, but my heart was emotional due to the blow to my self-respect.

What happened that brought the son of a poor farmer living in a small village of Kolhan to this point. From raising the voice of workers against industrial houses at the beginning of my public life to the Jharkhand movement, I have always done politics of public concern. I have been trying to get the rights of the tribals, natives, poor, laborers, students and people of backward classes of the state. Whether I held any post or not, I was always available to the public, raising the issues of those people who had dreamt of a better future with the state of Jharkhand.Meanwhile, on January 31, after an unprecedented turn of events, the India Alliance chose me to serve the state as the 12th Chief Minister of Jharkhand. From the first day of my tenure to the last day (July 3), I discharged my duties towards the state with full devotion and dedication.During this period, we took many decisions in public interest and, as always, was always available for everyone. The people of the state will evaluate the decisions we took keeping in mind the elders, women, youth, students and every section of the society and every person of the state. When I got power, I paid homage to heroes like Baba Tilka Manjhi, Bhagwan Birsa Munda and Sido-Kanhu and pledged to serve the state.Every child in Jharkhand knows that during my tenure, I never did anything wrong to anyone, nor did I let anything wrong happen to anyone. Meanwhile, the day after Hul Diwas, I came to know that all my programs for the next two days have been postponed by the party leadership.

I am counted among the senior members in this party, the rest are juniors, and the supremo who is senior to me is no longer active in politics due to health, then what option did I have? If he had been active, perhaps the situation would have been different.Although the Chief Minister has the right to call a meeting of the legislative party, I was not even told the agenda of the meeting.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Sunday took suo motu cognisance of the August 9 rape-murder of a doctor at Kolkata's R G Kar hospital. This comes days after Calcutta HC had transferred to probe to CBI expressing reservations about Kolkata police's probe into the case.CJI D Y Chandrachud ordered registration of suo motu criminal writ petition. A bench also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra will initiate proceedings at 10.30 am on Tuesday.It is rare for SC to take suo motu cognisance of an issue that has already been taken serious note of by a jurisdictional high court.The very fact that the apex court has taken note of the incident indicates its intention to examine long-neglected systemic loopholes resulting in such incidents.While high court may still be permitted to carry on with the monitoring of the ongoing CBI investigations, SC is expected to take a pan-India call on the lack of safety of doctors and healthcare professionals, especially women, in hospitals. The bench headed by CJI is likely to seek responses from West Bengal and Union governments about addressing this issue.It may also decide to implead all states and Union Territories as parties to the case if it were to lay down a pan-India safety guideline.Another factor which may have forced SC to take up the case was the Aug 14 midnight vandalism at the Kolkata hospital that was allegedly aimed at foiling a planned rally by doctors and students in solidarity with simultaneous “reclaim the night” marches across the city. The mob targeted patients, staff, medical equipment and hospital property. Nurses, security guards, and even visitors were traumatised by threats given by the mob. Subsequently, high court rapped state government for its inability to provide security to medical and healthcare professionals and staff at the hospital.Interestingly, an SC bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Sanjay Karol and Sanjay Kumar had dismissed a writ petition filed by Delhi Medical Association and Dr Satyajit Borah last month seeking adequate security for medical and healthcare professionals citing numerous incidents of violent attacks on doctors by irate relatives of patients.Justice Khanna-led bench told senior advocate Vijay Hansaria that the SC cannot direct the government to bring in a legislation in this regard. Observing that anybody who indulges in violence can be dealt with under the penal code, the bench had said that the only question is the implementation of the law.",CJI D Y Chandrachud ordered registration of suo motu criminal writ petition.

They were either subjected to forced religious conversion or sought refuge in India. Don't they have the right to live as per their religion? If they can't live with respect in the neighbouring country and seek refuge in our country, what should we do? We can't sit as silent spectators.This is Modi government, you will get justice,"" Shah asserted.The event marked the granting of citizenship certificates to 188 Hindu refugees who had come from Pakistan before Dec 31, 2014.

""Those who sought refuge in India were denied citizenship from 1947 to 2014,"" Shah said. ""They (refugees) weren't just tortured in neighbouring countries for being Hindu, Jain, Buddhist and Sikh, but also in our country as lakhs and crores of people longed for justice for three generations.""He said while intruders were made citizens illegally in the past, those who followed the law and applied for citizenship were denied.

The intense heatwave, exacerbated by the El Nino phenomenon, caused temperatures to soar to 44°C in May and June, leading to stunted growth and reduced fruit weight, according to officials of the horticulture department , Udham Singh Nagar .Dragon fruit, a perennial cactus known for its medicinal properties, requires a warm climate with an annual rainfall of at least 50 cm, and temperatures ranging from 20-36°C for optimal growth. However, farmers said that excessive heat this year resulted in a significant decrease in fruit size, with most dragon fruits weighing between just 6-150 grams, much lower than the expected 250-600 grams. Consequently, they have been unable to generate profits from their crops.Yatin Singhal, a farmer from Kashipur who has been cultivating dragon fruit for the past four years and encountered similar challenges with his crop, said, “This season, about 80% of the fruits weighed only 6-150 grams. Only 20% managed to reach 200-250 grams.”Prabhakar Singh, chief horticulture officer of Udham Singh Nagar, said, “The extreme heat during El Nino affected the production of dragon fruit, leading to insufficient growth and reduced weight.

The ED describes the assets as proceeds of crime (POC) from a loan fraud in which ₹4,000 crore were allegedly diverted from a PSU bank .The fraud amount goes beyond Rs 11,300 crore if the interest is added.The financial assets seized include shares of listed companies, mutual funds, and fixed deposits, apart from Rs 55 lakh in cash, according to a press release shared by the ED.Cases have been booked against Jayaswal's sons, Abhijeet and Abhishekh, too.The probe revealed that the company not only used a web of 250 shell companies but also 20 charitable organisations for money laundering . The action was taken following a raid on the company's premises in Nagpur, Kolkata, and Vishakapattanam on Tuesday and Wednesday.Jayaswal headed the Abhijeet Group of companies, which was among the biggest beneficiaries of the UPA regime's controversial coal block allocation scheme. Abhijeet Group was also ranked among the country's top bank defaulters. The companies were sitting on huge debt, which ultimately turned into NPAs. CPL was one of the entities that had borrowed from Union Bank but ended up in a default. Known for his flamboyant lifestyle, Jayawal had also purchased a private jet which is now grounded at the Nagpur airport after a loan default.The CBI had registered a case against the CPL promoters for manipulating the project cost and other financial statements to avail loans. The loan amount was later diverted to purposes other than stated, leading to a loss of Rs 4,000 crore to Union Bank, says the press release. With interest, the amount comes to Rs 11,379 crore. Apart from CPL, two more bank frauds worth Rs 136 crore and Rs 180 crore were committed through two more group companies - Corporate Ispat Alloys Limited (CIAL) and Abhijeet Integrated Steel Limited (AISL) respectively, said the release.The ED investigation also revealed that the company's promoters had colluded and engaged in booking fictitious transactions in the company's books of accounts as well as those of its related entities. The search revealed that the Abhijeet Group had created a web of 250 shell companies, which were used for layering, integration, and utilisation of the proceeds of crime. The shell companies were also used to introduce share premium in the accounts and inflate the balance sheet. The fudging of accounts helped the company avail fresh bank loans.A network of 20 charitable institutions was identified, which were used as conduits for the proceeds of crime. The funds were also parked in immovable properties, apart from shares and mutual funds, the release said.Jayaswal shot into the limelight over a decade ago after the coal allocation scam came to the fore. The Abhijeet Group had been allotted a number of coal blocks. For CPL, the company had plans to set up a power plant at Latehar in Jharkhand. However, the Abhijeet Group began defaulting in repaying loans after the plans of CPL and other companies were held up after the coal blocks were wrested back from the beneficiaries.

Manu:

What have you been eating since returning from Paris?

Jaspal:

What do you crave for?

Abhi tak toh ghar gayi nahi hu. Mummy ke hath ka khana nahi khaya hai maine

Abhi jaate hi I will be like ki give me a aalo ka parantha

'VOWED THAT MY DAUGHTER WOULD MAKE HISTORY'

""No, no, wait, wait."" Manu Bhaker stops Jaspal Rana in mid-sentence. It is normal, the interruption. No one minds really. If anything, it sums up best the relationship between the two, oscillating between the once ugly - after the debacle in Tokyo three years ago - to the good-natured banter that marked the double bronze high of Paris this past fortnight.Jaspal is, if you like, the Bela Karolyi to Manu's Nadia Comaneci. Sometimes father figure, most times back-slapping pal, full-time coach. Yet, this time when Manu interrupts him, she has something to say that is her own mind, not just a coaching mantra, however well-meant.Manu Bhaker didn't need to pick up a gun. Her easy, natural charm is disarming enough. Because when she talks, we are literally eating out of her hand, hanging on to every word, eager to find some elbow room in their private jokes. But with this interruption, Manu Bhaker, is thoughtful, perceptive, telling us how picking up the gun can bring about change in patriarchal and conservative mindsets in native Haryana, and much of India.""I think one event can bring about some change, but if you want to see bigger change, it has to be persistent,"" said the double Olympic bronze winner, somewhere fully aware that her own life has changed with that one last pull of the hair-trigger at the Chateauroux Shooting Centre, some 300km south of Paris, where they fed a goat tethered nearby each day back from the range, just to beat off boredom.""It takes a lot of time to see significant changes in society. Although we have seen over a period of time how India has changed, we need something to be very persistent in the society and only then we'll be able to see significant changes,"" she held forth, as everyone in the crowded hall nodded.Manu Bhaker didn't need to pick up a gun. But now that she has, we, a nation, are eternally thankful.I did not get to see the newspapers at all. But this is so heartwarming. It feels so good. I mean almost the entire page is dedicated to me. Thank you so much for this.When we are in the field of play, it's all about nervousness. So, performance was good although silver was possible. The journey from Tokyo to here has been full of ups and downs. Training and preparation were very good but there was a lot of nervousness on match day.She doesn't know anything about my days. This generation is ahead in terms of information and technology. They are way ahead of the 1990s and 2000s. Now everything is on the computer.I know (blushes). I didn't know whose it was, but now it's mine. I got it in Jan 2022. Now, only when people tell me that I have the tattoo, then I'm like, 'Oh, I have that tattoo!'After Tokyo Olympics, I was trying to move on, but it was getting difficult with each passing day. So, I was like, 'You know what? I'll get a tattoo'. The tattoo reminded me that I had to move on. I really love this tattoo and whenever people remind me of it, it just clicks in my head.Tokyo indeed taught me many things. Other than luck, I think it's just that how you build yourself during the training days, how you train, in what conditions you are able to sustain yourself. Of course, how you are as a human being also matters a lot. Olympics is about the day.There will always be controversy. It's about how you think. We also had a lot of difficulties. We also have a lot of problems, but we did not bypass them. We went through it. I knew that I would not be allowed in the Olympics to sit behind her. So, we started training for it. In all the trials, I was sitting at the back. Sometimes the problem makes you stronger.I think that was a long time back.I do have books with me. I always have something or the other to read. We are not allowed to carry phones. During flights and traveling, if I'm not sleeping, then I'll probably read or eat. So that's that. I really like Usain Bolt's book ('Faster Than Lightning'). But during the Olympics, we had a hectic training programme. It was like if you gave me 10 minutes, I would have probably fallen asleep.We went to meet the ambassador, and she got the Gita from there also. I think maybe some limited edition.He was talking about the book, and he was like, this is such a good book. I was like, 'are you gifting it to me?' Books will always be with me. And I mean flowers will last for hours or 2-3 days. But books always stay.Yes, I am a big music listener. Even if I'm driving, I need music. Otherwise, I won't be able to drive with patience. Same goes with the sports. Music calms me down.It depends how I want to feel. Sometimes I play emotional music and sad music like 'Maula mere lele meri jaan.' If I want to feel sad, then I'll feel sad and play sad music.If I feel sad about something, I will solve it. I will cry over it, I will solve it and then I'll put it in the past. I do not like to carry it with me for future events or in daily life.There's no time for this. Like the first medal, there were too many interviews and all. Next morning she had to be on the range by 7.I think this time around we put in equal amount of effort in all three events. We were training for 10m, we were training for mixed doubles, and training for 25m equally well. The workouts, the meditation and everything. I was always aware that I'll be shooting in three events.If you see her scores, I'm happier with the third event (25 metre pistol where she missed the bronze). It's about the day, the day decides.I'll give you an example. If you are writing an exam, you have to be very well prepared and you have to manage the time also. You practice that. And it's like you have to practice to be able to stand for a longer period of time. You have to practice to sustain for a longer period of time. Because in a sport such as shooting, we do not have major injuries, but we do have minor injuries. And minor injuries can affect your career badly. There was a scapula injury I was struggling with last year. And then we have elbow, knees, lower back injuries. We also have neck injuries. To maintain our posture and to be able to deliver for a longer period of time, you have to be fit.You need more strength to stand in one place for two hours than walking for two hours. They need to stand still till the last shot. So, you can imagine the kind of fitness they need.Physical health also affects your mental health. And I really believe that if you're physically fit, you will probably be more confident and feel mentally more stable.She has been a fighter. She had to struggle with many things. And even despite her previous journeys in the Olympics, she did not give up. She is not a kind of person who will give up on anything. I do not know the technicalities of those situations, the protests and the current situation. I do not know the deeper version of it. But to me, I have huge respect for her. She's been like an elder sister to me. It's the spirit that she carries that 'I'll fight, I'll fight till the end'. I go by that.I think many people did stand up. It also depends on person to person if they want to be engaged in something. We have back-to-back competitions and there's something happening in our lives also. I do not have phones with me. I do not carry anything. I do not get time to read newspapers and all. If something is going on, I'll be the last person to know.Earlier, sports was a kind of taboo, but I see that changing. Many parents are supportive of their daughters and their careers. But we have a long way to go. We cannot be like, 'Okay, one, two, three… parents are allowing their girls, and we have made a change.' Yes, there is a change, but we need to go even further.It's completely what she wants, and I have to mould myself around that - the training, the technique she has. It's her technique. I just work around her technique. Even my shopping style has changed because of her shopping. I spend more time in the ladies' section because she stays in the gent's floor for about five minutes. We need to protect them; we need to take care of a lot of things.(Laughs) What will I do in the gents section?It's a matter of practice. I shot 10-15 years without gear. But when you want to get better, you need these (equipment). Manu never used shooting glasses but I forced her to do it. We try to get the best technology because you are up against the best players. Every now and then somebody comes up and shoots without anything and becomes a winner and goes home a hero. But the point is when you fight, you need to be prepared.I'm aware. There were comparisons between the Korean shooter and the Turkish shooter, but that's how it is. The Turkish shooter is a natural. He is 52 and has had a long career. Every person has a style of shooting. Some people use caps, some use glasses, some earphones. Some use everything, some nothing. It's just a matter of how you get used to equipment. Earlier, like 30 years back, I don't know if shooters had access to this kind of technology.In 25m, they shoot with firearms, and gunpowder comes out. So, fire protection is required. You need to have earmuffs because after 50 you don't want to go deaf. We need every little protection provided.Plus 10m (air pistol event) doesn't require much protection.We have practiced every situation in training, everything that can happen during our matches. The atmosphere is different everywhere. During the trials before Paris, it was very quiet. We had no music. In international tournaments, sometimes the music is so loud or totally quiet.It's all in the mind. Your training talks during high-pressure situations. You have to work for it. Two months before the Olympics, we started training at exactly the same time of the qualification stage, the finals.It's not secret. If you are not able to see what people are doing, then it's a secret. Just like in journalism, you have to keep your eyes open.I read the (Bhagavad) Gita, usually. My physical fitness definitely helps me to be on my toes as well as be mentally fit. If anything bothers me, I talk to my mom, my dad, my brother. Even to (Jaspal) sir. I write journals. Meditate before bedtime. I read Gita before sleeping, it just stays with me. I have been reading the Gita since the last 7-8 years. Before that, my mother used to teach me, guide me, and keep mentioning the shlokas. For me, the ultimate one is focusing on your karma, not to think about the outcome.Yes, I've seen people not being happy with silver. But with a bronze they are kind of happy because they fought and they won. In the mixed team event, me and my partner Sarabjot actually fought for the medal. But yes, gold is gold, nothing like it.(Laughs) Yes, I see the headline here 'Manu misses silver' and then the report states 'Manu shot at 10.3, scored a 10.5'. So, there are very minor margins to win or to lose. In our sport, it's not him versus me or her versus me, it's more like how you as an individual are doing. That counts. Both medals are equally important. The second one was either you win third position or you lose. The first match was like, you have an opportunity to win the gold too. My scores were very good; however, I missed the silver by 0.1, the gold was also missed.It will be different, there will be the weight of expectation.That's fine. That's natural because that's what we train for. So, we will give our best and do better than this time.We have to push a little harder. With more pressure, there should be more effort. Experiment-wise, though, I don't think too much experimentation will succeed.The Tokyo chapter is an experience and will always be there with me. The experience will be there.What happened in Tokyo? (laughs)Yes, absolutely.Even I can, I will be 53, 52 (like Dikec) during the next Olympics.All of them shot brilliantly. If you see the skeet event, mixed team, Arjun Babuta, Sarabjot - all reached the final. So, we have several talented shooters. It's only about protecting them. How do we protect them? I think the authorities have to work on it… SAI, the federation, government, TOPS, everybody has to start working on it. Protecting a talent is a task.There will be a lean time for every sportsperson. It's during that time that you need to look after them. There is no talent protection in our country. Saurabh Chaudhary, you remember the name? What was Saurabh Chaudhary 's score in Tokyo? He was outstanding in Tokyo, just didn't win a medal. What did we do to protect him? Nothing.I mean, few songs of hers, yes, but it's like more like Karan Aujla, Diljit Dosanjh, Arijit Singh for me. And then the 1990s (looking at Jaspal).I take around like 2 hours in the gym every day. Every day, like five times a week. Or if my matches are going on, I'll work out every day. And the workout would be like, depending on the matches and all. So I will do my warm-up, then I'll do my rehab. Rehab for all the muscles and everything for injury prevention. Then I'll strengthen those small muscles for long-term injury prevention. And then I'll do the strengthening and then the cool down.She gave up the sugar two days back.Kal hi ice-cream khayi thi (I had ice-cream yesterday), samosas and all.But she's honest that way, that she doesn't cheat on exercise, training, eating and all.(I haven't been home yet, haven't eaten meals cooked by my mummy).""I always asked God for a daughter, and I vowed that if I had one, I would ensure she would do something that would go down in history,"" Manu's mother, Sumedha Bhaker told TOI. Manu's father, Ram Kishan, recounted that Manu was always a natural sportsperson. ""One day she'd be boxing, one day she'd be into karate. She used to be playing something or the other all the time."" Was it difficult to encourage their daughter's sporting interests in a conservative environment, TOI asked.""When Manu was still very young, I did the karva chauth fast. That day, I made my husband put his hand on my head and swear that he would let me move to a city with the children if we needed to. Whenever I did a fast, as a gift I always asked for something that would help the children,"" said Sumedha. ""I was determined to fulfill my vow.""She certainly did, and India owes her a debt of gratitude.","Manu Bhaker and coach Jaspal Rana tell TOI what it took to win a double. Bhaker: ""Shooting is not considered as a physical sport. How much emphasis do you put in physical fitness?"" Rana: ""It's a lot more give-and-take between the coach and the athlete""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112580375,imgsize-193600,width-400,resizemode-4/112580375.jpg"

Bangladesh: Dozens Of Hasina's Party Members Chased & Killed In Mob Attacks; 29 Bodies Found

Heavy rains in Brazil have led to a remarkable paleontological discovery that will astound one and all: a 233 million-year-old dinosaur fossil . This significant find was made in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , near the town of São João do Polêsine. The fossil, which is almost fully preserved, was unearthed next to a reservoir after torrential rains eroded parts of the fossil site.The dinosaur, believed to be a member of the Herrerasauridae family , roamed the Earth during the Triassic Period when all the continents were part of a single landmass known as Pangea, also often referred to as a ""super continent"".Herrerasaurids were among the earliest carnivorous dinosaurs, and this particular specimen is estimated to have been about 2.5 meters (8 feet) long. The discovery was made by a team led by Rodrigo Temp Müller , a paleontologist from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM).The site where the fossil was found has been a focus of paleontological research for about 20 years. The region is known for its rich deposits of Triassic fossils, which have provided valuable insights into the early evolution of dinosaurs . The recent heavy rains accelerated the erosion process, exposing the fossil that had been buried for millions of years. According to Müller, the fossil was initially thought to be just a few isolated bones, but further excavation revealed an almost complete skeleton.This discovery is particularly significant because it is one of the oldest dinosaur fossils ever found. The oldest known dinosaur fossils date back to around 231 million years ago, making this find potentially one of the earliest examples of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s excellent preservation allows scientists to study its anatomical details, which could provide new insights into the characteristics and behaviors of early dinosaurs. Truly an exciting find!The Herrerasauridae family, to which this dinosaur belongs, includes some of the first known carnivorous dinosaurs. These dinosaurs were bipedal, much like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, meaning they walked on two legs, and had free hands with sharp claws for catching prey. The newly discovered fossil is expected to shed light on the evolutionary adaptations that allowed these early dinosaurs to thrive in their environment.The discovery has generated excitement in the scientific community, as it could help fill gaps in our understanding of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s advanced age and preservation make it a unique and valuable addition to the fossil record, offering a rare glimpse into the past. Researchers are now working to carefully extract the fossil from the surrounding rock and conduct detailed analyses to determine whether it represents a new species of dinosaur.The region where the fossil was found has been subject to increasingly severe weather events, including the heavy rains that led to this discovery. In June 2024, the state of Rio Grande do Sul experienced three months’ worth of rain within just two weeks, causing widespread flooding and displacing over 500,000 people. While the rains have accelerated the erosion process, they also pose a threat to newly exposed fossils, which can be damaged or destroyed if not promptly rescued.The Federal University of Santa Maria and other research institutions are now focused on preserving the fossil and conducting further studies. The findings from this discovery are expected to be published in scientific journals, contributing to our knowledge of early dinosaur evolution and the conditions that shaped their development.For the unversed, dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago. They were some of the most successful and varied animals ever to have lived, ranging from the small, bird-like Velociraptor to the gigantic, long-necked Brachiosaurus. Paleontologists study dinosaur fossils to learn about their behavior, diet, and appearance. Fossilized bones, teeth, footprints, and even eggs have been found, offering insights into these ancient creatures. There were over 1,000 different species of dinosaurs identified so far, ranging from the plant-eating sauropods to the fierce carnivorous theropods, showcasing their incredible diversity.Did you like this article?

On August 14, 2024, Pradeepa Arvind (40), Arvind Mani (45), and their daughter Andril Arvind (17) perished in a two-car collision that occurred six miles from Lampasas , according to reports from the Austin American-Statesman.The accident, which happened at 5:45 am local time, involved a wreck six miles north of US 281 in Lampasas County. A Department of Public Safety (DPS) trooper confirmed on Friday that all five victims have been identified.The victims included Arvind Mani, his wife Pradeepa, and their daughter Andril, all from Leander, Texas. The sole surviving immediate family member, 14-year-old Adiryan, was not in the car at the time of the accident.A GoFundMe fundraiser, titled ""Support for Adiryan Arvind : A Tragic Loss and a Young Life to Rebuild,"" has been set up by family friend Rajaraman Venkatachalam to support the teenager during this difficult time. The fundraiser mentions that Arvind and Pradeepa were a loving couple with two children, Andril and Adiryan.The GoFundMe page noted: “Adiryan who just started 9th grade today, was unable to join them on the trip, and now he is left without his family. This young boy, with so many dreams and aspirations, needs our help for funeral, legal, and ongoing care including educational expenses. This will help him to navigate the difficult road ahead along with his uncle’s family living in Austin. We are reaching out to friends, family, and the wider community for support during this incredibly challenging time. Any contribution, no matter how small, will go a long way in helping Adiryan secure a brighter future.”It added: “Arvind & Pradeepa was a stalwart in the community and an integral part of our Austin Indian community. Please share this campaign with your network and let's support their son & the family during this difficult time. Rest in peace, dear Arvind, Pradeepa & Adril.

In a letter to the school community, the Rouse High School principal expressed deep sorrow at the loss of Andril, describing the tragedy as one that has impacted many in the community.According to the DPS report, the family was on their way to the university campus when the accident occurred. Arvind and Pradeepa had left their son behind because he had just started the 9th grade that day.The crash also claimed the lives of two other individuals from Copperas Cove: 31-year-old Jacinto Gudino Duran and 23-year-old Yosilu Gasman Martinez. Duran, who was driving south on US 281 in a 2004 Cadillac CTS, lost control after a rear tire blew out, causing the vehicle to veer into oncoming traffic and collide with the Arvind family’s 2024 Kia Telluride. Witnesses reported that Duran's vehicle was speeding before the collision.The impact of the crash was severe, with both vehicles sustaining extensive damage. The Kia caught fire after the collision, and there were no survivors from either car. DPS trooper Bryan Washko described the crash as one of the worst he had seen in his 26-year career, noting that the collision was akin to ""driving into a concrete wall at 170 mph.""","A tragic car accident in Central Texas claimed the lives of five individuals, including an Indian-origin family of three.

Power substation at Gurgaon's Basai treatment plant to be installed by next summer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/power-substation-at-gurgaons-basai-treatment-plant-to-be-installed-by-next-summer/articleshow/112616404.cms,"Basai treatment plant (File Photo)

GURGAON: After nearly a decade of bureaucratic hurdles and delayed execution, work on the long-awaited 66 kV substation at the Basai water treatment plant (WTP) is finally making progress as GMDA is now racing to complete the project before next summer to address the chronic power supply issues that have plagued the plant for years.Allotted in May last year, with a budget of Rs 23.4 crore, the project is likely miss its 18-month deadline.The Basai WTP, which can treat 270 MLD of water, currently depends on the Daultabad and Sector 10A feeders. These feeders frequently trip, suffer cable damage, and break down, especially during summer when water demand peaks. From April to June this year, the plant experienced nearly 50 hours of power outages, with disruptions lasting from a few seconds to over four and a half hours.An official from division 2, responsible for water management, explained, ""Unreliable power severely disrupts plant operations. Restarting machinery after a power trip can lead to a loss of up to 1 MLD of water supply. Prolonged outages result in even longer supply disruptions, particularly affecting areas at the tail end of the network.""The plan for a dedicated substation at Basai was first conceived in 2014 under the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA). The GMDA took over water distribution responsibilities in 2018 but only allotted the work for the substation in May last year. The project is likely to miss the original deadline, but officials said it is now in fast-track mode.""Multiple departments, including the irrigation department and HVPNL, were involved in finalising the route for the electrical infrastructure. We are now working on a war footing to ensure the substation is ready before the summer of 2025. Civil work has started, and equipment orders are in process. Once commissioned, this substation will provide a dedicated power supply to the Basai WTP, reducing its reliance on the existing feeders and ensuring uninterrupted operations,"" an official from the GMDA's electrical wing stated.Earlier in June, the state govt approved a new filtration unit at Chandu Budhera WTP and a separate water works at Basai, aiming to increase the capacity of each plant by 100 MLD at an estimated cost of Rs 325 crore.","The Basai WTP, which can treat 270 MLD of water, currently depends on the Daultabad and Sector 10A feeders.

Of the two accused, Kalpesh Sevak created the fake portal while his accomplice, Amol Patel, posed as a Mhada officer, police said.The official site of Mhada is http://mhada.gov.in , whereas the fake one is mhada.org “The fraudsters took an unsuspecting applicant to a Mhada apartment in Goregaon and told him that its price was Rs 30 lakh. They made him pay the amount online on the fake site. At least four people have fallen victim to the fraud,” said a Mhada official. The structure of the home page, address, and front page of the fake website is similar to the official Mhada website. However, the fake site provides an option of direct payment without the application process.A cyber police officer said they had received a complaint from Mhada about the fake website created by scammers to dupe people applying for the housing lottery scheme.The housing board recently announced the release of 2,030 flats in various projects in Mumbai.","Two men arrested by the Cyber Police for making a fake portal of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) The official site of Mhada is http://mhada.gov.in, whereas the fake one is mHada.org.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112611536,imgsize-956075,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112611536.jpg"
"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
