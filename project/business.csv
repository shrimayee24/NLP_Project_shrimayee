Myanmar man

NEW DELHI: A Myanmar citizen, who was caught by the Assam Rifles in 2012 while crossing the international border and served six months' imprisonment under the Foreigners Act, has continued to languish in jail and a detention centre in Manipur without being deported. The Supreme Court has now decided to examine his plea for release and has sought a response from the Centre.The foreign national , who filed the petition through his advocate Gautam Jha, told the apex court that his identity had been verified by the Myanmarese authorities which was duly informed to their counterparts here. However, despite this he has been kept in the detention centre without being given any reason.He also informed the court that he was recognised and accepted as a refugee for resettlement to Canada by the High Commission of Canada in New Delhi under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in 2021, and he could go there if released from detention.Observing that if the Canadian govt has no problem in taking him then why should the Centre object to it, a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan sought the Indian govt 's response.""The perusal of page 76 of the writ petition would reveal that the High Commission of Canada has accepted the present petitioner as a refugee for resettlement to Canada. We request Aishwarya Bhati, Additional Solicitor General, to take instructions as to what is the impediment for permitting the petitioner being sent to Canada, when the High Commission of Canada has approved the same,"" the court said.The petitioner Abdul Rashid , suspected as Bangladeshi national, was arrested in Feb 2012 while crossing the border and criminal proceedings were initiated against him under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act. The trial court convicted him and sentenced him to six months in jail which he had already undergone at the time of conviction.However, he continued to remain in Manipur jail . In Dec 2012, the state govt furnished his details to the ministry of external affairs for his deportation. As his deportation remained in limbo, the chief judicial magistrate had in Oct 2014 requested the state to expedite the deportation and verify the nationality of the petitioner with Myanmarese authorities after noting that his incarceration was beyond his term of imprisonment.With no progress in his case, Rashid approached Manipur High Court which had on Oct 24, 2016 directed that he be shifted out of jail and kept in a detention centre. As per the petitioner, Myanmarese authorities in 2022 verified his identity and told so to the Indian govt but he was still kept in detention centre for no reason disclosed to him.""The rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 21 and 22 are available to all persons who may or may not be citizens. The case of the petitioner must be treated at par with any other citizens in India. The law enforcement agencies should have ensured - legality, proportionality, and necessity for such unlawful detention. Insufficient guarantees in law to protect against arbitrary detention could call into question legal validity of any detention,"" he said.","A Myanmar citizen, who was caught by the Assam Rifles in 2012 while crossing the international border, has continued to languish in jail and a detention centre in Manipur.

NEW DELHI/PUNE: The central govt has sacked controversial IAS probationer Puja Manorama Khedkar from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), just over a month after the UPSC cancelled her provisional candidature for Civil Services Examination 2022 (CSE) for fraudulently availing of exam attempts more than the permissible limit by faking her identity.Rule 12 of the IAS (Probation) Rules, 1954, allows the central govt to discharge an IAS probationer, after holding a summary enquiry, if it is satisfied that the probationer was ineligible for recruitment to the service or is unsuitable for being a member of the service.""Vide order dated 6th September, 2024 the Central Government discharges Ms Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar , IAS Probationer (MH:2023), from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) under Rule 12 of IAS (Probation) Rules, 1954, with immediate effect,"" sources in the department of personnel and training (DoPT) informed TOI on Saturday.On July 31, the UPSC had cancelled Khedkar's candidature for CSE 2022, based on which she had been recommended to the IAS, on the ground that she had exceeded the nine CSE attempts permissible in her category - OBC and person with benchmark disability (PwBD) - by faking her identity. It had also permanently debarred her from all future examinations or selections of UPSC.As per findings of the single-member committee set up by DoPT on July 11 to probe the complaint referred to it by Maharashtra govt, particularly allegations that she may have misrepresented her caste and disability status, as well as UPSC's own inquiry, Khedkar had exhausted her maximum permissible attempts at CSE (nine for OBC and PwBD category) between 2012 And 2020 itself.It was concluded that Khedkar was ineligible to be a candidate for CSE-2022, which was the year of her selection and appointment to the lAS. Therefore, she was also ineligible to be recruited to the Indian Administrative Service, said an officer.TOI made repeated attempts to call Puja Khedkar and her father Dilip Khedkar, a retired senior Maharashtra govt officer, on Saturday to seek their comments on the development but their phones were switched off. Messages sent to them on the phone evoked no response till the time of going to press.Khedkar was served a show-cause notice on July 18 based on the findings and a criminal case filed against her for having forged her identity papers and misrepresenting facts to obtain extra attempts at CSE. After she failed to file her response despite an extended deadline till July 30, UPSC on July 31 announced its decision to cancel her candidature for CSE-2022 and also debarred her from appearing for any future selections or examinations conducted by it.The final nail in the coffin came on Friday, with the Centre sacking her from IAS with immediate effect for being ineligible for recruitment to the service.Khedkar's alleged lies as a CSE applicant about her as well as her parents' credentials, had recently led UPSC to prescribe Aadhaar authentication, though voluntary, of candidates appearing for all its examinations.As regards the complaints relating to the submission of false certificates (specifically OBC & PwBD categories) are concerned, the UPSC had clarified that it does only a preliminary scrutiny of the certificates viz. whether it was issued by the competent authority, the year to which the certificate pertains, issuing date of the certificate, whether there is any overwriting on the certificate, format of the certificate etc. Generally, the certificate is taken as genuine, if it has been issued by the competent authority, it had claimed.",Puja Manorama Khedkar has been sacked from the Indian Administrative Service.

But a tad arduous process of getting the exemption has raised eyebrows.A senior public works department official said a self-declaration proforma will have to be downloaded from the state govt's website, filled and pasted on thick, black paper.This will then have to be taped on the FasTag sticker outside the vehicle so that the RFID reader skips it. To err on the side of caution, motorists have been advised to tape black paper behind the FasTag sticker, too. Some officials acknowledged that with even these precautions, motorists could still be charged. ""If a FasTag sticker gets read and the toll gets deducted, one can make a cashback request through the FasTag bank account, following which the amount will be refunded,"" said a senior MSRDC official.The toll exemption directive covers all entry points of Mumbai (Vashi, Airoli, Mulund, LBS and Dahisar), barring Bandra-Worli Sea Link, NH-48 (Mumbai-Bengaluru), NH-66 (Mumbai-Goa), and other PWD and MSRDC roads. It applies to Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses as well, said a govt resolution (GR) issued on Wednesday, which said the move is targeted at devotees travelling during Ganesh festival.

Doctor: Healthcare workers in India are more susceptible to TB than general population: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/healthcare-workers-in-india-are-more-susceptible-to-tb-than-general-population-study/articleshow/113153898.cms,"High-risk roles in healthcare

Contributing factors

Call for immediate action

Systemic changes needed

NEW DELHI: A recent study has highlighted the critical occupational risks faced by healthcare workers (HCWs) in India, particularly with tuberculosis (TB).The study found that the prevalence of TB among HCWs is significantly higher than in the general population, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced protective measures and systemic improvements in healthcare facilities.The analysis, titled ""Prevalence of Tuberculosis Among Healthcare Workers in India: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"" is a collaborative effort by Dr. Ravindra Nath from Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad, and a team of medical experts from VMMC and Safdarjung Hospital, and Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar Medical College, Delhi.It reviews data from 10 separate studies conducted between 2004 and 2023, revealing an average of 2,391.6 TB cases per 100,000 healthcare workers—far exceeding the 300 cases per 100,000 in the general population.TB, an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains a pressing public health issue globally, with India accounting for about one-quarter of the world’s TB cases.The study emphasises that healthcare workers are especially vulnerable to contracting TB due to their constant exposure to infected patients, particularly in environments with multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of TB.The study identified that certain healthcare roles are at particularly high risk. Laboratory technicians had the highest TB prevalence at 6,468.31 cases per 100,000, followed by nurses (2,726.83 per 100,000) and doctors (2,006.18 per 100,000). These figures underscore the occupational hazards that healthcare workers routinely face, often with inadequate protection.Inadequate ventilation, poor air circulation in hospitals, and inconsistent use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as N95 masks, were highlighted as major factors contributing to the spread of TB among HCWs. Many healthcare facilities lack proper infection control measures, and despite high exposure to the disease, healthcare workers are not consistently using protective gear in high-risk areas.Moreover, HCWs’ frequent exposure to MDR and XDR TB strains complicates treatment and elevates their occupational risks. These drug-resistant strains make it harder to manage and prevent the spread of TB within healthcare settings.The authors of the study call for immediate reforms to protect healthcare workers. Recommendations include routine TB screening for HCWs, especially for those in high-risk positions, the consistent use of PPE, and investments in better ventilation systems and isolation rooms to reduce airborne transmission. The study also emphasises the need for ongoing training programs to raise awareness about TB risks and preventive practices in healthcare settings.In addition to physical protective measures, the study stresses the importance of supporting the overall well-being of healthcare workers, including providing access to mental health services, adequate nutrition, and stress management resources to mitigate their vulnerability to TB.The study advocates for national guidelines that mandate routine TB screening and infection control training for healthcare workers. Such guidelines should prioritise high-risk groups, including medical trainees and staff working in departments with high exposure to TB.Significant investment in healthcare infrastructure is also needed to create safer working environments for those on the front lines.As India aims to eliminate TB by 2025, the authors stress that safeguarding healthcare workers is crucial to reaching this goal. ""Protecting our healthcare workers is essential to achieving TB elimination. These findings highlight the urgent need to protect the 'saviours' who risk their lives to care for others,"" said Dr. Jugal Kishore , Director of the Department of Community Medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.This study serves as a stark reminder of the occupational risks healthcare workers face and the collective responsibility to address these systemic vulnerabilities for the health and safety of both HCWs and the wider population.","Tuberculosis (TB) is a pressing public health issue globally, with India accounting for about one-quarter of the world’s TB cases.

Physiotherapy is a boon for patients with osteoporosis

• Physiotherapy plays a critical role in managing osteoporosis, offering tailored exercises that focus on building strength and improving balance. Rather than shying away from movements due to fear of fractures, patients can enhance overall mobility. The physiotherapist will assess each patient's risks before designing a personalized program. • Physiotherapy is often recommended to osteoporosis patients to prevent bone thinning reduce bone loss and promote bone growth and development. It will also help to maintain proper body posture to avoid spine fracture, enhance balance and mobility, strengthen muscles to reduce the risk of falling, and manage pain. Hence, one will be able to do the daily activities with ease. One will also be required to adjust the home environment by using hand bars at home. Remove rugs or carpets from the home to reduce the risk of falls, fractures, and injuries. • The physiotherapist will understand your specific needs and treat you accordingly by monitoring your physical movements, ensuring that you are not over-exercising or under-exercising. Avoid high-impact activities that stress the bones and can lead to fractures. • The exercises that will be recommended to osteoporosis patients are strength training, climbing stairs slowly, dancing, and walking. The focus should also be on stability and balance exercises and resistance training. It is imperative to exercise under the guidance of a fitness trainer. Maintain the correct form while exercising to avoid injuries.

Physiotherapy

’s role in prevention and management

(Author: Dr. Seema Grover, senior consultant (physiotherapy and rehabilitation), Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, Delhi)

Back pain, particularly lower back pain, has reached epidemic levels in the modern workforce, with over 65% of the working population in India reporting some form of back discomfort. The problem is compounded by the nature of sedentary work , prolonged sitting, and poor ergonomic practices, with India’s working-age population being particularly vulnerable.Studies show that nearly 80% of workers in sedentary office jobs experience some form of musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) during their career, with lower back pain being the most prevalent complaint. Additionally, employees do not take sufficient breaks, which further intensifies spinal pressure and muscle stiffness. Maintaining static postures for more than 6 hours a day doubles the risk of developing lower back pain.In addition to physical risk factors, the psychological stresses of modern work life also contribute to the rising prevalence of back pain. Chronic work-related stress and demanding workloads cause sustained muscle tension, particularly in the neck and upper back regions. Psychological stress increases the perception of pain, leading to a cyclical problem where stress amplifies back pain and vice versa. This mind-body interaction is often underappreciated in clinical assessments, but it plays a critical role in the persistence of pain. Introducing mindful activities, such as deep breathing exercises or short meditation breaks during the workday, can help alleviate some of this tension and reduce stress-related back pain.Another overlooked contributor to back pain is the impact of inadequate sleep. Altered sleep patterns, often caused by stress and long working hours, can prevent the body from adequately repairing itself. Insufficient sleep increases inflammation and impairs muscle recovery, exacerbating musculoskeletal issues like back pain. A poor sleep environment, such as an unsupportive mattress, can further compound spinal discomfort. Ensuring quality sleep by maintaining a consistent routine, using proper bedding, and incorporating relaxation techniques before bedtime can greatly improve spinal health.The sedentary nature of modern work life, coupled with unhealthy lifestyle habits, adds to the burden. Physical inactivity, poor diet, and inadequate hydration significantly impact spinal health. In India, where a large number of working adults are classified as having insufficient physical activity, these factors contribute to the weakening of core muscles that support the spine, making individuals more prone to injury. Smoking, another significant modifiable risk factor, has been shown to reduce oxygen flow to spinal structures, hastening degeneration and exacerbating pain.Physiotherapy remains one of the most effective and clinically proven interventions to prevent and manage back pain. Early intervention with targeted physiotherapy can reduce the risk of developing chronic back pain. This involves educating individuals on proper posture, recommending ergonomic adjustments at the workplace, and designing personalized exercise regimens aimed at strengthening the core muscles that support the spine. For workers already suffering from back pain, a structured rehabilitation program focusing on spinal mobility, flexibility, and core strengthening can provide significant relief.As the demands of modern work life continue to rise, the prevalence of back pain will remain a significant challenge unless proactive measures are taken. Incorporating mindful activities during the day, maintaining good sleep hygiene, and utilizing physiotherapy offer holistic and clinically effective approaches to both prevention and management. With simple lifestyle changes, proper posture, and good ergonomic advice, back pain can be kept at bay, promoting a healthier and more productive workforce.","Nearly 80% of workers in sedentary office jobs experience some form of musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) during their career. Physical inactivity, poor diet, and inadequate hydration significantly impact spinal health. Smoking, another significant modifiable risk factor, has been shown to reduce oxygen flow to spinal structures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113152160,imgsize-720442,width-400,resizemode-4/113152160.jpg"
"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

MUMBAI: Canada’s Express Entry draws that offer permanent residency to those selected are back with a bang after a considerable hiatus. In May 2024, there were just two draws and only one in the following month. Since then, the periodicity of the draws has picked up, as was the earlier norm. However, there is a marked shift with ‘General’ category rounds conspicuous by their absence.The writing was on the wall – way back in March, Canada’s immigration minister, Marc Miller had said, “…As part of our efforts for temporary residents to transition to permanent residency, we will have more domestic draws for us and ask provinces and territories taking part in the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) to do the same with their allocations.”In other words, it was clear that going forward the focus would be on PNP draws and Canadian Experience Class (CEC) draws which are for skilled workers who have Canadian work experience and want to become permanent residents - typically such individuals are already residing in Canada.An analysis of the draws in July and August clearly reflects this. The main reason was to reduce an additional inflow of new immigrants and thus mitigate the pressure on health care and housing.Express Entry is a system used by the Canadian government to manage applications from skilled and qualified workers for permanent residence (PR) through three economic immigration programs. These are the Federal Skilled Worker Program, Canadian Experience Class (CEC) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program.Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the country’s immigration agency, on its website explains the different types of draws that are held throughout the year.In each draw, aspiring candidates are ranked relative to each other based on a score under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). Those who meet the cut-off score are sent an invitation to apply and become permanent residents. A permanent residency is akin to a green card in the USA and offers a future path to Canadian citizenship.The CRS score is divided into two sections. The core score can reach a maximum of 600 points and is based on the candidate’s age, education, official language proficiency, work experience etc. Second, a maximum of 600 points are awarded to the candidates if they meet policy or other objectives such as: having a provincial nomination, a qualifying offer of arranged employment, Canadian educational credentials, French-language proficiency or a sibling in Canada.Candidates that receive an invitation to apply have 60 days to either decline the invitation or submit an online application for permanent residence to IRCC. After a due process, applicants and their accompanying family members become permanent residents.Here is an analysis of the draws held during the past two months.Immigration experts point out that the cut off scores, except for category based draws be it - French proficiency draws or occupation-related draws, continue to remain high (above 500 points). Recently, IRCC also announced a pilot that offers a direct pathway to permanent residency to Francophone (French speaking) students.Those already in Canada now appear to have a better chance to become permanent residents under the Express Entry mechanism.","Canada’s Express Entry draws that offer permanent residency to those selected are back with a bang after a considerable hiatus.

The world of billionaires offers a sharp contrast. Many of the youngest billionaires inherited their wealth from their parents, whereas older generations frequently established their fortunes through their own efforts. Nonetheless, a few young billionaires have conquered the obstacles of entrepreneurship and innovation. Their success tales are characterised by perseverance, resilience, and the ability to seize opportunities.Regardless of how they become wealthy, today's young billionaires are not only constructing empires, but also shaping the future. Their tales show that with passion and determination, dreams can become reality.Let's examine the world's top 10 youngest billionaires and how they earned their incredible fortunes.Clemente Del Vecchio is the second youngest billionaire on the list. He inherited a 12.5% stake in the Luxembourg-based holding company Delfin from his late father, Leonardo Del Vecchio, who was the chairman of EssilorLuxottica until his death in 2022.

'Misguided approach': Telegram CEO Pavel Durov issues first statement after arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/misguided-approach-telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-issues-first-statement-after-arrest-says-telegram-not-anarchic-paradise/articleshow/113105719.cms,"Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has issued his first statement following his recent arrest at Le Bourget Airport near Paris. Durov described the accusations against him as a “misguided approach,” asserting that Telegram is not the “anarchic paradise” some have portrayed.""Using laws from the pre-smartphone era to charge a CEO with crimes committed by third parties on the platform he manages is a misguided approach,"" Durov said in a post on Telegram.Durov, a Russian-born entrepreneur and founder of the messaging app Telegram, was detained on August 24, 2024, upon arriving in France. The arrest came amid an investigation by French authorities into Telegram’s alleged lack of content moderation , which they claim has facilitated criminal activities on the platform. French media outlets reported that Durov was held for questioning, raising concerns about whether he could be held personally responsible for illegal content posted by users.In his statement, Durov expressed surprise at the arrest, citing several reasons. He noted that Telegram has an official representative in the EU who handles legal requests, and that French authorities had multiple ways to contact him directly. Durov highlighted his previous cooperation with French officials, including helping establish a hotline for terrorism-related issues.""As a platform, you want your processes to be consistent globally, while also ensuring they are not abused in countries with weak rule of law. We’ve been committed to engaging with regulators to find the right balance,"" he saidDurov criticized the notion that a CEO should be held accountable for third-party misuse of their platform. He pointed out that Telegram has a history of resisting government demands that conflict with its principles, such as blocking channels in Russia and Iran.""When Russia demanded we hand over “encryption keys” to enable surveillance, we refused — and Telegram got banned in Russia. When Iran demanded we block channels of peaceful protesters, we refused — and Telegram got banned in Iran,"" the statement read.Despite acknowledging that Telegram is not without flaws, Durov refuted claims that the platform is a haven for lawlessness. He stressed that Telegram actively moderates harmful content, publishes transparency reports, and maintains direct communication channels with NGOs for urgent issues. Durov said that the rapid growth in Telegram’s user base to 950 million has presented new challenges.","Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has issued his first statement following his recent arrest at Le Bourget Airport near Paris.

Boeing Starliner returns: Capsule that took Sunita Williams to ISS lands successfully without astronauts onboard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boeings-starliner-heads-back-home-without-any-astronauts-onboard/articleshow/113141292.cms,"Boeing 's Starliner capsule on Saturday landed in New Mexico's White Sands Missile Range after a period of uncertainty about its safety. The two NASA test pilots, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will remain at the space station until next year.The Starliner capsule, operating on autopilot, parachuted into the desert six hours after leaving the International Space Station .It undocked 260 miles (420 kilometers) over China, with springs gently pushing it away from the orbiting laboratory.Cameras on space station and later Nasa plane captured the descending capsule appearing as a white streak.""She's on her way home,"" astronaut Suni Williams radioed after Starliner exited.Williams and Wilmore were supposed to fly Starliner back to Earth in June, a week after launching in it. However, thruster failures and helium leaks compromised their ride to the space station.Nasa then decided it was too risky for them to return on Starliner, which led to the fully automated capsule departing with empty seats and blue spacesuits, along with some old station equipment. SpaceX will bring the duo back in late February, extending their original eight-day mission to more than eight months.A minute after separating from the space station, Starliner's thrusters could be seen firing as the white, blue-trimmed capsule slowly backed away. Nasa Mission Control called it a 'perfect' departure.Following the undocking, flight controllers planned additional test firings of the capsule's thrusters.Engineers believe that the more the thrusters are fired, the hotter they become, causing the protective seals to swell and obstruct the flow of propellant. Unfortunately, they won't be able to examine any of the parts, as the section containing the thrusters will be discarded just before reentry.Starliner will be transported back to Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center for analysis. “We will review the data and determine the next steps for the program,” said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi.Starliner's propulsion system experienced a small helium leak following the June 5 launch, which was initially thought to be isolated. However, four additional leaks emerged after liftoff, and five thrusters failed. Although four of the thrusters were recovered, Nasa expressed concern about potential malfunctions that could hinder the capsule's descent from orbit.Over the summer, Boeing conducted extensive thruster tests both in space and on the ground, and was confident that Starliner could safely return Wilmore and Williams to Earth. However, NASA had a different opinion and decided to go with SpaceX instead.As experienced astronauts and retired Navy captains, Wilmore and Williams anticipated challenges on the test flight. They have kept busy in space, assisting with repairs and experiments. The two are now full-time station crew members, joining the seven others on board.Boeing's first astronaut flight marks the end of a journey filled with delays and setbacks. After the space shuttles retired more than a decade ago, Nasa contracted Boeing and SpaceX for orbital taxi service. Boeing encountered numerous problems on its first uncrewed test flight in 2019, requiring a repeat mission. The 2022 do-over revealed even more flaws, with the repair bill exceeding $1 billion.Steve Stich, Nasa's commercial crew program manager, stated earlier this week that teams have been so focused on Starliner's return that they haven't had time to consider what's next for Boeing. He said that Nasa remains committed to having two competing US companies transporting astronauts.“We are excited to have Starliner home safely. This was an important test flight for NASA in setting us up for future missions with Boeing,"" said Stich.","Boeing's Starliner capsule landed in New Mexico's White Sands Missile Range after a period of uncertainty about its safety.

Among the infected, 24 people have been hospitalized, though no deaths have been reported.The CDC warns that the actual number of cases may be higher as many individuals recover without seeking medical attention or being tested. Additionally, there may be delays in reporting recent cases.The eggs linked to the outbreak were distributed in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan, and are labeled under ""Milo’s Poultry Farms"" or ""Tony’s Fresh Market."" Milo's Poultry Farms has voluntarily recalled all eggs from their farm. Retailers and foodservice distributors are being urged to remove these eggs from their shelves and to cease selling them.Tony’s Fresh Market is cooperating with the recall. Marisa Kutansky, a spokesperson for Heritage Grocers Group, emphasized the store’s commitment to customer safety and stated that affected products have been removed from their shelves.The CDC and FDA are continuing their investigation to determine the full extent of the outbreak and to prevent further cases.Salmonella infection typically causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Symptoms usually appear between six hours and six days after exposure and can last from four to seven days. Most people recover without specific treatment, but severe cases may require hospitalization. If you experience these symptoms and have consumed the recalled eggs, it is advised to contact a healthcare provider.","65 people across nine states have been infected with salmonella, with illnesses reported from May 23 to August 10.

The discovery could potentially offer a drastic boost to the nation's economy, according to a Pakistani senior security official quoted by DawnNewsTV.The official explained that the survey has successfully identified the location of the reserves, and relevant government bodies have been informed.These resources, located in the depths of Pakistani waters, represent a critical step towards capitalising what the official referred to as the "" blue water economy .""While this discovery could lead to a major boost for Pakistan’s energy sector, the process of exploration is still in its early stages.The work of digging wells and actually getting oil out could take several years. The official also talked about the potential of the blue water economy, pointing out that valuable minerals and elements could be extracted from the ocean, providing additional economic benefits for Pakistan.Estimates suggest that this discovery could be among the world’s largest oil and gas reserves , potentially placing Pakistan as the holder of the fourth-largest deposit globally.Venezuela currently leads in terms of oil reserves, with approximately 3.4 billion barrels, followed by countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Canada, and Iraq. The US is also notable for holding the most significant untapped shale oil reserves.In an interview with DawnNewsTV, Muhammad Arif, a former member of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) said that while the discovery is a positive development, there is no guarantee the reserves will be as large or easily recoverable as initially hoped.He said, ""If this is a gas reserve, it can replace LNG imports and if these are oil reserves, we can substitute imported oil.""The significant financial investment needed to explore offshore oil and gas reserves, estimating the cost at around $5 billion just for exploration, further claimed Arif.","A significant deposit of petroleum and natural gas has been discovered within Pakistan's territorial waters.
