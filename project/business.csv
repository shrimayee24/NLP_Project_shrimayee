NEW DELHI: India is favourably considering an invitation by the Maldives for PM Narendra Modi to visit the strategically important Indian Ocean country in July, ToI has learnt. This follows a strong reiteration of President Mohamed Muizzu’s 2024 invitation to Modi by Maldives foreign minister Abdulla Khaleel during his visit to India last week.While it’s too early to talk about the programme or agenda, It’s learnt that one of the dates being considered for Modi’s visit to the archipelago is July 26, the Maldives Independence Day. If it happens, it will be the first visit by Modi to the country since Muizzu assumed office in November 2023.Khaleel was in India last week for the third time this year, signaling an intent on the part of the Maldives to deepen ties with India amid concerns both here and in the West about its ties with China. Along with his counterpart S Jaishankar, Khaleel reviewed bilateral cooperation in a range of areas including the development partnership, defence and security and trade and investment. Jaishankar said after the meeting that India remained committed to Maldives’ progress and development and also thanked him for the solidarity with India on the issue of terrorism.Muizzu has continued to strongly maintain that the Maldives will not do anything to hurt India’s security interests and that his decision to force Indian military personnel out of the country was based purely on the Maldivian people’s desire for independence and non-interference in internal affairs.In an interview to Ceylon Today last week, the president said the Maldives will not allow its geographical location to be misused by any country for deliberate attempts that undermine the peace and stability in the Indian Ocean region. “Our approach will always be for regional peace and sovereignty, and fair diplomacy with everyone,’’ he said.India sees Maldives as a key maritime neighbour and an important partner in India’s Neighbourhood First policy and Vision MAHASAGAR (Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions). According to the Indian external affairs ministry, the visit was aimed at strengthening the Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership between the two countries. As Modi and Muizzu had said in a joint statement after the latter’s visit to India in October, 2024, this partnership will be people-centric, future-oriented and will act as an anchor of stability in the Indian Ocean Region. Among the big takeaways from that visit was a decision to initiate discussions on a Bilateral Free Trade Agreement focusing on trade in goods and services between the 2 countries.",India is favourably considering an invitation by the Maldives for PM Narendra Modi to visit the strategically important Indian Ocean country in July.

Cash-strapped Congress to revive crowdfunding at district level,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cash-strapped-congress-to-revive-crowdfunding-at-district-level/articleshow/121558876.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Just over a year after Income Tax notices forced it to discontinue its newly launched ""crowdfunding"" platform for resource mobilisation, Congress is set to reintroduce the novel programme with a nationwide focus down to the district level, which would complement its move to empower the organisation's bottom rung.Congress has finalised a revamped crowdfunding plan where donations would be invited at the district level. A page dedicated to every district will be opened on the official party website, and each resident can pick his district to contribute to the Congress kitty.It will be different from the ""donate for desh"" launched in December 2023 ahead of the 2024 parliamentary elections.After it was launched on December 18, 2023, the initiative created a splash as a first of its kind in the political sphere, and made bigger news as the principal opposition party's bid to overcome the funding skew created by the later-scrapped electoral bonds scheme that was viewed to favour the governing party. Congress got Rs 25 crore in one and half months, through 3 lakh donors. But the donation platform had to be paused abruptly in view of the IT notices to Congress, that saw the department take massive ""liens"" on its accounts, which threatened to funnel the money generated through crowdfunding into the govt kitty.Congress treasurer Ajay Maken recently gave a plan to district presidents on how the party proposes to generate funds at district level which can be used by local units for their functioning and programmes.According to the plan, the money generated in a district will be turned into a corpus fund, and Congress will provide a matching amount, and interest generated on the money will help finance organisational activities. Sources, however, said donations will be to AICC account only, as it alone is legally entitled to accept donations.This is in sync with the big Congress decision to empower the district units to bolster its grassroots strength amid dwindling political fortunes in the face of BJP’s continued dominance for a decade. As decided at the Ahmedabad AICC session in April, Congress has pledged to turn the district Congress units into the hubs of its organizational work, and also plans to vest real decision-making powers in them.According to strategists, crowdfunding helps in more ways than monetary. The small donors feel a stake in the party which increases their political commitment. Besides, the donations will be updated on the website in real time and also ready the workers’ database automatically.Under the Representation of People’s Act, money up to Rs 20,000 does not require a donor to present his PAN Card and only money above that sum is required to be disclosed to the Election Commission annually.","Congress has finalised a revamped crowdfunding plan where donations would be invited at the district level.

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India tells TOI, “Changes in the tax law in the past year and additional disclosure as well as other updates to the tax return form for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 have necessitated additional time for updating the technology for the tax department. This will entail revising the tax filing utility on the income tax portal as well. Hence, extending the deadline to file the income tax returns for FY 24-25 by almost one and a half months from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 is in line with the expectations. This extension aims to enhance the taxpayer experience by providing requisite time to file returns once the TDS credits are appropriately reflecting in taxpayers Form 26AS and AIS/ TIS following the submission of TDS statements by employers/ deductors of TDS due by May 31, 2025.“Nonetheless, it is in the taxpayers' best interest to file their returns as soon as the filing utility is made available to avoid additional interest costs where tax payments are due or to allow department time to process the returns at the earliest where refunds are due,” she adds.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.

The reason: India has so far not acceded to Dubai’s request for increasing the long-exhausted bilaterals or flying rights. As a result, airlines of both India and Dubai are operating the maximum possible flights under the current air service agreement (ASA), with no room to add services till the bilaterals are revised.“We’ve been stuck with 65,000 seats in each direction (Dubai-India and vice-versa) for just over 11 years now (during which period the demand for travel has grown exponentially). For every seat we sell, there are probably 10 takers. So I don’t see getting impacted by IndiGo and Air India expansion plans. In fact, there probably be a major relief valve for the pent up demand that has been in India for decades. Frankly, good luck to AI and IndiGo with getting airplanes at the pace they need,” Emirates Airlines president Tim Clark said Sunday in Delhi, where he is among the global aviation leaders attending the IATA AGM.Stressing the need for more bilaterals, he said: “Fifteen years ago, the population to Dubai was about 25 lakh. This is over 80 lakh. Dubai is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and 40% of the ethnic mix is of Indian origin. If you look at the way the Indian community has moved to and from Dubai over the last 10 or 11 years, you can see the scale of what is not happening by not giving seats to Emirates or wherever else it may be. The Indian government has a policy at the moment of restricting capacity of foreign carriers into India, and they have their own reasons for that.”Clark said he hopes “this will change when (India) realises the significance, the criticality of air transport as a wealth multiplier for their own economy. After all, it's been a it's been a catalyst for so many economies in the last 20-30 years,” he said.India is planning to have aviation hubs at its airports like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. “You have to have open access. We (Dubai) have got 80 lakh and we can make a hub out of it. So you have every opportunity on the planet to make a hub and make it very good with your 1.4 billion population. But if you have these sorts of restrictive practices (bilaterals), it doesn't make much sense when you look at the other aspects of Indian economy which are expanding,” he said.He said since the existing bilaterals have been exhausted, there is no possibility of Emirates starting flights to the upcoming airports in India like Navi Mumbai and Greater Noida.",Emirates does not see the huge transit business the mega carrier gets at its Dubai hub from flights to and from India getting impacted by the expansion of Air India.

Earlier, the PM had briefed cabinet ministers and had asked them to avoid making political commentary.Some time ago, Modi had advised his ministers to be thoroughly prepared before speaking on any issue in public and is said to have emphasised the importance of preparation by citing his own example, sharing that he meticulously reviews all details and prepares carefully before making any public address.Recently, some cabinet ministers were given a bunch of important articles published in newspapers and magazines on Operation Sindoor and its significance so that they get a full perspective of India’s all-out crackdown on terrorists and terrorism.

NEW DELHI: The government is evaluating the possibility of increasing the safeguard duty on steel to as much as 24%, from the current 12%, amid concerns that Chinese goods may enter the market and hurt Indian steelmakers.""We have received complaints of Chinese players trying to blunt the impact of the safeguard action by circumventing it. We are mulling over various options,"" a senior government official told TOI.In late April, the government had notified a provisional safeguard duty of 12% for 200 days, and a detailed investigation will be required before a higher duty is imposed.With Chinese goods facing levies and other actions in several markets, especially the US, there are widespread fears of trade diversion with India seen as one of the markets where these goods could be dumped or sold at subsidised prices.India, the world's second-largest crude steel producer, was also a net importer of finished steel for the second consecutive year in 2024-25. Imports are estimated to have neared the 10 million tonne mark.Small players have, however, been complaining about the adverse impact of the safeguard action as they have to deal with higher cost due to a price hike by domestic manufacturers after the safeguard action. The government will seek to strike a balance between the two sides, sources said.","The government is evaluating the possibility of increasing the safeguard duty on steel to as much as 24%, from the current 12%.

'Kamalesan's behaviour was against secular norms of Army'

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has upheld the 2017 termination of an Army officer who refused to participate in regimental weekly religious parades on the grounds that he belonged to the Christian faith.Samuel Kamalesan had challenged his dismissal without pension and gratuity, and sought reinstatement in service. In a May 30 order, a division bench of Justice Navin Chawla and Justice Shalinder Kaur said: ""Our armed forces comprise personnel of all religions, castes, creeds, regions and faiths, whose sole motto is to safeguard the country from external aggressions... They are united by their uniform rather than divided by their religion, caste or region. ""Kamalesan was commissioned in Army in March 2017 as a lieutenant in the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, which comprises three squadrons of Sikh, Jat and Rajput personnel. He was made the troop leader of Squadron B, which comprises Sikh personnel.In his plea, Kamalesan stated that his regiment maintained only a mandir and a gurdwara for its religious needs and parades, and not a sarv dharm sthal, which would serve persons of all faiths.He noted that there was no church on the premises.The bench observed that while regiments in the armed forces may historically bear names associated with religion or region, it does not undermine the secular ethos of the institution or of personnel posted in these regiments.""There are also war cries which, to an outsider, may sound religious in nature; however, they serve a purely motivational function, intended to foster solidarity and unity among the troops. At the same time, the armed forces also give due respect to the religious beliefs of their personnel,"" the bench noted.HC observed that Kamalesan kept his religion above a lawful command from his superior, which was clearly an act of indiscipline. ""While, to a civilian, it may appear harsh and even sound far-fetched, the standard of discipline required for the armed forces is different,"" it said.The bench stated the termination order specifically noted that Kamalesan's undisciplined behaviour was against all secular norms of Indian Army and adversely affected the traditional camaraderie between officers and troops of the regiment.Noting that Army organised several counselling sessions for Kamalesan, the court concluded that the decision of termination was taken after careful consideration of the specific circumstances of the case and potential consequences of different courses of action.","Samuel Kamalesan had challenged his dismissal without pension and gratuity.

Poll Do you believe the couple deserved a refund for their unused train tickets? Yes, they should be refunded No, it was their choice

BENGALURU: A senior citizen couple from Hoodi in Whitefield took on the railways and won after being denied refund for a train journey they never made, as their reserved coach was overcrowded and inaccessible, forcing them to return home. Bengaluru Urban II additional district consumer commission has pulled up South Western Railway (SWR) for deficiency in service and ordered a full refund along with litigation costs.The case, earlier dismissed by the forum on July 1, 2023, was challenged again by the couple at the state commission. The appeal was allowed, with the state commission setting aside the earlier order and directing the forum to readmit the complaint.The story began when Purna Ramakrishna and his wife Hymavathi booked sleeper class tickets on Guwahati Express for March 29, 2022, from Krishnarajapuram (KJM) Railway Station to Vijayawada on April 13, paying Rs 892.5 for the trip. On the day of the journey, after reaching the station by auto (spending Rs 165), the couple was shocked to find their S2 coach - and the entire train - packed with passengers, making it impossible for them to board.With no railway staff around to assist, they were forced to abandon the journey and return home.Despite several representations and email follow-ups, the railways neither refunded the ticket fare nor offered any explanation or compensation. Left with no option, the elderly couple filed a consumer complaint citing service lapses.In their complaint, they said they informed the railways post-departure and expected a ticket deposit receipt (TDR) to be raised. But no TDR was filed and no refund or compensation issued.However, the railways, in its defence, denied any service deficiency, claiming that the train was not overcrowded when it arrived at the station. In their written response, railway officials acknowledged their tickets, further stating the train was fully reserved and unreserved travel was restored across the division after Covid. Therefore, they argued, the couple's claims of overcrowding by unauthorised passengers were ""false and baseless"".The railways said 134 passengers boarded from KJM on April 13 with no overcrowding complaints - except the elderly couple. Officials noted the duo didn't report any issue to the station master or RPF on duty, and no crowding was flagged by staff on board.Calling the duo's decision not to board a personal choice, the railways denied any service lapse. It also cited refund rules, saying confirmed tickets are non-refundable unless cancelled or a TDR is filed four hours before departure.However, the railways' own letter dated May 6, 2022, had admitted a spike in ticketless travel and called for issuing unreserved tickets to curb revenue loss - a point the consumer forum said backed the couple's claim.Holding the railways responsible for the couple being unable to board the crowded train during its two-minute halt at 11.53 pm at KJM, the panel said internal records can't override on-ground realities. It ruled the couple faced financial loss and mental agony due to a clear deficiency in service, especially when the full fare was collected.In March this year, the consumer commission ordered the railways to refund Rs 892.5 and pay the complainants Rs 5,000 for deficiency of service, mental agony, and Rs 3000 as litigation costs.","Purna Ramakrishna and his wife Hymavathi booked sleeper class tickets on Guwahati Express for March 29, 2022, from Krishnarajapuram (KJM) Railway Station to Vijayawada on April 13.

KOLKATA: The era of ""appeasement politics"" in Bengal is over as BJP primes itself to form the next government in 2026 with the supportThe era of “appeasement politics” in Bengal is over as BJP primes itself to form the next government in 2026 with the support of its core Hindu constituency and women voters moving away from CM Mamata Banerjee ’s party, home minister Amit Shah said Sunday while echoing a sentiment ignited by PM Narendra Modi in north Bengal last week.“Bengal’s women won’t tolerate any insult to sindoor,” Shah declared at Kolkata’s Netaji Indoor Stadium.He said CM Mamata taking potshots at PM Modi amid India’s Operation Sindoor targeting terrorist sites in Pakistan indicated whose side she was on. “It would have been better if she were pained by Bengalis getting killed (in violence within Bengal). She didn’t utter a word then.”Shah alleged that the recent violence in Murshidabad linked to anti-waqf law protests was a “state-sponsored” riot. “The state government did not seek help from BSF despite repeated alerts from us. Finally, BSF intervened after the high court’s order. Trinamool netas were accusing BSF and encouraging the rioters…The CM opposed the waqf amendments. Who was she trying to protect?” The home minister said the next elections in Bengal were not only about Bengal’s future, but also national security.“Mamata Banerjee has opened the nation’s borders to Bangladeshis.She is allowing infiltration. We asked her for land to fence the gaps. She isn’t providing it so that infiltration continues, her vote bank keeps growing, and her nephew becomes the CM. But this is not going to happen,” he said.Shah said it was painful to see Bengal plumb the depths, first under Left Front’s governance, and now TMC “For years, Bengal led India in every field. But then came the communists, and after that, Mamata Didi took charge with the slogan of ‘Maa, Mati, Manush’. She has since turned this great land into the hub of infiltration, corruption, atrocities on women, bomb blasts and injustice against Hindus,” he said.“During elections and even after Didi’s victory, hundreds of BJP workers were brutally killed. Didi, how long will you hide them? Mark my words — your time is over.” Shah said under UPA, Bengal received Rs 2.09 lakh crore, whereas under Modi, it received Rs 8.27 lakh crore in 10 years. But the money was “looted by the TMC syndicate”, he said.“Even if Modiji sends Rs 50 lakh crore, it won’t reach the people unless BJP is in government here. To get Modiji’s benefits and homes, you must bring a BJP government in Bengal,” Shah told the crowd.He later inaugurated a Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in Rajarhat.","The era of ""appeasement politics"" in Bengal is over as BJP primes itself to form the next government in 2026.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court observed that a case in which the judgment was rendered by a foreign court, and was also sub judice in India, must be heard at length. The court of Additional Sessions Judge Sumit Dass made the observation on May 5 while hearing the submissions of Shravan Gupta, an accused in a money laundering case.Gupta was convicted by a court in Abu Dhabi last year for the same offences as charged by the Enforcement Directorate - fraud, deception, and embezzlement. Gupta and six others, including a private company, filed a revision petition against a magisterial court order of November 2024 in which the court issued them and others summons for the offences of fraud and cheating.Meanwhile, the court stayed proceedings in the matter until July 4, the next hearing date. The court also issued notice to the ED and the state to file a reply in the matter.The case is related to a complaint filed by Emaar India Limited against MGF Development Limited, Gupta and 11 others for large-scale fraud and siphoning of Rs 180 crore.In April, Gupta moved an application before the court, submitting that on February 27, 2024, a court in Abu Dhabi had convicted of the same offences as in the present case.

""We aim to achieve a Naxal-free Chhattisgarh by March 31, 2026."" The CM said his government plans to transform tribal-majority Bastar as well as the state through education, skilling, welfare projects, and inclusive policies.Government forces have penetrated deep into forested terrain long considered inaccessible, setting up security camps that now act as outposts of governance. These camps are enabling the spread of basic services and infrastructure in isolated tribal areas. The CM said these camps will remain as long as necessary.""Security has improved dramatically, there's a sharp decline in violence and 1,355 Maoists have surrendered,"" Sai said. ""Our surrender and rehabilitation policy has successfully reintegrated former Naxals, while initiatives like Niyad Nella Nar Yojana are promoting growth and stability in villages within a 10km radius of security camps.""Asked about public protests against blanket amnesty for hardcore Maoists, Sai struck a conciliatory tone.

NEW DELHI: Empanelment of hospitals under the Ayushman Bharat-PM Jan Arogya Yojana has dropped significantly, from an average of 316 per month in 2024 to 111 per month in 2025, as of April.Data shared by National Health Authority (NHA) on scheme's dashboard shows that 443 hospitals were empanelled under the AB-PMJAY across India in four months - 161 in Jan, 187 in Feb, 40 in March and 55 in April. In May, the latest update shows, 20 hospitals were empanelled.Many healthcare associations point out that low package rates and delayed payments are key reasons behind the lukewarm response to government schemes from the private sector, especially large corporate hospital chains.However, a senior official of NHA - the implementing agency of the AB-PMJAY - said empanelment is taking place and that some of the new empanelments may not have been updated as they were migrating to a new system.AB-PMJAY, which is available in all states/UTs, except West Bengal, offers treatment worth Rs 5 lakh and, in some cases, more, per family for treatment of nearly 2,000 procedures involving specialties, including medical oncology (cancer treatment), emergency care, orthopaedic and urology (kidney-related ailments).The CEO of a top hospital chain in Delhi, the latest state to join the scheme, told TOI that package rates offered for various procedures under the AB-PMJAY were lower than their input cost. ""We may join the scheme if the package rates are increased,"" he said.The Indian Medical Association has also stressed on the need to increase package rates to make treatment under the scheme more sustainable. ""The rates should be raised to at least CGHS level,"" said an IMA office-bearer.As many as 609 private hospitals have opted out of the scheme since 2018, minister of state for health Prataprao Jadhav said in a written response to a Parliament question in March.""The reasons for hospitals voluntarily opting out include empanelment only for Covid period, hospitals were closed or non-functional, changes in hospital entity, hospital relocated, ongoing reconstruction or renovation, unavailability of specialist doctors, voluntary withdrawal from scheme, package rates, opting out due to certain treatment packages reserved for public hospitals only (Chhattisgarh and Gujarat), and no referral from public hospitals (Karnataka),"" he added.",Empanelment of hospitals under the Ayushman Bharat-PM Jan Arogya Yojana has dropped.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season with a major dip in live storage at its two key dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on Indus - and the ""sudden decrease"" in Chenab river inflows due to regulation of water flow by India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.The situation may further aggravate this month during early kharif sowing and this is possibly what prompted Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif to raise concerns at a conference on glacier preservation in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, last week to draw global attention to India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty Latest estimates by Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA) show the country is already facing an overall shortage of 21% in water flow and around 50% in live storage of the two key dams which play a crucial role in providing water for irrigation in Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan and generating hydropower.Referring to its latest assessment of availability of water for summer sowing operations during May-Sept, the IRSA in its statement ""noted with concern"" that the ""sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortage in early kharif season"".It declared an overall shortage of 21% and advised dam authorities and irrigation supply monitoring agencies to use water from reservoirs judiciously, ""keeping in view the crisis created by Indian short supplies in Chenab river"".Though the situation may improve with monsoon rainfall in the catchment area, possibly by next month, Pakistan's farming operations will depend more on how India regulates the flow through limited infrastructure of its own reservoirs - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir.India has, so far, only flushed these reservoirs and made additional water storage available by clearing sediments. Besides, it also stopped sharing water flow data with Pakistan after putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam massacre.Publicly available information on live storage of Pakistan's critical reservoirs shows that Mangla dam is currently left with less than 50% of its fill level (2.7 million acre feet out of the total capacity of 5.9 MAF) whereas Tarbela dam's live storage is slightly over 50% (6 MFA) of its total capacity of 11.6 MFA.Officials here believe that since India is under no obligation to share water flow data with Pakistan after suspending the IWT, it would be difficult for the neighbouring country to even manage floods during the peak flow season once monsoon hits the catchment areas of the Indus river system as a large part of it falls within India.Farming operations in two provinces of Pakistan, Punjab and Sindh, fully depend on irrigation canals linked to the Indus river system, which gets almost its entire waters from the western rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. Though India has full rights on the waters of eastern rivers (Ravi, Sutlej and Beas) under the IWT, inadequate infrastructure to use the waters by the Indian side benefits Pakistan.India is permitted to construct water storage facilities on western rivers up to 3.6 MAF but has not been able to fully utilise this, making Pakistan a beneficiary by default.","Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season.

For the first time in 6 years, PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to be a part of the G7 summit that is being hosted this year by Canada June15-17. There’s no official invitation yet from Canada for the meeting in Alberta but Modi in all likelihood would not have travelled to the North American country in any case, especially when India still isn’t sure the new government in Ottawa will be more receptive to its concerns about the activities of Khalistan separatists.A Canadian G7 spokesperson didn’t confirm to TOI late on Sunday if Modi was going to be invited.Any eleventh-hour invitation is unlikely to be considered by India because of logistical constraints, likely efforts by the separatists to disrupt the visit and the strained bilateral ties that both Modi and his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney have committed to improve. A bilateral meeting on the margins could have provided an opportunity for the leaders to jointly reaffirm their commitment to rebuilding ties.Canada hasn’t officially announced the names of the guest leaders for the summit, which will see the heads of government of major world economies in attendance, but reports in the Canadian media say Ottawa has invited the leaders of Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Ukraine and Brazil. This will be the first time that he won’t be at the meeting of the economically most advanced group of nations since France invited him for the summit in 2019.His presence at the summit of what is also an informal grouping of like-minded democracies has been seen as a sign of India’s growing role in shaping up the global agenda and addressing transnational issues.The Sikh separatists last week called upon the Carney government to not invite the Indian PM, citing India’s alleged reluctance to cooperate in the investigations into the killing of separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau blamed the Indian government for the murder without backing up his claim, as Indian has repeatedly said, with any evidence. The diplomatic row that followed saw the relationship hitting an all-time low as both sides expelled each other’s diplomats for activities hostile to the host nation.Carney has so far not explicitly spoken on the Nijjar issue but, while talking about his plans to use trade to reset ties, has said that Canada is not responsible for the strain on the relationship with India. India is hoping that Carney will act more responsibly than Trudeau in his handling of the case and has said it is ready to work with Ottawa based on mutual trust and sensitivity. India wants Canada to ensure foolproof security for Indian diplomats and also crack down on extremists and secessionists indulging in anti-India activities.",PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to be a part of the G7 summit that is being hosted this year by Canada June15-17.

Bill Belichick’s buyout drops to $1M as June 1 arrives — is a surprise NFL return looming?







Bill Belichick’s unconventional offseason with the North Carolina Tar Heels just reached a critical turning point — and it has little to do with Xs and Os. June 1, 2025, is here, and with it comes a significant shift in the power dynamics between Belichick and UNC. The $10 million buyout in his contract has now shrunk to just $1 million, giving the legendary coach newfound leverage to walk away — no strings attached.This change, though buried in contractual fine print, was always the red flag skeptics pointed to when questioning Bill Belichick’s true commitment to Chapel Hill. While many downplayed the importance of this clause, its presence said more than any press conference ever could. If Belichick had truly envisioned himself building a long-term program in North Carolina, he could have simply asked the school to remove the clause. He didn’t.Now, with the reduced buyout officially in play, the dance between the Hall of Fame coach and his new college home just got a lot more complicated — and perhaps a little bit colder.What makes this entire situation even more volatile is the presence of 24-year-old Jordon Hudson, Belichick’s girlfriend and, as some have put it, his de facto brand manager.Their relationship has become tabloid fodder and locker-room curiosity all rolled into one — not least because of the visible influence she seems to wield over the stoic, famously private coach.Channing Crowder didn’t mince words when describing the couple:“She kind of coordinates and brand manages. She has her paws on the situation. It’s different . . . It was weird to be around Belichick and Jordon. . . . I don’t see Belichick in that light. But he just smiles and nods. . . . His old lady is different. . . . She lurks. It’s weird to know him as Coach Belichick running the entire organization as G.M., head coach, talent coordinator, all that stuff, and then to see this tiny, little 95-pound girl kind of — pretty much telling him what to do. ”That last line hit a nerve. Hard. The fallout was swift — an awkward apology from Ryan Clark and an edited version of the show where Crowder’s take was originally aired. But no amount of backpedaling could erase what was said. If anything, it confirmed the underlying tension many suspected: Hudson isn’t just Belichick’s partner — she’s part of the inner circle.Reports that Hudson was banned from UNC’s football facilities only poured fuel on the fire, even if the university denied such claims. Hudson herself clapped back at journalist Pablo Torre in a now-deleted social media post, suggesting the friction is real — and very personal.Belichick, who is no stranger to walking away before the first snap — just ask the New York Jets — now holds the cards. If he senses resistance, if Hudson feels slighted, or if the NFL suddenly calls with an irresistible offer, he can write a check and vanish. A $1 million exit fee is pocket change for a man who would be walking away from a $25 million deal.And let’s not forget: Belichick didn’t sign on at UNC during a hot hiring cycle. His phone wasn’t exactly ringing off the hook with NFL offers. But now, if circumstances change — or if Hudson decides it’s time — he has the power to act.Whether or not Belichick ever coaches a game in Tar Heel blue is no longer just a football question. It’s a story about control, influence, and legacy — and how quickly all of that can pivot when the right clause finally kicks in.Also Read: Travis Kelce startles Adam Sandler in first full ‘Happy Gilmore 2’ trailer as Netflix confirms star-studded sequel premieres July 25","The $10 million buyout in his contract has now shrunk to just $1 million.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has admitted that the country's key allies now expect strategic partnerships grounded in trade, innovation, and investment, not financial handouts.Addressing senior military officers in Quetta, Sharif declared the end of Pakistan’s reliance on foreign aid, saying key allies such including China, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, and the UAE, now expect equal partnerships based on trade and innovation.“They no longer expect us to go there with a begging bowl,” Sharif said, in a speech signaling a shift in Pakistan’s international posture. “China is the most time-tested friend of Pakistan.

US-China tech tensions 'escalate'



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly praised President Donald Trump while sharply criticising the Biden administration ’s export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, calling the policy 'a failure' that cost US companies billions. Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang blasts Biden-era AI chip export policy.

N Uttam Kumar Reddy: Telangana minister N Uttam Kumar Reddy demands transparency on ‘Rafale losses’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/uttam-demands-transparency-on-rafale-losses/articleshow/121540870.cms,"



HYDERABAD: Irrigation and civil supplies minister N Uttam Kumar Reddy on Saturday demanded full transparency from the Centre regarding the losses suffered during Operation Sindoor and the conflict between India and Pakistan, particularly the reported downing of Rafale fighter jets Addressing a media conference at AICC headquarters in New Delhi, Uttam, a former IAF fighter pilot himself, said: ""When Rahul Gandhi first raised questions on Rafales being shot down, he was accused of being anti-national. But today, General Anil Chauhan, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), has confirmed that Rafale aircraft were brought down.""He also cited Air Marshal Bharti, Director General Air Operations, who in the DGMO briefing had said: ""Losses are normal in combat. The objectives of the mission have been achieved and all pilots have come home."" Uttam emphasised that while the pilots returned safely, ""the aircraft have not returned to their bases,"" highlighting the need for transparency.He criticised the BJP govt for initially denying these losses and launching a campaign against Rahul Gandhi. ""Now that the CDS himself has spoken, the govt should stop the denials. We are proud of our armed forces, but transparency strengthens trust and helps us learn from every operation.How did the US President announce the ceasefire before the DGMOs of India and Pakistan? The govt of India has never clearly explained how this happened. ""He stressed the need for a serious reassessment of India's defence technology, pointing out that most of the firing during the four-day operation happened from within each country's international borders. ""Yet, we lost fighter aircraft. This requires a thorough review of our technological capabilities,"" he said. The BJP-led govt at the centre should act urgently on the concerns raised by the air force chief about delays in fighter aircraft supply, talent shortages, and the gap between sanctioned and operational squadrons in the armed forces.India's operational fighter squadrons were below the sanctioned strength of 42 squadrons. All three armed forces are short of manpower by over 10 percent. Given the live threats on both our borders (China and Pakistan), we should be going beyond the sanctioned strength. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) did not deliver the Tejas Mark-1A fighter jets on time as said by the Air Chief. This can prove to be a serious problem. The entire country and the govt of India must wake up to the reality to strengthen our armed forces considerably,"" Uttam said.Quoting the Air Chief Marshal directly, Uttam said: ""India has fallen behind China in defence technology and production although our training standards remain superior. This is of serious concern and urgent necessary corrective steps should be taken. The best minds are not joining the service in sufficient numbers, especially in operational and R&D wings. The govt should attract top talent.""Uttam reaffirmed his pride in the Indian armed forces while urging the govt to ensure they are equipped, supported, and respected with honesty and transparency. The govt must acknowledge what happened, learn lessons, and be accountable.

NEW DELHI: A man and his sister were found dead, suspected to have ended their lives by suicide, in their rented flat in north-east Delhi's Dilshad Garden on Sunday. Neighbours and family described the siblings as reclusive, rarely venturing out.The deceased were identified as Viresh Kumar and Preeti Tomar, who were residents of Baghpat. Both were MBA graduates. Viresh worked in the IT sector. The police are investigating possible motives, including financial difficulties and depression.Police received a PCR call around 8.21 am, and a team rushed to the spot, which was a flat on the ground floor in D Pocket, Dilshad Garden. ""The flat was found locked from inside, and on opening, the bodies of the two were found. They were tenants in the flat since 2021,"" deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) Prashant Priya Gautam said. They lived in a one room set, paying around Rs 1,4000 as rent.The crime and forensic teams went to the spot. The crime scene was videographed. The DCP said they had not found any foul play yet. The owner of the flat said the duo kept to themselves. ""They never interacted with anyone in the society, so most people didn't know much about them,"" the landlord said.He added that they were always paid the rent on time, except for the previous month. ""The last time I spoke to him was regarding the rent. He said his sister wasn't well, so I told him not to worry and to pay whenever he could,"" the landlord said.On Sunday morning, some neighbours smelled a strong odour. ""When we reached and checked, it was unbearable. That's when the police were called,"" he said.Police are in contact with the family of the deceased.Ashok Singh, a neighbour, described them as reclusive and lacking a social circle. ""I once went to invite them to my brother's wedding a few years ago, but they didn't even open the door,"" he said. He occasionally saw the sister cooking, but otherwise, the siblings kept to themselves.""The place where the incident took place was a LIG flat, and in the locality, more than 10 families live,"" he said. Their cousin, Vijay Tomar, shared that their father, who served in the army, passed away in 2011, followed by their mother in 2021 — both due to illness. The siblings moved from their native village in Baghpat to Delhi, initially living in Jhilmil Colony. ""We made an effort to reach out, but they never responded,"" he said.Tomar mentioned that both were academically gifted and held MBA degrees. ""I remember he was working at an IT company in 2020 but lost his job during the pandemic. I'm not sure if he found work afterward,"" he added.Family members tried to stay in touch, even inviting them to a wedding last year, but they declined. Relatives had also suggested matches for Preeti, but she said she wasn't interested, focusing instead on her studies. ""They cut themselves off from everyone.

There are global headwinds like renewed tariff concerns that will restrain a breakout rally. At the same time there are domestic tailwinds that will support the market at lower levels. President Trump’s 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium is a clear message that the tariff and trade scenario will continue to be uncertain and turbulent. This headwind will impact markets. On the domestic front the tailwinds are getting stronger with the latest Q4 GDP growth data coming at 7.4%, which is much better-than-expected.”“Trends in consumption expenditure and capital expenditure are promising. This along with low inflation and the expected continuation of the rate cutting policy provide the perfect setting for sustained economic growth in FY26.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Election Results 2025: Why AAP Lost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-election-results-2025-aap-lost-reasons-arvind-kejriwal-new-delhi-manish-sisodia-bjp-modi-incumbency-corruptio-sheesh-mahal-liquor-freebies-congress-rahul/articleshow/118023276.cms,"Here are 10 reasons behind AAP's defeat:



Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.

Elon Musk vs Cory Booker: A tale of two 'Nazi salutes',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-vs-cory-booker-a-tale-of-two-nazi-salutes/articleshow/121560682.cms,"The Outrage Exchange Rate



When Satire Becomes News



Final Salute







“If it looks like a Nazi salute and smells like a Nazi salute, but one guy’s a tech billionaire and the other is a Democrat senator, only one of them ends up being banned in Berlin.”Welcome to yet another episode of Who Gets Cancelled Today?—where the rules are made up, the outrage is algorithmic, and consistency is strictly optional.Let’s set the stage.In January 2025, at Donald Trump’s second inauguration—a carnival of CPAC cosplay, Mar-a-Lago loyalists, and Liberty University dropouts—Elon Musk stepped on stage, placed his hand over his heart, and extended his arm outward with the ceremonial stiffness of a Leni Riefenstahl extra. Reuters confirms the gesture and backlash.Germany, where the Nazi salute is criminalised when used in ideological contexts, responded with moral indigestion and political outrage. Politicians demanded travel bans. German media erupted. The New York Times ran grim explainer columns. MSNBC activated their ""Rise of Fascism"" chyron package. (No, seriously, they have one.)The Anti-Defamation League, bless their diplomatically exhausted souls, tried to de-escalate: they called it “an awkward gesture made in a moment of enthusiasm.” But that didn't stop former ADL director Abraham Foxman from calling it exactly what it looked like: a Nazi salute.BBC and Haaretz captured the range of reactions.Musk, predictably, memed through the chaos. He dismissed the outrage as “dirty tricks” and said the “‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.” His actual words on X/Twitter.Meanwhile, some far-right Telegram channels threw digital confetti.Fast forward to May 2025. Enter Senator Cory Booker—America’s favourite motivational speaker in a suit. At the California Democratic Convention, Booker made a gesture eerily similar: hand over heart, arm extended outward, open palm. Footage surfaced on social media.Cue: crickets.No Germany. No ADL. No CNN panels dissecting palm angles. No panicked Atlantic thinkpieces. Just a quick clarification from Booker’s spokesperson: “He was waving to the audience.” Case closed. Nothing to see here.Piers Morgan, ever the thundercloud of transatlantic outrage, noticed. He highlighted the double standard and triggered an X-storm.Elon the Meme Lord vs Cory the ChoirboyElon is the algorithm’s favourite villain: a ketamine-fuelled libertarian who co-signed Trump’s chaos and dropped $275 million to support the re-election campaign. He’s what happens when Reddit becomes sentient and buys a stake in SpaceX.So when Musk makes a vaguely Roman gesture? Of course it’s fascism. Throw in some AI-enhanced screenshots and a Daily Show segment, and suddenly it’s 1933 again.Cory Booker, on the other hand, is Progressive America’s wholesome avatar—the kind who quotes Rumi during climate speeches. His identical gesture? A heartwarming wave. If Elon had done it while holding a “Biden 2024” placard, Vox would’ve called it “a subversive reclaiming of classical Americana.”In this economy of curated outrage, Musk trades at Tesla volatility. Every blink is a Bitcoin crash. Booker? He’s a mutual fund of liberal goodwill. You’d need a Wagner soundtrack and SS cosplay before NPR considers it problematic.But here’s the rub: when the rules of moral outrage change depending on the party—or the palm—you can kiss public trust goodbye. Remember when the Left said “symbols matter”? Apparently not when it’s one of their own accidentally doing a salute straight out of Triumph of the Will: The Musical.There’s an old Dr Strangelove scene where the titular character can't stop his arm from flying up in a Nazi salute. That’s what this feels like. Except instead of satire, we now have real-life Democrats doing the salute, Republicans doing the same, and both sides frantically uploading context to cloud drives of morality.The media? Just a referee selectively enforcing the rules.So here’s your closing thought: if you’re going to raise your hand in American politics, make sure it’s the correct hand, with the correct party ID, at the correct convention—preferably surrounded by coastal elites and NPR donors. Otherwise, you might find yourself Photoshopped into history’s darkest moments and banned from Bavaria.Because in today’s reality-TV democracy, gestures are never just gestures. Unless, of course, they are.","Elon Musk and Cory Booker both performed the Nazi salute at Donald Trump's inauguration. Germany, where the salute is criminalised when used in ideological contexts, responded with moral indigestion and political outrage. But when the rules of moral outrage change depending on the party, you can kiss public trust goodbye.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121560727,imgsize-28588,width-400,resizemode-4/121560727.jpg"

A small plane carrying a 41-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl crashed into the Long Island Sound off the coast of Connecticut on Sunday morning, but both miraculously survived with only minor injuries, according to the New York Post.The six-seater Piper PA-32 went down near the Thimble Islands around 10.30 am, about ten minutes after taking off from Bridgeport.Before the crash, the pair made a desperate call for help and were directed to attempt an emergency landing at Tweed New Haven Airport. However, they were unable to make it in time.They were rescued when the Coast Guard Station New Haven sent a 45-foot response boat to the scene after the Sector Long Island Sound Command Center was alerted by the air traffic control tower that the aircraft had gone down.According to Branford fire department deputy chief Jason Karpovich, the initial emergency call was reported as a “boat taking on water” before a dispatcher realised it involved a sinking plane. Fire officials arrived at the crash site in a rescue boat roughly 25 minutes after the incident, by which time the aircraft was fully submerged.The Piper PA-32 is a single-engine plane built by Piper Aircraft. The cause of the crash remains under investigation by the FAA.",Piper PA-32 went down near the Thimble Islands around 10.30 am.

Why the Change Matters



The Bottom Line





In a sweeping administrative change, the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) has officially ended its role in issuing birth and death certificates. These vital registration services are now handled by Emirates Health Services (EHS) in the northern emirates, while Dubai and Abu Dhabi continue under their respective local health authorities.The transition was made quietly, with MoHAP removing all related service options from its website and discontinuing its WhatsApp-based application system. Residents are now required to navigate a decentralised process based on their emirate of residence.MoHAP has withdrawn from issuing birth and death certificates.Parents (of any nationality), legal guardians, or authorised delegates.Immediate family members or legally authorised persons.Certificates must be attested by the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and the embassy of the relevant foreign country.The UAE is continuing its trend of devolving administrative authority to regional bodies, particularly for citizen services. Emirates Health Services already manages most public healthcare in the northern emirates, making it a natural successor to MoHAP in handling life-event documentation.The next time you need a birth or death certificate in the UAE, MoHAP is no longer your go-to authority. Depending on where you live, you’ll be interacting with EHS, DHA, or DoH—with new procedures, slightly altered fees, and a greater push toward digital verification.While the transition might be procedural, it signals a larger shift in how civil documentation is administered across the UAE—more digital, more localised, and firmly tied to regional health systems.(Exchange rate used: 1 AED = ₹22.60)","Emirates Health Services (EHS) is responsible in Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah, and Fujairah.

Lives at risk: Trump cuts slash safety funds for nation’s most dangerous work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lives-at-risk-trump-cuts-slash-safety-funds-for-nations-most-dangerous-work/articleshow/121552673.cms,"



More than a dozen workplace safety training centres across the United States could be forced to close by the end of the summer, as sweeping job cuts at a key federal health agency take effect under the Trump administration’s cost-cutting drive.The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which supports training and research for some of the country’s most hazardous jobs, has lost nearly 90% of its workforce. Out of around 1,000 employees, only about 125 were left after job cuts on April 1, according to union data seen by Reuters.Although 300 employees were rehired in May, the team managing the 12 Centres for Agricultural Safety and Health, which support fishing, farming, and logging workers, was not part of this. Because of this, several centres are getting ready to close as their funding runs out.Training programmes run by groups like the Fishing Partnership Support Services (FPSS) and the Alaska Marine Safety Education Association face potential shutdowns by July or September. These programmes have provided critical hands-on safety training to thousands of workers, including how to handle fires, administer first aid, deploy life rafts, and use emergency radio equipment.Without these federally funded courses, experts warn that more workers will be at risk and the burden on rescue services could increase.“The return on investment of the government is huge,” said John Roberts, a retired Coast Guard officer and FPSS safety instructor. “If they give us this money to do this training, it’s going to lessen how much money has to be spent to rescue the untrained.”The US department of health and human services, which oversees NIOSH, said in a statement, “The work will continue. HHS supports America’s farmers, fishmen, and logging workers.” Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr defended the staff reductions in March, citing the need to streamline bureaucracy. NIOSH is now set to be absorbed into a new body called the Administration for a Healthy America.The decision comes despite the fact that fishing, farming and logging remain the deadliest industries in the US. Combined, they represent a small portion of the national workforce but recorded a fatal injury rate of 24.4 per 100,000 workers in 2023, seven times the national average.Many of the affected workers operate in remote locations where access to emergency medical care can be delayed by hours. Over the years, the NIOSH-backed centres have helped reduce those risks through safety research, direct education, and public health outreach.In 2024 alone, the Northeast Center for Occupational Health and Safety trained more than 5,600 workers. Other centres have introduced mobile health clinics, mental health support, and opioid overdose prevention in rural areas.But with grant funding set to expire between July and September, many of these initiatives are under threat. At the Southeastern Coastal Center for Agricultural Health and Safety in Florida, staff have already begun closing research programmes and worker outreach efforts.“We're shutting down the direct education to the workers, we're shutting down the research,” said director J Glenn Morris.Although some industry groups offer private training, the cost remains a barrier for many. Without continued federal support, safety experts fear that many vulnerable workers will lose access to life-saving resources.","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has lost nearly 90% of its workforce.

200 miles of sublime pain on a Hindu pilgrimage in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/200-miles-of-sublime-pain-on-a-hindu-pilgrimage-in-pakistan/articleshow/121544180.cms,"Pilgrims, arriving by bus, camp overnight on the desert plain in front of the Chandragup mud volcano during their journey to the Hinglaj Devi temple in the Balochistan Province of Pakistan, May 1, 2025. (NYT News Service)





HINGOL NATIONAL PARK, PAKISTAN: When Amar Faqira's 3-year-old son abruptly lost movement in his foot last year, doctors offered little hope.As panic gripped his family, Faqira made a vow - if the boy recovered, he would make a 200-mile pilgrimage through blistering plains and jagged terrain to the Hinglaj Devi temple, a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan. It is also where Pakistan's largest annual Hindu festival is held, usually in mid-April.When the child regained strength a year later, Faqira set off in late April on a seven-day walk to the temple, nestled deep in the rust-coloured mountains of the restive Balochistan . The goddess ""heard me and healed my son,"" Faqira said before the trek, as he gathered with friends and family in his neighbourhood in Karachi. ""Why shouldn't I fulfill my vow and endure a little pain?""Faqira and two companions, wearing saffron headscarves and carrying a ceremonial flag, joined thousands of others on the gruelling journey to Hinglaj Devi. Along a winding highway and sun-scorched desert paths, groups of resolute pilgrims - mostly men but also women and children - trudged beneath the unforgiving sky, in heat that reached 45Celsius. Some bore idols of the deity, and all chanted ""Jai Mata Di"" .The pilgrimage is an act of spiritual devotion as well as cultural preservation. Pakistan's Hindus number about 4.4 million and make up less than 2% of the country's population, which is more than 96% Muslim.Hindus are often treated as second-class citizens, systemically discriminated against in housing, jobs and access to govt welfare.For many, the pilgrimage to Hinglaj Devi is comparable in significance to the Haj in Islam, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation of faith. The yearning to make the journey is also strong among Hindus in India though it is very difficult for Indians to receive visas to travel to Pakistan. States bordering Pakistan have deep spiritual links to Hinglaj Devi that are rooted in traditions predating the Partition.For much of the 20th century, the Hinglaj Devi temple remained inaccessible. The pilgrimage gained momentum only in the 1990s. A transformative shift came in the early 2000s with the construction of the Makran Coastal Highway, which links the rest of Pakistan to the Chinese-operated Gwadar deep-sea port.The highway brought unprecedented access to the temple -- it became possible to make the bulk of the journey by vehicle, taking some of the sweat out of the endeavour. Still, thousands continue to make the journey by foot. They are considered the more spiritually devoted. ""The real pilgrimage is in the pain, the feeling,"" said Faqira on the fourth day of his trek.One of his two companions collapsed from heat exhaustion after walking nearly 70 miles and had to return home by bus. Faqira carried on, his feet blistered and bandaged. Each pilgrim walks with a personal vow.Minakshi, part of a group of women dressed in yellow and red, undertook the journey to ask the goddess for a son. Nearby, 60-year-old Raj Kumari was making her seventh pilgrimage, praying for her grandson's well-being. Also on the trek was a childless couple, married since 2018.Hinglaj Devi temple is one of the sites where the remains of Sati, goddess of marital devotion and longevity, fell to Earth after her self-immolation. For many of the faithful, the pilgrimage begins with a symbolic trek to a sacred mud volcano rising from the barren landscape near the Makran Coastal Highway. At the summit, devotees toss coconuts and rose petals into the bubbling crater to seek divine permission to proceed. Many also smear volcanic clay on their faces and bodies. The next stage takes pilgrims to the Hingol River for a ritual bath. From there, they continue 28 miles to the Hinglaj Devi temple, set within a natural cave.The complex houses four shrines, the most revered being the Nani Mandir. After reaching the shrines, devotees complete the pilgrimage with an arduous, hourslong trek across seven mountains, before returning to the temple to pray.","Hinglaj Devi temple is a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan.
