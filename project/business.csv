"EC halts appointment of Army Colonel as J&K SSP during MCC, seeks compliance report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-halts-appointment-of-army-colonel-as-jk-ssp-during-mcc-seeks-compliance-report/articleshow/113832849.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Monday stalled the appointment of an Army Colonel as the senior superintendent of police (SSP) in charge of training and special operations in J&K police, despite a restraint on transfer of all poll-related officers during the model code of conduct ( MCC ) period.Directing that the transfer of Vikrant Prasher of Indian Army's Para, High Altitude Warfare School, Gulmarg, as SSP be kept in abeyance with immediate effect and if already implemented, the status quo ante be restored, EC sought an explanation from the J&K chief secretary regarding the rationale for issuing the order without securing its prior clearance, as required under MCC.The chief secretary was asked to send a compliance report, along with the aforesaid explanation, to the EC by 11 am on Tuesday.The J&K administration had on September 27 appointed Col Prasher as SSP (Training) and Special (Ops) in J&K Police.Though this is perhaps the first time an Army officer has been posted as an SSP in J&K police, there has been a precedent of BSF officer Raja Aijaz Ali having headed the communications unit of J&K police. Also, there are precedents of Army officials having led Andhra Pradesh’s special anti-Naxal force Greyhounds, besides being drafted into special, expertise-based roles in West Bengal and Odisha police. “The expertise of military and para-military officers in roles like jungle warfare and mountain warfare is often used by the civilian police by taking in their senior officers and getting them to impart their skills to other police officers. Having an expert from the Army’s Para High Altitude Warfare School as an SSP in charge of training J&K police in mountain warfare will help them deal with terrorists that have recently made bases in the mountain tops of Jammu region,” said a senior J&K police officer told TOI.“When we can get foreign coaches to train our sportspersons, here we are only drafting the best officers from our own military and para-military forces, who closely work with us in counter-terror operations, to train the civilian police,” said the officer.In its letter sent to the J&K chief secretary on Monday, the EC had observed: “The model code of conduct is in force in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir and as such there is a ban on transfer of officers connected to election is in force. Without going into the rationale at this stage, process and urgency of posting of an Army officer as SSP in the civil side during the period of operation of MCC, the Commission hereby directs that order shall be kept in abeyance with immediate effect. If the order has already been implemented, the status quo prior to the issuance of the order must be restored immediately.”The J&K administration had on September 27 appointed Col Prasher as SSP (Training) and Special (Ops) in J&K Police.The third and conclusive phase of polling in the Union territory will be held on Tuesday. Counting for both J&K and Haryana, where polling is due on October 4, will be held on October 8.",The Election Commission on Monday stalled the appointment of an Army Colonel as the senior superintendent of police (SSP) in J&K police. This is despite a restraint on transfer of all poll-related officers during the model code of conduct ( MCC ) period. EC sought an explanation from the J &K chief secretary regarding the rationale for issuing the order without securing its prior clearance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113832846,imgsize-958554,width-400,resizemode-4/113832846.jpg"

NEW DELHI: France has submitted its final price offer to India for the purchase of 26 Rafale Marine jets . This comes ahead of Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval 's visit to France. Defense sources told ANI that the French side has provided a significant price reduction after tough negotiations.India and France are in talks to buy the jets for deployment on the INS Vikrant aircraft carrier and various bases.A French team was in India last week to finalise discussions. The deal is expected to be discussed during the India-France Strategic Dialogue, where the Indian NSA is set to meet his French counterparts starting tomorrow in Paris.This deal is crucial for the Indian Navy as it aims to enhance its maritime strike capability. India has approved modifications in the letter of request, including integrating the indigenous Uttam radar in the jets. Although integration may take about eight years and be costly, it has been a point of negotiation.India had also requested France to integrate indigenous weapons on the plane, including the Astra beyond visual range missiles and the Rudram anti-radiation missiles. The deal's price is based on previous agreements, such as the rate of inflation, and the past deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets for the Indian Air Force.The Indian side will also receive a larger number of long-range air-to-air Meteor missiles and anti-ship weaponry in this project, which is planned to be concluded before the end of this financial year. Some of the Indian Air Force requirements have also been incorporated in the naval deal, including around 40 drop tanks and a small number of work stations for the planes.","India and France are in talks to buy the jets for deployment on the INS Vikrant aircraft carrier and various bases.

'Implementing Congress directive important but ... ': Himachal minister Vikramaditya cites his 'responsibility' to explain vendor nameplate diktat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/implementing-congress-directive-important-but-himachal-minister-vikramaditya-cites-his-responsibility-to-explain-vendor-nameplate-diktat/articleshow/113821324.cms,"Vikramaditya Singh

NEW DELHI: Himachal Pradesh Congress minister Vikramaditya Singh , who was at the centre of a controversy over his diktat for mandatory use of nameplates by eateries in the state on the lines of Uttar Pradesh, on Monday reiterated his commitment to the Congress ideology but also asserted that protecting the interest of people of Himachal was as important as implementing the directives of the party high command.Vikramaditya strongly denied reports that he was summoned by the party high command over the issue and said he met Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and party general secretary K C Venugopal during a prescheduled visit to the national capital.The PWD and urban development minister invoked his father late Virbhadra Singh to justify his stand and reiterated why registration of vendors was important. ""I cleared my position and told the party leadership that I stand with them like a rock and their directives will be followed. But I also told them that protecting the interest of 70 lakh people of Himachal Pradesh is also my duty and responsibility. My father was chief minister for 6 terms and he could achieve this feat because he strongly raised the voice of Himachal. Just like implementing the directives of the party leadership is important, ensuring the interests of the state is equally important,"" the Congress minister said. His remarks seemed to suggest that the two objectives were at variance to each other despite a Congress government in the state.""The question is only about registration of vendors keeping in mind the internal security situation and respecting the issues and sentiments of the locals. The move is to ensure that the food served is clean and there is no adulteration of any kind, to ensure that law and order is maintained and if some one is up to any mischief he can be identified and dealt with by the authorities. It is unfortunate that this was given a communal colur and was linked with the policies of any other state. The issues of Himachal Pradesh are different,"" Vikramaditya Singh said justifying his announcement which led to a huge row.Interestingly, Pratibha Singh, who is the state BJP chief and mother of Vikramaditya Singh, had also endorsed identification of ""outsiders"" for the sake of state security but had said she did not subscribe to BJP's ideology or its style of working. ""Identification of outsiders should be done to know the purpose of visit in view of the internal security of the state,"" she had said and claimed that the issue was blown out of proportion by media.The vendor policy issue is not the first time that Vikramaditya Singh had made comments diverging from party line. On the issue of Waqf Board amendements, which the Congress has opposed strongly, the Himachal minister had asserted that changes are necessary with times and had said: ""For the best interests of Himachal and its people, it is essential to bring about reforms.""(With inputs from agencies)",Vikramaditya Singh was at the centre of a controversy over his diktat for mandatory use of nameplates by eateries in the state.

Why a scientific paper on adverse events in Covid vaccination was withdrawn post-publication,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-a-scientific-paper-on-adverse-events-in-covid-vaccination-was-withdrawn-post-publication/articleshow/113823634.cms,"Representative photo

Why did the journal editor lose confidence in the conclusions of the article?

Why did the study create controversy when it was published?

Why did ICMR want the paper retracted?

Why did Bharat Biotech file a defamation case against the authors of the paper?

What were the objections raised by researchers, doctors, ethicists, scientists, and civil society members supporting the study authors?

The study titled “Long-term safety analysis of the BBV152 coronavirus vaccine in adolescents and adults: findings from a 1-year prospective study in north India,” which was published in May 2024 in the journal Drug Safety, was retracted and removed on September 24. Announcing the retraction, the journal editor stated that the article was being retracted “as he no longer has confidence in the conclusions as stated in the article.” Several researchers, doctors, ethicists, scientists, and civil society members wrote an open letter condemning this decision, saying it would have “a chilling effect on researchers and is harmful to science and the trust people have in the institution of science.”According to the retraction notice, a post-publication review concluded that the reported adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were presented in a way that could lead to ambiguous or incorrect interpretations regarding the relationship with the BBV152 vaccine, popularly known as Covaxin.The notice added that, given these findings, the editor and the publisher, Springer Publishing Company, decided that the article “should be removed on public health grounds.” It stated that the authors disagreed with the retraction. Incidentally, the published study had been cleared by the journal’s editor and peer-reviewed by two independent reviewers. It had been published after incorporating the revisions suggested by the peer reviewers and the editor. Questions to the editor about whether the post-publication review had been shared with the authors, as mandated by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines, and whether they were given a chance to respond to the concerns raised in the review, went unanswered. There was also no response on how exactly public health was affected by the study. The journal decided to retract and remove the article even before a decision was made on the court case filed by Bharat Biotech India Ltd. (BBIL), the manufacturers of the vaccine, against the authors and the journal editor.When the study was published, there was significant media coverage, with most headlines stating that one-third of the study participants who took the vaccine reported adverse events. The paper also stated that only 1% of participants developed serious AESIs. However, AESIs are defined by the WHO as pre-specified medically significant events that have the potential to be causally associated with a vaccine and need to be carefully monitored and confirmed by further special studies. Clearly, AESIs after vaccination cannot be categorically said to be caused by the vaccine. There is only a probability that they could be “causally associated” with the vaccine and need to be studied further. Many pointed out several flaws in the study design, while some felt that parts of the discussion in the paper could be misleading. The media frenzy around it drew a sharp reaction from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR ), which, within a few days of the study’s publication, sent a letter to the journal editor and the authors, raising several objections and seeking its retraction.Most of the objections to the study, including those raised by ICMR, were already recorded and explained by the authors in the limitations section of the study. ICMR strongly objected to being acknowledged “for research support,” stating that it was not associated with the study nor had it provided any financial or technical support for the research. The council added that the acknowledgment was “without any prior approval or intimation to ICMR,” which was “inappropriate and unacceptable.” Although the authors explained why they had acknowledged ICMR, they subsequently asked for all acknowledgments to be removed, as the journal objected to the fact that they did not have written permission from ICMR to acknowledge the institution. Incidentally, while ICMR objected to the use of telephonic interviews for data collection in the study, it did not mention that BBIL had also conducted a safety study with just 176 participants (aged 15-18 years), using telephonic interviews to collect data on adverse events seven days after vaccination. ICMR also did not disclose in the letter its own conflict of interest as a co-developer of the vaccine with BBIL, from which it earned about Rs 172 crore in royalty. A group of epidemiologists, doctors, and public health experts criticized ICMR for “academic censorship” instead of building on the study and addressing its shortcomings to elevate the standards of vaccine safety . The group urged ICMR to seek publication of the long-term follow-up of phase-3 trials, which is yet to be published by Bharat Biotech.Bharat Biotech claimed in its petition that the research was conducted at the instance of its competitors, without providing any proof for this allegation. It claimed that “the study created shock, alarm, and hesitancy in the minds of the public regarding the quality and efficacy” of the vaccine, even though the Covid vaccination program had ended long before the study was published in May 2024. Moreover, the study was on AESIs, which are not necessarily causally related to a vaccine. It only emphasized the need for confirmation from future studies. The company claimed that the study had negatively affected its business and that it had lost out on contracts for the supply of the vaccine because of the defamatory study. The company sought Rs 5 crore in damages for loss of business and defamation. However, the export of Covaxin had been halted since April 2022 after the WHO raised unspecified concerns about its manufacturing following an inspection of the production facilities in Hyderabad. The company stopped producing Covaxin after the first quarter of 2023, long before the study was published, due to a lack of demand. In their affidavit in court, the authors pointed out that the company ought to have sent its objections to the journal and sought a debate and discussion on the methodology and findings of the study within scientific forums instead of sending their comments to the media and filing a case against them.The letter pointed out that, like most research studies, this one had various limitations, which the authors had acknowledged in the paper. The study showed that 99% of people did not have any serious events, which could have been used by the government to bolster people’s trust in the vaccine. The letter added that ICMR ought to have set up follow-up studies to examine the causal relationship between any reported adverse events and the vaccine. According to the letter, several media reports misinterpreted the study, suggesting that the vaccine caused side effects in one-third of the individuals, even though no such claims could be made from the study because it was not designed to examine a causal link between the vaccine and the adverse events. “The actions of ICMR and BBIL are short-sighted and punitive. Scientific disagreements have to be articulated as counterpoints in scientific fora. Forcing the journal to retract the paper or filing a Rs 5 crore defamation suit leads to a chilling effect on researchers and is harmful to science and the trust people have in the institution of science,” the letter stated. It called for “a mature, open-minded, and more confident response” from ICMR and demanded that the lawsuit be withdrawn and the paper reinstated in the journal.","The study titled “Long-term safety analysis of the BBV152 coronavirus vaccine in adolescents and adults: findings from a 1-year prospective study in north India” was retracted and removed on September 24. Several researchers, doctors, ethicists, scientists, and civil society members wrote an open letter condemning this decision. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) raised several objections and sought its retraction.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113823671,imgsize-94620,width-400,resizemode-4/113823671.jpg"

The visit will be an important occasion for India to reaffirm its commitment to development support for the strategically located Indian Ocean neighbour amid concerns over a realignment in its foreign policy under the Marxist president.Jaishankar will also call on the president during what will also be the first visit by any foreign minister to Sri Lanka after the presidential election.India’s high commissioner to Sri Lanka Santosh Jha was the first foreign diplomat to call on Dissanayake after the election outcome was announced.With the visit by Jaishankar, which is expected to commence on October 4, the Indian government will also hope to build on its outreach to Dissanayake in the past 12 months that saw him visiting Delhi earlier this year, setting aside reservations over his party JVP’s (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna) deep and longstanding resentment against India. During his visit, Dissanayake had met both Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval.“Dissanayake may not have been India’s first choice but the visit by Jaishankar in only the second week of his presidency suggests India doesn’t expect him to be hostile in the manner the new Maldives president was initially or the way the interim government in Bangladesh has been,’’ said a source speaking on condition of anonymity.While it took 6 months for the first high-level bilateral visit from either country in the case of the Maldives after the new president, Mohamed Muizzu, took over last year, India and Bangladesh are yet to see any bilateral visit since the ouster of former pro-India PM Sheikh Hasina in early August.In his meetings with Indian officials, Dissanayake is said to have been appreciative of India’s $ 4 billion-worth assistance that helped bail Sri Lanka out of a financial crisis. While there are concerns about what sort of relationship Dissanayake might pursue with China, his assurance before he became president that he won’t allow Sri Lanka’s land, sea and airspace to be used against India has been received well here. His threat to scrap Adani’s wind power project during the election campaign is also attributed more to ecological reasons than any political agenda. Dissanayake, who has called for a snap parliamentary poll to consolidate his hold over power, has said that views both India and China as valued partners and that he doesn’t want Sri Lanka to get involved in any ``geopolitical fight’’.``His anti-corruption focus helps India which believes in transparent infrastructure development, responsible debt financing practices, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the rule of law and the environment,’’ added the source.",Jaishankar will also call on the president during what will also be the first visit by any foreign minister to Sri Lanka after the presidential election.

Observing that ""it cannot allow such a talented boy to go away"" and miss the opportunity after cracking the tough entrance exam, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra directed that the petitioner be admitted to the electrical engineering course.It directed IIT-Dhanbad to create an additional seat to accommodate him without disturbing other students who have been admitted.""We are affirmatively of the view that a talented student like the petitioner should not be left in the lurch.

BENGALURU: A Pakistani national, his Bangladeshi wife and her parents, who have been living in India with fake passports and Aadhaar cards for the past 10 years, were arrested on Monday from their rented villa at Jigani on the outskirts of Bengaluru.Police have seized their passports and Aadhaar cards, which they procured using fake documents.The accused are Rashid Ali Siddiqui (identified in his Indian passport as Shankar Sharma), his wife Ayesha Hanif (Asha Sharma), and her father Hanif and mother Rubina.Investigation revealed they entered the country through West Bengal in 2014 and lived in Delhi till 2018, before moving to Bengaluru.Police swung into action following a tip-off from Chennai immigration officials, who on Sept 24 detained four Bangladeshi men on charges of possessing Indian passports, acquired on the basis of fake documents.The four men had flown to Dhaka on Sept 14 to participate in a meet organised by spiritual leader Younus AlGohar, co-founder of Messiah Foundation International (also known as Kalki Avatar Foundation and Mehdi Foundation International). They were apprehended when they flew back to Chennai.“The four men revealed to the immigration officials that they lived with their relatives in Jigani, Bengaluru. The officials passed the information to us. We raided the villa early Monday morning and detained the four occupants. After scanning the documents and verifying them with those shared by immigration officials, we arrested them,” an officer said.All the four were subjected to a medical test and then produced before a local court, which remanded them in police custody for 10 days.Police said Siddiqui ran an engine-oil selling shop and also worked as an online caterer while Ayesha was a homemaker. “The four passports were made in Delhi during 2015-2016. They also have Aadhaar cards with a Delhi residential address,” a police officer said. According to their Aadhaar cards, Siddiqui and Ayesha are in their late 30s and her parents in their late 60s. Police are yet to determine their original age and how the four men arrested in Chennai were connected to them.Karnataka’s home minister G Parameshwara said more information would emerge after questioning of the family.","Pakistani national Rashid Ali Siddiqui, his Bangladeshi wife and her parents were arrested on Monday from their rented villa at Jigani on the outskirts of Bengaluru.

transfer to independent agency

NEW DELHI: Observing that politics should be kept out of the issue of faith and there was nothing prima facie to prove that contaminated ghee was used to make laddus at Tirumala Tirupati temple , Supreme Court on Monday slammed Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu for going public with his allegation of adulterated prasadam without any basis, and hurting the sentiments of crores of devotees.Hearing a batch of four petitions, including one filed by Subramanian Swamy, a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said prasadam was not sent for test and repeatedly asked the state and Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) to show evidence that contaminated ghee was used to make laddus.The court said according to the report, a sample of rejected ghee was tested.""There are some disclaimers in the lab report. It is not clear at all. It says rejected ghee was subjected to the test. If you yourself have ordered an investigation, what was the need to go to the press? The report came in July and the statement was made in Sept. The report says that was not the material used for prasadam,"" the bench said at the outset.It sought answers from the state govt and TTD on how they came to the conclusion that contaminated ghee was used to make the laddus. Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for TTD, said the test was conducted after devotees complained about change in taste and recounted the events leading to the controversy.The bench again said that when there was no material to show contamination of prasadam, then there could not be any justification for the CM to make comments before an FIR was lodged and an SIT formed. The court said it would also decide whether the probe should be transferred from the state-appointed SIT to an independent agency and would seek the assistance of solicitor general Tushar Mehta on this issue.“When you have ordered an investigation through the SIT, what was the necessity to go to the press? When you hold a constitutional office, you should maintain some restraint. We expect gods to be kept away from politics,” the bench said. “We are prima facie of the view that when the investigation was under process, it was not appropriate for the high constitutional authority to make a statement which can affect the sentiments of crores of people. We find that it would be appropriate if the SG assists us on whether the SIT by the state should continue or the probe should be by an independent agency,” the bench said and posted the hearing to Thursday.Senior advocate Rajashekhar Rao, appearing for Swamy, said the CM’s statements were refuted by the executive officer of TTD who said such ghee was never used. He said the probe should have some kind of supervision.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for Andhra govt, said Swamy’s petition was not bona fide and was filed to espouse cause of previous YSRCP govt.",Supreme Court slams Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu for going public with his allegation of adulterated prasadam.

Mithun Chakraborty's life has more drama than most films,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mithun-chakrabortys-life-has-more-drama-than-most-films/articleshow/113828183.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the summer of 1969, Mithun Chakraborty was asked to leave Kolkata by his father for getting involved with the Naxalites, the radical Reds whose ideology had enchanted hundreds of young men in search of a cause in Kolkata. In the years that followed, among other things, Mithun slept on pavements of Mumbai and was forced to cough up a fee for the precious space.On Monday, he was declared as the next recipient of Indian cinema 's highest honour, the Dadasaheb Phalke award , by Union I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on X.Life's been a rollercoaster for the actor who has won the National Award on three occasions. Mithun got the best actor prize for his portrayal of a wronged tribal in his first major film, Mrinal Sen's Mrigayaa (1977) and again for his celluloid interpretation of a disillusioned freedom fighter in Buddadev Dasgupta's Tahader Katha (1992). A third award as the best supporting actor came for his part of Sri Ramkrishna Paramhans in GV Iyer's Swami Vivekananda (1995). The profundity that Mithun brought to these varying parts has often been overshadowed by his image of a star of mainstream movies.Even in commercial cinema, the 74-year-old Kolkata-born actor has done more than often given credit for. Mithun toiled for 10 years in the harsh Mumbai filmdom before finding his feet and success; 1979 being his breakthrough year when Surakksha, where he played the desi Bond, Gunmaster G-9, became a box-office winner. He was the first dancing star to emerge in the video era that the non-gentry audience loved and identified with. Nobody took dancing to the street as a way of expressing joy and celebrating weddings and festivals like Mithun.The actor also overcame colour prejudice that was subtly embedded in the choice of heroes in colour conscious 1980s Bollywood; Mithun made dusky sexy. Even today Mithun is an icon in Russia where Disco Dancer (1983) is an inter-generational hit. In Tokyo too, there's a shrine to the Disco Dancer. Now over four and half decades in the acting business, he acted in the 2022 blockbuster, The Kashmir Files.Over the years, the actor widened his repertoire. He has delivered hits in mature action yarns (Ghulami), romantic dramas (Pyar Jhukta Nahi) and southern-made melodramas (Ghar Ek Mandir, Swarg Se Sundar and Pyaar Ka Mandir), not to forget in comedies (Golmaal 3).Mithun has also acted with success in low budget films such as Jallad creating a template of such movies. His dialogues like 'Marbo ekhane lash porbe shoshane (Hit you here, and the body will land up in the crematorium)' in the Bengali film, MLA Fatakesto, is played on YouTube to this day.The actor has always been at the forefront of social causes. In 1986, he took the lead in organising the Calcutta version of Hope 86, a concert in aid of Bombay film industry workers. In the 1990s, he was often conferred with Rashtriya Samman for being one of the highest tax-payers in the country.Politics has been a playful rainbow for Mithun. He has enjoyed its different colours and shades. After starting from the extreme Red, he warmed up to the gentler hues of CPM politicos in the 1980s. He became a Rajya Sabha MP via centrist Trinamool. And embraced BJP's saffron in 2021.""Mithun Da's remarkable cinematic journey inspires generations!"" said Vaishnaw in his post. The truth is that Mithun's life has more drama than most films. It has been an exceptional life overall which will certainly inspire any ambitious young man or woman trying to reach for the stars.","Mithun Chakraborty was declared as the next recipient of Indian cinema's highest honour, the Dadasaheb Phalke award.

India is home to numerous fascinating locations, but some of its most intriguing sites are entirely off-limits to the general public. From restricted research facilities to remote tribal islands, these forbidden places remain shrouded in mystery, protected for reasons ranging from national security to the preservation of indigenous cultures.The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Mumbai, for example, plays a crucial role in India’s nuclear program, while North Sentinel Island safeguards one of the world’s last uncontacted tribes.Other areas, like Pangong Tso Lake and Aksai Chin , are caught in geopolitical disputes, making them inaccessible to tourists.Located in Trombay, Mumbai, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) is one of India’s most guarded sites. Established by Homi Jehangir Bhabha as the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET), BARC plays a critical role in India’s nuclear research and development.Although there is no official classified reason for the public ban, access to this facility is highly restricted. Only research students, after completing extensive paperwork, are allowed inside the centre, which remains off-limits to the general public due to security and confidentiality concerns surrounding nuclear research.North Sentinel Island, part of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago, is home to the Sentinelese, one of the world’s most isolated indigenous tribes. These inhabitants are protected under the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Protection of Aboriginal Tribes Act of 1956, which strictly prohibits outsiders from entering their territory.The Sentinelese have had no contact with the modern world, and this isolation has made them vulnerable to diseases for which they have no immunity. For the protection of both the tribe and outsiders, the island remains one of the most forbidden places on Earth.Visitors can enjoy the serene beauty of Pangong Tso Lake from the Indian side in Ladakh, but certain portions of this lake, which extend into Chinese territory, are strictly prohibited. The lake spans both India and China, and while tourists flock to the Indian side for its stunning views, the Chinese-controlled areas are off-limits due to political and territorial disputes. This delicate border region remains under constant surveillance, and entry into certain areas of Pangong Tso is restricted.Aksai Chin is a region steeped in natural beauty, with salt lakes, valleys, gorges, and the Karakash River adding to its allure. However, this region remains largely unexplored by tourists due to its status as a restricted area. Caught in a long-standing territorial dispute between India and China, Aksai Chin is claimed by both nations.The area falls along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), making it inaccessible to the public. Although it attracts adventurers, its political sensitivity and challenging landscape keep it off-limits.Located in the Andaman Sea, Barren Island is home to India’s only confirmed active volcano. Though its beauty can be admired from a distance while aboard a ship, setting foot on the island is strictly prohibited. The island, devoid of human inhabitants, earned its name due to its uninhabitable nature. This isolated volcanic site remains a restricted zone, allowing only for distant observation.Known as Tso Lhamo Lake, Cholamu Lake is one of the highest lakes in the world, sitting just a few kilometres from the Tibetan border in Sikkim. Unfortunately, this breathtaking lake is out of reach for tourists.Its proximity to the border places it in a restricted area, and access is granted solely to the Indian Army and the Sikkim police or administration. The lake’s remote location and strategic importance make it one of the most elusive natural wonders in India.","India is home to numerous fascinating locations, but some of its most intriguing sites are entirely off-limits to the general public.

NEW DELHI: Junior doctors in West Bengal have resumed their indefinite strike demanding better safety and security at medical facilities.The strike, which began on October 1, follows an earlier partial return to work on September 21 after a 42-day protest. The initial protest was triggered by the rape and murder of a woman doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9.“We do not see any positive approach from the state government to fulfill our demands for safety and security. Today is the 52nd day (of the protest) and we are still being attacked and there is no attempt to keep the other promises made during the meetings with chief minister Mamata Banerjee . In the given situation, we are left with no option other than opting for full cease work, starting today,” said Aniket Mahato, one of the protesting doctors.He added, “Unless we see clear action from the state government on these demands, this complete cease work will continue.” The doctors call for concrete steps from the government to address their concerns.Meanwhile, senior doctors have also planned a rally in Kolkata on Tuesday, set to commence around 5 pm, with approximately 60 civil society organisations expected to participate.Manas Gumta, a surgery professor from the Joint Platform of Doctors, stated, ""The movement will go on in some form till justice is delivered. The rally on Tuesday will culminate in front of Academy of Fine Arts, where cultural programmes, like a street play on the heinous crime, will be staged.""Another rally, organised by WBJDF, is scheduled for Wednesday at 1 pm and is likely to be attended by various organisations, including senior doctors and civil society bodies.Earlier, Calcutta high court on Monday allowed a rally to be held in the metropolis by the Joint Platform of Doctors (JPD) on October 1 to protest the rape-murder of a trainee medic at RG Kar hospital.Disposing of a petition by the JPD, Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj directed that a peaceful rally be held between 5 pm and 8 pm from College Square in north Kolkata to Rabindra Sadan in the south.The medics' platform, an umbrella organisation of the Association of Health Service Doctors, West Bengal, had made a representation before the Kolkata police commissioner for permission to take out the protest rally from College Square to Rabindra Sadan from 5 pm to 8 pm with around 50,000 participants.","The strike, which began on October 1, follows an earlier partial return to work on September 21 after a 42-day protest.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Feeling burnt out from the monotonous office routine? Struggling to find time for yourself, family, or friends? You're not alone. The pressures of work can drain us both mentally and physically. If you're seeking a solution, perhaps it's time to consider moving to a country with a healthier work-life balance .According to a survey by Remote , an HR platform, the work culture of 60 countries with the highest GDP was analysed.The survey focused on various factors such as annual leave, minimum statutory sick pay, paid maternity leave, minimum wage, healthcare systems, happiness index, weekly working hours, and LGBTQ+ inclusivity.Based on this evaluation, 10 countries emerged as leaders in work-life balance. From New Zealand to Canada , these countries offer the perfect blend of work and relaxation, allowing you to focus on your well-being. Let’s take a look at them:Brazil is synonymous with carnival culture and vibrant festivities, but it also offers a great work-life balance for its citizens. With generous sick leave, maternity pay, and a government-funded universal health care system, Brazilians enjoy a well-rounded lifestyle year-round.Known for its inclusivity, Canada ranks high for LGBTQ+ friendliness. Canadians benefit from a universal healthcare system, unlike their American neighbours. Cities like Toronto are popular among remote workers who enjoy the flexibility of a thriving city combined with personal freedom and a balanced life.With a renowned National Health Service (NHS), a decent minimum wage, and one of the most generous maternity leave systems in the world, the UK ranks among the top countries for work-life balance. Workers here average just 25.6 hours per week, the shortest working week of any country on the list.The Netherlands stands out for its high quality of life and generous maternity pay. Workers here enjoy a well-balanced lifestyle, making the country one of the best places for life-work balance globally.Although just missing the top five, Norway offers a generous annual leave, universal healthcare, and education. Long working hours are uncommon, leaving workers ample time to explore the natural beauty of Oslo and beyond.Ranking high on the happiness index, Denmark offers a favourable work-life balance. Workers benefit from high annual leave allowances, universal healthcare, full sick pay, and a high level of LGBTQ+ inclusivity. Denmark's progressive policies make it one of Europe’s most attractive countries for workers.With its sunny climate, friendly culture, and some of the world’s best beaches, Australia boasts a laid-back lifestyle. Its work-life balance is one of the best, and the country offers a high minimum wage, a top ranking on the happiness index, and universal healthcare, making it a popular destination for those seeking a better balance.Coming in at number three, France exemplifies a healthy work-life balance. The French culture encourages separating work from leisure, which doesn’t negatively impact the economy—France currently ranks seventh in GDP worldwide. The country’s approach to work and play has become a model for many.Known for the siesta, Spain excels at blending work and leisure. While the siesta may not be as common in corporate life, Spanish workers understand the importance of relaxation. With Madrid serving as a cultural hotspot, workers in Spain know how to enjoy life after work.Topping the list, New Zealand offers a remarkable work-life balance. Kiwis benefit from generous annual leave, a high minimum wage, and 26 weeks of paid maternity leave for new mothers, all of which contribute to an enviable lifestyle.","A survey by Remote analysed the work culture of 60 countries with the highest GDP. The survey focused on various factors such as annual leave, minimum statutory sick pay, paid maternity leave, and minimum wage. 10 countries emerged as leaders in work-life balance. From New Zealand to Canada, these countries offer the perfect blend of work and relaxation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113811629,imgsize-45436,width-400,resizemode-4/113811629.jpg"

Malcolm Gladwell , the best-selling author ofone of the most important non-fiction books of the 21st century, is back with its dark sequelWhile discussing the new book with the Guardian, Gladwell calls out what he calls Harvard’s admission officers’ “bias towards affluent white students”.Pointing out the disparity between Harvard and an institution with a merit-based admissions process like Caltech compared to Harvard, he writes: “My suspicion is that for many people it’s unconscious, but there must be a point at which [Harvard admissions tutors] are confronting the fact that they have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their campus hasn’t become dominated by Asians and Indians.”In the book, Gladwell notes that Caltech, a highly competitive university with a merit-based admissions system, saw the proportion of Asian American students rise from 25% to 43% between 1992 and 2013.In contrast, at Harvard, where the admissions process is influenced by factors such as legacy, donor contributions, and athletic scholarships, the percentage of Asian American students has remained consistently between 15-20% during the same period. Indian applicants are even more likely to be excluded by Harvard’s application process.Gladwell goes on to argue: ""Meritocracy is one of the most beautiful inventions of the 20th century – it is a foundation of a free society.""Here are 10 other key points aboutand Malcolm Gladwell:Malcolm Gladwell was initially reluctant to revisit his debut work but ultimately chose to create an entirely new version, one that reflects today's more anxious world rather than simply updating the original.The foundational idea that social trends behave like epidemics, initially growing slowly before suddenly taking off, still holds true. However, some of Gladwell's original examples have not aged well.Gladwell now finds his earlier chapter on crime ""embarrassing,"" as he once credited New York City's crime reduction to 'broken windows' policing. He has since acknowledged that this approach led to over-policing in minority neighbourhoods and wasn't actually responsible for the drop in crime rates.Gladwell values the process of learning from errors, a trait he respects in his father. He proposes that authors should periodically reassess their original works every 25 years to stay aligned with new insights.The new book is darker and more nuanced than the original. It delves into how a small number of individuals can disproportionately influence significant events, such as the opioid crisis, where a minority of doctors were responsible for nearly half of all prescriptions.While The Tipping Point became a cultural phenomenon, Gladwell’s latest book explores how individuals with substantial influence can shape societal changes, both positively and negatively.Gladwell reflects on how male leadership failures over the past eight years make a strong case for female leaders, particularly in the current political climate.Gladwell has expressed his support for Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election, noting a personal connection through his mother, who shares Jamaican heritage with Harris's father.He argues that recent examples of male leadership failures have made it increasingly difficult to justify misogynistic attitudes and believes that America is ready for a female president.Now living with his partner and two young daughters, Gladwell views parenting as a journey of intellectual humility. He continuously adapts his understanding of his children as they grow and sees this phase of his life as a ""productivity mechanism"" that shapes his evolving perspective.","Malcolm Gladwell's new book, ""Revenge of the Tipping Point,"" is darker and more nuanced than the original.

Projections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) indicate that India is set to surpass Japan by 2025, making it the fourth-largest economy. Despite impressive economic growth, a significant gap persists between this expansion and the labour market, particularly among the youth, as highlighted by the latest data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS).Released by the Labour Bureau on September 23, 2024, the PLFS for July 2023 to June 2024 reveals ongoing challenges in the Indian labour market.Despite five years of decline, the overall unemployment rate has stagnated at 3.2% for 2023-24.Alarmingly, the youth unemployment rate is at 10.2%, with males at 9.8% and females facing a higher rate of 11%. This trend is particularly concerning for women, whose unemployment rate has increased from 2.9% to 3.2% over the past year.Topping the list, Lakshadweep has the highest unemployment rate for those aged 15 to 29, with an overall rate of 36.2%. Female unemployment in the union territory stands at a staggering 79.7%, compared to 26.2% for males.With an unemployment rate of 33.6%, this UT also has a significant gap between male (24%) and female (49.5%) unemployment.Despite having the highest literacy rate in India, Kerala faces an unemployment rate of 29.9%, with a particularly high female unemployment rate of 47.1%, compared to 19.3% for males.This northeastern state has an unemployment rate of 27.4%, with a more balanced distribution between males (27.9%) and females (26.6%).Manipur’s unemployment rate stands at 22.9%, with females facing higher unemployment (27.5%) compared to males (19.9%).The union territory of Ladakh has a total unemployment rate of 22.2%, with female unemployment reaching 38.3%, which is significantly higher than male unemployment at 11.4%.Arunachal Pradesh has an overall unemployment rate of 20.9%, with male unemployment at 21.9% and female unemployment at 19.6%. The relatively lower gap between male and female unemployment in this state shows a more balanced employment landscape. However, with a fifth of the youth population unemployed, the state still faces serious labour market challenges.Goa’s unemployment rate stands at 19.1%, with females experiencing much higher unemployment (31%) compared to males (13.2%). This sharp contrast in gender unemployment rates raises concerns about gender-specific barriers to employment in the state, despite its tourism-driven economy.Punjab faces an unemployment rate of 18.8%, with female unemployment at 24.5% and male unemployment at 16.7%. The state’s agricultural base and industrial growth have not translated into sufficient job opportunities for women, indicating the need for policies that foster more inclusive economic participation across genders.Andhra Pradesh rounds out the top 10 with an unemployment rate of 17.5%, featuring a female unemployment rate of 19.7% and a male unemployment rate of 16.4%. While the gap between genders is narrower here, the overall high rate of youth unemployment suggests a skills mismatch in the state’s labour market.","Despite impressive economic growth, a significant gap persists between this expansion and the labour market, particularly among the youth.

All Hail Meghan: Where did all start?

After a damning report cited Meghan Markle's former staff calling her a demon and dictator, a new report claims that Meghan Markle was kind enough to not expect a response to her mails that she used to send at 5 am. She let her staff know that she was not expecting a reply immediately, US Weekly reported citing five current and former employees who recounted their experience of working with the Royal.""My working day may not be your working day. Please do not feel obliged to reply to this email outside your normal working hours,"" Meghan writes this in her mails. Her staff claimed she is flexible and fair-minded like that.Meghan has around 16 staffers working for production on various Netflix projects, podcasts, the Archewell Foundation, and communications. Meghan shares credit and writes personal email thanking her staff for their contribution, an ex-staffer said.“If you’re in a meeting and a great idea is referenced, she makes sure to give props to the person who generated the idea,"" the ex-staffer said. ""[After] a big trip, every employee gets a personal email thanking them for their contribution in making it a success.”Former head of content at Archewell Ben Browning defended Meghan Markle and said that she encouraged a positive and supportive work environment. ""We all continue to be friends,"" he said adding that all suggestions of Meghan Markle being otherwise are false.One employee said they never heard Meghan Markle yell as she is solution-oriented and gives clear direction. “If you come for our bosses, you’re coming for us. This isn’t a criminal organization. We’re trying to do good,"" the employee said.Meghan and Harry received a lot of bad press and saw a huge attrition rate. The couple's chief of staff resigned after just three months on the job. A Hollywood Reporter account quoted staffers who said everyone working under Meghan Markle is terrified as she belittles people. ""She marches around like a dictator in high heels, fuming and barking orders. I've watched her reduce grown men to tears,"" one said. Harry, on the other hand, has been described as a very charming person but an enabler of a terrible Meghan.Another report from the Daily Beast portrayed Meghan Markle as a demon who chews up in person. ""I witnessed people being chewed up in person and over the phone and made to feel like s**t. It was an incredibly fraught time, and I'm inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt, She has said herself she was suicidal at times,"" one insider was quoted as saying.","Meghan Markle's staff now say she is a good boss, fair-minded, solution- oriented.

AI Safety Bill: California’s landmark AI safety bill blocked by governor amid tech industry backlash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/californias-ai-safety-bill-blocked-by-governor-amid-tech-industry-backlash/articleshow/113828813.cms,"California governor Gavin Newsom

California governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a landmark artificial intelligence (AI) safety bill, which had faced significant resistance from major tech companies , according to BBC News. The proposed legislation, which would have imposed some of the first AI regulations in the US, was blocked due to concerns it could stifle innovation and push developers out of the state.The bill, authored by senator Scott Wiener , sought to introduce strict safety testing for advanced AI systems and mandate a ""kill switch"" to disable potentially dangerous models. It also aimed to impose official oversight for the development of powerful ""Frontier Models.""In his veto statement, Newsom explained the legislation ""does not take into account whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data,"" adding that the bill would impose strict regulations on even basic AI functions if implemented by large systems.Newsom announced plans to protect the public from the risks posed by AI, requesting input from leading experts to help shape future safeguards. In recent weeks, he has signed 17 other bills related to technology, including measures to combat misinformation and deepfakes created with generative AI.Senator Wiener criticised the decision, claiming the veto allows AI companies to continue developing ""extremely powerful technology"" without government oversight. He argued that without this regulation, AI firms will face ""no binding restrictions from US policymakers,"" especially given the lack of action from Congress.The bill had drawn opposition from tech giants such as OpenAI Google , and Meta , who warned it would hinder AI’s development. Wei Sun, an analyst at Counterpoint Research, called the restrictions premature, noting that regulating specific AI applications rather than the technology itself would be more beneficial in the long term.","California governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a landmark artificial intelligence (AI) safety bill.

Islamabad, In an effort to minimise administrative expenditures, cash-strapped Pakistan on Sunday announced to abolish about 150,000 government posts , close six ministries, and merge two others, as part of reforms agreed upon with the IMF under USD 7 billion loan deal . The International Monetary Fund on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to cut expenditures, increase tax-to GDP ratio, tax non-traditional sectors like agriculture and real estate, limit subsidies and transfer some fiscal responsibilities to provinces.Addressing the media on his return from the US, Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb said that a programme had been finalised with the IMF, which would be the last programme for Pakistan.""We need to implement our policies to prove that it will be the last programme,"" he said, and emphasised that in order to join the G20, the economy must be formalised.The minister said right-sizing within ministries was going on and the decision to close six ministries is set to be implemented, while two ministries will be merged. ""Additionally, 150,000 posts across various ministries will be eliminated,"" Aurangzeb said.He dwelt at length on increasing tax revenues, noting that there were approximately 300,000 new taxpayers last year, and so far this year, 732,000 new taxpayers have registered, increasing the total number of taxpayers in the country from 1.6 million to 3.2 million.Aurangzeb also said that the non-filers category will be abolished and those not paying taxes will no longer be able to purchase property or vehicles.The minister claimed that the economy was moving in the right direction and the country's foreign exchange reserves had increased, reaching their highest level. He highlighted significant growth in both national exports and IT exports, and stated that investor confidence regarding the strength of the economy is a major success.Aurangzeb stated that the policy rate has been reduced by 4.5 per cent by the government after coming to power, and expressed optimism that the exchange rate and policy rate will remain as expected.""Our claim that the economy is improving is not a hollow claim because inflation has decreased due to government policies. Inflation has dropped to single digits,"" he said.Pakistan has been struggling to fix its economy for the last many years and it was close to default in 2023 but a timely loan of USD 3 billion by the IMF saved the situation.Pakistan has negotiated a long-term loan with the global lender with the hope and commitment that it would be the last loan. However, many doubt this claim as the country has already secured about two dozen loans from the Fund but failed to address the economy on a permanent basis.","Pakistan to abolish about 150,000 government posts, close six ministries, and merge two others.
