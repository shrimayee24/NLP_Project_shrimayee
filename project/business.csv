They deserve your immediate attention. The Government of West Bengal is entirely capable of meeting all the demands,” the letter read.""Peaceful ambience and security are not a luxury.

After 42 days, on September 21, they concluded their strike based on assurances from the state government to address their demands.However, the doctors resumed their protest by starting an indefinite fast at the Dorina Crossing in Dharmatala, located in central Kolkata, on Saturday evening.The doctors alleged that the government has failed to deliver on the promises previously made to them.The protesting doctors have put forward several demands, including justice for their colleague, the immediate removal of Health Secretary N S Nigam, and the establishment of task forces to ensure the installation of essential facilities such as CCTV cameras, on-call rooms, and washrooms at their workplaces.","The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has written a letter to West Bengal's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee.

"Congress reviews Haryana loss, to pause EVM attack till it has ‘enough evidence’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-reviews-haryana-loss-to-pause-evm-attack-till-it-has-enough-evidence/articleshow/114131317.cms,"To ‘avoid bad optics’, Hooda & Selja not invited to Congress meet

NEW DELHI: Congress , which reacted to its Haryana debacle by blaming it on EVMs and rejecting the result as “unacceptable”, has decided to pause the line of attack and has turned the focus inwards to look into the role of factional feuds and weaknesses that prevented a win.The decision was taken at a review meeting convened on Thursday by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , with the party brass agreeing that it will firm up its position on EVMs as one of the key causes for the electoral loss only after it had gathered “firm evidence” of wrongdoing, sources said.A statement issued by Kharge’s office later in the evening said the party has decided to depute a technical team to look into complaints and discrepancies noted by candidates. “Congress will issue a detailed response based on the fact-finding team’s report on the counting process and functioning of electronic voting machines,” it said.The deliberations, held against the backdrop of supporters of factions led by former Haryana CM B S Hooda and former Union minister Kumari Selja pointing fingers at each other, saw Rahul Gandhi asserting the need for all to bury their differences and unite for the party’s interest. “The party’s interest is paramount,” a source quoted him as saying in the meeting. Fight between rival factions is widely seen to be the major factor in Congress’s defeat.Hooda, his loyalist and PCC chief Udai Bhan, Selja and her ally Randeep Singh Surjewala were not invited for the meeting, with sources attributing their exclusion to the concern to “avoid bad optics”. The party is planning to carry out booth-level assessment by seeking a report from each candidate to study the factors that played a role in the loss.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Ajay Maken said, “As you all know, as the exit polls and opinion polls had showed, the results were unexpected. There was a lot of difference between the exit polls and the actual results. We discussed what could be the reasons.” On whether infighting had hurt Congress’s chances in the polls, Maken said, “There are various reasons, from EC to internal differences, we have discussed all that and will hold more discussions going forward.”On Tuesday, party general secretary Jairam Ramesh and spokesperson Pawan Khera had blamed the “slow counting of EVMs” for the party’s defeat to BJP: a bitter surprise which has helped the saffron rival gain momentum and raised doubts about the viability of Congress’s planks — guaranteed MSP purchase of entire farm produce, scrapping of Agnipath scheme, caste census and an “imperilled Constitution”.The rejection of the outcome, a first for a national party, drew a strong protest from EC, which rejected all the charges and raised eyebrows in independent quarters. BJP, of course, lashed out at Congress.Besides Kharge and Rahul, general secretary K C Venugopal, senior observers for the polls Ashok Gehlot and Maken, as well as secretaries for the state participated in the review meeting. Party in-charge of the state Deepak Babaria joined the meeting online from Ahmedabad.","Hooda, his loyalist and PCC chief Udai Bhan, Selja and her ally Randeep Singh Surjewala were not invited for the meeting.

Ratan Naval Tata, a titan of industry, passed away on Wednesday night at a Mumbai hospital, aged 86. Despite his immense influence and control over more than 30 companies operating in over 100 countries across six continents, he never appeared on any list of billionaires.Tata was known for his modest lifestyle, which stood in stark contrast to his vast business empire.He was widely regarded as a ""secular living saint,"" a title that spoke to his reputation for decency and integrity in a world where such qualities are often lacking.His passing marks the end of an era, as he leaves behind a legacy that will be remembered for generations to come. Tata's impact on the global business landscape cannot be overstated, and his commitment to ethical leadership will continue to inspire those who follow in his footsteps.""None can destroy iron, but its own rust can. Likewise, none can destroy a person, but their own mindset can.""""Power and wealth are not two of my main stakes.""""If you want to walk fast, walk alone. But if you want to walk far, walk together.""""Take the stones people throw at you, and use them to build a monument.""""I admire people who are very successful.

All that matters is the well-being of the people you love.""""The best leaders are those most interested in surrounding themselves with assistants and associates smarter than they are.""""I don't believe in work-life balance. I believe in work-life integration. Make your work and life meaningful and fulfilling, and they will complement each other.""""The biggest risk is not taking any risk. In a world that is changing quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.""""Be persistent and resilient in the face of challenges, for they are the building blocks of success.""""Never underestimate the power of kindness, empathy, and compassion in your interactions with others.""""You may not always have a comfortable life, and you may not always be able to solve all the world's problems, but don't ever underestimate the importance you can have, because history has shown us that courage can be contagious, and hope can take on a life of its own.""""Leadership is about taking responsibility, not making excuses.""""Don’t wait for opportunities to come to you, create your own opportunities.""""I have always been very confident and very upbeat about the future potential of India. I think it is a great country with great potential.""""People still believe what they read is necessarily the truth.""""I don’t believe in taking right decisions.

NEW DELHI: Ratan Tata , chairman emeritus of one of India's biggest conglomerates Tata Group , died at 86 after prolonged illness. He was admitted to the hospital due to his age and related medical conditions.In a statement, Tata's family said, ""We his brothers, sisters, and family take solace and comfort in the outpouring of love and respect from all who admired him. While he is no longer with us in person, his legacy of humility, generosity and purpose will continue to inspire future generations.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi mourned Ratan Tata and called him a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being.""Shri Ratan Tata Ji was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being. He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond the boardroom. He endeared himself to several people thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.""One of the most unique aspects of Shri Ratan Tata Ji was his passion towards dreaming big and giving back. He was at the forefront of championing causes like education, healthcare, sanitation, animal welfare to name a few,"" he added.Ratan Tata, who is also known for his charitable work, served as the chairman of the Tata Group from 1991 to 2012. During his tenure, he made significant contributions to the conglomerate founded by his great-grandfather over a century ago.In 1996, Tata established Tata Teleservices, the telecommunications arm of the group, and in 2004, he led the initial public offering of Tata Consultancy Services, the group's IT company.After stepping down as chairman in 2012, Tata retained the honorary title of chairman emeritus for several Tata companies, including Tata Sons , Tata Industries, Tata Motors , Tata Steel, and Tata Chemicals.Tata was awarded two of India's highest civilian honors: the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.One of India's most successful business tycoons, he is also renowned for his philanthropic endeavors. His personal involvement in philanthropy began in the 1970s with the initiation of The Aga Khan Hospital and Medical College project, which laid the foundation for one of India's premier healthcare institutions.After becoming the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, Tata's philanthropic efforts gained new momentum. He actively guided the Tata Trusts, established by his great-grandfather Jamsetji, towards addressing crucial social needs and established institutes of excellence such as the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, while also funding educational initiatives across India.Despite his reputation for class and elegance, Tata was not immune to controversies. Although the Tata Group was not directly implicated in the 2008 scam involving the allocation of second-generation telecom licences, Tata was drawn into the controversy through leaked recordings of purported phone calls he made to lobbyist Nira Radia. However, he was not implicated in any wrongdoing.In December 2012, Tata handed over control of Tata Sons to Cyrus Mistry, his deputy at the time. However, the owners had issues with the functioning of the first non-Tata family member, leading to Mistry's ouster in October 2016. Ratan Tata was said to be one of the shareholders who disagreed with Mistry on several projects, including Mistry's decision to discontinue the loss-making small car Nano, which was a pet project of Ratan Tata.Since 2017, Tata has been the emeritus chairman of Tata Sons. During this time, he has taken on a new role, supporting young entrepreneurs of the 21st century by investing in new age tech-driven start-ups that will play a significant role in shaping the future of the country. In his personal capacity and through his investment company RNT Capital Advisors, Tata has invested in over 30 start-ups, including Ola Electric, Paytm, Snapdeal, Lenskart, and Zivame.One wet monsoon evening not many moons ago, dog-lover Tata had decreed that any strays outside the conglomerate's HQ in downtown Mumbai be allowed shelter. Some never left but their benefactor is no more.","Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Group, dies at 86 after prolonged illness.

The passing of Ratan Tata has brought attention to succession at Tata Trusts , the largest public charitable foundations in India and the owner of the $165-billion Tata Group. As Tata did not designate a successor, the boards of Trusts will have to select a chairman from among the trustees . Though the Trusts comprises several foundations the two main units are Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust.These two entities collectively hold approximately 52% in Tata Sons, the parent of Tata Group , which has a diverse portfolio ranging from aviation to automobiles.There are 13 trustees in total across the two Trusts, with five individuals serving as common trustees for both. The five common trustees are former defence secretary Vijay Singh, automobile industrialist Venu Srinivasan, Ratan Tata's half brother and Trent chairman Noel Tata , businessman Mehli Mistry and lawyer Darius Khambata. The other trustees include former Citi India CEO Pramit Jhaveri at Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, and Ratan Tata's younger brother Jimmy Tata and Jehangir Hospital CEO Jehangir H C Jehangir at Sir Ratan Tata Trust.The chairman of Tata Trusts is elected through majority consent among the trustees. Vijay Singh and Venu Srinivasan hold the position of vice-chairmen at the Trusts. However, the likelihood of either of them being selected as the chairman is relatively low. Noel Tata, aged 67, has a high likelihood of being named the chairman of Tata Trusts. This appointment would satisfy the Parsi community and ensure that a member of the founding family leads the philanthropic organisation, which distributed $56 million (Rs 470 crore) in FY23.Historically, only Parsis have chaired Tata Trusts, even if some had non-Tata surnames and no direct connection to the founding family. If appointed, Noel would become the 11th chairman of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the sixth chairman of Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Noel has been involved with the Tata Group for over four decades and holds positions on the boards of six key companies, including Trent, Titan, and Tata Steel. He was appointed a trustee of Sir Ratan Tata Trust in 2019 and later joined the board of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust in 2022.He was considered a potential candidate to take over as the chairman of Tata Sons after Tata's tenure. However, the position was ultimately given to Cyrus Mistry, Noel's brother-in-law. After Mistry's controversial exit, the role of Tata Sons chairman was then assumed by N Chandrasekaran, a seasoned executive from TCS. Noel and Ratan Tata were not often spotted in each other's company and preferred to keep their distance. However, in recent times, the half- brothers have bridged the gap between them to a large extent.","Ratan Tata did not designate a successor, the boards of Trusts will have to select a chairman from among the trustees.

NEW DELHI: WWF ’s Living Planet Report , released on Thursday, calls India’s food consumption pattern as most sustainable among big economies ( G20 countries ), noting that it would be least climate-damaging for Earth to support food production by 2050 if all countries adopt India’s pattern. Argentina, Australia and USA are worst on this count.“If everyone in the world adopted the current food consumption patterns of the world’s major economies by 2050, we exceed the 1.5° Celsius climate (warming limit) target for food related greenhouse gas emissions by 263 per cent and require one to seven Earths to support us,” the report says, making special mention of India’s millet mission .The report points out that if all countries adopt the current consumption patterns of India, the world would need ‘less than one earth’ (0.84) by 2050 to support food production. The Indian scenario is even marginally better than the planetary climate boundary for food, indicating the maximum amount of greenhouse gas emissions that food systems can emit to stay within 1.5° Celsius of the warming limit.In contrast, the world will need the highest 7.4 Earths if it adopts the consumption patterns of Argentina. It means Argentina has the worst system on a sustainable benchmark, followed by Australia (6.8), USA (5.5), Brazil (5.2), France (5), Italy (4.6), Canada (4.5) and the UK (3.9). Among the better ones, Indonesia (0.9) figures only after India (0.84) and ahead of China (1.7), Japan (1.8) and Saudi Arabia (2).The report also appreciated India’s ongoing efforts to promote climate-resilient millets ( nutri-cereals ), saying National Millet Campaign is designed to increase national consumption of this ancient grain which is good for health and highly resilient in the face of climate change .“Eating more sustainable diets would reduce the amount of land needed to produce food: grazing land, in particular, could be freed up for other purposes, including nature restoration and carbon sequestration,” says the report. It also underlines the importance of promoting healthy alternative protein sources such as legumes and nutri-cereals, plant-based meat alternatives, and algal species high in nutritional value.","WWF Living Planet Report calls India’s food consumption pattern as most sustainable among big economies.

But there is no question of any friction in the Mahayuti, and nothing should be read into anyone leaving the cabinet early if that has happened at all,"" Tatkare said.The state has already come under criticism for a slew of pre-election sops costing Rs 96,000 crore announced in the budget, including the Ladki Bahin scheme. The expenditure on the Ladki Bahin scheme on its own is slated to be Rs 46,000 crore per year.The state is on a spree of clearing land allotments, subsidies and guarantees in the run-up to polls. The finance dept has already warned that fiscal deficit could be as high as Rs 2 lakh crore for 2024-25.The department has warned that the fiscal deficit had crossed 3% of the GSDP, the limit set by the Maharashtra Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Act.""This was probably first time that Ajit Pawar has left the cabinet like this. The exact reason is not known, but this is uncommon.

Man taxed for US income as he spent over half the year in India

MUMBAI: The income tax appellate tribunal (ITAT) recently ruled that income earned in the US would be taxable for an individual residing in India. While the individual initially declared an income of Rs 9,570 for 2012-13, his taxable income surged to Rs 43.5 lakh after the US income was added.Under tax laws, residential status determines tax liability. Non-residents, for example, are not taxed in India on foreign income.However, in this case, the individual was a tax resident of both India and the US, requiring the application of the 'tie-breaker test' under the India-US tax treaty to determine which country he was a resident of.Applying this test, which takes into account certain criteria, ITAT concluded that the individual's ""centre of vital interest"" was closer to India, making his US income taxable in India.Applying the tiebreaker test, ITAT, in the case of a person who is a tax resident of both India and the US, has held that income earned in the US was taxable in India.Tax experts said the tiebreaker test is applied in cases of dual residency.Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head (global mobility services tax) at KPMG India, said a returning Indian, for instance, could be a tax resident of both India (based on the number of days in the country) and the US (based on citizenship). “In determining basic residency under domestic tax laws of each country, the fact that US tax residency (among other conditions) is based on US citizenship/green card status does have its own nuances as such individuals ar e always taxed in the US on their global income.”In this particular case, the individual was a tax resident of India, having spent more than 183 days in the country in 2012-13. He was also a US citizen, one of the criteria for tax residency in America.“The tie-breaker test is sequential, meaning if the tie is broken at one stage, subsequent criteria do not need to be applied. But, these criteria are highly subjective and vary with each individual’s circumstances,” Sirwalla said.The individual argued that his family (wife and three children) were a ll US citizens and one of his daughters was studying in the US. While he earned income from investments in both India and the US, he held larger investments in the US, and hence claimed he was a US resident. Accordingly, he said, his US income should not be taxed in India.The I-T department said the man had spent more than 183 days in India, and his wife and two of his children lived in Mumbai, while only one daughter resided in the US.ITAT noted that determining the ‘centre of vital interest’ requires analysing both personal and economic relationships. It observed that while the man had family ties to the US, his immediate family and business activities were centred in India. His siblings and parents residing in the US were deemed less relevant than his stay in India with his wife and children. ITAT gave more weight to his active business involvement in India over his passive investments in the US.The man had returned to India to run a film distribution company, co-founded with his wife in 2009, and was actively involved in its operations. Thus, ITAT ruled that he was a resident of India, making his US income taxable here.","Man taxed for US income as he spent over half the year in India.

HYDERABAD: ED ’s adjudicating authority has imposed a penalty of Rs 2,146 crore on PC Financial Services (PCFS), a non-banking financial company running a loan app allegedly linked to Chinese and Norwegian entities, for Fema violations. This is the first instance in India of an NBFC running a loan app being penalised with a huge fine, reports.The adjudication proceedings concluded on Oct 7 with ED’s adjudicating authority ordering seizure of PCFS’s properties, worth Rs 252 crore, in India.PCFS, a subsidiary of Norway’s Opera Group, came under ED lens after a probe revealed it was involved in lending money through mobile app “CashBean”.An ED official said: “After carefully examining the alleged violations levelled against the notices and their written submissions made during personal hearings, it has been found that the alleged Fema violations have been clearly proved.”The investigation by ED’s Hyderabad unit into the company, allegedly under the control of Chinese owners, found that PCFS had made fraudulent remittances of Rs 429 crore to related overseas group companies under the guise of importing software licences and services.The investigation culminated in the seizure of several properties of PCFS held in India through three seizure orders passed during 2021.The seizure orders were confirmed by the competent authority in Feb 2022, against which PCFS filed an appeal before the appellate forum.RBI had said in Feb two years ago: “PCFS was found to be charging usurious rates of interest and other charges to its borrowers apart from indulging in unauthorised use of logos of RBI and CBI for recovery from borrowers in violation of the fair practices code.” RBI cancelled PCFS’s registration and debarred it from acting as an NBFC.On June 21, 2022, a complaint was filed by ED before the adjudicating authority against PCFS and others under Fema Section 16 charging them with violations of various provisions of the law.The next day a show-cause notice was issued followed by personal hearings.However, one of the persons on whom notice was served, Zhang Hong, then country head of PCFS during the contravention period, neither replied to the notice nor took the opportunity of a personal hearing.",PC Financial Services (PCFS) is a subsidiary of Norway’s Opera Group.

""The test that the court should adopt in this type of cases is to make an endeavour to ascertain on the basis of materials on record whether there is anything to indicate even prima facie that accused intended the consequences of the act, i.e., suicide.

TD Bank has become the largest bank in US history to plead guilty to breaking federal money laundering laws. The bank has agreed to pay $3 billion in penalties, as announced by government officials on Thursday.The bank admitted to conspiring to launder money and failing to file accurate reports or maintain a compliant anti-money laundering program. This led to over $18 trillion in customer activity going unmonitored for about ten years.US authorities reported that three money laundering networks were able to move illicit funds through the bank’s accounts.Attorney general Merrick Garland said, “TD Bank chose profits over compliance in order to keep its costs down.” He stressed that bank employees ""openly joked"" about the lack of compliance on several occasions.The bank now faces an asset cap and other business limitations. This cap, imposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), is a rare and severe measure. It restricts TD from opening new branches or entering new markets without OCC approval.The $3 billion penalty will be distributed among the Justice Department, U.S. banking regulators, and the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. This settlement resolves investigations by multiple federal agencies and includes independent monitoring of the bank.Analysts had predicted that an asset cap could significantly affect TD Bank. Lemar Persaud of Cormark Securities noted that TD's situation is similar toWells Fargo , which also faced an asset cap due to a previous scandal. Persaud mentioned, “The TD probe has led to significant underperformance of the stock, and we believe, the retirement of the current CEO, Bharat Masrani .”TD Bank is Canada's second-largest bank and ranks tenth in the US. The bank began responding to regulatory inquiries last year, soon after it canceled a $13 billion acquisition of First Horizon . The investigation started when federal agents uncovered a Chinese criminal operation using TD branches to launder drug money.TD has invested in strengthening its compliance programs and has fired numerous staff members in its US branches.The bank recently appointed Ray Chun, its Canadian personal banking head, as the new CEO.

Employees are speculating that this policy could soon extend to other departments, potentially affecting a significant portion of Dell's workforce. Dell has mandated a five-day return-to-office policy for its global sales team, catching employees off guard and sparking widespread concern.The directive, announced via an internal memo on September 26, gave staff just two working days' notice before implementation.According to the memo obtained by Business Insider, sales chiefs Bill Scannell and John Byrne declared, ""The expectation is that ALL Global Sales team members who can work from a Dell office be on-site five days a week, regardless of role."" This unexpected shift comes mere months after Dell introduced a hybrid work model in May, which required employees to be in the office approximately three days per week.The sudden change has left many employees scrambling to reorganise their personal lives. In the memo, Scannell and Byrne acknowledged that workers had arranged their lives around coming in three days a week and ""may need some time to make new arrangements."" However, the memo did not provide a specific timeframe for these adjustments, leaving many employees feeling rushed and unprepared.According to the report, some employees speculate that the move could be influenced by similar decisions from tech giants like Amazon. A Dell technical support worker mentioned hearing that the policy might be implemented ""because that's what Amazon is doing.""Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a memo that employees are required to return to the office five days a week starting January 2, 2025. Amazon's decision is based on the belief that in-person work strengthens company culture and improves collaboration and innovation.A Dell spokesperson says that flexibility is encouraged and that team members should collaborate with managers to accommodate specific needs during the transition. However, employees report that office parking lots are now full, and workspaces are packed, indicating widespread compliance with the new policy.","Dell has mandated a five-day return-to-office policy for its global sales team. The directive, announced via an internal memo on September 26, gave staff just two working days' notice before implementation. Employees are speculating that this policy could soon extend to other departments, potentially affecting a significant portion of Dell's workforce.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114116730,imgsize-45586,width-400,resizemode-4/114116730.jpg"

Accumulated experience: Unlike those who achieve early success, late bloomers often spend years learning the ins and outs of their industry. This deep experience enables them to make more informed decisions, see opportunities others miss, and avoid costly mistakes.

Resilience and patience: Late bloomers tend to develop a thick skin, having faced failures and obstacles along the way. Their ability to bounce back from setbacks with persistence often becomes one of their greatest strengths.

Adaptation and learning: As they navigate the ups and downs of their careers, late bloomers are often more adaptable. They continuously learn from their mistakes and evolve their approach, making them more capable of succeeding in the long run.

Financial stability: By the time many late bloomers find success, they often have a more stable financial foundation. This can reduce the pressure to succeed quickly and give them the freedom to take calculated risks.

Their journeys highlight the importance of accumulated experience, strategic thinking, and a relentless pursuit of opportunity. Through years of hard work and learning from challenges, these late bloomers not only transformed their own lives but also made significant impacts on the global economy, inspiring countless others to pursue their dreams regardless of age.Meet the business figures who became billionaires after the age of 40. Let's know more about their case studies.Let's explore a few individuals who reached billionaire status after the age of 40. Their stories offer deep insights into how late bloomers can achieve monumental success, often after years of laying the groundwork.Henry Ford’s impact on the automotive industry is legendary. He didn’t start the Ford Motor Company until he was in his late 30s, but his revolutionary use of the assembly line transformed automobile manufacturing. His vision to make cars affordable for the general public led to the creation of the Model T in 1908, which became the first mass-produced automobile. Ford’s approach not only revolutionised transportation but also shaped modern industrial practices. By the age of 40, Ford had reached billionaire status, but it was years of trial and error before he truly revolutionised the industry.Ray Kroc's story is a testament to perseverance. Before discovering McDonald's, Kroc spent decades as a travelling salesman. At 52, Kroc met the McDonald brothers and saw an opportunity to expand their small, innovative restaurant. Purchasing the franchise rights, Kroc grew McDonald's into the largest fast-food franchise in the world. His success didn’t come quickly, but his vision, determination, and ability to scale operations changed the way the world eats.Harland Sanders, better known as Colonel Sanders, didn’t find success with Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) until he was 62. He spent much of his early life working in various jobs, including as a railroad worker and gas station operator. It wasn’t until he began franchising his fried chicken recipe that his fortunes changed. Over 12 years, Sanders expanded KFC into a major fast-food chain, eventually selling it for $2 million. His story underscores the value of never giving up, even when success seems out of reach.James Dyson spent years struggling to bring his revolutionary bagless vacuum cleaner to market. After more than 5,000 prototypes and facing repeated rejections, Dyson eventually found success in Japan, where his vacuum won a prestigious design award. From there, his brand grew rapidly, and today Dyson is a household name for innovative appliances. His journey is a powerful example of how persistence, even in the face of failure, can eventually lead to great success.Giorgio Armani didn’t launch his iconic fashion brand until his 40s. Armani started his career in the fashion world modestly, working as a window dresser before breaking into design. His brand, now synonymous with luxury, has expanded beyond fashion into music, sports, and hotels. Armani’s rise to billionaire status shows how a clear vision, combined with years of dedication, can lead to immense success.Warren Buffett, often considered the greatest investor of all time, didn’t reach billionaire status until he was 55. Known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” Buffett’s success came from his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway. He became a millionaire by 32, but his wealth grew exponentially later in life due to his disciplined, long-term investment strategy. Buffett’s story illustrates how wealth can accumulate steadily over time through patience, consistency, and an understanding of compounding returns.Sam Walton founded Walmart when he was 44 years old, but his early career included managing retail stores and learning the industry from the ground up. His innovation in inventory management, supply chain efficiency, and pricing strategies transformed Walmart into the world’s largest retailer. Walton’s late-career success highlights the power of applying knowledge gained through years of experience to build something groundbreaking.Donald Fisher didn’t enter the retail industry until the age of 40, when he and his wife opened the first Gap store in San Francisco. Despite having no prior retail experience, Fisher’s focus on trendy, casual clothing for a wide demographic helped Gap grow into a global brand. His willingness to take a risk on an unfamiliar industry later in life shows that it’s never too late to pursue new ventures.Radhakishan Damani, an Indian billionaire, transitioned from the stock market to retail in his late 40s. He founded DMart, a chain of hypermarkets, in 2002. After years of slow and steady growth, DMart went public in 2017, skyrocketing Damani’s net worth. His story is one of patience and vision, as he identified a gap in the market and built a business that would eventually make him one of the richest men in India.","A ""late bloomer"" refers to someone who achieves significant milestones in their career or personal life later than typically expected.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
