Must shield child victims of criminal cases: Madras high court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/must-shield-child-victims-of-criminal-cases-madras-high-court/articleshow/120246060.cms,"CHENNAI: Unlike legal safeguards and remedial measures ensured under the Pocso Act , child victims of other criminal cases do not have a support system in place, Madras high court has rued. The court has sought special measures and action on the issue.Disposing of a criminal appeal in a murder case, in which an eight-year-old girl was witness to the murder of her mother by her schizophrenic uncle, a division bench comprising Justice MS Ramesh and Justice N Senthilkumar said it is not an isolated case of a child being subjected to such trauma.""We have been handling several cases where innocent children are witness to several criminal cases. Even in cases where a child witnesses harsh quarrels between his or her parents, they undergo mental agony. But there are no regulations for child victims in other criminal cases to extend psychological evaluation or counselling,"" the order stated. The bench recorded the submissions of senior counsel Abudu Kumar Rajaratnam that National Policy for Children, 2013, though published in the Gazette of India on May 11, 2013, is still not implemented.The bench invoked the inherent powers to suo motu implead Union ministry of women and children development, Tamil Nadu home secretary, state social welfare department secretary, DGP and institute of mental health as respondents in the case and posted the matter to April 21 for further proceedings.","Madras high court has sought special measures and action on the issue.

Tahawwur Rana In India: Trump's Biggest Strike On Pak Terror, 26/11 Plotter To Face Justice Finally

Also read:

NEW DELHI: Worry seemed to flit across Tahawwur Rana’s face when he asked his legal counsels on Thursday night whether his trial would be over in a year or so and received “No” as a reply, sources said. They told him that just filing a chargesheet could consume a year, and that the entire trial, even a fast one, could take between five to 10 years.As he got a quick primer on the pace of the Indian legal system, Rana asked if he could plead the “Fifth”, to which his counsels said Indian laws also provide protection from “self-incrimination”, sources said. “Pleading the Fifth”, or invoking the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution, means refusing to answer questions or providing information that could incriminate oneself.Walking slowly in a brown jumpsuit with Crocs as footwear, wearing specta cles and a four-to-six-inch white beard, a fringe of white hair framing a balding scalp, Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security. His legal aid counsels (LACs) — advocates Piyush Sachdeva and Lakshya Dheer — were provided to him by Delhi State Legal Services Authority.Looking frail, tired, and jet-lagged, Rana displayed no other signs of anxiety during the court proceedings. However, the effects of age-related ailments were visible on the former Pakistan Army officer accused of a key role in the 26/ 11 Mumbai terror attacks. Rana suffers from various ailments, including abdominal, intestinal, and sinus cysts.According to sources, he came across as a “smart individual” who can strike up “casual conversations”. Rana was offered fruits by NIA personnel while waiting for court proceedings to begin, which he refused, but interacted “comfortably” with agency members. Sources said that Rana is being “taken good care of”. Govt and the agency want to make this case a “model one” so no one is going to take any chances, said sources.Rana’s major concern, apart from his claim that he is innocent and that extradition was not needed as he had already spent over a decade in jail and had been “acquitted” in the matter, was his medical care. On this, NIA assured the special judge that he would be provided all the medical care he needs. The question of “manhandling” also came up in the hearing, which was addressed by the court directing that Rana be medically examined every 48 hours.A US district court trial by jury had acquitted him on June 9, 2011 of conspiracy to provide material support to the Nov 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The LACs appearing for Rana urged the court to provide him with a “writing instrument” so that he can prepare his defence.The hearing for his remand was over within 10-15 minutes at around 11pm on Thursday. However, the order was pronounced at around 2am Friday.The prosecution, led by senior advocate Dayan Krishnan and advocate Narender Mann, submitted before the court that Rana is the first accused to be arrested and has links with named terrorists and other accused persons in this case. The counsels appearing for NIA told the court that a detailed investigation is required, Rana has to be confronted with a lot of evidence, and his statements would lead to additional discoveries.The court granted NIA 18 days’ custody of Rana. The agency requested 20 days, expressing concern that Rana might orchestrate terror plots like 26/11 targeting additional Indian cities. The court stipulated several conditions, including permission to consult with his legal representative on alternate days. The court also specified that Rana could only use a soft-tip pen and must conduct meetings with his lawyer under NIA supervision and within hearing range.","Tahawwur Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security.

Poll Should the reservation policy be consistent across all states in India? No, it should vary by state Yes, it should be uniform

NEW DELHI: The caste census report submitted to the Karnataka Cabinet has recommended increasing reservations for Backward Communities from the existing 32% to 51%, government sources told PTI on Saturday.The recommendation is based on the findings of the socio-economic and educational survey, also known as the caste census, which highlights that Backward Communities make up nearly 70% of the state's population.The report also proposes extending this 51% reservation to educational institutions in Karnataka. It draws comparisons with states like Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand, which currently provide 69% and 77% reservations respectively, in line with their backward class populations.According to the survey, the total population of Other Backward Castes (OBCs) stands at over 4.16 crore out of a surveyed population of approximately 5.98 crore.The report also places the Scheduled Caste population at over 1.09 crore and the Scheduled Tribe population at over 42 lakh.The caste census was initially launched in 2015 under H Kantharaj and was later completed by the Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes under the leadership of K Jayaprakash Hegde.The final report was submitted to chief minister Siddaramaiah in February 2024.","The recommendation is based on the findings of the socio-economic and educational survey, also known as the caste census.

Both sides disagreed on when the pause in strikes should begin and quickly accused each other of violating the agreement almost immediately.","A Russian missile struck the warehouse of an Indian pharmaceutical company Kusum in Ukraine on Saturday amid the ongoing conflict.

Paywall: UPI outage hits users across the country,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/paywall-upi-outage-hits-users-across-the-country/articleshow/120241983.cms,"(With inputs from our state bureau)

MUMBAI: India experienced the flip side of going cashless when Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the platform that accounts for more than four-fifths of all digital transactions in the country, suffered a major outage Saturday, leaving users struggling to make payments across malls, parking lots and shops.Users across India reported failed payments. Some got debit alerts despite failed transactions. National Payments Corporation of India, which operates UPI, reported ""intermittent technical issues leading to partial transaction declines"" which ""stabilised by late afternoon"". TNNNPCI said they regretted the outage and were ""working to resolve the issue"". The impact was pan-India, with complaints from people in Bengal, Delhi, Maharashtra, UP, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Assam and the southern states. A woman in the national capital said the outage inconvenienced people at a specialty hospital as it led to a long queue at the payments desk. In Lucknow, Ahad Arshad, operator of the popular food chain Red Dragon, said around 50 customers were unable to pay their bills. ""We had to note down their contact numbers for payment later. It was chaotic for about 25 minutes but eventually all dues were cleared,"" he said.Payment providers said they started facing increased failures just before 10am. There was no shutdown of services but a sharp rise in failed transactions. Success rates improved later in the afternoon. NPCI did not give any details of the cause of the failures nor about the increase in failure rate.Sources said that it was not a capacity issue as NPCI was used to higher volumes. The corporation was doing a ""root cause analysis"" and did not disclose the reasons behind the disruption.An Ahmedabad-based petrol pump owner, requesting anonymity, said they switched to precautionary payment methods during the disruption. ""We took UPI payments before filling fuel or requested customers to use other options."" In UP, from restaurants to retailers, users across the state reported that popular third-party payment platforms like Google Pay, PhonePe and Paytm were unresponsive between 11.20am and 11.45am.The disruption was the fourth in 30 days - an unusual frequency for a platform that has a highly reliable track record. Since its launch in 2016, UPI has scaled rapidly without major hiccups. Its ease of use - allowing peer-to-peer transfers at no cost - has made it ubiquitous, from roadside vendors to high-value transactions of up to Rs 1 lakh. Many consumers, now accustomed to its dependability, no longer carry cash.For small merchants, the outage meant missed sales. Larger retailerssaw customers switch to more expensive card-based payments, raising transaction costs.The impact ranged from a few rupees in rickshaw fares to larger purchases at petrol stations and shops. Earlier, disruptions on March 26 were also attributed to a technical issue. Banks said the outages on March 31 and April 2 were largely due to heavy traffic at the close of the financial year.The last time UPI faced a systemic vulnerability was in 2020 when Yes Bank, then a key service provider for apps such as PhonePe, was placed under a moratorium by RBI. The fallout led NPCI to propose market-share caps to mitigate single-point-of-failure risks. Despite these efforts, Google Pay and PhonePe continue to dominate the UPI ecosystem. Though transactions feel instantaneous to users, the process involves nearly 10 rapid-fire digital handshakes among third-party apps, their banks, customers and recipient banks, and recipient payment processors and their banks.","Users across India reported failed payments.

No, it could harm the shipping industry. Yes, it's essential for environmental protection.

NEW DELHI: India joined 62 other countries in agreeing to the world’s first-ever global carbon tax by bringing commercial shipping under this mechanism to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions in the sector. Under the agreement, ship owners will need to use cleaner fuels or face fines beginning 2028.Shipping currently accounts for 3% of global emissions. Since the sector is not covered under the Paris Agreement, the legally binding deal on imposing a global carbon tax on shipping to tackle emissions marks a significant development towards the overall 'net-zero' goal.The countries agreed on the global framework after voting at the UN’s International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in London late Friday. The agreement, reached after nearly 10 years of negotiations, aims to put a carbon price on shipping emissions. It is expected to help the sector decarbonise and encourage the use of cleaner technologies.The carbon pricing measures, set to be formally adopted in October, will become mandatory for large ocean-going ships of over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emits 85% of the total carbon dioxide emissions from international shipping.Under the agreed framework, if a ship continues to use conventional fuel in 2028 it would have to pay $100 to $380 per tonne of emission, depending on crossing the threshold of 'base' and 'direct compliance' targets. It is estimated that the carbon tax could generate up to $40 billion by 2030. The funds will be used exclusively to decarbonise the shipping industry.A total of 63 countries, including India, China, the EU, Norway, Singapore, South Africa and Japan, voted in favour of the agreement, while 16, including major oil-producing Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Russia and Venezuela, voted against it, and 25 countries, mostly the small island nations and Argentina, abstained. The US delegation was not present at the time of the voting, sticking to its principle of not engaging in negotiations.“Now, it is important to continue working together, engaging in dialogue and listening to one another, if we are to create the conditions for successful adoption,” said IMO secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez while commending the spirit of cooperation and commitment demonstrated by the shipping nations.Many expert groups pointed out that the agreement is projected to deliver at best 10% absolute emissions reduction in the shipping sector by 2030, which is far short of the IMO’s own targets set in their 2023 revised strategy, calling for at least a 20% cut by 2030, with a stretch goal of 30%.","India joins 62 other countries in agreeing to the world’s first-ever global carbon tax. Under the agreement, ship owners will need to use cleaner fuels or face fines beginning 2028. Shipping currently accounts for 3% of global emissions. Since the sector is not covered under the Paris Agreement, the deal marks a significant development towards the overall 'net-zero' goal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120245632,imgsize-15384,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"Presidents, governors don't have unbridled powers: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/presidents-governors-dont-have-unbridled-powers-sc/articleshow/120241790.cms,"Poll Do you agree with the Supreme Court's decision to invoke Article 142 in this case? No, it undermines the governor's role. Yes, it's a necessary measure.

NEW DELHI: Justifying its decision to invoke the extraordinary powers granted under Constitution's Article 142 by deeming 10 bills passed by the Tamil Nadu assembly to have received the governor's assent, rather than sending the matter back to him, Supreme Court said governor R N Ravi was ""lacking in bona fides"" and that ""it was difficult for us to repose our trust and remand the matter to him"".Questioning the conduct of the governor who has been at loggerheads with the state govt on a number of issues, SC said the constitutional head of the state of TN ""failed in showing due deference and respect to its judgments and directions"".""There have been clear instances where the governor has failed in showing due deference and respect to the judgments and directions of this court,"" court said.Appealing to all constitutional functionaries, SC said, ""When called upon to take decisions, such authorities must not give in to ephemeral political considerations but rather be guided by the spirit that underlies the Constitution.""Observing that bills if kept pending after their passage by state legislature militate against the very sustenance of a representative democracy based on direct elections, Supreme Court has ruled that neither the President nor governors have ""unbridled powers"" and neither of them has the power to exercise 'absolute veto' on any bill passed by the assembly. It said the constitutional functionaries have to take decisions in a time-bound manner and fixed it at three months for the President.Clearing the constitutional ambiguity over the role of the constitutional head of the country and those of states when bills are sent for their assent, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said the authorities have to pass a reasoned order and cannot sit indefinitely on bills. It said delay on their part as well as decisions taken by them are judicially reviewable and can be challenged in court.Settling a timeline for governors, it said a decision has to be taken within a month if assent is granted or within three months if a bill is referred to the President or to assembly for reconsideration. SC also accepted Centre's 2016 office memorandum fixing a timeline of three months for the President to take a decision, and made it a part of its order.""... the scheme under which the constitutional heads of both the country and a state respectively are required to operate, does not contemplate the idea of an 'absolute veto', thereby meaning that there can be no withholding of assent without furnishing reasons. This is owing to the fact that the simpliciter withholding of assent both by President and governor would be impermissible within the fundamental principles of a constitutional democracy,"" SC said.Elaborating on Article 200 (pertaining to governors) and Article 201 (regarding President) of the Constitution, it said both the functionaries are bound to give reasons in writing for withholding assent and the state govt must not be prevented from incorporating the changes or amendments to the bill. Though a governor is bound to give assent in case the assembly sends the bill again after reconsideration, the bench said it was not applicable to the President.It said the President giving reasons in support of decision is of paramount importance, and the court can make a presumption that the President and by extension, the central govt, may not have acted in a bona fide manner if the decision is not a reasoned one.The bench said, ""...governor does not hold the power to exercise 'absolute veto' on any bill, we see no reason why the same standard would also not apply to the President under Article 201 as well. The President is not an exception to this default rule which permeates throughout our Constitution. Such unbridled powers cannot be said to remain in either of these constitutional posts.""SC suggested the President invoke Article 143 of the Constitution to seek SC's opinion in case a state bill's constitutionality is questioned. ""... although the option to refer a bill to this court under Article 143 may not be mandatory, yet the President, as a measure of prudence, ought to seek an opinion under the said provision in respect of bills that have been reserved for the consideration of the President on grounds of perceived unconstitutionality. This is all the more necessary as there is no mechanism at the state level for the governor to refer bills to the constitutional courts for their advice or opinion thereupon,"" SC said.","Supreme Court said governor R N Ravi was ""lacking in bona fides"" and that ""it was difficult for us to repose our trust and remand the matter to him"" Neither the President nor governors have ""unbridled powers"" and neither has the power to exercise 'absolute veto' on any bill passed by the assembly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120241808,imgsize-777600,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Sarma: Fugitives won’t be safe abroad anymore

‘Judiciary will give him what he deserves’

Sarma recalls narrow escape during 26/11

What’s next for Rana?

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday hailed the extradition of Tahawwur Hussain Rana, one of the key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks , calling it a major diplomatic triumph for the Narendra Modi-led government. He asserted that the move should serve as a strong warning to fugitives enjoying luxury abroad that they will inevitably have to face Indian justice.Addressing a press conference in Guwahati, Sarma said, “Rana’s extradition is a big diplomatic victory because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji. American courts had earlier acquitted him in the Mumbai terror case only because there was no proper follow-up by the then UPA government. He was in jail in the US in connection with another case.”Tahawwur Rana, a 64-year-old Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman, was brought back to India by a team of NIA officials on Thursday evening on a chartered aircraft. His extradition from the United States marks a significant breakthrough in India’s attempt to prosecute one of the key figures accused of aiding the planning and logistics of the 26/11 attacks that killed 166 people and injured over 230 in Mumbai.Rana is accused of facilitating reconnaissance activities in Mumbai for his childhood friend David Coleman Headley, another 26/11 accused who is currently serving a prison sentence in the US. Rana allegedly used his immigration business as a front to help Headley get access to India.The extradition comes after a prolonged legal process in the United States, where an American court had earlier rejected India’s request citing double jeopardy, but eventually cleared the way following detailed submissions from Indian authorities and diplomatic negotiations.CM Sarma said the message from Rana’s extradition is clear: fugitives can no longer hide behind foreign borders.“This is a warning to all absconders. They may be living luxurious lives abroad now, but with Modi ji at the helm, they will have to come back. Their relief is only temporary,” he said.The BJP leader took a sharp dig at the Congress-led UPA government, blaming it for Rana’s earlier acquittal in the US and accusing it of “failing to pursue the case with seriousness.”Sarma expressed full confidence in the Indian judicial system, saying, “We have full faith in our judiciary, and it will deliver justice. Rana will get what he deserves.”In a personal anecdote, Sarma shared that he narrowly escaped the 26/11 attacks. At the time a minister in the Congress-led Assam government, he said he had initially booked a room at Mumbai’s Taj Mahal Palace Hotel — one of the main sites of the attack — but changed his plans at the last minute.“I had booked a room at the Taj Hotel, but for some reason, I checked into another hotel. That decision probably saved my life,” Sarma recalled.The chief minister said the horror of 26/11 still lingers in the minds of the nation, and bringing perpetrators like Rana to justice is not just about closure, but a reaffirmation of India’s resolve to fight terrorism.Following his arrival in Delhi, Rana is expected to face trial under Indian law and will be produced before a special NIA court. The agency is expected to press charges based on evidence already collected from international intelligence agencies and Headley’s previous confessions.With Rana now in Indian custody, officials say the case could serve as a precedent for extradition of other key fugitives wanted in terror cases, financial fraud, and organised crime.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma hailed the extradition of Tahawwur Hussain Rana, one of the key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.

"Tahawwur Rana arrested on arrival in India, appears before NIA court, sent to 18-day custody",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tahawwur-rana-arrested-on-arrival-in-india-appears-before-nia-court-sent-to-18-day-custody/articleshow/120177280.cms,"NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Hussain Rana , who played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives, was arrested by NIA here on Thursday after his arrival from US on a special flight.The Pakistani-Canadian terrorist was produced before special NIA judge Chander Jit Singh, who held an in-camera hearing on NIA counsel and special public prosecutor Narender Mann's plea for a 20-day remand. Rana was represented by Piyush Sachdeva, provided to him by Delhi Legal Services Authority. After the hearing, the court sent Rana to 18-day NIA custody.Rana's extradition process was nothing short of a nail-biter with fears of sabotage looming till the flight touched down at Palam airport's technical area. The home ministry and the office of NSA, along with Intelligence Bureau, constantly monitored the flight ferrying Rana, taking precautions to thwart any attempt to stop him from landing in the grasp of Indian agencies.Exercising utmost caution in extraditing Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a dummy code was generated for the chartered aircraft, a Gulfstream G550, ferrying him to India to avoid detection on public flight trackers and alleviate threats of an attack. The aircraft took off from Los Angeles in the early hours of Wednesday and landed in New Delhi around 6 pm, after a pit stop in Romania.Rana, along with his close school friend and fellow jihadi Daood Gilani aka David Coleman Headley, had left Mumbai on Nov 19, 2008, just a week before a gang of jihadi terrorists belonging to and motivated by LeT and trained by serving officers of Pakistan army landed on the Worli shore to carry out an attack in which 166 people were killed and which left the nation traumatised. The massacre marked the execution of a plan that Rana and Headley helped draw by selecting the targets to be struck.As Rana stepped on the tarmac in prison browns with NIA personnel clinging to him, he looked far from the unassuming businessman he had posed as when he checked into a Powai hotel in Mumbai in 2008. He had also visited Agra, Hapur, Kochi and other cities during this trip, supposedly to promote his immigration business, though NIA suspects the trips may have been a cover to scout for potential terror recruits for LeT.Rana, for long a strategic asset for Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistan's military intelligence complex, was placed under arrest at the airport, made to undergo a medical examination and whisked to court through a green corridor amid heavy security comprising a 20-vehicle cavalcade and SWAT commandos.On the plane back to India, Rana was seated in the middle with NSG commandos on all seats surrounding him, followed by senior NIA officials. Just after touchdown, the NIA acknowledged the assistance of US Sky Marshals who are assigned with secure transportation of federal prisoners, including inmate transfers via air.In a statement, the NIA termed Rana a key conspirator and confirmed his extradition. ""Rana was being held in judicial custody in the US pursuant to proceedings initiated under the India-US extradition treaty. The extradition finally came through after Rana exhausted all legal avenues to stay the move. The district court for the Central District of California had ordered his extradition on May 16, 2023. Rana then filed multiple litigations in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, all of which were rejected,"" it said.Extradition proceedings were initiated between the two countries after India eventually secured a surrender warrant for the wanted terrorist from the US govt.The extradition finally came through after Rana's various litigations and appeals, including an emergency application before the US Supreme Court, were rejected with the active assistance of the US department of justice's Office of International Affairs, US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, US Marshals Service, FBI's Legal Attache Office in New Delhi, and US department of state's Office of the Legal Adviser for Law Enforcement, the NIA said.For NIA investigators, the challenge will be to get Rana to reveal more than what he has already told US authorities. His interrogation will be aimed at getting to the bottom of the Mumbai attack conspiracy and exposing the role of Pakistan-based LeT masterminds like Hafiz Saeed, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and others in planning and remote-controlling one of the deadliest terror strikes against India.","Tahawwur Hussain Rana played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives.

CJI Dipak Misra: Singapore Supreme Court Quashes 'Copy-Pasted' Arbitration Award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/singapore-sc-quashes-ex-cji-dipak-misras-copy-pasted-arbitration-award/articleshow/120141717.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major embarrassment, Singapore Supreme Court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) set up to manage dedicated freight corridors in India after finding that the tribunal headed by retired CJI Dipak Misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties but on different issues.Though the tribunal also comprised MP HC ex-Chief Justice K K Lahoti and ex-CJ of J&K HC Gita Mittal, a Singapore SC bench led by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said since the other two were not part of the earlier awards, it couldn't be ascertained whether they were even aware of Misra's ""copy-paste"" job.The Singapore SC was firm that the copying compromised the integrity of the arbitration process and thus it did not adhere to the ""principles of natural justice"".The court said, ""The patently substantial material derived from parallel arbitrations were extraneous considerations that hadn't been raised to the parties' attention. The material formed such a pervasive part of the award that it simply could not be overlooked. It was plain that it was neither contemplated nor agreed to by the parties that the award could be prepared by such a process. We agree with the (Singapore HC) judge there had been a breach of the fair hearing rule.""By its award dated Nov 24, 2023, the Justice Misra-led tribunal had ruled in favour of the three firms which formed a consortium to bag the contract for Western Dedicated Freight Corridor in Aug 2015. A dispute arose because of the Indian govt's decision to raise labour wages, leading to the consortium demanding more money which was contested by the SPV, and the matter was referred to the Justice Misra-led arbitration tribunal.Upholding the Singapore HC's decision to set aside the award, Justices Menon and Steven Chong in a 40-page judgment analysed the award, found it plagued by copying and in breach of the principles of natural justice. The Justice Menon-led bench accepted the SPV's arguments and rejected those of the consortium.The SPV contended that Justice Misra, during the arbitration, had used extensive material derived from parallel arbitrations. ""It is also common ground that the award was not drafted afresh. Rather, the parallel awards were used as templates, with adjustments made to account for what were thought to be the specificities of the arbitration,"" the Singapore SC said.CJ Menon said the SPV had abandoned some of the submissions made in the parallel arbitrations and replaced these with new arguments unique to the arbitration at hand. ""These new arguments arose because of the slightly different factual matrix presented by the arbitration: for instance, the difference in the length of delay between the issuance of the notification and the consortium's claim allowed the SPV to make additional arguments on estoppel,"" he said.""Despite this, the parallel awards were used as templates in drafting the award to a very substantial degree. It is undisputed that at least 212 paragraphs from the parallel awards were retained in the 451-paragraph award. This has several implications,"" the Singapore SC said.""We also consider that the expectation of equality between the arbitrators was compromised. While, as we have noted, there is no evidence as to what transpired between the members of the tribunal, it is known that the two co-arbitrators in this case were not privy to the parallel arbitrations. They would thus have had no direct access to any material or knowledge derived from those proceedings, but which appeared to have significantly influenced the outcome of the present arbitration. The integrity of the arbitration was, therefore, further compromised as a result,"" it said.",Singapore Supreme Court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( SPV) The tribunal headed by retired CJI Dipak Misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties but on different issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120142141,imgsize-543479,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Delhi IGI Airport Storm Causes 400+ Flight Delays and Cancellations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/45-minute-storm-blows-into-400-flight-chaos-at-igi/articleshow/120245433.cms,"NEW DELHI: Flyers in and out of Delhi faced double disruption since Friday evening. First, a dust storm led to many incoming flights being diverted to other cities on Friday. Then, there were long delays in these flights finally arriving at IGI due to the main runway being shut for upgradation, triggering network-wide delays on Saturday.Over 350 departures from IGI Airport were affected between midnight and 2pm Saturday, leaving thousands stranded. The average delay was 40 minutes, and many airlines had to cancel flights due to the scale of disruptions.Over 40 Delhi-bound flights had been diverted due to stormy conditions on Friday. The strong thunderstorm, with winds reaching 74kmph, hit IGI around 6.30pm and created chaos.The sudden change in wind speed impacted take-offs and landings, with Air Traffic Control suspending operations for nearly 45 minutes. The inclement weather caused a cascading effect with many flights arriving and leaving late from Friday evening to early Saturday.On average, IGIA handles 1,300 flights and about 2 lakh passengers (domestic and international) daily. The sheer volume of passengers affected meant stranded flyers were packed like sardines with airlines unable to give clear information on when their flights would operate. ""The weather-related disruption was such that despite our best efforts, there has been unavoidable inconvenience which we regret.This factor was beyond our control,"" said an airline official, with other airlines issuing similar statements.As hundreds of passengers were stranded for hours, many took to social media to complain about the chaos at the airport. Some passengers shared pictures and videos of overcrowded boarding gates. Dr Shalabh Kumar, a passenger, shared a video of a jam-packed gate at Delhi Airport's Terminal 3 on X on Saturday at 7am. ""There is utter chaos,"" he said.Aritra Mukherjee, a passenger, wrote on X that his Kolkata-Delhi flight was rescheduled for the seventh time. Another passenger, Ashutosh Anand, complained on X about the ""disgraceful state of affairs with Indian aviation"". He added, ""A 20-minute dust storm in Delhi has thrown the entire system into chaos. Our flight from Kolkata was diverted to Lucknow, made to wait 4 hours, then landed in Delhi, and now we've been stuck inside the aircraft for two hours because there's no gate available to deboard.""Sharing a video of a crowded boarding gate, Vipul Singh, a passenger, claimed that there was ""ultra mismanagement and a stampede-like situation at Terminal 3, Delhi Airport, due to poor mismanagement.""Delhi Airport tweeted at 11.53am on Saturday that previous night's inclement weather significantly impacted flight operations across the country. With disruptions continuing, Delhi Airport posted an update at 5pm: ""Flight operations at Delhi Airport are normal, but some airlines are still affected by last night's weather conditions. Our teams are working hard to minimise inconvenience. Please check flight status on our website and airline websites for updates.""IndiGo said on X Saturday afternoon: ""Ongoing air traffic congestion in Delhi is causing flights to be held for takeoff and landing clearance. Due to the consequential impact, a few flights across the network are impacted too.... recommend checking flight status on our website or app for the latest information. At Delhi Airport, pre-departure formalities are being completed as we await clearance.""On Saturday afternoon, Air India posted that air traffic congestion was continuing to hit operations. ""Disruptions have a cascading impact on flight schedules, we are making every effort to manage them effectively and minimise inconvenience, but some delays or changes may still occur.""The main runway was closed on Tuesday for about four months. IGIA has four runways, and currently, three of them are operational. Now, flight delays will be worse when changed wind direction (easterlies) leads to aircraft landing from Dwarka/Gurgaon side and taking off towards Vasant Vihar - instead of the other way round when westerlies blow. When easterlies prevail, as has often been the case since Tuesday, departures can happen from two runways and arrivals only on one.When westerlies blow - which is mostly the case - runway 27/09 can be used in mixed mode to handle both arrivals and departures, while runway 29L and 29R are used for only arrivals and departures, respectively. So, depending on whether it's peak arrival or departure time, two runways can be used for either during westerly time, thereby reducing delays.","Over 350 departures from IGI Airport were affected between midnight and 2pm Saturday. The average delay was 40 minutes, and many airlines had to cancel flights. The sheer volume of passengers affected meant stranded flyers were packed like sardines with airlines unable to give clear information on when their flights would operate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120245635,imgsize-24224,width-400,resizemode-4/120245635.jpg"

When Steve Jobs explained to President Barack Obama why iPhones can’t be made in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-steve-jobs-explained-to-president-barack-obama-why-iphones-cant-be-made-in-the-us/articleshow/120246122.cms,"Steve Jobs gives reasons why iPhones are made in other countries



US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his commitment to revitalising American manufacturing, proposing steep tariffs to push companies into producing goods domestically. This means challenges for tech giants like Apple, Dell and others who have huge manufacturing set-ups in China. Though over the past few years, Apple has moved some of its supply chain to countries like India and Vietnam; China still remains the biggest manufacturing base for the iPhone maker.The US President Trump sees tariffs as a way to drive manufacturing into the US, create jobs, and benefit the economy. And here getting the world's most valuable company, Apple, to manufacture its most popular product, the iPhone, in the US, is clearly part of Trump's vision. Last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Apple's commitment to invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years was supposedly a clear indicator that Apple believed it was feasible to build iPhones here. ""If Apple didn’t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn’t have put up that big chunk of change,"" Leavitt said.However, manufacturing iPhones in the US may not be as easy. A case in point is a report by The New York Times dating back to 2012 that highlighted conversation between the then-President Barack Obama and some of Silicon Valley’s most influential leaders, including Apple CEO Steve Jobs , during a private dinner in California held in February 2011. This was just months ahead of Apple founder Steve Jobs’ demise in October 2011.Each guest – which included Eric Schmidt, then Google CEO as well as Mark Zuckerberg , the founder of Facebook – was encouraged to pose a question to the president. But when Apple’s late CEO, Steve Jobs, began to speak, it was Obama who asked a question: “What would it take to make iPhones in the United States?”Jobs’s response was blunt and unwavering: “Those jobs aren’t coming back,” he said, the report cited another guest at the dinner as saying.Notably, a vast majority of iPhones, iPads and other devices that Apple sold that year were assembled in China. The reasoning, according to Apple executives, goes far beyond cost-cutting. It’s about scale, speed and skill.According to the report, Apple’s executives believed that the company's stance wasn't solely about labor costs. According to dinner attendees, Apple's executives emphasised the superior scale, flexibility, and specialised skills found in overseas factories.Apple airlifts 600 tons of iPhones from India and transported them to ChinaAs President Trump's tariff push for domestic manufacturing intensified, Apple strategically moved to mitigate potential financial impacts. Just ahead of the tariff implementation, Apple expedited the transport of approximately 600 tons of iPhones, or an estimated 1.5 million units, from India via six cargo planes to avoid the impending levies.","US President Donald Trump has proposed steep tariffs to push companies into producing goods domestically.

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA), in its ongoing probe into Tahawwur Rana's involvement in the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai, is focusing on the network of people who helped plan the conspiracy.Rana was questioned for the second day in a row as investigators try to understand how the large-scale attack was planned and who all were involved. NIA is also directing its effort to examine the possible links of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.As sources informed PTI news agency, the NIA is dissecting dozens of phone calls between Rana and Headley, using them to piece together the larger conspiracy that spanned continents. Investigators believe these conversations hold vital clues to the operational details of the attacks, and to those who worked behind the scenes.One of the leads includes a person based in Dubai, believed to have met Rana on Headley’s request. Investigators think this man knew about the attack plans. They are also checking if this ""mystery man"" was connected to Dawood Ibrahim or his criminal network known as D-Company, which is based in Dubai, as sources told IANS news agency.The agency is also looking into Rana’s possible ties with Pakistan’s spy agency ISI and terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which carried out the attacks. NIA officials believe the planning for the 26/11 attacks may have started as early as 2005.To support their investigation, Rana’s fresh voice samples have been sent for testing to match with calls made right after the attack. Investigators also suspect that Rana may have visited several parts of India before the attack, possibly to assist in planning.Rana was extradited from the US and brought to India on Thursday evening. A Delhi court gave the NIA 18 days of custody to question him. He is currently being held at the NIA headquarters in Delhi in a high-security cell.According to the NIA, Rana is being questioned not just for his role in the Mumbai attacks, but also to see if he was involved in planning similar terror attacks in other Indian cities. He faces several serious charges, including conspiracy, murder, and helping terrorists.The 2008 Mumbai attacks were among the deadliest in India’s history. Ten terrorists came to Mumbai by boat and attacked several places including the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, CST railway station, and Nariman House. The attacks lasted three days, killing 166 people and injuring over 230.With Rana now in India, the NIA is hoping to get a clearer picture of how the entire plot was put together and who all were involved behind the scenes.","Tahawwur Rana was extradited from the US and brought to India on Thursday evening.

The ill-fated helicopter that plunged into the Hudson River on Thursday, resulting in six deaths, had reportedly already completed seven flights that day and lacked flight recording equipment.The Bell 206 L-4 aircraft had conducted seven tour excursions before embarking on its final Hudson River journey, which ended in tragedy, claiming the lives of five family members and the pilot, as reported by the NY Post quoting the National Transportation Safety Board on Saturday evening.Officials confirmed the aircraft operated without flight recorders, and no video or camera equipment has been located at the crash site. Additionally, investigators have been unable to recover any audio recordings from the aircraft's systems.A significant portion of the wreckage has been retrieved, including the cockpit, cabin, forward tail boom section, horizontal stabiliser finlets, and vertical fin, according to the NTSB statement. The main rotor blades remain unaccounted for.All recovered debris is being sent to NTSB facilities in Washington DC for thorough analysis, whilst investigators continue to work towards determining the cause of the incident.Earlier reports about the crash indicated experts claiming that a mechanical failure may have caused the main rotors to hit the tail, breaking the aircraft apart. An aviation lawyer also noted the video suggests a catastrophic failure that gave the pilot no chance to regain control.Another report revealed that the tragedy pointed to the mismanagement of the private company New York Helicopter Tour as helicopter had reported a mechanical issue months before. The aircraft owned and operated by New York Helicopter, experienced a mechanical issue with its transmission assembly last September, according to Federal Aviation Administration data. Records show the doomed chopper was built in 2004 and had already logged 12,728 hours of flight time when it was forced into repair.The aircraft's most recent comprehensive inspection was completed on March 1.The investigation revolves around the helicopter that was midway through a sightseeing expedition along the Hudson River on Thursday, carrying Spanish tourists, when it suddenly descended and crashed into the cold waters.The Spanish family - Augustin Escobar, Merce Montal, and their children Augustin (10), Mercedes (8), and Victor (4) - along with Navy veteran pilot Sean Johnson, all lost their lives in the incident.","The Bell 206 L-4 aircraft had conducted seven tour excursions before embarking on its final Hudson River journey.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Bengaluru’s much anticipated Blue Line Metro to become operational in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengalurus-blue-linemetro-may-open-in-mid-2026/articleshow/120214727.cms,"Innovation challenge launched

BENGALURU: BMRCL has announced that the first phase of the Blue Line of Namma Metro , linking Central Silk Board with KR Pura, will become operational around mid-2026. The 18km line runs along Outer Ring Road (ORR) and through a major IT corridor in the city.BMRCL MD Maheshwar Rao on Friday exuded confidence of meeting the timeline, saying: ""We should be able to start the service around June next year. Let us see. It may slip by 2-3 months. Trains will come, and depending on the availability of labour, we will speed up the work. We are hopeful of opening the line in the June-Sept window.""Rao was participating in the launch of ‘Stamp: Nudging Commuter Behaviour' aimed at promoting public transport use. The event was organised by Electronics City Industries Association (ELCIA), in collaboration with Toyota Mobility Foundation (TMF) and WRI India.Providing an update on the Yellow Line (RV Road to Bommasandra) connecting Electronics City, Rao said BMRCL hopes to start the services by the end of May, as announced by DyCM DK Shivakumar.""We already have two train sets. Most of the tests are over. I think we'll be able to finish or get approval from the Commissioner of Metro Railway Safety by the first week of May. But the other part is that we require at least three trains so that you can make headway,"" he said.The official said initial operations on the Yellow Line will handle 5,400 passengers per hour, helping 2,000 vehicles go off the roads. While operating with three train sets, services will be made available at only five stations. He added that in the next one-and-a-half years, 15 train sets will be deployed for service, running at a frequency of 5-6 minutes at all Metro stations along the line.The Namma Metro chief also sought help from companies in promoting the public transport system. ""We are expecting more people from the Yeshwanthpur side and RV Road side once the Yellow Line gets operational,"" he said.Admitting that the recent Metro fare hike left ‘people worried', the official said BMRCL is now working on providing first and last-mile connectivity.The Station Access and Mobility Program (Stamp) Innovation Challenge, launched Friday, is an innovation competition seeking solutions to boost Metro ridership in Electronics City. The challenge is also open for global innovators, provided they partner with an Indian entity. The primary focus is on utilising behavioural science principles to improve public transport experiences.Solutions should encompass gamification (incentives for eco-friendly transport choices), real-time nudges (prompts during peak transit times to encourage shared mobility and reduce congestion) and inclusive access (behaviour-based solutions for improving last-mile connectivity, affordability, security, and user convenience for diverse commuter needs). The challenge will run from April to June this year.Selected participants will share a USD 100,000 implementation grant for solution development and testing. Additionally, participants will attend a boot camp at Ashoka University's Centre for Social and Behaviour Change to gain behavioural science expertise.The finalists will benefit in three key areas: Enterprise (support in business growth, pilot planning, govt liaison tools, and technical guidance), exposure (access to subject matter experts, govt officials, and local authorities for guidance) and financial support (prize money awarded to shortlisted teams).The challenge is organised by ELCIA and WRI India for all 200+ member companies in Electronics City (with 200,000+ employees) along with TMF and is supported by BMRCL and BMTC.

What will happen to Tuft student Rumeysa Ozturk as judge rules for deporting Columbia's Mahmoud Khalil?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-will-happen-to-tuft-student-rumeysa-ozturk-as-judge-rules-for-deporting-columbias-mahmoud-khalil/articleshow/120240798.cms,"Tuft University student Rumeysa Ozturk's plea is to be heard in Vermont Monday.

Good riddance: Trump admin reacts to Mahmoud Khalil order



What Mahmoud Khalil said after the ruling



The verdict of the Mahmoud Khalil case was crucial as several international students were detained by ICE after Khalil and are now waiting to be deported. An immigration judge, Jamee E Comans, on Friday ruled that Khalil can be deported as his presence in the US posed ""potentially serious foreign policy consequences"". The judge said the government established by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable.His lawyers said he would not be deported immediately as they would appeal the verdict. Previously, federal judges in New York and New Jersey ordered the government not to deport Khalil while his case remains in court.Tuft University doctoral student from Turkey Rumeysa Ozturkl who was detained by immigration officials near her Massachussets home has been demanding her release. She has filed an updated account of how she was surrounded by ICE officials who grabbed her phone.Rumeysa's case is like Khalil's, though Khalil is a US citizen through his marriage to a US citizen, Dr Noorr Abdallah who is going to be a mother next month.The petition to release her was filed in a Boston court and then it was moved top Vermont, which will be heard on Monday.Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, last year criticizing the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.DHS secretary Kristi Noem said it will be 'good riddance' once Khalil is deported. ""Mahmoud Khalil hates the United States and what we stand for—so his removal should come as welcome news,"" Noem posted.""It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country,"" Noem posted.""I would like to quote what you said last time that there's nothing that's more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness. Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process. This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family. I just hope that the urgency that you deemed fit for me are afforded to the hundreds of others who have been here without hearing for months,"" Khalil said.","An immigration judge, Jamee E Comans, on Friday ruled that Khalil can be deported as his presence in the US posed ""potentially serious foreign policy consequences"" Rumeysa Ozturk who was detained by immigration officials near her Massachussets home has been demanding her release.
