Bakerganj ki gaa-rantee: Patna locality sets tune for Bihar polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bakerganj-ki-gaa-rantee-patna-locality-sets-tune-for-bihar-polls/articleshow/110286365.cms,"PATNA: In the heart of Patna city, narrow lanes throbbing with techno beats and shiny neon lights wind past Bakerganj, Bari Path, Exhibition Road, Gola Road and many such prosaic places where, quite curiously, a brand new music recording industry is taking shape. Bakerganj is where politicians eager to add a filmy touch to their campaigns, and singers, lyricists and composers waiting to make a quick buck, come trooping in, looking for that one song that can put their careers on the fast track.“Kuchh achha gaana likhiye, bhai (write some good songs, brother),” is the strained plea one commonly hears in these studios. With poll campaigning building towards a crescendo, the recording studios in the city are teeming with candidates and officebearers of parties who walk in with queries and suggestions about songs and jingles for hustings and roadshows.Raghwendra Raghu, a composer and owner of a recording studio in Meethapur, said most visitors want to hear something “original and fresh”.“They provide us with their party pam phlets and manifesto and accordingly, I write lyrics highlighting their poll agendas. Once they give the nod, our team composes music and records songs. We make poll songs not only for Independents, but also for candidates from JD(U) and Vikassheel Insaan Party,” he said.For original songs, his studio charges up to Rs 15,000, and for parodies of popular Bhojpuri and Bollywood songs, between Rs 3,000 and Rs 6,000. Until just a few years ago, there were only 24 studios in Patna, most of them located at Bakerganj. Now, around 200 such studios have sprung up in Patna, churning out songs by the dozen every day — parodies, originals and covers sung by newbies and top artistes alike.Raju Kumar, owner of a recording studio at the old electronics bazaar in Bakerganj, said that while some parties have hired top-notch singers like Pramod Premi and Khesari Lal Yadav, who charge up to Rs 2 lakh per song, most candidates pick local Bhojpuri artistes.“We’ve been getting requests for video and audio-only songs from BJP, RJD, JD(U), CPI-ML and LJP (Ram Vilas). Bhojpuri songs are the most preferred. We tweak the lyrics based on what parties want,” he said.The music studios charge anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 50,000 to record a set of audio and video songs and jingles. Local singers get paid anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 7,000 per song, a newcomer charges Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 and seasoned singers, between Rs 3,000 and Rs 7,000.“Among the local singers, Khushboo Uttam, Om Prakash Akela, Laheri Lal, Amrita and Madhu Singh are the top choices,” said Dhananjay Kumar, owner of a music studio at Bakerganj.Among the poll songs that are trending are “Kamal ka button dabayenge, phir se Modi ko jitayenge” set to the tune of “Aisa desh hai mera” from Veer Zara, and “Aapka neta kaisa ho… Rahul Gandhi jaisa ho”, which is a mix of Bhojpuri and Hindi lyrics. “So far, we’ve received orders for more than 40 songs and done business of Rs 2.5 lakh, which is expected to touch around Rs 7 lakh by the end of the seventh phase,” he said.Birendra Vikram, who runs a studio at Exhibition Road, said his clients prefer inserting jingles and highlights of political speeches into the video songs to make them more attractive.“They play these songs on the digital raths and during hustings. This season, chhath geet, bhajans and patriotic songs are more in demand. We provide ready music to the artistes who can then experiment with lyrics. We do brisk business during panchayat, municipal and assembly elections and make around Rs 35 lakh, but during the parliamentary elections, we hardly manage to earn Rs 6-8 lakh,” said Vikram.Singer Pramod Premi recently posted his song “Sabki chaheti adarsh beti Rohini Yadav” on an online video sharing platform, which garnered 3.6 lakh views in three weeks. He has written and sung several songs for the RJD. Deepanjali Yadav, a local singer, launched a scathing attack on the PM with her Bhojpuri song “Modi ki gaurunty”, touching upon inflation, surgical strike, Covid vaccine, unemployment and privatisation. Another singer, Khushboo Uttam, has come up with “Upendra ji ke vijayi banai ho… Gas cylinder dekhi button dabai ho” by tweaking the lyrics of a popular Bhojpuri number.Similarly, songs incorporating BJP’s “Abki baar 400 paar” and Congress’s “Ab hoga nyay” slogans are also in demand.","Around 200 studios have sprung up in Patna, churning out songs by the dozen every day.

The two navies share strong bonds of friendship, and both have endeavored to participate in maritime partnership exercises at every available opportunity,” Rear Admiral Dhankhar said.Personnel from the two navies will take part in an exercise as well as engage in a wide range of professional interactions, including subject matter expert exchange, cross-deck visits, cultural visits, and collaborative community outreach programmes, during the visit. “We are visiting friendly foreign countries to share our experiences and best practices with their navies,” Rear Admiral Dhankhar.The deployment to the South China Sea, where China is locked in territorial disputes with its neighbours, is also taking place when the Indian Navy is closely monitoring expanding operations of Chinese satellite and missile tracking ships in the Indian Ocean Region. Such dual-use ships map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations of the Chinese Navy.India has been steadily upgrading defence ties with ASEAN countries like Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines through regular joint exercises, military exchanges and training programmes.Towards this end, the first-ever ASEAN-India maritime exercise (AIME) was also conducted in May last year.

ED to MHA: Probe AAP for Rs 7cr from foreign donors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-to-mha-probe-aap-for-rs-7cr-from-foreign-donors/articleshow/110285722.cms,"ED: Real identity of its foreign donors concealed by AAP

NEW DELHI: ED has approached the home ministry seeking action against Aam Aadmi Party for allegedly receiving Rs 7 crore from 'undisclosed foreign donors' in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act.In its letter to MHA, the agency has accused AAP of shielding the names of Canadian nationals who generously funded the outfit just before the Punjab elections in 2017.""The investigation revealed that AAP has set up AAP Overseas India in countries like USA, Canada, Australia etc whose primary task was to mobilise foreign funds for AAP India,"" ED claimed. tnnIt is also revealed that a target of overseas donation of Rs 50 crore was fixed for these volunteers in 2016,"" ED has claimed, giving emails and phone numbers of at least 19 Canadian nationals who, the agency alleges, had donated over Rs 51 lakh to the party.ED's letter said AAP received over Rs 7 crore in foreign funds during 2014-2022 in violation of FCRA, the Representation of the People Act and was punishable under the Indian Penal Code. AAP received funds from multiple donors from North America, Australia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait and Oman, besides other countries, it said.""The real identity of foreign donors has been concealed by AAP in their book of accounts to circumvent the restrictions on foreign donations to political parties,"" the agency said, according to sources. These donations were allegedly deposited in the party's accounts in IDBI Bank.The move, which comes close on the heels of the anti-money laundering agency including AAP in the chargesheet filed in the excise policy case, can potentially have serious consequences for Arvind Kejriwal 's outfit, including freezing of its funds.Under FCRA, no political party is allowed to receive funds from foreign nationals.The ED dossier comes weeks after the home ministry received a letter from Delhi lieutenant governor V K Saxena demanding a probe by NIA against AAP for allegedly receiving huge funds from pro-Khalistan separatists based in the US and Canada in exchange for a recommendation Kejriwal made on Jan 27, 2014 in his 49-day tenure as CM to then President Pranab Mukherjee for clemency to 1993 bomb blast accused Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar, currently serving a life sentence.The LG's office had attached a letter written by Kejriwal in 2014 assuring one Iqbal Singh of Sikhs For Justice, who had resorted to an indefinite fast seeking clemency for Bhullar, that he has ""already written to the President for the release of Prof Bhullar and would also be working on other issues including formation of SIT etc, in a sympathetic and time-bound manner"".""The analysis of foreign donations revealed that multiple donors used the same passport numbers, emails, mobile numbers and credit cards for donation,"" ED's dossier to MHA said.A money laundering probe launched against these donations after the arrest of former AAP functionary of Punjab, Sukhpal Singh Khaira, in a drug smuggling case led to recovery of documents revealing huge cash collections made for AAP by its overseas functionaries, according to ED. Khaira, who has now switched to Congress, was later questioned by the agency and he failed to disclose the actual beneficiaries.ED has accused AAP MLA Durgesh Pathak of allegedly ""siphoning off the funds collected during fund-raising in Canada in 2016 for personal benefits"". The agency substantiated its claims through emails exchanged between various AAP volunteers and functionaries, including Aniket Saxena (coordinator of AAP Overseas India), Kumar Vishwas (then convener of AAP Overseas India), Kapil Bhardwaj (AAP member) and Pathak.Pathak is also being investigated to ascertain his involvement in the excise policy case.The agency said FCRA violation and other irregularities in receiving foreign funds by AAP emerged during investigation in a case registered in Fazilka district of Punjab against an international drugs cartel involved in smuggling heroin from Pakistan.The probe began after a special court in Fazilka issued summons to Khaira, then an AAP MLA, as an accused. ED later searched the residences of Khaira and his associates which ""resulted in seizure of incriminating documents containing details of foreign donations (four typewritten pages containing list of donors in USA and eight handwritten pages of diary)"", the agency said.",ED has approached the home ministry seeking action against Aam Aadmi Party.

BENGALURU: A seemingly fun experience with liquid nitrogen paan turned into a nightmare for a 12-year-old, Ananya (name changed), and her family when the girl developed stomach discomfort in the end of April.Shortly afterward, she was rushed to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed her with perforation peritonitis—a hole in her stomach. “I just wanted to try the smoky paan because it looked interesting, and everyone else was trying it too.No one else was hurt or felt any pain, but the discomfort I experienced was terrifying,” Ananya recounted.At Narayana Multispeciality Hospital in HSR Layout, the examining doctors determined that surgery was necessary to prevent further complications. Ananya underwent an exploratory laparotomy with intra-op OGD scopy, and sleeve gastrectomy . “Intra-op OGD scopy is a procedure where an endoscope, a flexible tube equipped with a camera and light, is used during surgery to examine the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum—the first part of the small intestine,” explained Dr Vijay HS, Operating Surgeon (Surgical Gastroenterology), who led the surgical team.Subsequently, a portion of the stomach, measuring about 4x5 cm on the lesser curvature, was removed.However, the incident has alarmed medical practitioners. “As the popularity of liquid nitrogen in culinary circles continues to grow, it’s crucial for individuals to exercise caution and prioritize safety. Vigilance and increased awareness are essential to avoid potentially devastating consequences,” stated Dr Vijay, who also mentioned a 2017 case in Gurugram where a person suffered after drinking a cocktail infused with liquid nitrogen.“We must take these isolated incidents seriously before they become a pattern,” he added.Ananya was discharged after six days.""Liquid nitrogen, with a liquid-to-gas expansion ratio of 1:694 at 20 degrees Celsius, poses significant health risks.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

SYDNEY: Australia faces the risk of power shortages because of delays in installing transmission lines tied to wind and solar farms, the energy market operator said on Tuesday, posing a challenge to the country's energy transition plans.In an updated outlook for the electricity market, the Australian Energy Market Operator ( AEMO ) said the delay in commissioning dates for EnergyConnect , a 900 km (559 miles) transmission line to connect grids across three states, as well as the mothballing and retirement of gas and diesel power generators in South Australia could impact the power grid.Australia's power industry is struggling to meet the government's target for 82% renewable power by 2030 from around 40% now due to challenges in expanding transmission networks to handle new renewable projects located far from demand centres.Compared to last year's outlook, the AEMO report said reliability risks have increased in New South Wales and Victoria, the two biggest power-consuming states, from 2024-25 to 2027-28, and in South Australia in 2026-27.AEMO CEO Daniel Westerman said, ""While new generation and storage capacity continues to increase, project development and commissioning delays are impacting reliability throughout the horizon.""Westerman said AEMO would bid for backup supplies to support Victoria and New South Wales to avoid supply gaps next summer, which usually begins in December in the southern hemisphere.Several Australian farmers are refusing to let high-voltage overhead power lines cross their land, which threatens plans to boost renewable generation and cut emissions.To avoid supply shortages, about 10,000 km (6,200 miles) of new and upgraded transmission line is required, the operator said in a report in December.","Australia's power industry is struggling to meet the government's target for 82% renewable power by 2030 from around 40% now.

"Trump trial turns chaotic as judge clears court, warns witness",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-hush-money-trial-michael-cohen-stormy-daniels/articleshow/110286253.cms,"‘Staring me down’

Admitted theft

‘It upset him’

The Donald Trump hush-money trial briefly devolved into chaos after the judge cleared the courtroom and warned a defense witness not to give him “side eye.”Trump had called his second defense witness, attorney Robert Costello, to testify Monday about his interactions in 2018 with the prosecution’s star witness, Michael Cohen , when the conflict erupted in the New York courtroom.Costello repeatedly gave answers that went beyond the questions, prompting Judge Juan Merchan to sustain objections from prosecutors and strike the testimony. After one such ruling, Costello said, “Jeez.” The judge looked at him and said, “I’m sorry?” And then Costello said, “stricken,” referring to his own remark.After more questions, Merchan finally stopped the proceedings and asked the jury to leave.“Mr. Costello, I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,” a visibly angry Merchan said. “If you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez’ and then you don’t say ‘Strike it’ because I’m the only one who can strike testimony in my courtroom.”After that admonition, Merchan appeared ready to proceed. But then he said: “You don’t give me side eye and you don’t roll your eyes.” The judge asked: “Are you staring me down right now?”With that, the judge said: “Clear the courtroom.” Dozens of people in the gallery, most of whom were media members, were ordered by guards to leave. Most people didn’t understand why they were being escorted out. The former president and his lawyers had remained in the courtroom, along with prosecutors.After several minutes, the judge allowed the public and the press to return. The judge recalled the jury, and Costello resumed his testimony, appearing chastened.Costello had earlier testified that Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, insisted to him in an April 2018 meeting that Trump knew nothing about a $130,000 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Cohen testified that he didn’t tell Costello about the Daniels payment because he didn’t trust him.Earlier Monday, prosecutors rested their case after Cohen finished his fourth day on the witness stand. The government alleges Trump falsified business records to cover up the payment, which Cohen testified was meant to bury the Daniels story of having a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.Costello said he first met Cohen days after the FBI raided his home, office and hotel suite. Cohen had testified that Costello wanted to set up a back channel to Trump and make sure he didn’t cooperate with prosecutors.But Costello disputed that, saying he only wanted to protect Cohen’s interests.“He was absolutely manic at the beginning and throughout the two hours of that meeting,” Costello said. “He said ‘My life is shattered, my family’s life is shattered. What’s my escape route?”’During earlier testimony Monday, Cohen admitted he stole $30,000 from Trump by adding phony expenses to his hush-money reimbursement. During his fourth day on the witness stand, Cohen was grilled on cross examination about a key element of a larger repayment he received for the $130,000 he paid to Daniels.That repayment included another $50,000 that Cohen said he paid to Red Finch, a technology company that did work to help Trump boost his standing in a pre-election CNBC poll. Trump had refused to pay the firm, so Cohen said he stepped in with his own money. But he testified he’d only paid Red Finch $20,000, passing the cash to the company’s chief executive officer in a paper bag.“You stole from the Trump Organization?” Trump attorney Todd Blanche asked.“Yes, sir,” Cohen said.Cohen said he felt entitled to take the money. He said he’d sought to protect Trump “the best that I could” and assisted his campaign, but was “very upset” when the billionaire cut his annual bonus in December 2016 by two-thirds — even after Cohen had used his own funds on Trump’s behalf for the payments to Daniels and Red Finch.“I was angered because of the reduction of funds,” Cohen said. “I felt it was almost like self-help. I wasn’t going to let him benefit in this way.”While Cohen initially testified to the Red Finch payment last week, he was asked about details of the theft Monday. He said he felt “pressured” to pay Red Finch for its work, so he got cash from his own account to give $20,000 to the company CEO.“It was in a small brown paper bag,” Cohen said. “He came to the office and I gave him the cash.”Blanche continued attempts to depict him as a liar and thief who’s made millions of dollars rooting for Trump’s demise through his books, podcasts and interviews.He pleaded guilty twice in 2018 to various crimes, but was never charged for the Red Finch theft, he said. The defense lawyers are trying to undermine Cohen’s credibility to suggest he was lying in testifying that Trump authorized the payments to influence the election.Cohen said Red Finch was hired by the Trump Organization to improve Trump’s standing in a CNBC poll. Trump ranked near the bottom, “and it upset him,” because he is one of the most famous business executives of the past century, Cohen said.A Red Finch executive told Cohen that he could acquire IP addresses “to create an algorithm to ensure that Mr. Trump would rise and rise significantly in this poll.”The firm managed to boost his standing to ninth, fearing that going to the top spot would raise red flags.Trump didn’t want to pay though, because “CNBC ended up not continuing and moving forward with this poll, and so he didn’t feel that he had gotten the benefit of what the services were supposed to ultimately provide,” Cohen said.Cohen then decided to pay Red Finch on his own, he testified.After the government rested its case, Merchan said that he now expects closing arguments in the trial to take place on May 28.","Defense witness Robert Costello repeatedly gave answers that went beyond the questions.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Twenty-one sailors aboard the Dali ship are enduring severe hardships as they remain stranded at sea. The vessel, which has been immobilized for an extended period due to mechanical issues , has left the crew in a precarious situation without access to essential resources.One of the sailors, speaking on the condition of anonymity, shed light on the dire conditions they are facing: “Life is tough.We don’t have access to proper food, water, or medical supplies. The situation is getting worse every day.” The sailor’s account highlights the urgent need for relief and assistance, as the crew’s basic needs are not being met, a New York Post report said.The ordeal began when the Dali ship encountered mechanical problems that halted its journey, leaving it adrift and unable to reach a safe harbor. Despite efforts to secure assistance, the response has been sluggish, compounding the crew's struggles. The lack of immediate aid has left the sailors feeling isolated and abandoned.Another sailor shared the emotional toll of their situation: “We are trying to stay hopeful, but it’s hard. We need help soon.” The prolonged uncertainty and harsh living conditions have taken a significant toll on the crew's morale and well-being. The sailors are confined to the ship with limited communication with the outside world, adding to their sense of isolation.The update came following reports that the 20 Indian crew stuck in Baltimore can not pay bills for their families in India as their phones have been confiscated by the probe agencies.Authorities are reportedly working on a solution to rescue the stranded sailors, but the timeline for such efforts remains unclear. The delay in providing assistance has raised concerns about the welfare of the crew, as their situation grows increasingly desperate with each passing day.Family members of the stranded sailors have also expressed their anxiety and frustration. One relative, who wished to remain unnamed, said, “We are worried sick. It’s been too long, and we need answers. Our loved ones are out there suffering, and it feels like nothing is being done.”Maritime experts have pointed out the importance of swift action in such situations. Prolonged delays not only jeopardize the physical health of the crew but also pose psychological risks. “In cases like this, immediate intervention is crucial to prevent a humanitarian crisis,” said a maritime safety expert.As the world watches and waits, the stranded sailors aboard the Dali ship continue to hope for a timely rescue. Their story is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities faced by those who work at sea and the critical need for efficient emergency response mechanisms in maritime operations.Meanwhile, recovery teams refloated Dali in the Port of Baltimore early on Monday and pulled it free of the main channel, two months after the boat crashed into the Francis Scott Key bridge and caused the span to collapse.Tugboats led the Dali to a local marine terminal after a successful effort to make the container ship buoyant at about 6:40am EDT (1040 GMT), the US Army Corps of Engineers said on social media platform X.The removal of the Dali marked a significant step in the Port of Baltimore's recovery from the boat's March 26 collision with one of the bridge's support pillars. The bridge's collapse killed six road workers and hindered traffic through the busiest port for car shipments in the US.President Joe Biden praised the team that freed the ship from its weeks-long imprisonment under the bridge's wreckage in a post on X on Monday.""It took the grit of workers and officials coming together to get this done,"" Biden said. ""That's Baltimore Strong.""",Twenty-one sailors aboard the Dali ship are enduring severe hardships as they remain stranded at sea. The vessel has been immobilized for an extended period due to mechanical issues. The prolonged uncertainty and harsh living conditions have taken a significant toll on the crew's morale and well-being.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110287312,imgsize-1128176,width-400,resizemode-4/110287312.jpg"

The report also claimed that Muslim families in India grapple with anguish and isolation as they try to raise their children in a country that increasingly questions their very identity.A recent report by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) stated that the share of the Muslim population in India increased from 9.84 per cent to 14.09 per cent between 1950 and 2015.""The share of Muslim population in 1950 was 9.84 per cent and increased to 14.09 per cent in 2015 - a 43.15 per cent increase in their share,"" the report said.In the same period, the share of Hindu population in India decreased from 84.68 per cent to 78.06 per cent.""The share of the majority Hindu population decreased by 7.82 per cent between 1950 and 2015 (from 84.68 per cent to 78.06 per cent),"" the report said.The report noted increases in the Christian, Sikh, and Buddhist populations, while the Jain and Parsi populations decreased.The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) is an independent body constituted to advise on economic and related issues to the Government of India, specifically to the Prime Minister.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also highlighted the report by the EAC-PM and claimed that the narrative that ""minority is in danger"" is false and has been exposed.

The decision, made by High Court judges Victoria Sharp and Jeremy Johnson, means that Assange's legal battle is likely to continue for some time.Assange's lawyers argued that the US had not provided adequate assurances that he would be protected under the First Amendment if extradited.They claimed that the US prosecutors had failed to guarantee that Assange, an Australian citizen who claims protections as a journalist for publishing classified US information, could rely on the press protections provided by the US Constitution.""The real issue is whether an adequate assurance has been provided to remove the real risk identified by the court,"" Fitzgerald said. ""It is submitted that no adequate assurance has been made.""The outcome of the hearing will depend on the weight given by the judges to the assurances provided by US officials that Assange's rights will be protected if he goes on trial. In March, two judges rejected most of Assange's arguments but stated that he could take his case to the Court of Appeal unless the US guaranteed that he would not face the death penalty and would have the same free speech protections as a US citizen.Assange has been indicted on 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse related to the publication of classified US documents by his website nearly 15 years ago. The US government argues that Assange's actions went beyond those of a journalist gathering information and amounted to an attempt to solicit, steal, and indiscriminately publish classified government documents.Assange has spent the last five years in a British prison and did not attend the hearing for health reasons. His family and supporters claim that his physical and mental health have suffered during more than a decade of legal battles, including seven years spent inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London from 2012 to 2019.President Joe Biden recently stated that he was considering a request from Australia to drop the case and allow Assange to return to his home country.

US pediatricians group reverses decades-old ban on breastfeeding for those with HIV,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-pediatricians-group-reverses-decades-old-ban-on-breastfeeding-for-those-with-hiv/articleshow/110265924.cms,"People with HIV can breastfeed their babies, as long as they are taking medications that effectively suppress the virus that causes AIDS, a top US pediatricians ' group said Monday in a sharp policy change .The new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics reverses recommendations it had in place since the start of the HIV epidemic in the 1980s.It recognizes that routinely prescribed drugs can reduce the risk of transmitting HIV via breast milk to less than 1%, said Dr Lisa Abuogi, a pediatric HIV expert at the University of Colorado and lead author of the report.""The medications are so good now and the benefits for mom and baby are so important that we are at a point where it is important to engage in shared decision-making,"" Abuogi said.The drugs, known as antiretroviral therapy, don't eliminate all risk of transmitting HIV through breast milk. Avoiding breastfeeding is the only certain way to prevent spreading the virus, Abuogi said.In addition, parents must breastfeed exclusively for the babies' first six months because research shows that switching between breast milk and formula can disrupt an infant's gut in ways that increase the risk of HIV infection.About 5,000 people who have HIV give birth in the US each year. Nearly all take drugs to suppress the virus to very low levels, Abuogi said, though viral levels can rebound if they don't stay on them.Before the medications became widely available starting a decade ago, about 30% of HIV infections transmitted from moms to babies occurred during breastfeeding, said Dr Lynne Mofenson, an adviser to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. In the early 1990s, about 2,000 infections occurred in US infants each year. Today, it's fewer than 30.The Apolicy comes more than a year after the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed longstanding recommendations against breastfeeding by people with HIV. That guidance said people who have consistent viral suppression should be counseled on their options. It also emphasizes that health care providers shouldn't alert child protective services agencies if a parent with HIV seeks to breastfeed.The goal is listening to patients ""and not blaming or shaming them,"" said Dr Lynn Yee, a Northwestern University professor of obstetrics and gynecology who helped draft the NIH guidance.Breastfeeding provides ideal nutrition for babies and protects them against illnesses and conditions such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes, research shows. Nursing also reduces the mother's risk of breast and ovarian cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure.The World Health Organization has recommended since 2010 that women with HIV in developing countries breastfeed their infants and have access to antiretroviral therapy. The guidance weighed the risk of infants acquiring HIV through breastfeeding and the risk of babies dying from malnutrition, diarrhea and pneumonia in places where safe replacements for breast milk aren't available.In developed nations, however, experts had recommended against breastfeeding because the wide availability of safe water, formula and human donor milk could eliminate the risk of HIV transmission, Yee said.That frustrated people with HIV who were flatly refused the option of nursing.Ci Ci Covin, 36, of Philadelphia, said she was diagnosed with HIV at age 20 and not permitted to breastfeed her first child, Zion, now 13.""I couldn't understand how come my sister that lives in a place like Kenya, who looks just like me with the same color brown skin, was given the option to breastfeed and how my option was starkly no,"" she said.Not being able to nurse her son sent Covin into a spiral of postpartum depression, she said. When she became pregnant with her now 2-year-old daughter, Zuri, her health care team helped her successfully breastfeed for seven months. Covin took her prescriptions as directed and also gave the baby drugs to prevent infection.""Breast milk has everything in it that my baby would need,"" Covin said. ""That's a beautiful thing.""Abuogi said the AAP report provides crucial guidance for pediatricians, nurses and lactation specialists who work directly with children and families.Some providers were already helping people treated for HIV to nurse their babies, despite the earlier recommendations. The new guidance should expand the practice, hopefully quickly, Abuogi said.""This is a unique situation because it's not just doctors and providers who are changing,"" Abuogi said. ""Our patients are pushing this as well.""","The American Academy of Pediatrics reverses recommendations it had in place since the 1980s.

As the IMF and Pakistan continue their negotiations, it is clear that the new bailout programme will require strict economic measures. However, Pakistan remains committed to the IMF loan program and has no intentions of replacing it.To be eligible for the ""new bailout programme,"" sources indicate that Pakistan will need to practice fiscal discipline by reducing spending and deficits in accordance with IMF requirements. Last week, the IMF mission ""asked"" Pakistani authorities to raise the general sales tax (GST) to 18 percent during four rounds of talks for a new loan.The IMF mission noted that Pakistan's sales tax collection system is problematic, as the centre collects sales tax on commodities while the provinces collect it on services. They suggested that the federal government should be solely responsible for collecting sales tax. Additionally, the IMF demanded an end to GST exemptions and an increase to 18 percent on both commodities and services.During the fourth round of talks, the IMF mission also called for reforms in the insurance sector and the establishment of a separate regulatory body.

Fresh corruption allegations levelled against ex-Pak PM Imran Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fresh-corruption-allegations-levelled-against-ex-pak-pm-imran-khan/articleshow/110249925.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's accountability watchdog has levelled fresh corruption allegations against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accusing him of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts linked to the state gift repository when he was in power, media reports said on Sunday. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) launched an inquiry against the 71-year-old Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi over the alleged misuse of the Toshakhana -- the state gift repository, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.The beleaguered former first couple has been convicted in earlier Toshakhana corruption cases as well.In January, Khan and Bushra were sentenced to 14 years in jail each by an accountability court for alleged corruption in state gifts they got from the state repository. The sentence was later suspended by the Islamabad High Court (IHC). The previous Toshakhana graft case was filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the charges of hiring the sale of state gifts.The NAB investigation centres on the illegal possession and sale of seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts, including diamond and gold jewellery, the report said.According to the inquiry, items such as Graff and Rolex watches and diamond jewellery were allegedly sold without being legally owned or deposited in the Toshakhana, as required by law.The Toshakhana is a department under the Cabinet Division that stores gifts given to rulers and government officials by heads of other governments and foreign dignitaries.Under the rules governing Toshakhana - a Persian word meaning ""treasure house"" - government officials can keep gifts by paying a price, but first, the gift should be deposited.The gifts were purchased/retained at ""considerably lower rates"" and were ""routinely sold"" without properly declaring them. The expensive Graff watch set was also allegedly sold without ""retention"", according to the report.The NAB's findings suggest collusion between the buyers of the Graff watches and a private appraiser, who allegedly undervalued the watches by Rs 30 million.The undervaluation, confirmed via an email from Toshakhana, meant that only Rs 20.1 million, or 20 per cent of the watches' actual value of Rs 100.9 million, was deposited into the government treasury, the report said.""During the course of the inquiry, it was revealed that the value of luxury gift items was assessed in an unscrupulous and slipshod manner by a private appraiser [...] was not even an industry expert and did not possess the required experience or expertise to make these assessments,"" Geo News said, citing the report.After the report findings, the accountability watchdog was authorised to conduct further probes against Khan and Bushra. Separate call-up notices had also been served to them, which they have challenged in the IHC.The court will hear Bushra's appeal on June 4 and Khan's appeal on June 24, the report said.The former-cricketer-turned-politician has been lodged at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since August last year. Since his removal from power in a no-confidence motion in April 2022, Khan has been convicted in at least four cases, including the cipher (secret diplomatic communication) case.","Pakistan's accountability watchdog accuses Imran Khan of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts.

Pakistan government forecasts USD 72 bn investment needed to meet 50 pc surge in power demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forecasts-usd-72-bn-investment-needed-to-meet-50-pc-surge-in-power-demand/articleshow/110249530.cms,"ISLAMABAD: In a comprehensive overview of Pakistan's energy landscape, the government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade. This forecast, outlined in the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP 2024-34) submitted to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), aims to bolster the country's power infrastructure to meet escalating demand, Dawn reported.Under the proposed plan, renewable energy sources are slated to account for a significant portion, with an expected surge to 46 per cent of the total energy mix within the next decade.This surge in capacity, estimated to rise from 42,000MW to 57,000MW, underscores the government's commitment to embracing sustainable energy solutions .The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) has provided insights into the anticipated growth in electricity demand, projecting increases ranging from 46 per cent under a low-growth scenario to 74 per cent in a high-growth scenario over the next ten years. To accommodate this surge, an estimated investment of USD 62-64 billion would be required, reflecting the scale of the challenge at hand, as reported by Dawn.The Transmission System Expansion Plan (TSEP 2024-34) outlines an additional USD 8.7 billion investment imperative for enhancing the transmission network. This allocation includes funds for both ongoing projects, requiring USD 3.2 billion for completion, and new projects necessitating USD 5.5 billion in funding.Employing state-of-the-art generation planning software, PLEXOS, the least-cost, long-term generation expansion plan has been meticulously developed. This plan factors in existing and future generation projects, policy frameworks, contractual obligations, natural resource allocations, and prevailing Grid Code provisions. It adheres closely to the National Electricity Policy 2021 and incorporates a series of assumptions to guide strategic decision-making.In crafting the base case scenario, NTDC has meticulously accounted for existing contractual obligations and projected retirements of power projects as stipulated in their respective Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), with the exception of KAPCO. The plan also factors in the retirement of 8,330MW of existing power generation capacity over the planning horizon.The forecasted demand is calibrated to accommodate the intermittency of variable renewable energy resources such as wind and solar PV, critical elements in achieving the government's ambitious renewable energy targets. With an estimated 87,600 hours of energy and peak demand forecasted from FY24 to 34, the plan aims to balance the evolving energy landscape with a diversified and resilient energy mix.By 2034, the envisioned energy mix will reflect a notable shift towards indigenous fuel sources, with local coal and renewables playing a prominent role. Hydropower is expected to contribute 46 per cent of the energy mix, accompanied by 10 per cent from variable renewable energy sources. The plan minimizes reliance on imported fuels, with RFO making no contribution and imported coal and RLNG accounting for a modest share of total energy requirements, Dawn reported.","The government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade.

Prachanda, 69, a former guerilla leader, belongs to the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), the third largest party in the House of Representatives (HoR).He will seek a vote of confidence in Parliament, the fourth within 18 months of taking office, amidst obstruction of the House proceedings by the Opposition Nepali Congress demanding a probe into the alleged involvement of Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane in the misappropriation of cooperative funds.""There is no doubt that my government will survive the floor test,"" Prime Minister Prachanda said at a ruling party's programme in Kathmandu on Saturday.""The differences between the ruling alliance and opposition parties will be sorted out through dialogue,"" he said.The Prime Minister is required to take a vote of confidence within 30 days if the party the Prime Minister is representing splits or if a member of the coalition government withdraws support. The Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) withdrew its support last week while quitting the coalition government.This will be Prime Minister Prachanda's fourth vote of confidence within one and a half years after he assumed the top executive position on December 25, 2022.The new government requires at least 138 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives to win the vote of trust.Earlier on March 13, Prime Minister Dahal won his third consecutive vote of confidence.Last year, Prachanda faced a floor test after former prime minister KP Sharma Oli-led CPN-UML withdrew its support to the Prachanda-led government following a rift over backing the main opposition party's candidate for the presidential poll.Prachanda's support has notably declined in successive confidence votes. In January 2023, he obtained 268 votes, followed by 172 in March of the same year. His support further dwindled to just 157 votes in the third-floor test.Currently, the ruling coalition holds a majority with 77 seats of the CPN-UML, 32 of the Maoist Centre, 21 of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, seven of the newly formed Janata Samajbadi Party and 10 seats of the CPN-Unified Socialist (CPN-US).Meanwhile, the major political parties have agreed to form a panel to look into the misappropriation of fund by cooperatives.","Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' has exuded confidence that he would win the trust vote in the House of Representatives on Monday.

NEW DELHI: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak issued an apology following allegations of a cover-up by the National Health Service (NHS) in a public inquiry report presented to the government.The scandal revolves around the infection of over 30,000 individuals with life-threatening viruses, including HIV and Hepatitis C , while under the care of the NHS between the 1970s and 1990s.Tragically, more than 3,000 of these patients died.""This is a day of shame for the British state, The result of this inquiry should shake our nation to its core,"" Sunak told the British parliament.He told the MPs, ""I want to make a wholehearted and unequivocal apology for this terrible injustice,"" and vowed to pay ""whatever it costs"" to make amends for the victims and their families.""I want to make a wholehearted and unequivocal apology for this terrible injustice,"" he told MPs, promising to pay ""whatever it costs"" to compensate those affected and the families of victims who died.At the heart of the scandal lies the use of contaminated batches of Factor VIII, a crucial blood clotting protein that haemophiliacs are unable to produce naturally. These tainted batches were imported from the United States and widely administered to patients during the aforementioned period. The infections occurred due to the lack of testing for HIV/AIDS until 1986 and Hepatitis C until 1991 in the United Kingdom.""The scale of what happened is horrifying.

Not in the sense of a handful of people plotting in an orchestrated conspiracy to mislead, but in a way that was more subtle, more pervasive and more chilling in its implications. To save face and to save expense, there has been a hiding of much of the truth.""The extensive 2,527-page, seven-volume document delves into the immense scale of the scandal and presents a series of recommendations.

Over the past four years the inquiry has reviewed evidence from more than 5,000 witnesses and more than 100,000 documents.The inquiry heard estimates that more than 30,000 people, including hundreds of children, were infected with HIV or hepatitis C, a kind of liver infection, from contaminated blood or blood products provided by the public health system.Many of those affected were people with hemophilia, a condition affecting the blood's ability to clot. In the 1970s, patients were given a new treatment that the UK imported from the United States. Some of the plasma used to make the blood products was traced to high-risk donors, including prison inmates, who were paid to give blood samples.Because manufacturers of the treatment mixed plasma from thousands of donations, one infected donor would compromise the whole batch.Others were infected through tainted blood transfusions that were given to patients after childbirth, surgery or accidents.Britain's government is expected to pay compensation of about 10 billion pounds ($12.7 billion) in all to victims, though details about that payment are not expected until Tuesday.Des Collins, a lawyer representing 1,500 of the victims, called the report's publication a ""day of truth.""""They have spent years bravely telling their stories, campaigning and spurring collective action in order to get to this point. For some, it has been 40 years since their lives were forever blighted or loved ones were lost in cruel circumstances,"" he said. ""Several thousands, sadly, have not lived to see this day.""Diana Johnson, a lawmaker who has long campaigned for the victims, said she hoped that those found responsible for the disaster will face justice including prosecution - though the investigations have taken so long that some of the key players may well have died since.""There has to be accountability for the actions that were taken, even if it was 30, 40, 50 years ago,"" she said.","Britain's government expected to apologize for infected blood scandal.

LONDON: The final report of the UK 's infected blood inquiry will be published Monday, nearly six years after it began looking into how tens of thousands of people contracted HIV or hepatitis from transfusions of tainted blood and blood products in the 1970s and 1980s. The scandal is widely seen as the deadliest to afflict Britain's state-run National Health Service since its inception in 1948, with around 3,000 people believed to have died as a result of being infected with the HIV virus and hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver.The report is expected to criticise pharmaceutical firms and medical practitioners, civil servants and politicians, though many have already died given the passage of time.It's also set to pave the way to a huge compensation bill that the British government will be under pressure to rapidly pay out.Had it not been for the tireless campaigners, many of whom saw loved ones die decades too soon, the scale of the scandal may have remained hidden forever.""This whole scandal has blanketed my entire life,"" said Jason Evans, who was four when his father died at the age of 31 in 1993 after contracting HIV and hepatitis from an infected blood plasma product.""My dad knew he was dying and he took many home videos, which I've got and replayed over and over again growing up because that's really all I had,"" he added.Evans was instrumental in the decision by then Prime Minister Theresa May to establish the inquiry in 2017. He said he just ""couldn't let it go."" His hope is that on Monday, he and countless others, can.Here is a look at what the scandal was about and what the report's impact may be.In the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of people who needed blood transfusions, for example after childbirth or surgery, became exposed to blood tainted with hepatitis, including an as yet unknown kind that was later termed Hepatitis C, and the HIV virus.Those with haemophilia, a condition affecting the blood's ability to clot, became exposed to what was sold as a revolutionary new treatment derived from blood plasma.In the UK, the NHS, which treats the vast majority of people, started using the new treatment in the early 1970s. It was called Factor VIII. It was more convenient when compared with an alternative treatment and was dubbed a wonder drug.Demand soon outstripped domestic sources of supply, so health officials began importing Factor VIII from the US, where a high proportion of plasma donations came from prisoners and drug users who were paid to donate blood.That dramatically raised the risk of the plasma being contaminated.Factor VIII was made by mixing plasma from thousands of donations. In this pooling, one infected donor would compromise the whole batch.The inquiry heard estimates that more than 30,000 people were infected from compromised blood or blood products via transfusions or Factor VIII.By the mid 1970s, there was evidence haemophiliacs being treated with Factor VIII were more prone to hepatitis. The World Health Organisation, which had warned in 1953 of the hepatitis risks associated with the mass pooling of plasma products, urged countries not to import plasma.AIDS, the biggest public health crisis since World War II, turned up in the early 1980s. Originally thought to be isolated to the gay community, it soon started appearing among haemophiliacs and those who had received blood transfusions.Though the cause of AIDS - HIV - was not identified until 1983, warnings had been relayed to the UK government the year before that the causative agent could be transmitted by blood products.The government argued there was no conclusive proof. Patients were not informed of the risk, and persisted with a treatment that put them in mortal danger.The inquiry is expected to conclude that lessons from as early as the 1940s had been ignored.Campaigners argue that since the 1940s it had been clear that heat killed hepatitis in another plasma product, Albumin. They say authorities could have made Factor VIII safe before it was sold.Evidence given to the inquiry suggested that authorities' main objection was financial. Non-heated Factor VIII was prescribed by the NHS until late 1985.Campaigners hope the inquiry's core finding is that Factor VIII concentrates should never have been licensed for use unless heated.In the late 1980s, victims and their families called for compensation on the grounds of medical negligence.Though the government set up a charity to make one-off support payments to those infected with HIV in the early 1990s, it did not admit liability or responsibility and victims were pressured to sign a waiver undertaking not to sue the Department of Health to get the money.Crucially, the waiver also prevented victims from suing for hepatitis, even though at that stage they only knew about their HIV infection. Years after signing, victims were told they had also been infected with hepatitis, mainly Hepatitis C.There was no further group litigation until Evans, whose mother ""crumbled"" after his father's death and who was called ""AIDS boy"" at school, brought a case claiming misfeasance in public office against the Department of Health.Combined with political and media pressure, May announced the independent inquiry. It was, she said, ""an appalling tragedy which should simply never have happened.""The government has accepted the case for compensation, with most estimates putting the final bill in the region of 10 billion pounds (USD 12.7 billion).In October 2022, authorities made interim payments of 100,000 pounds to each survivor and bereaved partners.The government is expected to announce different payments for different infections and also address how and when bereaved families can apply for interim payments on behalf of the estates of people who have died.",The final report of the UK's infected blood inquiry will be published Monday. Tens of thousands of people contracted HIV or hepatitis from transfusions of tainted blood. The scandal is widely seen as the deadliest to afflict Britain's state-run National Health Service.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110248235,imgsize-79606,width-400,resizemode-4/110248235.jpg"
