HYDERABAD: A software professional recently approached Cyberabad's cyber crime police, claiming that he had lost Rs 1 crore to cyber fraudsters.Police said the fraudsters, under the pretext of stock market investments, convinced the victim that he had earned Rs 32 crore. However, when he attempted to withdraw the money, he was denied access and given various excuses, while the fraudsters tried to extort more money.Officials said that the victim initially invested Rs 50,000 and later increased his investment, believing he was purchasing legitimate stocks. He was also regularly sent updates about the investment status.The victim had first fallen into the trap after being added to an unsolicited WhatsApp group. Once he realised he had been conned, he approached the police.In executing the fraud, the victim was redirected to a website impersonating a page belonging to a well-known trading company.","The victim initially invested Rs 50,000 and later increased his investment, believing he was purchasing legitimate stocks.

ITR filing FY 2024-25: Has deadline for Income Tax Returns filing been extended beyond September 15? Income Tax Department clarifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-2025-has-the-deadline-been-pushed-beyond-september-15-what-income-tax-dept-said/articleshow/123891607.cms,"Representative image





The Income Tax department on Sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) had been extended beyond September 15, clarifying that the due date remains unchanged.In a post on X, the department said: “A fake news is in circulation stating that the due of filing ITRs (originally due on 31.07.2025, and extended to 15.09.2025) has been further extended to 30.09.2025. The due date for filing ITRs remains 15.09.2025.”The clarification came amid a wave of unverified messages circulating online.The I-T department has urged taxpayers to rely only on updates from its verified handle @IncomeTaxIndia and avoid being misled by false claims. It further noted that its helpdesk is working “on a 24x7 basis” to support taxpayers with ITR filing, tax payment and other related services through calls, live chats, WebEx sessions and X.Over six crore ITRs had already been filed for the Assessment Year 2025-26 as of Saturday.The department thanked taxpayers and professionals for their efforts, while reminding those yet to file to do so before the September 15 deadline to avoid last-minute delays, penalties and interest.The filing window had originally closed on July 31 but was extended to September 15 due to revisions introduced in ITR forms earlier this year.These “structural and content revisions” were rolled out in April–May, requiring changes to filing utilities and back-end systems, which prompted the extension.While this relaxation covered individuals, HUFs and non-audit entities, officials have underlined that a further extension is “unlikely.”Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, though this attracts late fees under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act — Rs 1,000 for income up to Rs 5 lakh and Rs 5,000 for income above that threshold.Delays also trigger interest liabilities under Sections 234A, 234B and 234C. Moreover, belated filers are shifted to the new tax regime by default and lose the ability to carry forward certain business or capital losses.ITR submissions have been steadily rising in recent years. For AY 2024-25, a record 7.28 crore returns were filed by July 31, 2024, up from 6.77 crore the previous year, marking a 7.5% annual increase.With Monday marking the final day, the department has reiterated its appeal: file early, comply on time, and avoid penalties.",The Income Tax department on Sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) had been extended beyond September 15.

"SC refuses to stall waqf act, but stays some provisions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-refuses-to-stall-waqf-act-but-stays-some-provisions/articleshow/123908619.cms,"Abolishing waqf by user clause not arbitrary: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court, in an interim order Monday, refused to stay the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, prima facie finding none of its provisions illegal but suspended implementation of 'five-year practice of Islam' for dedicating a property to waqf till the Centre framed rules on it.The court also stayed a section of the amended law that provided for derecognition as soon as inquiry by an officer above the rank of collector begins into the status of a property as waqf, saying that it was prima facie arbitrary and not in line with separation of powers. It said that a determination by the official could not be treated as final, and as conceded by solicitor general Tushar Mehta during the hearings, could be challenged before the waqf tribunal and jurisdictional HCs.Even as Supreme Court on Monday stayed some provisions of Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, it found no merit in the challenge to the provision for inquiry into govt land being declared waqf property by an officer above the rank of collector and said, ""The govt holds the property in trust for its citizens. Any person who has wrongful possession of such property cannot be permitted to claim the same as his own property.""The bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih said that once the inquiry commences to determine whether a govt property has been wrongly identified or declared as waqf, the mutawalli of waqf board cannot create third-party interest in the property till the final adjudication by judiciary.SC rejected the arguments of challengers to the provision in the Waqf Act confining waqf only to Muslims and barring non-Muslims from dedicating their properties. SC said as the petitioners argued that waqf is specific to Islam, deletion of non-Muslims from the ambit of donation is not arbitrary. ""In any case, if such a person desires to donate his property, he can do so by giving or donating it to a trust or creating a trust for any of the purposes which were included in Section 104 of the Waqf Act, 1995,"" the bench said.To preserve religious character of Central Waqf Council and state waqf boards, the bench directed the Centre and states not to have more than four and three non-Muslims in the council and each board, respectively, recording the assurance by the SG during the hearing. SC also told the states to, as far as possible, avoid appointment of a non-Muslim chief executive officer, who is a serving joint secretary, of the waqf boards. The court refused to stay some provisions: challenge in court, in joint parliamentary committee, and Parliament, deletion of provision which barred non-Muslims from creating waqfs, application of Limitations Act to waqf properties, bar on tribal lands from being declared waqf, bar on declaring ASI properties to be waqf.On another intensely contested provision of abolishing 'waqf by user' provision, the bench said right from 1923 there had been a mandatory provision for registration of waqf property. ""We are, therefore, of the view that if mutawallis for a period of 102 years could not get waqf registered, as required under the earlier provisions, they cannot claim that they be allowed to continue with the waqf even if they are not registered,"" it said. ""If the legislature, on noticing misuse of the waqf properties, finds that after the enactment of the impugned Act all such applications should be accompanied by a copy of the waqf deed, the same cannot be said to be arbitrary,"" SC said.It also found no illegality in the prospective abolition of the 'waqf by user' clause. ""We are of the view that if the legislature, in 2025, finds that on account of the concept of 'waqf by user', huge govt properties have been encroached upon and to stop the menace, it takes steps for deletion of the said provision, the said amendment, prima facie, cannot be said to be arbitrary,"" bench said, and cited how in Andhra Pradesh the state waqf board notified thousands of acres of govt land as waqf and which was set aside by SC.","Supreme Court refused to stay the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025. It suspended implementation of 'five-year practice of Islam' for dedicating a property to waqf.

Parcel train with Kashmiri apples flagged off to Delhi; mandis protest Srinagar-Jammu highway closure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parcel-train-with-kashmiri-apples-flagged-off-to-delhi-mandis-protest-srinagar-jammu-highway-closure/articleshow/123906758.cms,"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha flagged off the first dedicated parcel train from Budgam to New Delhi Monday, calling it the start of “a new era of trade and business for apple growers and traders of the Valley”.While welcoming the launch of the parcel train, fruit mandis across Kashmir observed a complete shutdown in protest against the govt’s failure to open the Srinagar-Jammu highway, damaged between Nashri and Udhampur after heavy rain on Aug 26–27.With about 5,000 fruit-laden vehicles stranded, J&K agriculture minister Javed Dar described the situation as alarming. Dar said the train’s capacity is limited to around 180 metric tonnes and is still in its infancy. “Our priority will be to keep the Srinagar-Jammu highway open for traffic,” he added.Chief minister Omar Abdullah Monday said, “If the Centre is unable to open and maintain it, they should hand it over to us.”Omar said he would speak to Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari to press for the immediate reopening of the road.Earlier, the LG said the 7-day-a-week parcel train will transport 23–24 tonnes of apples and other perishable goods every day.“This will provide a faster and more economical transportation mode, strengthen market linkages, and bring improvement in the lives and livelihoods of farmers,” Sinha said.Kashmir Valley Fruit Growers Union president Bashir Ahmad Basheer told TOI, “Early varieties like Gala are already perishing on the highway, as fruit-laden vehicles have not moved beyond Qazigund in the past eight days. This is a serious crisis.”Mandi representatives in Sopore, home to Kashmir’s oldest fruit market, demanded that if the administration cannot restore the Srinagar-Jammu highway, control should be handed over to the Army, “which can make it operational within a day.”Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone accused the Omar govt of wandering aimlessly on the issue. “Inclement weather is not the fault of the govt. But sitting like a mute spectator and doing nothing is criminal,” Lone said, urging the CM to “sit with your officers and stakeholders and work out a strategy.”Iltija Mufti, PDP representative, accused the govt of “not acting” on the crucial issue.",Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha flagged off the first dedicated parcel train from Budgam to New Delhi Monday.

D'Souza vs. Mohd. Ishfaq wherein, it was pointed out that no sensible professional would intentionally commit an act or omission which would result in harm or injury to a patient as the reputation of that professional would be at stake and a single failure may cost him or her dear in that lapse. It was also pointed out that sometimes, despite best efforts, the treatment by a doctor may fail but that does not mean that the doctor or surgeon must be held guilty of medical negligence, unless there is some strong evidence to suggest that he or she is,"" the bench said.""'While acknowledging that the medical profession had been commercialised to some extent and there were doctors who depart from their Hippocratic Oath for their selfish ends of making money, this Court held that the entire medical fraternity cannot be blamed or branded as lacking in integrity or competence just because of some bad apples,"" it said.The court quashed the order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) holding the doctor and the hospital guilty of negligence. The court noted that the complaint had categorically asserted that the nursing home was 'inadequately and ill equipped' to handle emergencies during deliveries and had no facilities available for the purpose, and there were no allegations whatsoever to the effect that the antenatal care and management of obstetrician/gynaecologist were deficient in any manner.",The court quashed the order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) holding the doctor and the hospital guilty of negligence.

Mumbai institute finds gene tied to rare male infertility disorder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-institute-finds-gene-tied-to-rare-male-infertility-disorder/articleshow/123911167.cms,"MUMBAI: For years, a rare form of male infertility, in which men are born without the tubes that carry sperm, was blamed on a single gene tied to cystic fibrosis. Now, researchers in Mumbai have identified a broader set of genes in Indian men, including one passed from mothers to sons, that help explain this condition, called congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD).Although the research gained momentum in 2019, its roots stretch back to 2011. The findings promise not only better understanding of the condition but also more informed treatment options and genetic counselling for couples. Fresh from Parel's ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (ICMR-NIRRCH), a paper published earlier this week in Reproductive Sciences reported that so far, mutations in the CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) explain congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) in roughly 70% of Indian men with the condition. But until now, the remaining 30-40% had no clear genetic explanation. When only one tube is missing, the condition is called congenital unilateral absence of the vas deferens (CUAVD). It sometimes occurs alongside kidney abnormalities but is rare, accounting for 0.04% of male infertility cases.When both tubes are missing, CBAVD accounts for 2-3% of Indian male infertility cases and up to 25% of men with obstructive azoospermia (no sperm in semen).For these couples, IVF is the only option. ""Stigma is associated with infertility. Women are often blamed even if the biological issue lies with the man,"" said Dr Prakash Pawar, a urologist at Sion Hospital. ""Male infertility is a growing global issue. High-burden tertiary care hospitals see a few cases of CBAVD annually. ""Of the 93 men in the study, 19 had tested negative for the known CFTR gene. Using whole-exome sequencing on these 19 samples, the researchers discovered a new X-linked gene called ADGRG2, which can be passed from mothers to sons and is linked to CBAVD. This gene was found in two of the 19 men studied. ""Research groups in Europe and other countries have also reported similar pathogenic variants in ADGRG2. What makes our study significant is that this is the first time ADGRG2 has been identified in Indian men with infertility,"" said Dr Rahul Gajbhiye, scientist at ICMR-NIRRCH and principal investigator of the study. He said that in light of the findings, whole-exome sequencing should be considered for genetic screening of CBAVD, covering CFTR, ADGRG2, and other candidate genes, before couples undergo intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a procedure in which sperm is retrieved directly from the testicles and injected into the egg in the lab.","For years, a rare form of male infertility was blamed on a single gene tied to cystic fibrosis.

SC's endorsement of clauses in 2025 Act based on 100-yr mismanagement history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scs-endorsement-of-clauses-in-2025-act-based-on-100-yr-mismanagement-history/articleshow/123911026.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court's prima facie endorsement of non-arbitrariness of provisions of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, was principally based on a 100-year history of mismanagement and misappropriation of sprawling properties and valuable assets donated for charity by benevolent Muslims and the remedial regulations enacted since 1923.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih traced more than 100 years of documented history relating to regulation of waqfs starting from the Waqf Act of 1923, which noticed that the endowments made by pious and public-spirited Muslims were being wasted or systematically misappropriated by those managing them.Writing the 128-page judgment on the interim order, CJI Gavai said the enactment of the 1923 Act was necessitated as people increasingly found waqf endowment being used as a ""clever device"" to tie up property to defeat creditors and generally to evade the law under the cloak of a plausible dedication to the Almighty. ""A system of compulsory registration not merely about the fact of the waqf but also the nature, extent and other incidents of the waqf was found to be necessary even at that point of time,"" the CJI said, and drew similarity with similar clauses under the 2025 Act.SC said that the 1923 Act made it an obligation for each waqf to furnish its particulars and allowed verification of credentials, including accounts, by officials.""Not only that, but a penalty was also provided for a person who failed to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act.""After referring to the Bengal Waqf Act of 1934, the bench took note of the provisions of the Waqf Act, 1954, under which a state govt was required to inquire into the existence of waqfs and the properties administered by them through an official. ""The provisions with regard to compulsory registration of every waqf also continued under the 1954 Act,"" it said.To find out the working of the 1954 Act, Centre had appointed an inquiry committee, which in 1975 recommended ""no Mutawalli who has failed to have waqfs registered as required under the 1954 Act should be provided with the facility of enforcing any right in a court of law unless he has duly registered his waqf as required under the Act.""Though the 1954 Act was amended in 1959, 1964 and 1969, the committee's recommendation was incorporated in the Waqf Amendment Act of 1984, which was opposed by Muslims leading to the law being placed in cold storage.In another parallel with the 2025 Act, SC said the 1995 Waqf Amendment Act provided a detailed procedure for registration of waqfs and bar on enforcement of rights on behalf of unregistered ones, which was in existence till 2013 and was removed hurriedly before the 2014 LS polls.",A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih traced more than 100 years of documented history relating to regulation of waqfs.

Only 45% of students feel ready for life beyond school: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-45-of-students-feel-ready-for-life-beyond-school-study/articleshow/123910895.cms,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Less than half of students, including those in India, felt well prepared for their next educational step, and only 45% felt ready for life beyond school, according to a global survey.Conducted by Cambridge University Press and Assessment, the survey - Preparing Learners to Thrive in a Changing World: The View from International Education - will be released on Tuesday and drew responses from 3,021 teachers and 3,840 students across 150 countries, including a weighted sample of South-Asian participants.Subject knowledge, once the undisputed passport to success, now looks more like a short-term currency. Though teachers and students still see it as vital for clearing exams, it was the least-selected priority for life after school, according to the report.Teachers are more optimistic: more than two-thirds say their students are ready for the next step and many stress leadership and self-management skills.Yet complacency looms; an Indian student observed: ""As AI grows... memorising subject knowledge matters less.""Students still prize subject knowledge for exams but ranked leadership, management and business skills highest for life beyond school. An Indian teacher noted that many pupils ""have made short-term plans for next one or two years"" yet are unsure about postgraduation choices.According to Rod Smith, Cambridge's head of international education, South Asian parents, who once focused on which university their child could enter, now ask whether schooling ""will prepare you with the kind of skills that are going to make you successful in a future world"". Self-management illustrates the gap: one in four teachers identified it as the hardest skill to teach, and about 19% of students found it hardest to learn. Technology amplifies the challenge - two-thirds of students worry about distraction from devices, and 88% of teachers say attention spans are shrinking.Interpersonal skills also suffer. Teachers cite fear of judgment and social anxiety as the biggest barriers to developing interpersonal skills, and 60% see decreased social skills as a major downside of technology, the survey found.A school leader from India warned that technology connects learners but ""has limited understanding in the way it offers solutions,"" narrowing world views. Another student said communication skills are vital because ""we need to exchange ideas... before it gets out of hand."" Experts in the report stress that subject knowledge is more important than ever; without a solid base, AI can mislead rather than empower. Smith echoed this, saying over-reliance on technology ""leads you down dead end. ""Cambridge plans to help schools balance rigorous subject knowledge with chances to practise self-management, leadership & communication.For India, where parents have invested heavily in education, the findings are a call to action. Students may undervalue their readiness, but teachers see potential.

PM puts thrust on

self-reliance in defence production

KOLKATA/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Monday directed the defence ministry to 'swiftly implement concrete steps' to achieve greater jointness, atmanirbharta and innovation to meet future challenges, amid the continuing differences among the Army, Navy and IAF over the creation of theatre commands for an integrated and cost-effective war-fighting machinery.Inaugurating the biennial three-day combined commanders conference (CCC) at Kolkata, the PM also reviewed the security situation and operational readiness of the armed forces in the context of the ""new normal"" created by Operation Sindoor, while being briefed on the future of warfare in the backdrop of emerging technology and tactics. tnnAs per the ""new normal"" laid down by PM Modi after the strikes against Pakistan during the May 7-10 hostilities, any act of cross-border terror will be treated as an act of war and be met with a decisive response. ""Moreover, the PM has made it clear that Pakistan's nuclear sabre-rattling will not prevent India from striking terror bases, with no distinction being made between terrorists and their sponsors,"" an official said.The PM complimented the armed forces for the success of Operation Sindoor as well as the integral role they play in nation-building, anti-piracy, safe return of Indian citizens from conflict zones and providing humanitarian assistance to friendly countries.The CCC at Easter Command headquarters in Vijay Durg, Kolkata, is being attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, national security adviser Ajit Doval, chief of defence staff Anil Chauhan, the three service chiefs and other top military officers and bureaucrats. Singh will address the commanders on Tuesday.Defence officials said that key topics under discussion include enhancing inter-service coordination, streamlining procurement processes, adopting advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and unmanned systems, and improving training frameworks for multi-domain operations. The conference emphasised the need to shift from traditional paradigms of warfare to agile, network-centric, and technology-driven military strategies.Reviewing the defence reforms implemented over the last two years, and the plan for the next two years, the PM's main thrust was on the urgent need for jointness among the armed forces, self-reliance in defence production and innovation to enhance operational readiness and ""prevail against any eventuality"" in the years ahead.The Modi govt has been pushing for the long-pending creation of the tri-Service integrated theatre commands (ITCs), in the most radical military reorganisation envisaged since Independence. The progress, however, has been slow. India currently has 17 single-service commands (Army 7, IAF 7 and Navy 3), which do not have the requisite synergy in planning, logistics and operations.The plan is to have two ""adversary-specific"" ITCs -- one for the northern borders with China at Lucknow and the other for the western front with Pakistan at Jaipur.","PM Narendra Modi has directed the defence ministry to'swiftly implement concrete steps' to achieve greater jointness, atmanirbharta and innovation to meet future challenges.

"Delhi’s sex ratio dips to 920, falling for 4th year",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhis-sex-ratio-dips-to-920-falling-for-4th-year/articleshow/123909016.cms,"Lower education and higher fertility linked

NEW DELHI: The sex ratio at birth recorded a decline for the fourth successive year in Delhi, with 920 females being born in 2024 per 1,000 males, compared with 922 in 2023 and 929 in 2022. Delhi govt officials said the fall was marginal, but health experts sounded an alarm, saying that the trend pointed to illegal prenatal sex determination tests taking place in Delhi-NCR.The data was released by Delhi's Directorate of Economics and Statistics and the office of Chief Registrar (births & deaths) in its annual report on births and deaths in 2024.""The trend is of concern as there is a continuous dip now (since 2020). This indicates prenatal sex determination happening in the city,"" said Arun Yadav, former director of hospital administration of MCD. ""We need a continuous crackdown on these illegal units rather than sporadic raids.""Delhi also saw a notable demographic shift in 2024, with a decline in the number of registered births and a simultaneous rise in deaths, as per data released this week.The sex ratio in the city had shown some improvement in 2020 when it jumped to 933 from 920 in the previous year.Since then, there has been a fall - 932 in 2021 and 929 in 2022. A senior Delhi govt health official said the fall reflects the low priority accorded to inspections by district authorities. He said that fewer inspections have led to fewer show-cause notices and suspensions of registrations, weakening the entire deterrent system.The official noted that there has been a rapid growth of illegal labs offering NIPT (non-invasive prenatal testing) and karyotyping through home collection services, with reports being delivered directly to patients.Delhi recorded 3,06,459 births in 2024, a drop from 3,15,087 births in 2023. The average daily birth count decreased to 837 from 863 the previous year. Of the total births, 52.1per cent were males, 47.9per cent females, and 0.03per cent were categorised as others, which includes transgender, ambiguous or unstated cases.A majority of these births, 96.1per cent, took place in institutions, with govt hospitals accounting for 65.11per cent of all institutional deliveries. Domiciliary (home) births made up 3.9per cent, and among these, around 17per cent had assistance from trained medical personnel, while 61.4per cent relied on relatives or untrained help. Urban dominance in childbirth was significant, with 88.1per cent of the births attributed to mothers residing in urban areas, compared to 11.9per cent from rural parts of Delhi.In terms of birth order, 51.5per cent were first-time births, followed by 36.4per cent second-order, 10.2per cent third-order, and nearly 2per cent fourth or higher. An interesting pattern emerged when birth order was analysed against maternal education levels. Among mothers with fourth or higher-order births, 41.1per cent had education levels between matric and below graduate, while 16.7per cent were illiterate. Only 9.6per cent of such births were recorded among mothers with graduation or higher qualifications, highlighting a clear link between lower education and higher fertility rates.Another official said, ""Women with less education often have limited awareness of contraception and reproductive health. They are likely to marry early, leading to a longer reproductive period. Cultural norms in some communities encourage larger families, especially when there's a preference for sons."" He added, ""Also, lower education is often associated with reduced access to healthcare and fewer career opportunities, making motherhood a primary role. ""Educated women, on the other hand, are more empowered to make informed reproductive choices. Thus, education plays a crucial role in promoting smaller, planned families, he said. Age also played a role, with the majority of mothers, 37per cent, in the 25-29 years age bracket, followed by 27.1per cent in the 20-24 years group.Of the leading causes of infant death, 11.6per cent of institutional fatalities were due to septicemia, followed by 10.1per cent because of heart and pulmonary conditions, and 8per cent due to shock. Tuberculosis, hypertension, and liver diseases were also among the top causes. A senior official said, ""Septicemia is more of a problem in rural pockets when prenatal care is not taken well. Pulmonary circulation or other heart diseases can be picked up in the ultrasound and cured at the right time. ""Meanwhile, Delhi reported 1,39,480 deaths in 2024, up from 1,32,391 in 2023. This equates to an average of 381 deaths per day, compared to 363 in the previous year. Of the total deaths, 61.2per cent were males and 38.8per cent females, with 0.03per cent recorded under the ""others"" category. A total of 6,866 infant deaths were reported.Age-wise analysis of all deaths showed that 40.8per cent occurred in the 65 and above category, followed by 18per cent in the 55-64 years group.With inputs from Anuja Jaiswal","Delhi recorded 3,06,459 births in 2024, a drop from 3,15,087 births in 2023.

""On the basis of the report of the SIT, the court is of the opinion that the receipt of animals by Vantara by rescuing them from various situations and housing them in the rescue centre for conservation, and breeding programmes have gone through a complex multi-layered/multijurisdictional statutory approvals, procedure and documentation. The imports of animals have been made only after issuance of valid permits.Once the import of animals is fully documented and supported by valid permits, it is not open for anyone to go beyond the said permits and to dispute the validity attached to such permits or official acts,"" it said.Incorporating the SIT report, which was filed in a sealed envelope, the court said the panel found that welfare standards followed for conservation and preservation of the animals at Vantara exceed prescribed benchmark and the mortality figures align with the global zoological averages.""Upon consideration of the entire record, we are more than satisfied that the facilities at Vantara in certain respects exceeds the prescribed standards of animal husbandry, veterinary care and welfare as well as the statutory benchmarks laid down by the Central Zoo Authority. Independent bodies such as Global Human Society after site inspection and audit through a team has certified that respondent Vantara has not only complied with but exceeded internationally recognised benchmarks,"" it said.""On the so-called allegations of misuse of carbon credits, water resources, or financial impropriety, the SIT has found them to be baseless relying upon responses from agencies like CBI, DRI and ED. The deputy director, ED, from whom the SIT sought expert assistance, clarified that there is no breach of provisions of the prevention of Money Laundering Act,"" the order said.The court said, ""No further complaint or proceedings based upon such same set of allegations shall be entertained before any judicial statutory or administrative forum was to secure finality, obviate repetitive inquiries and investigation on issues concluded by the SIT.""

It marked the beginning of this year’s monsoon retreat from the country. Normally, the withdrawal process ends on Oct 15 - a few days ahead of the onset of winter monsoon in Peninsular India.It’s the earliest withdrawal of monsoon since 2015, when the retreat began on Sept 4, under the old regime where the normal date of beginning of the withdrawal used to be Sept 1 based on records during 1901-1940.It's also the earliest withdrawal since 2020 under the new regime when the normal date was revised as Sept 17 based on data during 1971-2019. Under the new regime, monsoon onset over Kerala remains the same (June 1). There is also no change in the final withdrawal date over south India (Oct 15). The normal withdrawal date for Delhi is Sept 25.Announcing the beginning of the retreat of summer monsoon on Sunday, the IMD also predicted that the conditions are favourable for its withdrawal from some more parts of Rajasthan and some parts of Punjab and Gujarat during the next 2-3 days.Meanwhile, heavy to very heavy rainfall is predicted by the Met department over northeastern states and Maharashtra for the next three days.Normally, monsoon covers the entire India in 38 days (June 1-July 8). This year, it covered the entire country in 37 days after making an early onset on May 24 and covering the whole India by June 29.Though early onset/withdrawal or coverage has nothing to do with the overall status of the monsoon, it certainly guides farming activities, and water and hydro-power management during the rainy season.Early onset of monsoon helped farmers begin early sowing of kharif (summer sown) crops this year. The early withdrawal by just three days will, however, not impact the acreage as the sowing operation has already completed in most parts of the country. Even all key reservoirs have enough water to sustain the Rabi (winter sown) crops during Oct-March cycle.IMD has predicted an 'above normal' monsoon this year and it's already reflected in over 7% more than normal cumulative (June 1 - Sept 14) rainfall in the country so far with northwest India recording nearly 32% more than normal rainfall during the period, leading to multiple disasters including flooding and crop damage in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir.Except east & northeast India that faced a cumulative rainfall deficit of nearly 20%, the rest of the country received surplus rainfall with the central India getting 10.5% more than normal rainfall and south peninsular India getting 7.5% more than normal rainfall during the monsoon season.Good rainfall this year in most parts of the country helped increase the total acreage (1105 lakh hectares) which is more than last year (1078 lakh hectares) and also more than the normal acreage (1096 lakh hectares) for Kharif crops.","The southwest (summer) monsoon started withdrawing from some parts of west Rajasthan on Sunday against the normal date of Sept 17.

Key cultural and social themes of this year’s celebrations include:

Unity and national pride among Emirati citizens.

Inclusion and participation of the UAE’s large expatriate community, invited to take part in public festivities.

A continued emphasis on modernity integrated with tradition, evident in the use of drone shows and digital storytelling alongside heritage performances.





The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2. Authorities have officially declared December 2 and 3 (Tuesday and Wednesday) as public holidays, with strong speculation that December 1 (Monday) may also be granted as a holiday—potentially creating a four- or even five-day weekend. As the country marks more than half a century of union, preparations are underway for one of the largest Eid Al Etihad commemorations to date, blending deep-rooted cultural traditions with high-tech spectacles across the seven emirates.The UAE Cabinet has confirmed December 2 and 3, 2025 as official public holidays in honour of Eid Al Etihad, or Festival of the Union, commemorating the founding of the nation on December 2, 1971. With these days falling on a Tuesday and Wednesday, the inclusion of Monday, December 1, as a holiday could extend the break to four days, or possibly five depending on the weekend alignment.This potential long weekend is expected to benefit both social and economic activities. Residents and families will have more time to travel within the country, participate in public festivities, or take advantage of the extended holiday period for leisure or short-term vacations.Authorities have not yet confirmed the status of December 1, but based on prior years and UAE holiday policies, there is growing anticipation that an official announcement will follow soon.The UAE’s 54th National Day celebrations are set to feature a series of expansive and coordinated events across all emirates, with major public and private venues playing host to cultural, entertainment, and community-focused programs.Public transportation services across major cities are expected to extend operational hours, while law enforcement and municipal bodies are preparing traffic and safety protocols to manage the anticipated increase in footfall at celebration venues.At the centre of the celebrations will be a grand official ceremony on Tuesday, December 2, to be attended by the UAE’s leadership. While the venue for the main event has not yet been revealed, organisers have confirmed it will be a site of deep cultural and national relevance.In 2024, the ceremony was held at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, where the nation’s heritage and vision for the future were presented through immersive storytelling and performances. A similarly meaningful location is expected to be selected for the 2025 event, and details are expected to be made public in the coming weeks.Preparations officially began on Union Pledge Day, marking the symbolic start of a nationwide effort to build an inclusive, celebratory experience that reflects the UAE’s values of unity and diversity.The 54th National Day serves as a reminder of the UAE’s evolution from its unification in 1971 into a global centre for innovation, commerce, and cross-cultural engagement. Eid Al Etihad is not only a time of celebration but also of reflection—honouring the nation’s history while highlighting its ambitions for the future.Organisers have also released behind-the-scenes footage from the 2024 ceremony, showcasing the depth of planning and artistic execution that goes into these annual events. The footage aims to build excitement and demonstrate the UAE’s commitment to making National Day a culturally resonant and visually compelling occasion.On the economic front, long public holidays like these are known to boost local tourism and retail sectors, with increased activity in hotels, restaurants, and shopping destinations. Travel agencies typically report a spike in bookings, as residents look to make the most of the extended break for domestic or short international getaways.","The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2.

In spring, clocks are moved forward to extend evening daylight, while in autumn, clocks are set back to give more light in the mornings.Under current federal rules set by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, DST begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November. Next year, clocks will move forward again on Sunday, March 8, 2026.Most US states follow DST, but not all. Hawaii and most of Arizona do not observe the change, citing limited benefit due to their climates. The Navajo Nation, which spans parts of Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico, does observe DST to maintain consistent time across its territory.Five US territories, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, also do not follow DST.For many Americans, shifting the clocks requires changes to daily routines.

Breaking Down The Minnesota Wild & Kaprizov Standoff | SDP

Other potential landing spots and Minnesota's dilemma

Kirill Kaprizov has taken a place among the league's most dynamic forwards, but his future with the Minnesota Wild appears cloudy. It was reported that the 28-year-old rejected a massive eight-year, $128-million contract extension offer, thus sparking speculation about whether he will stay or if the franchise may ultimately have to pursue the trade route. With only one year on his contract, the Wild must act soon to either keep their star or secure value before free agency.While it may still be early, insiders are behind the scenes linking Kirill Kaprizov to some contenders. Per Michael Russo, the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes are expected to get aggressive if he is put on the market, while Chicago would be an attractive personal city for him. Los Angeles and Tampa Bay are also interesting stops from a roster-market size interplay.Kaprizov’s skill set makes him a fit almost anywhere. During the 2024-25 season, he scored 25 goals and 31 assists in just 41 games. Therefore, speed, creativity, and finishing ability are a blend that could turn any team’s offense around. Any organization looking to make a leap into Stanley Cup contention is presented with a one-off opportunity to add a tried and tested game-changer who is in his prime.Besides the five so-called headline teams that made headlines back in the day, some other franchises could attempt to step inside the little ring as well.New York Islanders could fit well, given their need for offensive firepower; meanwhile, Washington Capitals and San Jose Sharks could emerge perhaps as dark horses should their rebuild continue trending upward. But Kaprizov essentially wants a pretty big market, a chance to win, and a money offer worthy of him as an elite winger.The Wild, on the other hand, sees this as a tricky situation. Allowing their franchise cornerstone to walk away for nothing would be the stuff of nightmares, but trading him in the near term could very well alter the identity of the team. If a deal is not struck soon, Minnesota will possibly have to entertain offers for one of the brightest stars in the NHL.Also Read: Blue Jackets go after Ivan Fedotov in a major move to upgrade goaltending The future of Kirill Kaprizov is shaping up to be one of the biggest storylines of the league. Whether they go to a new market with their decision or stay in Minnesota, the choice could change the NHL's view for years to come.","Kirill Kaprizov rejected an eight-year, $128-million contract extension offer from the Minnesota Wild. New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes are expected to get aggressive if he is put on the market. Chicago would be an attractive personal city for him, while Los Angeles and Tampa Bay are also interesting stops.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123904435,imgsize-1181811,width-400,resizemode-4/kirill-kaprizov.jpg"
"Pachgaon metro route to link growth hubs in Gurgaon and Manesar, to have 28 stations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/pachgaon-metro-route-to-link-growth-hubs-in-gurgaon-and-manesar-to-have-28-stations/articleshow/123908247.cms,"



Gurgaon: The planned 35.2km metro line connecting Sector 56 to Pachgaon moved a step closer to realisation, with officials confirming that the detailed project report (DPR) will be submitted to Haryana govt for approval within a week.The Haryana Mass Rapid Transport Corporation (HMRTC) is currently examining the DPR for the Rs 8,500-crore project, which will feature 28 stations along an entirely elevated corridor meant to serve both residential and industrial hubs.""The DPR has been submitted by the agency (RITES) and we are examining it. Once the review is complete, we will forward it to the state govt for approval,"" a senior HMRTC official said on Monday.The financing model for the project has been the subject to changes over the past year. RITES had proposed an equity-sharing model, with 20% contributions each from the state and Centre, and 60% through soft loans.But chief minister Nayab Singh Saini decided in Nov 2024 that the state would fund the entire project. The Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) subsequently committed Rs 1,500 crore as seed money to kickstart the work.A revised proposal approved by the state govt in Jan includes a 10% grant from the Centre, applicable to the total project cost, excluding private investment, land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement expenses and state taxes. The remaining will follow a debt-equity ratio of 80:20, with the state bearing the larger share.The corridor will connect critical growth centres including Golf Course Extension Road, Southern Peripheral Road, Central Peripheral Road, Dwarka Expressway sectors, the upcoming Global City, Manesar, and Pachgaon.The station at Sector 56 will serve as an interchange with the existing Rapid Metro, while Kherki Daula and Pachgaon stations will provide connectivity with the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS), strengthening Gurgaon's transportation links with Delhi and beyond.Once approved by the state, the proposal will be forwarded to the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for final clearance.For residents of Gurgaon's newer sectors, which have experienced rapid growth over the past decade but lack adequate public transport, the metro line represents a crucial infrastructure upgrade.""We have been living here for nearly a decade, but there is no public transport. We have no choice but to rely on private cars. With thousands of vehicles on roads, congestion has become commonplace. A metro line is the only way commuting will become easier and more comfortable,"" said Dharam Veer Singh, RWA president of Mapsko Casabella.Separately, groundwork for the city's new metro line between Millenium City Centre and Cyber City has picked up pace. A traffic management plan is being prepared, and construction work is set to begin from Oct.","The detailed project report will be submitted to Haryana govt for approval within a week.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently poked fun at rival Palantir’s steep prices, calling its software “the most expensive enterprise software I’ve ever seen” before joking, “Maybe I’m not charging enough. ” Benioff made the remark during an interview with CNBC’s Morgan Brennan at Goldman Sachs’ Communacopia+Technology conference in San Francisco last week. His comments come as Palantir, known for its data management tools used by companies and government agencies, enjoys surging investor enthusiasm.“I am so inspired by that company,” Benioff said. “Not just because they have 100 times multiple on their revenue, which I would love to have that too. Maybe it’ll have 1000 times soon.”Despite the praise, Benioff’s jab underscored the growing rivalry. Salesforce generated more than $10 billion in revenue in its latest quarter, ten times Palantir’s size, but Palantir’s revenue growth rate of 48% far outpaces Salesforce’s 10%.It wasn’t the first time Benioff raised Palantir’s pricing. Just last week, he told CNBC’s Jim Cramer that Salesforce offers “a very competitive product at a much lower cost.”Palantir CEO Alex Karp responded on the TBPN podcast, saying the company is “very focused on value creation” and asks to be “modestly compensated for that value.”The two companies also compete for government contracts. Marc Benioff recently touted Salesforce’s win over Palantir in a US Army deal, highlighting the direct competition between the tech firms.Founded in 1999, Salesforce went public in 2004, years before Palantir’s 2020 stock market debut.

Left’s new pilgrimage: CPM’s Sabarimala shift ahead of polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/lefts-new-pilgrimage-cpms-sabarimala-shift-ahead-of-polls/articleshow/123912871.cms,"Global summit and poll realities

Ideological pragmatism

Gains and trade-offs





In 2018, after Supreme Court struck down the practice of barring women of menstrual age from entering the Sabarimala temple in Kerala, the Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF govt implemented the order, calling it a step towards “promoting progressive values”. Despite a violent backlash and accusations from several Hindu organisations that the govt was seeking to “violate traditions,” the administration held firm.Even PM Narendra Modi , during a 2019 election rally in Kollam, attacked the move: “We knew that communists do not respect Indian history, culture and spirituality but nobody imagined that they will have such hatred.”Cut to 2025, and the political landscape has shifted dramatically. With assembly elections coming up in 2026, the LDF govt has changed tack. Its stand now seems to be to align with the devotees, and that the contentious issue of women’s entry into Sabarimala is a “closed matter”.This repositioning comes as the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), the body that manages the hill shrine, prepares for an international summit, the ‘Global Ayyappa Sangamam’, on Sept 20 at Pamba, the temple’s base station.Officially, the summit marks the TDB’s 75th anniversary and seeks to showcase Sabarimala as a “divine, traditional, and sustainable global pilgrimage centre”. CM Vijayan, his cabinet colleagues, spiritual leaders, opposition figures, and representatives of Ayyappa devotees from across the world are expected to attend the event.But beneath the surface, many see it as CPM ’s first serious attempt to woo the Hindu majority vote bank. “For the first time, CPM is trying to influence the majority community and do social engineering through the Hindu community,” said political scientist G Gopa Kumar.If this U-turn has stirred a hornet’s nest, it is also seen to have upset both BJP and Congress. Political observer N M Pearson calls it “a genetic variation” of CPM politics: “Being in power, they have studied society and used it to meet their needs rather than sticking to the communist ideology. The role of a good political party is to provide ideological clarity. Instead, with this move, they have created ideological confusion.”Yet, what looks like a retreat from ideology could make for a political blessing. CPM has secured support for the Sangamam from powerful community organisations like the Nair Service Society (NSS) — which spearheaded the agitation against the Vijayan govt in 2018 — along with the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP), Kerala Pulaya Maha Sabha (KPMS) and Malayaraya Mahasabha.Together, these bodies represent nearly 95% of Kerala’s Hindu community — once CPM’s traditional vote base though much of it has shifted to BJP and Congress after the Sabarimala agitation.The 2019 Lok Sabha polls yielded just one seat for LDF out of Kerala’s 20. In 2024, the tally remained unchanged. But in 2021, bucking the historical trend, LDF returned to office for a second consecutive term — the first time since 1977 that any govt had managed the feat. It won 99 assembly seats, eight more than in the previous election.Still, studies suggest notable shifts. Among the Ezhava community, long seen as an LDF backbone, the vote share of the alliance dipped from 49% in 2016 to 45% in 2019. Among Nair voters, the slide was sharper: from 45% to just 20% over the same period, effectively turning them into a swing community. CPM’s loss translated into BJP’s gain.With assembly elections due in early 2026 and local body polls later this year, the stakes are high. “From what I hear from party workers, CPM has calculated that almost 90% of Malayalis visiting Sabarimala are its supporters. The new thinking is: ‘Why should we oppose this?’ That logic is now unfortunately being echoed by the party’s brass,” said Pearson.“It is obvious the Left wants to regain its Hindu vote share. BJP may still win two or three seats, but their vote share could shrink from 20% in 2024 to 10-12% in 2026, with UDF being the bigger loser. Even if LDF recovers just 6% of BJP’s Hindu vote share, they would have made an impact with this (Sangaman) meet. But the flip side is that LDF risks losing minority votes — both Muslims and Christians,” added Gopa Kumar.CPM appears willing to take a complex gamble. The party is sending feelers to influential community organisations, but analysts suggest its strategy goes deeper. Political analyst Sunny Kapikad says that recent rhetoric from the LDF side reflects what was “earlier BJP’s tactic to consolidate Hindu votes”.That, experts say, puts a question mark on the image of Kerala as a bastion of secular politics. “It’s time to admit that Hindutva has become a major force in Kerala and part of every party’s political consciousness. Even the LDF is no exception. Here, Hindutva is framed as cultural legacy, not just religion,” Kapikad argues.This realignment comes at a time when the LDF govt faces anti-incumbency and has few new welfare schemes to showcase. Its only trump card is the narrative that corporatisation is happening along with welfare and any development taking place in the state is pro-poor.LDF would also be hoping to count on certain advantages. For one, UDF remains divided and demoralised whereas the Left continues to command strong organisational networks and enjoys a reputation for handling crises — from floods to pandemics. Voters recognise that even if the Congress-led UDF returns to office in the state, it will struggle to deliver on finances or jobs with BJP entrenched at the Centre.This context makes the CPM’s latest manoeuvre look like a masterstroke. It seems to have succeeded in hitting two birds — Congress and BJP — with one stone, leaving both divided and startled. Many Hindus who leaned towards BJP in recent years are now seen to be drifting back towards LDF in response to the Sangamam.“There is nothing wrong in convening a Sangamam of Ayyappa devotees, but CPM should be honest enough to admit that it is for political reasons,” says BJP state vice-president K S Radhakrishnan, who faces over 250 criminal cases linked to the Sabarimala protests.Pearson, though, feels the move is not without its pitfalls. “For committed CPM supporters, the concern is that, with this stand, the party is shifting from ideology to mere adjustment. While the move may help in the 2026 assembly elections, it could weaken the party in the long run. The end effect is that, unlike in the past, when CPM stood firm whether in or out of power, it will now appear strong only while governing. Once out of power, the party will face a steady exodus that will ultimately erode its strength. ”Kapikad points out that while “CPM has, in different ways, used religion for political gains in the past, it has never done so this openly”. “There is no record of the party ever calling affected groups to discuss their concerns... So, why extend such a favour to Ayyappa believers? What right of the Ayyappa devotee has been violated that requires redress through this meet?” asks Kapikad.Whether it pays off in the 2026 assembly polls or not, what’s becoming clear is that LDF’s Sabarimala gambit will influence the course of Kerala’s politics in the time to come.","In 2018, after Supreme Court struck down the practice of barring women of menstrual age from entering the Sabarimala temple in Kerala, the Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF govt implemented the order.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

‘Expect Europeans to do their share now’: US holds back on China tariffs; Bessent says Europe must act first on Russian oil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/expect-europeans-to-do-their-share-now-us-holds-back-on-china-tariffs-bessent-says-europe-must-act-first-on-russian-oil/articleshow/123911925.cms,"File photo: US treasury secretary Scott Bessent (Picture credit: AP)





US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that the Trump administration will not move ahead with new tariffs on Chinese goods over Beijing’s Russian oil purchases unless European countries impose steep duties of their own.Speaking in a joint interview with Reuters and Bloomberg, Bessent stressed that Washington expects Europe to take a stronger role in reducing Moscow’s oil revenues. “We expect the Europeans to do their share now, and we are not moving forward without the Europeans,” he said.Bessent noted that US President Donald Trump has already imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports tied to Russian oil, and has urged European nations to introduce tariffs of 50% to 100% on China and India.He said he raised these points with Chinese officials during trade talks in Madrid, where the issue of TikTok was also discussed. According to Reuters, Chinese representatives insisted that oil purchases remain a “sovereign matter.”The treasury chief criticised some European states for continuing to buy Russian oil, while others import petroleum products refined in India from Russian crude. “I guarantee you that if Europe put on substantial secondary tariffs on the buyers of Russian oil, the war would be over in 60 or 90 days,” Bessent said, arguing that such measures would choke off Moscow’s main source of income.Trump has already said Europe’s sanctions are “not tough enough” and warned allies against fuelling Russia’s war economy. He has long pressed Nato partners to step up pressure on Beijing and New Delhi, although in recent weeks rhetoric towards India has softened as the US and India prepare for a new round of talks on Tuesday.Bessent claimed that the tariffs on Indian goods had already brought “substantial progress” in discussions with New Delhi.Meanwhile, he indicated Washington would work with European partners on tougher sanctions against Russian energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil, and explore using frozen Russian sovereign assets. Options include seizing small portions of the $300 billion in blocked funds or placing them in a special-purpose vehicle to back loans for Ukraine.The US and China recently reached a “basic framework consensus” on shifting ownership of TikTok from ByteDance to a US company, with leaders expected to discuss final terms later this week.",US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that the Trump administration will not move ahead with new tariffs on Chinese goods over Beijing's Russian oil purchases.

U.S. Dollar CRASHES Hours After Trump's Unprecedented Move Against Fed Governor Cook | Details





A federal appeals court has ruled that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can remain in her post, allowing her to take part in this week’s closely watched interest rate meeting, despite President Donald Trump’s attempt to remove her from the board. The decision from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit came on Monday, hours after Trump announced Cook’s dismissal in a letter posted on Truth Social, accusing her of mortgage fraud.“In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, [Americans] cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity,” Trump wrote. “I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.” Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed’s board, has denied the allegations and pledged not to be “bullied to step down.” She has also filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the accusations are unrelated to her role at the central bank and remain unproven.The allegations originated with Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who claimed Cook had listed more than one home as her primary residence in 2021 to secure favourable mortgage terms.The Justice Department has since opened an investigation, with subpoenas issued in Georgia and Michigan, and reports suggesting a grand jury in Atlanta is examining the case. Cook has not been charged, and her legal filing describes the allegations as a pretext to force her out and open a seat for Trump to fill.Legal experts say the case raises fundamental questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve. Governors can only be removed “for cause,” a standard that historically covers proven misconduct or neglect. Trump’s move marks the first attempt by a president to fire a sitting Fed governor in the institution’s 112-year history, and observers expect the dispute could reach the Supreme Court.The legal fight comes as the Fed begins a two-day policy meeting, with markets anticipating a rate cut of at least 25 basis points. Investors are watching closely for signals of further easing as the US economy slows and trade talks with China continue.","Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can remain in her post, despite President Donald Trump's attempt to remove her from the board.

Understanding solar eclipses – Types and what to expect

Total solar eclipse



The Moon completely covers the Sun.

Observers in a narrow zone experience brief daylight darkness.

Spectacular but rare. Partial solar eclipse



Only part of the Sun is covered by the Moon.

Creates a crescent or “bitten” appearance of the Sun.

This is the type occurring on September 21, 2025. Annular solar eclipse



The Moon is farther from Earth and doesn’t fully cover the Sun.

A ring of sunlight remains visible, forming the “ring of fire” effect.





In an extraordinary celestial turn, September 2025 is bookended by two eclipses, a lunar eclipse on the 7th and a solar eclipse just 15 days later. While the Moon recently turned a vivid red in a dramatic lunar display, the sky will offer another rare phenomenon: a partial solar eclipse on September 21, timed just before the equinox. However, this spectacle won’t be visible everywhere, and the UAE is among the regions that will miss it.The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21. Unlike a total eclipse, this will be a partial solar eclipse, where the Moon covers only part of the Sun, creating a crescent-shaped sliver of sunlight. Even as a partial eclipse, it provides a rare chance to observe the Sun’s changing face.This event holds additional significance because it closely precedes the September equinox, which falls on September 22, 2025. The equinox is one of two moments in the year when the Sun is directly above the Earth’s equator, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths across the globe. Because of this timing, the eclipse is also being called an ""equinox eclipse"", adding to its astronomical and symbolic intrigue.The event also carries cultural and astrological meaning. This year's Pitru Paksha — a fortnight in the Hindu calendar dedicated to ancestral remembrance and rituals — uniquely begins with a lunar eclipse and ends with this solar eclipse, a rare alignment astrologers consider especially potent.This celestial pairing not only marks an important astronomical event but also deepens the spiritual significance of Pitru Paksha for many observers.Also Read: Saudi National Day 2025 The September 21 partial solar eclipse will be visible only in specific parts of the Southern Hemisphere, offering clear views to skywatchers in select regions.Skywatchers in visible regions must use proper solar filters or eclipse glasses to view the partial eclipse safely.Unlike the lunar eclipse on September 7, which had wide visibility across many countries, this solar eclipse will not be visible in the UAE or most parts of the Northern Hemisphere.Countries that will not witness any part of the eclipse include:This means millions of skywatchers across Asia and the Americas will miss the event entirely — a sharp contrast to the global excitement generated by the earlier lunar eclipse.A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, partially or fully blocking sunlight in specific areas on Earth. These alignments don’t happen frequently in the same place due to the precise positioning required.There are three main types of solar eclipses:Although this particular eclipse is not a total one, its timing, rarity, and symbolic links to the equinox and Pitru Paksha make it a notable event in the 2025 celestial calendar.This will be the last solar eclipse of 2025, concluding a year that featured two solar eclipses","The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21.

Aid meant for relief diverted? Pakistan funding reconstruction of LeT HQ destroyed in Op Sindoor; what intel says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/aid-meant-for-relief-diverted-pakistan-funding-reconstruction-of-let-hq-destroyed-in-op-sindoor-what-intel-says/articleshow/123878923.cms,"Intel Reveals Pak Using Aid To Rebuild LeT HQ Hit In Op Sindoor, Experts Say ‘Time To Strike Again’

Poll Do you believe the reconstruction of LeT's Markaz Taiba is a threat to regional security? Yes, it poses a significant threat. No, it will not impact security.

How India destroyed LeT HQ



Why its reconstruction is a matter of concern?







Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba, which was destroyed in precision airstrikes during Operation Sindoor on May 7. According to ANI, citing an agency dossier, LeT has launched fundraising campaigns under the pretext of flood relief to support the redevelopment project.Moreover, Islamabad has already allocated PKR 4 crore, though the group estimates costs at over PKR 15 crore. The dossier stated that its army and ISI remain involved in sustaining and reviving LeT.Senior commanders Maulana Abu Zar and Yunus Shah Bukhari are overseeing the project, due by February 2026, mirroring past cases where LeT diverted humanitarian aid, including most of the 2005 earthquake relief, to militant infrastructure.This comes amidst Pakistan's continuous assertions on global platforms that it was combating terrorism.The Indian Air Force (IAF), earlier this year, showcased the extensive damage caused to LeT Muridke headquarters during Operation Sindoor, highlighting the precision and reach of the strikes.Muridke, home to LeT’s Markaz Taiba, was identified as a critical target. The strikes hit senior leadership residential areas and office buildings where commanders convened for planning and operations.The IAF showed videos captured directly from the weapons, pointing out the level of devastation within the complex.The airstrikes reportedly killed around a dozen high-value terrorists, including Yusuf Azhar, the IC-814 hijacker, Abu Jundal (also known as Mudassar), the Muridke chief of LeT, and the son of the planner of the 2016 Nagrota attack. The operation, conducted in retaliation for the Pahalgam killings, reinforced India’s ability to carry out precise, high-impact missions inside enemy territory.The ongoing reconstruction of LeT Markaz Taiba headquarters has raised serious concerns regarding regional security, given the facility’s central role in training and radicalizing terrorists. Established in 2000, the complex serves as both a residence for senior commanders and a training ground where recruits are instructed in intelligence gathering, arms handling, and other operational skills. Analysts warn that reviving the facility could strengthen LeT’s operational capabilities and enable the recruitment of new militants.Markaz Taiba functions as the “alma mater” of LeT, providing courses that combine physical and arms training with ideological indoctrination. The center attracts recruits from within Pakistan and abroad, using religious and radicalization programs to cultivate loyalty and operational skills among future militants. Its facilities, including a mosque and guest house financed by Osama bin Laden, underscore the longstanding support the organization has received from international terror networks.The scale of the operation at Markaz Taiba further amplifies the threat. The facility reportedly trains around 1,000 students annually, preparing them for operational roles within LeT. Past evidence has shown that graduates of this center have gone on to participate in high-profile attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, highlighting the direct link between the facility and acts of cross-border terrorism targeting India.LeT’s historical connection with Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus adds another layer of concern. Senior commanders at the facility, including those who oversaw training for the 26/11 perpetrators, have operated under the guidance of the ISI.","Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert





Train operations on five rail sections in Punjab have been suspended due to damage caused to railway tracks and infrastructure by ongoing floods and heavy rains in the province, Dawn reported.According to an internal report compiled by the Pakistan Railways (PR) and cited by Dawn, the Narowal-Sialkot section has remained closed since August 27 after floodwater breached a portion of the track. The report said a Girder Span of bridge No 7 near Aik Nullah was also misaligned, allowing floodwater to maintain a high level and overtop the track. Repair works are underway and operations are expected to resume by September 12.The PR report further noted that the Chak Jhumra-Shaheenabad (Sargodha) section was closed for rail traffic on August 29 when an ""exceptionally high flood damaged bridge No 132 & 134 near Chiniot."" Efforts are ongoing to repair or reconstruct the bridge to restore train operations, it added, according to Dawn.Similarly, the Wazirabad-Sialkot section was closed on September 3 after floodwater overtopped the track between Wazirabad-Sodhra Kopra.The Jhang-Shaheenabad section has also been shut since August 28 after flooding breached an area near the Rivaz Railway Bridge over the river Chanab. ""The floodwater is still passing through the breached section, as the train traffic remains suspended,"" the report stated.Dawn further reported that the Khanewal-Shorkot section was closed on September 3 due to high flood levels at Abdul Hakim Bridge No 27 and breaches between Abdul Hakim and Darkana stations. Temporary disruptions were also recorded at Shahdra-Faisalabad, Lahore-Badami Bagh, Uggoki-Sialkot, Port Qasim-Bin Qasim, Kotri-Dadu, Tando Adam-Hyderabad, and Peshawar Saddar-Cant sections due to flooding, embankment cuts, mudslides, and fallen trees, the PR document noted.Meanwhile, the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) also reported widespread damage to its infrastructure. ""As many as 73,724 consumers suffered power disruptions, and of them, 13,073 are still without electricity,"" Lesco Chief Executive Officer Ramzan Butt said in a statement, as quoted by Dawn.

KATHMANDU: On a stroll through Kathmandu’s Thamel district—the beating heart of Nepal’s tourist trade—the presence of China is hard to miss. Shop signs flash Mandarin translations, and even restaurant menus have dish details elaborated in the language. In narrow lanes once dominated almost entirely by Indian backpackers and European trekkers, Chinese tourists now form a noticeable second wave.At Tribhuvan International Airport, the shift has been made official. Alongside a long-standing immigration counter reserved for Indian citizens, a new one has been set up for Chinese travellers, with colourful words saying: 'Celebrating 70 years of Nepal-China friendship'. The gesture complements an existing visa-free regime for Chinese citizens, making their entry smoother than ever in the Himalayan nation.For Mausam Rana, a hotel manager in Thamel, the impact is visible in the guest ledger. “Indians still form the bulk of our clientele,” he said. “But Chinese numbers are rising. Till some time back, our hotel used to have around 15 or 20 Chinese tourists in a month—now it’s double that.With campaigns like 'Visit Nepal' this year and better flight connections, the peak season could bring even more.”Official data seems to confirm what the eye sees. In August, Nepal welcomed 88,680 foreign visitors, a 22 % rise from last year. Indians accounted for 40 %, Chinese 8.5 %, and Americans about 6 %. Himal Gautam, director at department of tourism, Nepal, told TOI, ""In August, a total of 7,533 Chinese tourists visited Nepal in comparison to 6,614 in the same month last year. SImilarly, in May, a total of 8,824 tourists from China visited our country against 8,381 in May last year.Indian tourists have always topped the chart in terms of foreign tourists visiting our country. But we are happy that more tourists are also coming from China and other countries as well.""The new relationship extends beyond tourism. Chinese automakers—BYD, Leap Motors, Omoda, XPENG, Dongfeng Forthing, Great Wall, to name a few, have flooded Kathmandu’s streets with sleek electric vehicles. Taxi driver Sushil Thapa, who has worked the roads for two decades, says Indian cars once ruled. “Now, whole fleets run on Chinese EVs. They’re stylish, affordable, and packed with features.”For Kathmandu-based analysts like Kanchan Jha, the trend is unmistakable. “It reflects a look-beyond-India mindset,” he said. “Our ties with India remain deep, but there is value in cultivating another giant across the mountains.”","In August, Nepal welcomed 88,680 foreign visitors, a 22 % rise from last year.

Experts Hail ‘Nepal’s Step Towards Democracy’, Praise Sushila Karki’s Six-Month Deadline For Power





As Nepal picks up its pieces following the violent protests that left many of the country's iconic buildings as well as hundreds of govt offices and homes badly damaged, an unusual economy is stirring amidst the rubble. Scrap dealers in Kathmandu are bracing for a windfall, as heaps of building material, metal and junk is cleared from vandalised govt complexes, burnt-down car showrooms, and ransacked supermarkets.""The junk largely comprises charred cars, damaged furniture and other metal scrap from torched public buildings,"" an official of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City administration said. ""It will eventually be auctioned to scrap dealers through tenders once cleanup is complete,"" he added.Among the areas that were ravaged in the Sept 8-9 'Gen Z' protests that led to downfall of the KP Sharma Oli government were the historic Singha Durbar, the Supreme Court, office of the attorney general, and the parliament building in Kathmandu. Besides, scores of govt offices in around 250 municipalities were damaged due to vandalism and arson, a spokesperson at the ministry of federal affairs and general administration was quoted as saying by The Kathmandu Post.Biratnagar’s four-storey municipal building was reduced to rubble, while two ward offices were burned. Birgunj saw three of its seven buildings rendered unusable, and 95 per cent of municipal properties destroyed, the newspaper reported.“What happened to the properties was very unfortunate. They should not have been damaged. But then somebody has to now take care of disposal of the mess. Scrap dealers will do that,” said Paban Tamling, a local scrap merchant. He added that business could triple or even quadruple.“Before the protest, the annual business of scrap dealing in Kathmandu was around 2 crore Nepalese rupees. But now, after the vandalism and arson, it would easily cross over 5 crore,” Tamling added.Deepak Jaiswal, who runs the recycling firm 'Thalo Kawadi', echoed the sentiment. “We are waiting for officials to finish assessing the damage and then float tenders. The number of bidders this time will surely increase, as many will try to jump into the business.

'Stop Radical Islam': Anti-Immigrant Vs Anti-Racism Protesters Clash In Liverpool; UK Cops In Action

The Reddit post on moving back to India from the UK went viral.





A post by an Indian Redditor who claimed that there is enough racism in the UK against Indians that they started to feel unwelcome and moved back to India went viral as people found the experience relatable. The post came as a huge anti-immigrant protest, organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, took place in London.The Redditor claimed they turned down as extension of the visa because it was difficult to adjust with the UK lifestyle. ""Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of positives - great public transport, amazing grocery options, personal freedom, great work-life balance, clean air, and so much space to walk. There’s a lot of things I liked too. But overall, the lack of vibrancy, combined with living alone and struggling to make friends, wore me down. The salary hit will hurt, but mentally I couldn’t cope in the UK anymore. Some people thrive there, but I just couldn't,"" the person wrote.""Most Brits I met were polite and tolerant, but I did experience subtle (and sometimes not subtle) racism. Enough that I started to feel unwelcome, like I didn’t belong,"" the viral post read.""India has a whole lot of problems. I guess it comes down to the problems you find you can tolerate in the end!"" the writer added, replying to a post.The post went viral as several NRIs expressed their feelings about the UK and how it's not a great option because of the cost and also racism. ""I agree with all your points. Would not live in UK again unless travelling on a tourist visa in summer for 2 weeks.Throw in 50 percent inheritance tax, my financial estate will be bigger in India at 60years old than in the UK and my kids will be able to access all of that money,"" the person said.London turned into a scene of chaos as the protesters of the 'Unite the Kingdom' march clashed with police officers. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the assaults on police officers and racist intimidation. “People have a right to peaceful protest. It is core to our country’s values. But we will not stand for assaults on police officers doing their job or for people feeling intimidated on our streets because of their background or the colour of their skin. Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. Our flag represents our diverse country and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division,"" he said.","The Redditor claimed they turned down as extension of the visa because it was difficult to adjust with the UK lifestyle.
