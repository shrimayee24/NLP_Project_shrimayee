On Tuesday morning , a desperate Roy reached the Bangladesh deputy high commissioner’s office here, trying to get the visas extended. Roy is also ‘mahasampadak’ of Jatiya Sramik League for Khulna, an arm of Awami League .“A few of my political opponents came to my residence where my mother is alone and threatened her. If we go back at this juncture our lives would be at risk. I wish to go back but until there is a long spell of peace, I am not ready to return,” Roy told TOI.A Dhaka-based theatre personality also fears returning to his homeland due to his association with the Awami League.His house in Barishal was attacked Monday night. “I came to Delhi for an Indo-Bangla research project on ‘Gano Sangeet’. I am shaken by what happened to my family home in Barishal. My sisters are living in constant fear after the vandalism. Now, I find myself stranded and fearing for my life if I return. I may need to extend myvisa for a prolonged stay in India,” he said.Biswajit Saha, an Awami League functionary, who narrowly survived a violent attack at his residence in Bangladesh’s Kachua Bagerhat on Monday night, managed to flee to India on Tuesday and take shelter at a cousin’s house in Kolkata’s Duttapukur area. “I found out that many Awami League functionaries, including myself, were on BNP’s hit list. My family members fled and took shelter elsewhere,” he said. On Monday evening, a mob attacked his house.Unlike Roy or Saha, who left their homeland recently, Ananya Azad had fled to Germany in 2015, after her name came up on the hit list of Ansarullah Banga Team, an outfit that was behind the attack on atheist bloggers in Bangladesh. “I never visited Bangladesh after I left my country in 2015.

I came to India on July 28 on a holiday, hoping to visit Kashmir with my husband, a police officer in Dhaka. But it remained a hope after a week-long peaceful protest against a quota system metamorphosed into unprecedented violence there.My husband was called back to duty, and he got stuck in Dhaka. I am worried about him and several of my relatives and friends in police which are bearing the brunt of the violence.Since Monday, I have been hearing about police stations falling prey to arsonists.Several cops have been killed since the fall of Sheikh Hasina govt. What’s their fault? Police officials were just following govt orders.I heard that Bangladesh Police Subordinate Employees’ Association has announced an indefinite strike to protest against attacks on police force. One can understand when cops call strike — it’s their last resort to save themselves.I want to go back to my husband and my relatives in the time of crisis, but I am stuck here. I had booked a ticket on an IndiGo flight at 2.50 pm on Tuesday but the flight was cancelled. Bangladesh Biman too has not been able to provide confirmed tickets. We have checked out of the hotel as I want to reach Dhaka as early as possible by any means. Now, I am desperately trying to get a bus ticket to Dhaka.The visuals coming from my country have unnerved me. I cannot stand vested interests hijacking a popularstudent movement . Students are our future. It’s disheartening to see them being misled and falling into the hands of vandals.The new govt needs to be tolerant and inclusive. We cannot destroy Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s statues. Also, PM’s residence is not a piece of private property; it has a historic significance. I wish the authorities establish peace first. Most Bangladeshis are peaceful and extremely hopeful of the future. When I return to Dhaka, I wish it should fill me with pride, not fear.","I came to India on July 28 on a holiday, hoping to visit Kashmir with my husband, a police officer in Dhaka.

"Situation evolving, threat to minorities matter of concern, EAM tells House",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-evolving-threat-to-minorities-matter-of-concern-eam-tells-house/articleshow/112329420.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the first public remarks on the ongoing crisis in Bangladesh, foreign minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday told Parliament that India has been in regular touch with authorities in Dhaka in the past 24 hours about the “evolving” and “complex” situation, as he also expressed deep concern over the threat to minorities and asserted that India expects the host govt to protect Indian establishments so that they can function normally once the situation improves.While giving nothing away on where deposed PM Sheikh Hasina might be headed, the minister said she had sought at a very short notice approval to come “for the moment” to India.Conscious of the delicate situation in Dhaka, Jaishankar in his suo moto statement avoided making any remark that might be misinterpreted as an attempt to dictate the terms of govt formation to Bangladesh. Significantly, while India had publicly said during the protests against Hasina that this was an internal issue of Bangladesh, Jaishankar disclosed the Indian govt had repeatedly advised restraint and urged “various political forces” it was in touch with that the situation be defused through dialogue. He didn’t name the Hasina govt or any party but said various decisions and actions after the stir refused to die down only exacerbated the situation.Unlike the US, which welcomed the formation of an interim govt, Jaishankar only took note of Army chief Waker-uz-Zaman talking about assuming responsibility and constituting a govt. Giving details of the violence that erupted on August 4 against the Hasina regime in the past few days, he said what was particularly worrying was that minorities, their businesses and temples also came under attack at multiple locations. The full extent of this was still not clear, he said.“On August 5, demonstrators converged in Dhaka despite the curfew. Our understanding is that after a meeting with leaders of the security establishment, PM Hasina apparently made the decision to resign. At very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India. We simultaneously received a request for flight clearance from Bangladeshi authorities,” Jaishankar said, adding the govt was in continuous touch with theIndian community in Bangladesh through its diplomatic missions and has asked border forces to be exceptionally alert because of the complex situation.He said there are an estimated 19,000 Indian nationals in Bangladesh, of which about 9,000 are students. The bulk of the students had already returned to India in July on the advice of the Indian high commission, he said. “In terms of our diplomatic presence, in addition to the high commission in Dhaka, we have assistant high commissions in Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna and Sylhet. It is our expectation that the host govt will provide the required security protection for these establishments. We look forward to their normal functioning once the situation stabilises,” he said, adding India-Bangladesh relations have been exceptionally close for many decades.Jaishankar said India was closely following the situation with regard to the minorities and appreciates initiatives by various groups to protect them but added it would remain deeply concerned till law and order was visibly restored.India, along with Russia and China, had endorsed the elections early this year in which Hasina had secured another term in office in the absence of any real opposition. Jaishankar said since the election, there had been considerable tensions, deep divides and growing polarisation in Bangladesh politics. This underlying foundation, he said, aggravated a student agitation that started in June, leading to increasing violence. India has so far not officially blamed forces aligned with Pakistan for the situation but it’s widely believed opposition BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami worked to transform the students’ agitation into a movement for regime change.",India has been in regular touch with authorities in Dhaka in the past 24 hours about the ‘evolving’ and ‘complex’ situation.

"SC bristles, mulls action as Punjab & Haryana HC judge slams apex court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-bristles-mulls-action-as-punjab-haryana-hc-judge-slams-apex-court/articleshow/112329157.cms,"SC direction is to make HCs servile to apex court: Justice Sherawat

NEW DELHI: Taking serious note of “judicial indiscipline” of Punjab and Haryana high court judge Rajbir Sherawat by showing defiance towards a Supreme Court order, CJI D Y Chandrachud and four most senior judges decided to form a bench on Wednesday to decide the future course of action in regard to the HC judge’s July 17 order.Justice Sherawat had remarked in his order: “A tendency to presume the Supreme Court to be more ‘Supreme’ than it actually is and to presume a high court to be less ‘High’ than it constitutionally is.”The bench of CJI Chandrachud , and Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B R Gavai, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy will tackle Justice Sherawat’s order, who had reluctantly adjourned a contempt proceeding initiated by him because of SC’s stay.Justice Sherawat had said, “But this (adjourning a case because of SC order) may not be always possible for an HC to follow such a course in view of particular facts and circumstances embedded in a particular case or because of involvement of some statutory provisions. That would be an unfortunate situation, which would better be avoided.”Justice Sherawat had gone on to propagate that contempt proceedings initiated by a single-judge HC bench had to be appealed before the division bench of HC and that the role of SC would arise only when the contemnor, whose conviction is upheld by the division bench, files an appeal in the apex court. It is an elementary fact that SC has overarching jurisdiction over any matter before any court, including HCs, and on any subject whether pending in any court or not.Justice Sherawat said, “SC may have power to permit a special appeal by a ‘party’ to contempt proceedings before HC , against certain types of orders of contempt court under certain circumstances, however, in the present case neither there are any such circumstances, nor has any such special appeal been filed by the respondents against any such order of the contempt court. Hence, in the given circumstances, the order of SC turns out to be simply in the nature of putting an estoppel on the powers of HC exercisable under Article 215 of the Constitution of India and under the Contempt of Courts Act.”“However, it is highly doubtful if the apex court has any such power to stay operation of Article 215 of the Constitution of India and the Contempt of Courts Act, per se. Probably more caution on the part of SC would have been more appropriate,” the judge said while lecturing SC on judicial propriety .Justice Sherawat faulted SC for attempting to control the roster of HC and issuing guidelines for designation of senior advocates and said this direction is to make HCs servile to SC. He said SC did not fathom the damage it has caused by staying the contempt proceedings initiated by him. Defending initiation of contempt proceedings relating to non-filling up of judicial officers’ post, the HC judge asked, “Who is responsible for this plight of judicial officers manning the superior judiciary of state of Punjab and state of Haryana. Is it HC or is it SC ?”Punching way beyond his judicial weight, Justice Sherawat said in his humble opinion HC “should sound a note of caution even for SC to be more specific in causing legal consequences through its order”.",Punjab and Haryana high court judge Rajbir Sherawat showed defiance towards a Supreme Court order.

NEW DELHI: As Bangladesh faced political upheaval, India had to act swiftly to ensure the safety of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as she left her country. Security agencies prepared for all eventualities as Hasina headed towards India in an Air Force jet.Around 3pm, Indian Air Force radars detected a low-flying aircraft approaching the Indian border from Bangladesh.Air defense personnel, aware of the high-profile passenger onboard, allowed the aircraft to enter Indian airspace. To provide security, two Rafale fighter jets from the 101 squadron at Hashimara air base in West Bengal were deployed over Bihar and Jharkhand, according to ANI.The aircraft followed its designated flight path, closely monitored by ground agencies, with constant communication between the plane and top Indian security officials. Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari and General Upendra Dwivedi, the chiefs of the Indian Air Force and Army, respectively, closely monitored the situation.A high-level meeting was held with intelligence agency chiefs, General Dwivedi, and Lieutenant General Johnson Philip Mathew, the Integrated Defence Staff chief.As Hasina's jet landed at Hindan air base around 5:45pm, she was greeted by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. They held an hour-long meeting, discussing the current situation in Bangladesh and her future plans. Doval then briefed the Cabinet Committee of Security, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had been kept informed throughout the day.Bangladesh plunged into chaos on Monday following Hasina's resignation and departure from the country. Her resignation came after a violent crackdown on protests that had grown from demonstrations against employment quotas into a full-fledged movement demanding her ouster.As news of Hasina's exit spread, volatile crowds took to the streets, with some vandalizing the statue of her father and Bangladesh's founder, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.In an address to the nation, army chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman announced that an interim government would be formed and that he had met with members of most political parties, taking full responsibility for the country.Also Visit: Bangladesh Protests Live Updates","Bangladesh plunged into chaos on Monday following Hasina's resignation and departure from the country.

Sufi shrines body welcomes changes proposed to Waqf Act,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sufi-shrines-body-hails-bid-to-amend-waqf-act/articleshow/112328212.cms,"NEW DELHI: At odds with the position of All India Muslim Personal Law Board, All India Sufi Sajjadanashin Council ( AISSC ) — an apex body representing sufi shrines from across country led by Syed Naseruddin Chishty from Ajmer dargah — welcomed govt’s proposal to amend Waqf Act . Chishty alleged that waqf boards work in a “dictatorial” manner and cited dargahs as one the biggest “victims” of mismanagement & corruption eating into the waqf system.Citing that sufi traditions are not recognised under the current law, Chishty who is AISSC chairman has raised demand for a separate dargah board under the law.Representatives of prominent dargahs including Delhi’s Nizamuddin Auliya and Agra’s Fatehpur Sikri and representatives of sufi shrines from Rajasthan, Hyderabad and Karnataka were present at a press conference in Delhi.They highlighted that smaller dargahs are often slapped with notices resulting in endless legal battles. Chishty shared that there are about 2,000 dargahs including small ones across country and around 800 prominent ones are associated with the council.AISSC representatives, met National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Monday. Chishty said they were assured that “all stakeholders will be consulted and amendments will be in the interest of Muslims.”On Tuesday, Rijiju in a post on X described the interaction with AISSC representatives as a “fruitful and forward looking discussion” and highlighted that they praised the efforts of PM Narendra Modi-led govt towards welfare of minorities.To questions about AIMPLB and other Muslim organisations opposing proposal for amendments and citing it to be an attack on rights of Muslims, Chishty asked those opposing how they had made up their mind without even seeing the Bill. He cautioned theMuslim community to not fall prey and warned against “false propaganda” and attempting “to divide society based on religion.”Chishty, however, underlined the need for wider consultations on the Bill with stakeholders. “In the present Waqf Act, there is no mention of dargahs at all. Waqf Boards do not recognise traditions of the dargah as many of our traditions are not there in sharia, so we demand a separate Dargah Board,” he said.In their memorandum to Doval and Rijiju, Chishty said, “Our council and various organisations have consistently submitted memorandums over the past decades, urging amendments to the law. “Following a thorough examination of the draft Bill, we intend to submit our recommendations and proposal. Consequently, it is imperative that the proposed amendments prioritise the interests and safeguards of dargahs and their actual representatives,” he added.",All India Sufi Sajjadanashin Council (AISSC) is an apex body representing sufi shrines from across country.

GUWAHATI: Amid protests by Manipur ’s Kukis against the withdrawal of two “non-partisan” Assam Rifles (AR) battalions from two sensitive security buffer zones in the strife-torn state, Army has recommended placing the incoming CRPF battalions under the command and control of AR’s sector headquarters.Kuki MLAs have been part of the protests to retain the AR troops.The community fears the move to withdraw a “non-partisan force like Assam Rifles” could lead to a resurgence of violence.Army has directed relocation of the two AR battalions from Manipur to Nagaland , where they will relieve two other battalions. These relieved battalions will be redeployed in J&K. Assam Rifles, despite being a paramilitary force, has a dual control structure, with the Army overseeing operational control and home ministry handling administrative supervision.Currently, the two Assam Rifles battalions are deployed in Manipur’s Kangvai along the Churachandpur-Bishnupur border, and Kangchup on the Kangpokpi-Imphal (East) inter-district borders.The incoming CRPF battalions, comprising over 2,000 personnel, are being transferred from J&K and Telangana and are expected to assume their new positions this month, a security source said. The AR battalions are expected to hand over their areas of responsibility within one week of the CRPF battalions’ arrival, the source added.“It has been recommended that the command and control of the two CRPF battalions, relieving the AR battalions, is vested with the respective AR sector headquarters of IG (E) and IG (S), to ensure cohesion in operations in these sensitive areas,” the source said. Besides, the two CRPF battalions will undergo three months of on-the-job training “in view of the prevailing security situation in the state”.Additionally, like other infantry battalions inducted into Manipur, they will undergo four weeks of pre-induction training at the Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School in Vairengte, Mizoram, suggesting their involvement in counter-insurgency operations in the state.","Two Assam Rifles battalions are deployed in Manipur’s Kangvai along the Churachandpur-Bishnupur border, and Kangchup on the Kangpokpi-Imphal (East) inter-district borders.

Another 22.6 lakh tonne phosphatic and potassic (P&K) fertilisers was imported from China, the govt informed Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. In a written reply, MoS for chemicals and fertilisers Anupriya Patel said that India imports urea ( agriculture purpose ) on govt account to bridge the gap between production and assessed demand.The data submitted to the Upper House mentioned that India imported 70.4 lakh tonne urea in 2023-24 for $2.6 billion (Rs 21,827 crore). Similarly, 106.5 lakh tonne P&K fertilisers was imported during the last financial year. The ministry said that value of imported P&K fertilisers is not maintained in the department.“So far as P&K fertilisers are concerned, these grades of fertilisers are covered under Open General Licence (OGL) under the Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme (NBS).

He accused Congress of engaging in the “politics of lies” and claimed that their actions demonstrate a disgusting mentality.Pradhan asserted that Congress has consistently opposed India’s development and education system, and urged those who criticise Indian education system to seek the truth before spreading misinformation.NCERT has made changes to its curriculum for current academic year, removing the Preamble to the Constitution from some Class 3 & 6 textbooks across subjects. The Preamble, which previously served as an introduction to core values of the Constitution, has been excluded from textbooks for Hindi, English, Mathematics, and “World Around Us” in Class 3, as well as from new English textbook and Sanskrit textbook in Class 6. However, the Preamble remains in Hindi textbook and science textbook.Ranjana Arora, head of the department of curriculum studies and development at NCERT, clarified that the allegation was untrue. She said, “The allegation has no basis. For the first time, under National Education Policy, NCERT has given due importance and respect to various aspects of the Constitution, Preamble, fundamental duties, fundamental rights, national anthem , in textbooks.”Pradhan argued that Congress’s understanding of the Constitution is exposed by their belief that only the Preamble reflects constitutional values.

Can trial courts order fixed-term life imprisonment? SC to decide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-trial-courts-order-fixed-term-life-imprisonment-sc-to-decide/articleshow/112328022.cms,"NEW DLEHI: After reducing instances of death penalty to a rarity through interpretative development of criminal jurisprudence , SC Tuesday proposed to examine trial courts ’ power to impose fixed-term life imprisonments to convicts in heinous crimes and whether this should be the exclusive jurisdiction of Constitution courts , SC and high courts.A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and R Mahadevan dismissed an appeal by a life convict from Chhattisgarh but expressed surprise that the trial court had given a 20 year-sentence.The bench opined that it was for Constitution courts, SC and HCs, to do so.Under the Criminal Procedure Code, now replaced by Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, a lifer can make an application to the state govt concerned for remission of the remaining part of life sentence after he/she has served 14 years. The state is empowered to remit the sentence if it finds the convict had exhibited good conduct during the imprisonment period and could be re-assimilated in the society.Interestingly, in Feb, a bench comprising Justices Hrishikesh Roy and Prashant Kumar Mishra entertained a petition filed by Chandrakant Jha, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for two murders and given the death penalty for another. The petition challenged the power of Constitution courts to award such sentences, specifically questioning Delhi HC’s decision to award him imprisonment for the rest of his life while commuting his capital punishment.Jha’s counsel Rishi Malhotra had argued that Constitution courts cannot take away the statutory rights of a convict to seek remission after serving 14 years jail term. Jha was awarded death penalty by trial court in 2013 for murdering a 19-year-old in 2007 and dumping his headless body near Tihar jail.Last year a bench of Justices A S Oka and Sanjay Kumar in Ravinder Singh vs Govt of NCT of Delhi, had said, “With regard to special category sentencing to life imprisonment beyond 14 years by fixing a lengthier term would be available to HCs and SC, even in cases where the maximum punishment permissible in law is duly imposed.”However, the bench had clarified that such sentencing must be restricted to grave cases “where allowing the convict sentenced to life imprisonment to seek release after 14 years of imprisonment will be tantamount to trivialising the very punishment imposed on such convicts.”But in judgments through decades — Gopal Vinayak Godse (1961), Mar Ram (1981) and V Sriharan @ Murugan (2016) — Constitution benches of SC have consistently ruled that life sentence is nothing less than life long imprisonment and would last till the last breath of the convict.","A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and R Mahadevan dismissed an appeal by a life convict from Chhattisgarh.

However, Dhawan alleged that neither of these commitments was fulfilled. In April 2011, an agreement was signed between the realty firm, Jaysinh, Janakraj and Sons LLP, and Dhawan, his son, and sister, stating that Aspria Constructions LLP would complete the redevelopment project. Between April and December 2013, Dave returned Rs. 3.29 crore of the Rs. 3.50 crore invested by the Dhawans in the project.

The Ghatkopar police have booked four partners of a realty firm , Punjalal G Dave Realtors LLP, after a 63-year-old Ghatkopar resident lodged a complaint of cheating . The resident alleged that the developer induced him to invest in a redevelopment project in 2011, failed to return his investment and profit, and cheated him of Rs. 3.91 crore. Maulik Dave, one of the directors of Dave Realtors, has refuted all the allegations levelled in the FIR and said that instead, the complainant, Sanjay Dhawan, has to pay them a huge amount.Dhawan, in the FIR, has alleged that his late father, Janakraj, was close friends with Harshadbhai Dave, the former owner of the firm, and Janakraj had invested Rs. 5.5 crore in the company.In 2005, Kalpesh Seth, a director at Seth Builders and a committee member of Jai Arihant Housing Society, Ghatkopar, approached Janakraj with a proposal to invest in the society's redevelopment. Between 2008 and 2010, they paid Seth a total of Rs. 82.63 lakh. However, the project was stalled in 2011, and the power of attorney was transferred to Sanjay. The society later decided to transfer the incomplete project to Punjalal Dave’s firm, and Dhawan provided a no-objection certificate for the same, states the FIR.However, Dhawan, in his complaint, alleged that the Daves later convinced him to invest further in two projects—Chandani CHS in Ghatkopar and Arihant Siddhi Apartment in Borivali, promising him 25% of the saleable area. From 2013 to 2015, Dhawan allegedly paid Rs. 3.91 crore via cheque, but these funds were never deposited in Aspria Constructions but in their personal accounts. Dhawan alleged that when he asked for his investment, the Dave group refused to entertain him. Dhawan claimed that despite repeated requests and warnings, the money was not refunded, and his family received threats instead.Speaking to TOI, Maulik Dave said, ""The entire FIR is bogus. We have filed a civil suit against him. Pending that, how can an FIR be lodged? We will be taking all legal remedies to quash the FIR. Dhawan, using his lies, has managed to lodge an FIR.

Who is Muhammad Yunus?

Coordinators of the recent student protests in Bangladesh have proposed the formation of a new interim government with Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief adviser. The announcement was made in a video released on Facebook early Tuesday.The Bangladesh army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman is scheduled to meet with the protest leaders at 12 pm local time (0600 GMT) on Tuesday.Muhammad Yunus, born on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong, Bangladesh, is a distinguished social entrepreneur , banker, economist, and civil society leader. He rose to international prominence in 2006 when he and the Grameen Bank received the Nobel Peace Prize for their pioneering work in microcredit and microfinance . These initiatives provide small loans to underserved entrepreneurs, empowering them to achieve economic and social development despite limited access to traditional banking services.In addition to the Nobel Prize, Yunus has been honored with numerous prestigious awards, including the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010. He co-founded Yunus Social Business – Global Initiatives (YSB) in 2011, which focuses on promoting social businesses worldwide. YSB supports these enterprises through incubator funds and advisory services, working with various organizations such as companies, governments, foundations, and NGOs.Yunus served as the Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland from 2012 to 2018 and was previously a professor of economics at Chittagong University. He has also played a significant role in Grameen America and the Grameen Foundation, which continue his efforts in microcredit. From 1998 to 2021, he was a board member of the United Nations Foundation, contributing to a range of UN initiatives.Professor Yunus has an extensive educational background, having studied at Dhaka University in Bangladesh before receiving a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1969. He began his academic career as an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University and later returned to Bangladesh to head the economics department at Chittagong University.Throughout his career, Yunus has held various influential positions, including serving on the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women (1993-1995), the Global Commission on Women's Health, and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance. His contributions have been recognized globally, with accolades such as the Mohamed Shabdeen Award for Science, the World Food Prize, the King Hussein Humanitarian Leadership Award, the Volvo Environment Prize, the Nikkei Asia Prize for Regional Growth, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Freedom Award, and the Seoul Peace Prize.In response to the famine in Bangladesh in 1974, Yunus sought to make a tangible difference for the impoverished. He initiated long-term loans to help individuals start their own small businesses, which led to the establishment of the Grameen Bank and the broader movement of microfinance. This innovative approach has helped countless people escape poverty and improve their quality of life.Yunus was sentenced to six months in jail by a court for violating the labour laws in this year's January but later in March he was granted bail.He was also jailed in a USD 2.3 million embezzlement case. The embezzlement case involves a workers welfare fund of Grameen Telecom, which owns 34.2 per cent of the country's largest mobile phone company, Grameenphone, a subsidiary of Norway's telecom giant Telenor.The charges involve the embezzlement of over 250 million takas and money laundering. The accused gave the money to trade union leaders instead of the workers. This way they deprived the ordinary workers of their rightful earnings.","Muhammad Yunus, born on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong, Bangladesh, is a distinguished social entrepreneur, banker, economist, and civil society leader.

PUNE: Over the last two days, a half-km, 15-ft deep and 5-ft wide crack developed on the hillside close to Panchale Khurd village near Malin has triggered landslide concern among the villagers .The hamlet , 3km north of Malin close to Dimbhe dam's reservoir, is about 150km from Pune. A landslide on July 30, 2014 claimed 151 lives when it buried Malin.Panchale Khurd villagers said the crack first appeared in 2015 but it was not as scary as it now is. The Geological Survey of India ( GSI ) has listed the hamlet as landslide-prone.Shekhar Sarkar , former deputy director general of the GSI, who had surveyed Panchale Khurd in 2016 after the Malin landslide, told TOI, ""If the cracks have widened and deepened, it is a clear indication of natural imbalance in the area.""He added that when the nature of the cracks changes, it means the material's state including soil is changing internally. ""It often depends on the type of the rocks. All these events must be investigated afresh to assess the situation scientifically,"" he added.A section of geologists told TOI that the district administration must carry out extensive awareness campaigns in landslide-prone villages. ""Only then will the people understand and identify the signs of a landslide. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the authorities to prevent such disasters,"" they added.In 2016, the Ambegaon tehsil administration shifted villagers to temporary shelters during the monsoon. However, villagers want permanent rehabilitation at a safe location. Memories of the Malin tragedy still evoke strong emotions. They do not want to face a similar situation due to the lackadaisical approach of the administration, the villagers said.Samir Gore, a villager, told TOI, ""The tehsil's administration should have resolved the rehabilitation issue by now. They promised us pieces of land to construct houses which needs financial support. There is no clarity on it yet.""","A half-km, 15-ft deep and 5-ft wide crack developed on the hillside close to Panchale Khurd village near Malin.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals.

Did Netflix donate $7 million to Kamala Harris's campaign?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-netflix-donate-7-million-to-kamala-harriss-campaign-the-truth-behind-the-boycott-claims/articleshow/112331969.cms,"Clarification from Netflix

The source of the donation

Fact-checking the claims

Social media has erupted with calls for a boycott of Netflix after unfounded rumors spread that the streaming giant donated $7 million to Vice President Kamala Harris 's presidential campaign.While Reed Hastings , co-founder and executive chairman of Netflix, did make a substantial donation, the company has clarified that it did not contribute any funds to Harris's election efforts.The misinformation began circulating online on August 2, 2024, with a viral Facebook post claiming, ""Netflix just donated $7 million to Kamala, BYE BYE Netflix! Cancel your subscription today.""Similar messages quickly spread across platforms like X, TikTok, Instagram, and even in Spanish-language posts following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 race and his endorsement of Harris.In response to the claims, a Netflix said, as quoted by AFP on August 1, 2024, ""This is a personal donation from Reed [Hastings] and has no connection to Netflix."" The company emphasized that it has not made any financial contributions to Harris’s campaign. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) confirms that corporate donations to federal campaigns are illegal, although corporations may create political action committees (PACs) to support candidates indirectly.Hastings, known as a significant donor to the Democratic Party, personally gave $7 million to a PAC supporting Harris’s presidential bid. According to a July 2024 report from The Information, Hastings stated that this was his largest donation ever to a single candidate. This money was channeled to a super PAC, which can accept unlimited contributions, rather than directly to Harris’s campaign.Andrew Mayersohn, a researcher at OpenSecrets, a nonprofit that monitors political spending, explained that direct contributions to presidential candidates are capped at $3,300 per election, or $6,600 for both primary and general elections. Larger donations are typically directed to PACs, which have different regulations.Despite the viral posts, other fact-checking organizations have confirmed that Hastings' donation was directed to a super PAC named Republican Accountability PAC and not directly to Harris’s campaign.Anne Zald, an expert in government regulation, stated that the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1972 strictly prohibits corporations and unions from making direct campaign contributions, a rule implemented amid concerns from the Watergate scandal and has been amended over the years.","The misinformation began circulating online on August 2, 2024, with a viral Facebook post claiming, ""Netflix just donated $7 million to Kamala, BYE BYE Netflix!""

Gulf employers sideline Pakistani workers due to 'deplorable standards',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gulf-employers-sideline-pakistani-workers-due-to-deplorable-standards/articleshow/112196238.cms,"The senate standing committee on overseas Pakistanis, chaired by senator Zeeshan Khanzada, was informed that employers in the Gulf region prefer hiring workers from countries like Bangladesh over Pakistan due to the 'deplorable standards' of Pakistani labour.During the committee meeting, it was underlined that the government is failing to recognise the potential in this sector.In response to criticism from committee members regarding the government's failure to leverage the potential of the Pakistani diaspora , secretary of the ministry of overseas Pakistanis and human resource development, Arshad Mahmood, provided a grim outlook on the situation, highlighting issues such as high crime rates and inappropriate behavior among Pakistani workers in the UAE, and a general lack of skills among the workforce.Mahmood disclosed that Pakistanis reportedly account for 50 percent of the crime rate among the labour force in the UAE. He mentioned that UAE authorities have raised concerns about inappropriate behavior, including making videos of women in Dubai without their consent.He also pointed out a declining trend in overseas employment for Pakistani workers, attributing this to the lack of skills despite technological advancements and modernisation efforts.Mahmood suggested that countries like Bangladesh serve as a model for Pakistan in terms of skilled labour force and recommended that Pakistan should follow their example.""The governments of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait have expressed various concerns regarding overseas Pakistanis,"" Mahmood informed the committee.He also said that the Pakistani diaspora consists of 10.7 million individuals, primarily employed in Saudi Arabia, UAE, the US, UK, and Canada.Another issue brought to light was the presence of organised gangs of Pakistani beggars operating in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, having entered these countries as pilgrims. Mahmood noted that many individuals travel to Saudi Arabia on Umrah visas, with Saudi authorities reporting that 90 percent of beggars arrested in the country are Pakistani.Senator Nasir Abbas raised concerns about Pakistanis living illegally in Iraq and questioned whether the ministry could assist them, as they are often subjected to poor treatment.Senator Zeeshan Khanzada also pointed out that many Pakistanis living illegally in Italy often deny their nationality, while the Pakistani embassy recognises them as citizens. He urged the ministry to take a more proactive role in obtaining a clear understanding of the situation and extending help to stranded Pakistanis.In response to the committee's queries, Mahmood said, ""A lack of resources and skill development among Pakistani workers has led to their replacement by workers from other countries.""","The senate standing committee on overseas Pakistanis was informed that employers in the Gulf region prefer hiring workers from countries like Bangladesh over Pakistan due to the 'deplorable standards' of Pakistani labour.
