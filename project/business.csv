I dedicate my last years to health: Ratan Tata in Assam

NEW DELHI: Ratan Tata , chairman emeritus of one of India's biggest conglomerates Tata Group , died at 86 after prolonged illness. He was admitted to the hospital due to his age and related medical conditions.In a statement, Tata's family said, ""We his brothers, sisters, and family take solace and comfort in the outpouring of love and respect from all who admired him. While he is no longer with us in person, his legacy of humility, generosity and purpose will continue to inspire future generations.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi mourned Ratan Tata and called him a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being.""Shri Ratan Tata Ji was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being. He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond the boardroom. He endeared himself to several people thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.""One of the most unique aspects of Shri Ratan Tata Ji was his passion towards dreaming big and giving back. He was at the forefront of championing causes like education, healthcare, sanitation, animal welfare to name a few,"" he added.Ratan Tata, who is also known for his charitable work, served as the chairman of the Tata Group from 1991 to 2012. During his tenure, he made significant contributions to the conglomerate founded by his great-grandfather over a century ago.In 1996, Tata established Tata Teleservices, the telecommunications arm of the group, and in 2004, he led the initial public offering of Tata Consultancy Services, the group's IT company.After stepping down as chairman in 2012, Tata retained the honorary title of chairman emeritus for several Tata companies, including Tata Sons , Tata Industries, Tata Motors , Tata Steel, and Tata Chemicals.Tata was awarded two of India's highest civilian honors: the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.One of India's most successful business tycoons, he is also renowned for his philanthropic endeavors. His personal involvement in philanthropy began in the 1970s with the initiation of The Aga Khan Hospital and Medical College project, which laid the foundation for one of India's premier healthcare institutions.After becoming the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, Tata's philanthropic efforts gained new momentum. He actively guided the Tata Trusts, established by his great-grandfather Jamsetji, towards addressing crucial social needs and established institutes of excellence such as the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, while also funding educational initiatives across India.Despite his reputation for class and elegance, Tata was not immune to controversies. Although the Tata Group was not directly implicated in the 2008 scam involving the allocation of second-generation telecom licences, Tata was drawn into the controversy through leaked recordings of purported phone calls he made to lobbyist Nira Radia. However, he was not implicated in any wrongdoing.In December 2012, Tata handed over control of Tata Sons to Cyrus Mistry, his deputy at the time. However, the owners had issues with the functioning of the first non-Tata family member, leading to Mistry's ouster in October 2016. Ratan Tata was said to be one of the shareholders who disagreed with Mistry on several projects, including Mistry's decision to discontinue the loss-making small car Nano, which was a pet project of Ratan Tata.Since 2017, Tata has been the emeritus chairman of Tata Sons. During this time, he has taken on a new role, supporting young entrepreneurs of the 21st century by investing in new age tech-driven start-ups that will play a significant role in shaping the future of the country. In his personal capacity and through his investment company RNT Capital Advisors, Tata has invested in over 30 start-ups, including Ola Electric, Paytm, Snapdeal, Lenskart, and Zivame.One wet monsoon evening not many moons ago, dog-lover Tata had decreed that any strays outside the conglomerate's HQ in downtown Mumbai be allowed shelter. Some never left but their benefactor is no more.","Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Group, dies at 86 after prolonged illness.

"Congress reviews Haryana loss, to pause EVM attack till it has ‘enough evidence’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-reviews-haryana-loss-to-pause-evm-attack-till-it-has-enough-evidence/articleshow/114131317.cms,"To ‘avoid bad optics’, Hooda & Selja not invited to Congress meet

NEW DELHI: Congress , which reacted to its Haryana debacle by blaming it on EVMs and rejecting the result as “unacceptable”, has decided to pause the line of attack and has turned the focus inwards to look into the role of factional feuds and weaknesses that prevented a win.The decision was taken at a review meeting convened on Thursday by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , with the party brass agreeing that it will firm up its position on EVMs as one of the key causes for the electoral loss only after it had gathered “firm evidence” of wrongdoing, sources said.A statement issued by Kharge’s office later in the evening said the party has decided to depute a technical team to look into complaints and discrepancies noted by candidates. “Congress will issue a detailed response based on the fact-finding team’s report on the counting process and functioning of electronic voting machines,” it said.The deliberations, held against the backdrop of supporters of factions led by former Haryana CM B S Hooda and former Union minister Kumari Selja pointing fingers at each other, saw Rahul Gandhi asserting the need for all to bury their differences and unite for the party’s interest. “The party’s interest is paramount,” a source quoted him as saying in the meeting. Fight between rival factions is widely seen to be the major factor in Congress’s defeat.Hooda, his loyalist and PCC chief Udai Bhan, Selja and her ally Randeep Singh Surjewala were not invited for the meeting, with sources attributing their exclusion to the concern to “avoid bad optics”. The party is planning to carry out booth-level assessment by seeking a report from each candidate to study the factors that played a role in the loss.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Ajay Maken said, “As you all know, as the exit polls and opinion polls had showed, the results were unexpected. There was a lot of difference between the exit polls and the actual results. We discussed what could be the reasons.” On whether infighting had hurt Congress’s chances in the polls, Maken said, “There are various reasons, from EC to internal differences, we have discussed all that and will hold more discussions going forward.”On Tuesday, party general secretary Jairam Ramesh and spokesperson Pawan Khera had blamed the “slow counting of EVMs” for the party’s defeat to BJP: a bitter surprise which has helped the saffron rival gain momentum and raised doubts about the viability of Congress’s planks — guaranteed MSP purchase of entire farm produce, scrapping of Agnipath scheme, caste census and an “imperilled Constitution”.The rejection of the outcome, a first for a national party, drew a strong protest from EC, which rejected all the charges and raised eyebrows in independent quarters. BJP, of course, lashed out at Congress.Besides Kharge and Rahul, general secretary K C Venugopal, senior observers for the polls Ashok Gehlot and Maken, as well as secretaries for the state participated in the review meeting. Party in-charge of the state Deepak Babaria joined the meeting online from Ahmedabad.","Hooda, his loyalist and PCC chief Udai Bhan, Selja and her ally Randeep Singh Surjewala were not invited for the meeting.

What is the Mahadev betting scam?

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Sourabh Chandrakar, one of the main promoters of the Mahadev betting app , is expected to be brought to India soon following his recent formal arrest in Dubai on the basis of an Interpol issued arrest warrant in a money laundering and fraud case.Chandrakar along with another promoter of the app, Ravi Uppal was detained in that country late last year following the ED 's request for issuance of a Red Notice (RN) against them.Sources said Chandrakar is expected to be either extradited or deported to India over the next few days after he was formally placed under arrest in Dubai recently.Red corner notices was issued against Chandrakar in October 2023 after the ED had moved a special court in Raipur, filed a chargesheet and obtained a non-bailable warrant against him.The Mahadev online betting scam, a complex web of illicit operations involving individuals from Bhilai, the steel city, and orchestrated from the UAE and various states in India, was uncovered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) following a series of raids in Chhattisgarh in 2023.The scandal, which unfolded during the previous Congress regime in Chhattisgarh, has since become one of the most significant controversies in the state.According to ED findings, the Mahadev online betting app was an unauthorized platform that facilitated illegal betting on various sports, including cricket and football, as well as other forms of gambling. Operating across India and internationally, the app attracted a large number of users with the promise of easy money.However, beneath the surface, it was allegedly involved in laundering vast sums of money, funnelling illegal earnings through a complex network of offshore accounts and shell companies.The ED's crackdown involved a series of high-profile raids across multiple locations, targeting individuals who wielded significant power during the Congress regime. These raids resulted in the seizure of incriminating evidence, including digital devices, financial records, and documents that revealed the extent of the app's illicit activities.The ED suspects that the betting app laundered over Rs 5,000 crores—a staggering amount that has raised concerns about the reach of such illegal operations within the Indian financial system.","Saurabh Chandrakar, the promoter of the Mahadev Online Book gaming-betting app, was arrested in Dubai.

MUMBAI: In one of the last cabinet meetings before the announcement of the assembly elections, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , who holds the finance portfolio, was present for only around 10 minutes and left immediately after tribute was paid to Ratan Tata Thursday.Thirty-eight decisions - many of them having major financial implications - were taken in the two and a half hours that the meeting continued for after he left.Chief minister Eknath Shinde presided over the meeting, and deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis was with him all the time.Insiders said it was possible he was unhappy with the state of affairs and the high number of urgent proposals being brought before the cabinet meeting at the last minute without prior circular. Over the past few weeks, the finance department has raised objections to several proposals moved in the cabinet.While Ajit Pawar could not be reached for his comments despite repeated attempts, NCP state unit chief and Lok Sabha MP Sunil Tatkare said there was no question of any friction in Mahayuti .""I was in Raigad and don't know what happened in the cabinet. But there is no question of any friction in the Mahayuti, and nothing should be read into anyone leaving the cabinet early if that has happened at all,"" Tatkare said.The state has already come under criticism for a slew of pre-election sops costing Rs 96,000 crore announced in the budget, including the Ladki Bahin scheme. The expenditure on the Ladki Bahin scheme on its own is slated to be Rs 46,000 crore per year.The state is on a spree of clearing land allotments, subsidies and guarantees in the run-up to polls. The finance dept has already warned that fiscal deficit could be as high as Rs 2 lakh crore for 2024-25.The department has warned that the fiscal deficit had crossed 3% of the GSDP, the limit set by the Maharashtra Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Act.""This was probably first time that Ajit Pawar has left the cabinet like this. The exact reason is not known, but this is uncommon. His chair was vacant throughout the meeting,"" an official said.Over the last few weeks, fault lines have emerged between the Mahayuti partners - Shiv Sena and Ajit's NCP.","Ajit Pawar, who holds the finance portfolio, was present for only around 10 minutes.

Hindus should take lessons from the events in Bangladesh, he said as his organisation enters its 100th year.On society, and the country in general, he said there is a famous saying that even God does not care about the weak.“It is the job of the administration to prevent such indigents from happening, and to control and punish the culprits immediately. But until they arrive, society has to protect itself and its property along with the lives of loved ones,” he said.Bhagwat said his description of the situation was “not meant to scare, intimidate, or incite fighting”. “We are all experiencing the existence of such a situation. It is everyone’s responsibility to make the country united, happy, peaceful and strong. Hindu society has a greater responsibility,” he added.Bhagwat said Hindus in Bangladesh are facing persecution and have been reduced to a minority. They will need help from the “Bharatiya govt” and Hindu community all over the world.He said there is a “sudden increase in the incidents in the country that incite fanaticism without any reason (sic)” but there are “democratic ways ways to express it and oppose them”.He said “resorting to violence, attacking a particular community… trying to create fear is hooliganism”.He said “deep state”, “wokeism” and “cultural Marxism” are topics of discussion nowadays. “In fact, they are the declared enemies of all cultural traditions. Complete destruction of values, traditions and whatever is considered virtuous and auspicious is a part of the modus operandi of this group,” he said and called for a national narrative against such elements while remaining within the purview of the law. These elements are capturing educational institutions and spreading their distorted philosophy, he said.","Mohan Bhagwat said Hindus in Bangladesh are facing persecution and have been reduced to a minority.

NEW DELHI: Highlighting serious concerns in the functioning of madrasas across the country and their failure to connect Muslim children to the mainstream, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights has written to all states and Union Territories recommending that state funding to madrasas and the Boards running them be stopped and the latter be disbanded.“Madrasas Boards pose multifaceted challenges to the realisation of rights of children, from not providing quality education to exclusion from mainstream education to lack of accountability,” states the NCPCR’s report titled ‘Guardians of Faith or Oppressors of Rights: Constitutional Rights of Children vs. Madrasas'. The Commission argues that constituting a Board or adhering to Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) Codes does not mean that the madrasas are following the provisions of Right To Education Act 2009 (RTE).Recommending that children from the Muslim community who are attending madrasas should be enrolled in formal schools , the commission which has sent its report to all states with the letter underlines that “religious education cannot be at the expense of formal education which is a fundamental right under the Constitution of India.”The commission has also recommended that all non-Muslim children enrolled in madrasas without consent of guardians or parents be taken out and admitted in schools for receiving fundamental education. Pointing out that Article 28 of the Constitution prohibits the imposition of religious instruction without consent of parents or guardians in case of minors, the report states that largely the states/UTs could not furnish the consent of parents of non-Muslim children for letting their children attend madrasas.Data shared by states which have Madrasa Boards shows that there were 9,446 non-Muslim children in madrasas in Madhya Pradesh followed by Rajasthan (3,103), Chhatisgarh (2,159), Bihar (69) and Uttarakhand (42) which comes to a total of about 14,819. The Madrasa Board in Odisha said there were no non-Muslim students enrolled and Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal did not provide the data as per the report.In the letter to chief secretaries, NCPCR chairperson Priyank Kanoongo said, “the exemption of religious institutions from RTE Act led to exclusion of children attending only religious institutions from the formal education system in keeping with RTE.”“What was intended to empower children ultimately created new layers of deprivation and discrimination due to wrong interpretation,” Kanoongo added.NCPCR states that the madrasas while providing religious education are not following the principle of secularism. “Also the exams administered by the Board of Madrasa Education and the books prescribed are not as per the curriculum given by NCERT and SCERT, keeping the students of Madrasas behind those who fall within the purview of RTE,” the report states.The NCPCR report also drew attention to the need to map the unmapped madrasas in the country. “There are 19,613 recognised madrasas and 4,037 unrecognised madrasas in the country (UDISE+ 2020-21). The enrollment for recognised Madrasas is 26,93,588 and for unrecognised Madrasas is 5,40,744,” it is stated. “Based on the estimation of 1.1 crore Muslim children that are out-of-school and attending madrasas, there could be more than 80,000 unmapped madrasas in the country,” the commission noted with concern.",National Commission for Protection of Child Rights has written to all states and Union Territories recommending that state funding to madrasas and the Boards running them be stopped.

NEW DELHI: In 2013, Ratan Tata candidly spoke about his initial experience as a student at Harvard University , revealing how he felt “confused” and “humiliated” by the impressive accomplishments of his peers. Tata described anxiously crossing off each day on his calendar, eager to return to what he referred to as the “normal world,” according to a report from the Harvard Gazette.Reflecting on those early days, Tata said, “It was the only time in my life where I sat and crossed out day by day how many days were left before I could return to the normal world.”Tata attended Harvard Business School ’s (HBS) Advanced Management Program in 1975.He recounted his experience during the 2013 dedication ceremony of Tata Hall, a seven-story glass-and-limestone building at HBS named in his honour. The Tata Group , along with the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Tata Education and Development Trust, had donated $50 million in 2010 for its construction, which began in 2011. Tata Hall now serves as a residential and educational space for the executive education program.Despite the challenging start, Tata noted the transformative impact of his time at Harvard. “As I look back, those 13 weeks were probably the most important 13 weeks of my life. They transformed me and my perspective,” he said, adding that the initial confusion he felt gradually faded, allowing him to appreciate the depth of his learning experience at the institution.“But what it did do for me, as I soon found out, the confusion sort of disappeared, and you understood the magnitude of what you had learned in a manner that I believe is not possible to do in places other than at this business school,” he explained.In designing Tata Hall, Tata, an architect by training, aimed to create a welcoming and transparent environment for students. “Can the building touch the ground lightly?” he had asked the architect, showcasing his vision for the structure.Harvard’s dean, Nitin Nohria , lauded Tata's contribution, stating, “Although our School has welcomed international students since its very first class in 1908, Tata Hall represents by far the most significant gift made by an international alum.” The facility supports over 9,000 executive education students annually, featuring 179 bedrooms, two classrooms with 99 seats each, and multiple conference spaces.","Tata attended Harvard Business School’s (HBS) Advanced Management Program in 1975.

Research found that each 10% increment of total daily food intake from UPF (%/day) was associated with 17% higher incidence of diabetes.Even among the UPFs, researchers found, breads, biscuits and breakfast cereals, sweets and desserts, and plant-based alternatives were associated with lower incidence of diabetes.Ultra-processed savoury snacks, animal-based products, ready-to-eat meals, and sugar-sweetened beverages/artificially-sweetened beverages were associated with higher risk of incident of diabetes, the study revealed.Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of Fortis C-Doc , said ""It is especially important for India, where fast food consumption and type 2 diabetes are on the rise, especially post Covid-19 pandemic. Currently, there is an increased reliance on ready-to-eat meals and snacks, increasing heart attack and fatty liver risk, besides diabetes,"" he said.","The Lancet study involved over three lakh people for an average of 10.9 years.

The court said while it has an obligation to protect rights of citizens, it must also ensure that individuals who approach the court without adequate reasons for delay cannot be allowed to seek relief at their leisure.The petitioner, Tamrdwaj Yadav, had moved HC, challenging rejection of his application for compassionate appointment.His father, Punaram Yadav, a waterman under Work Charge Establishment, died on Feb 14, 2005, but it wasn't until Oct 17, 2007, over two years later, that he applied for compassionate appointment. Govt guidelines set a six-month deadline on this. The department rejected his application on Dec 10, 2009, and Yadav filed a petition in HC under Article 226 of Constitution on May 14, 2015.The petitioner had contended that he was a minor at the time of his father's death and applied for compassionate appointment as soon as he turned 18. However, court found that this did not sufficiently justify the delay in filing the petition. The petitioner had siblings and his mother, who could have applied for the appointment but failed to do so within the prescribed time, the court noted.The court said the delay reflects ""inactivity and inaction"" on part of the litigant. Furthermore, the petitioner's claim for compassionate appointment was also weakened by the fact that his family had other earning members, which negated the immediate need for employment support.Considering legal principles surrounding delay and laches, the court dismissed the writ petition, reiterating that such inordinate delays are detrimental to equity and justice. The petitioner's failure to act promptly, coupled with absence of a compelling reason for the delay, led to the conclusion that the case could not be entertained.In a twist of fate, the petitioner died of Covid in 2020 during pendency of the petition. Thereafter, his legal representatives were brought on record.","Chhattisgarh HC has dismissed a writ petition on grounds of unjustifiable delay.

We will continue to preserve this heritage. However, if our interests are threatened, we will not hesitate to take a big step.

But, due to that chaos, the tradition of committing atrocities against Hindus was repeated there.""""For the first time, Hindus united and came on roads for their protection.But, by the time this radical nature of committing atrocities out of anger is there - not only Hindus, but all minorities will be in danger,” Bhagwat added.Bhagwat said that there is a need for global Hindu support for those affected and urged the Indian government to offer assistance adding, “Being weak is a crime. If we are weak, we are inviting atrocity. Wherever we are, we need to be united and empowered.”Commenting on the narratives circulating in Bangladesh, Bhagwat said, ""In Bangladesh, such discussions are going on that we have a threat from India and hence we have to side with Pakistan since they have a nuclear weapon we can stop India... We all know which countries are pushing such discussions, and narrations, we don't need to take their name. Their wish is to create such conditions in India as well.

Bhagwat said, “We have such a big and diverse society - to create that diversity as a division, or to divide even when there is no diversity but to make them think that we are diverse and hence we are aloof - giving such narration - to agitate people, to create an environment when the society loses faith and start disrespecting govt, law & order, administration - it helps in establishing supremacy over the country by remaining abroad.”Referring to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, he said, “Situations are challenging sometimes and sometimes good...

MUMBAI: Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar said on Friday that he had left the cabinet meeting early on Thursday to attend a farmers' event in Latur and that there was no friction between him and CM Eknath Shinde or anyone in Mahayuti . The opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi, meanwhile, took a dig at the state govt over the issue, with Congress' leader of opposition Vijay Wadettiwar saying efforts were being made to sideline Ajit Pawar.TOI had reported on Thursday that Pawar left early from the cabinet meet and 38 decisions were later taken.Senior officials who were present said Pawar, who holds the finance portfolio, was missing when decisions with major financial implications were taken.“The cabinet meeting started late, and I had to leave for a pre-scheduled meeting. The cabinet meet was supposed to start at 11 am but it started late. I had to take a flight to reach Nanded and then take a chopper to Ahmadpur to attend a farmers’ meeting. So I informed CM Eknath Shinde and DCM Fadnavis and then left,” Ajit Pawar said.Wadettiwar said, “It is coming to light that there are always disputes in the cabinet meetings, but this dispute is not for the interest of the state, but for the sake of self-interest. Eighty decisions were taken even when there is no money in the coffers. Ajit Pawar tried to discipline the finance department. Lately, fiscal discipline is being undermined. Mahayuti will leave the state destitute.

Among the projects, 19 are in J&K, 18 in Arunachal Pradesh, 11 in Ladakh, 9 in Uttarakhand and 6 in Sikkim.Singh on Friday also said the armed forces must be prepared for ""asymmetric warfare"", which has been brought home by ongoing conflicts in the present ""complex and ambiguous world situation"".""Unconventional and asymmetric warfare, including hybrid war, will be part of future conventional wars. This necessitates that armed forces should keep all these facets in consideration while formulating strategies.

"Roblox dismisses claims made by Hindenburg report: ""...don't support their agenda""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/roblox-dismisses-claims-made-by-hindenburg-report-dont-support-their-agenda/articleshow/114178326.cms,"Read Roblox’s statement here



“Roblox rejects the claims made in the Hindenburg Report.

Safety and civility have been foundational to Roblox since the company’s inception nearly two decades ago, and the company has invested heavily throughout its history in its Trust & Safety efforts. Every day, tens of millions of users of all ages have safe and positive experiences on Roblox, abiding by the company’s Community Standards. Roblox takes any content or behaviour on the platform that doesn’t abide by its standards extremely seriously, and Roblox has a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent malicious or harmful activity on the platform. For more information about Roblox’s safety efforts, see this most recent blog post.

The financial claims made by Hindenburg are misleading. The authors are short sellers and have an agenda irrespective of the substance of Roblox’s business model and results. Roblox’s topline is growing quickly. Bookings grew over 22% to $955.2 million in Q2 2024 (the most recent publicly reported quarter) up from $780.7 million in Q2 2023. Over the last four quarters, cash provided by operating activities has totaled $646.3 million and free cash flow was $440.3 million. An examination of Roblox's GAAP balance sheet and GAAP cash flow statement makes that clear. The focus on cash bookings and cash flow are themes that the company has focused on consistently with investors dating back to when it was a private company. The authors made no attempt to highlight any of that because the positive facts simply don’t support their agenda.

The authors neglected to accurately report on the company’s public disclosures. Roblox takes its reporting obligations seriously. Since Roblox’s initial public filing, the company has included a Special Note Regarding Operating Metrics that explains how the company’s key operating metrics (including DAUs, hours, and bookings) are calculated. As an example, below is selected language from the company’s most recent 10-K regarding Daily Active Users (emphasis added):

‘We define a DAU as a user who has logged in and visited Roblox through our website or application on a unique registered account on a given calendar day. If a registered, logged-in user visits Roblox more than once within a 24-hour period that spans two calendar days, that user is counted as a DAU only for the first calendar day. We believe this method better reflects global engagement on the platform compared to a method based purely on a calendar-day cutoff. DAUs for a specified period are the average of the DAUs for each day during that period. As an example, DAUs for the month of September would be an average of DAUs during that 30-day period.

Because DAUs measure account activity and an individual user may actively use our platform within a particular day on multiple accounts for which that individual registered, our DAUs are not a measure of unique individuals accessing Roblox. Additionally, if undetected, fraud and unauthorized access to our platform may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement of DAUs. In many cases, fraudulent accounts are created by bots to inflate user activity for a particular developer’s content on our platform, thus making the developer’s experience (which refer to the titles that have been created by developers) or other content appear more popular than it really is. We strive to detect and minimize fraud and unauthorized access to our platform.’

There is additional detail in the company’s filings on hours, bookings and other metrics that provide abundant clarity on the company’s approaches to measuring and reporting these critical metrics. Roblox looks forward to discussing its most recent financial results and answering any questions on the company’s third-quarter earnings call on October 31, 2024.”

Roblox, the popular online gaming platform, has dismissed the allegations presented in a recent report by Hindenburg Research , a firm known for its activist short-selling. In a statement, Roblox rejected the claims outright, accusing Hindenburg of misrepresenting key aspects of its business and having a vested interest in driving the company's stock price down. The gaming platform specifically addressed the report's financial claims, labelling them ""misleading"" and emphasising its strong revenue growth and positive cash flow.Roblox also highlighted its commitment to user safety, a point of contention in the Hindenburg report , and reiterated its dedication to providing a secure and positive experience for its users.Earlier this week, a Hindenburg report accused Roblox of inflating its user count by as much as 42% and misleading investors. The report claimed that the game intentionally includes alternate accounts and bots in its user metrics, despite having the ability to distinguish them. Hindenburg also raised concerns about child safety on the platform, citing examples of young users being exposed to explicit content.In an official statement, Roblox wrote:","Hindenburg Research accused Roblox of inflating its user count by 42% and misleading investors.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Importantly, Thursday was the seventh day of Durga puja when the goddess is worshipped as Kalratri, one of the forms of Kali.The theft coincided with the recitation of Islamic songs by a group, including two clerics, at a Durga puja pandal in Chattogram. The songs included one proclaiming the universal victory of the Islamic revolution.The theft has heightened fears gripping Hindus after the regime change in Aug, putting a question mark on chief advisor Mohammad Yunus's promise to provide security to the minority community and safeguard their rights.Anger among Hindus ran high in Chattogram after a group of six, including Shahidul Karim, who teaches at Tanzimul Ummah Madrasa, and Mohammad Nurul Islam, a teacher of Darul Irfan Academy, recited Islamic songs after misleading the organisers. The group was allowed on the dais after they told the organisers that they intended to sing nationalist songs.The two clerics have been detained. The six are members of Chattogram Cultural Academy, a pro-Jamaat-e-Islami body, according to sources. Jamaat, however, denied any links with those detained.Chattogram deputy commissioner Farida Khanom visited the puja venue Thursday and assured that the administration would nab the absconding accused within 48 hours.The puja committee expelled two of its senior functionaries for not being vigilant enough.

An 18-year-old Nepali mountaineer Nima Rinji Sherpa set a new world record by becoming the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres.As per the news agency ANI, his historic feat was completed on Wednesday when he successfully scaled Tibet's 8,027-metre-high Shisha Pangma , marking the culmination of his two-year mission to conquer the most daunting mountains on the planet.Summiting all 14 ""eight-thousanders"" is considered the ultimate achievement in mountaineering, requiring climbers to cross into ""death zones,"" where oxygen levels are too low to support human life for long periods. Nima’s success at such a young age has been hailed as a remarkable testament to his strength and determination.Looking back at his journey, Nima posted about the achievement on his Instagram page. He said, ""This summit is not just the culmination of my personal journey, but a tribute to every Sherpa who has ever dared to dream beyond the traditional boundaries set for us. Mountaineering is more than labour; it is a testament to our strength, resilience, and passion.""Wanting this feat to be an inspiration for the younger generation, he further said, ""Through #SherpaPower, I want to show the younger generation of Sherpas that they can rise above the stereotype of being only support climbers and embrace their potential as top-tier athletes, adventurers, and creators. We are not just guides; we are trailblazers. Let this be a call to every Sherpa to see the dignity in our work, the power in our heritage, and the limitless possibilities in our future.""""To humanity as a whole: let this climb remind us that the peaks we reach together, united, are far greater than any individual achievement. As a teenager, witnessing the division caused by borders, wars, racism and other conflicts, I call for love, respect, and harmony among all people. In this vast world, we are but one human race. No summit, no boundary, no conflict is worth more than the peace and unity we can achieve by understanding and supporting one another,"" he added.Then he called out to the people to preserve nature and said, ""The mountain does not define us; we define the mountain We are its guardians, similarly the world we live in should be defined by people who reside in it ! Let’s all unite to protect and preserve our natural resources to live a sustainable and adventurous life!""Nima Rinji hails from a family of renowned mountaineers.He reached the summit of Shisha Pangma early in the morning, accompanied by fellow climber Pasang Nurbu Sherpa. ""He reached the summit this morning. He had trained well, and I was confident he would do it,"" said his father, Tashi Sherpa, while expressing pride in his son’s accomplishment.The President of the Nepal Mountaineering Association , Nima Nuru Sherpa also expressed his happiness at Rinji’s achievement. “This is a proud moment for our country. Nima broke all the stereotypes, and his success has given a message that nothing is impossible if you have a strong determination"".Nima Rinji began his mountaineering career in earnest in August 2022 when he summited Mount Manaslu at the age of 16. By June 2024, he had successfully climbed his 13th mountain, Kanchenjunga, the third-highest peak in the world. His ascent of Shisha Pangma on October 9, 2024, completed his record-breaking achievement.The record for the youngest person to summit all 14 peaks was previously held by Mingma Gyabu 'David' Sherpa, who achieved the feat at the age of 30 in 2019. Nima Rinji, however, accomplished the same feat at just 18 years and five months, completing his journey in two years and ten days, according to Seven Summit Treks, the expedition organiser.Nepali climbers, particularly Sherpas, have long been considered the backbone of the climbing industry in the Himalayas, often carrying equipment and setting up routes for foreign climbers. However, in recent years, Sherpas have gained recognition in their own right, taking centre stage in some of the most challenging climbs.","Nima Rinji Sherpa is the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres. His historic feat was completed on Wednesday when he successfully scaled Tibet's 8,027-metre-high Shisha Pangma. Nima’s success at such a young age has been hailed as a remarkable testament to his strength.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114082342,imgsize-559266,width-400,resizemode-4/114082342.jpg"

Reality via research

Same old story

all

Remember that movie,? It opens with a manager of a ritzy London hotel acting snooty to a Singaporean mom and her kids. Why don’t you try Chinatown, the manager tells them, in a fine example of British racist prejudice. Mighty cheesed off, mom calls her husband, who solves the problem – by buying the hotel his family was trying to check into.That scene tells you everything about Singapore’s wealth.It reinforced a certain image of the city-state. Singapore – everything’s shiny, everyone’s happy. This is a country where a popular slogan was built around the idea of material possessions. Called “5Cs”, it defined Singaporeans’ aspirations – cash, country club membership, car, credit card and condo. Plenty of people in other countries want/have these things, too. Only Singapore coined a slogan around this.Plus…This is by no means an exhaustive list of what makes Singapore tick.But…Singapore is not all shiny, happy.A well-heeled visitor driving down a beautiful road from Changi airport to a world class hotel, thence to dine at a world class restaurant (Singapore hosts five of the world’s top 100 restaurants) won’t probably see this, or even know about it – there’s poverty , some of it deep, in Singapore. And it’s a problem likely to sharpen because the city-state, like many rich countries, is ageing.Most countries define a poverty line, a level of income/expenditure that differentiates the poor from the non-poor. There's a good reason for this. A poverty line allows policymakers to better target those who need the most help. India has a poverty line, so does America, and so do most countries. Singapore doesn’t.Why? Singapore govt’s approach, as Arabella Woo wrote in a London School of Economics research paper (“Inequality in Singapore: The Hidden Poor”) is “to reward citizens in alignment with the work that is done”. As for economically vulnerable citizens, govt wants “citizens…to protect themselves…to do it themselves”.If that’s your take on poverty, obviously there’ll be no official poverty line. Naturally, there’s no official count of poor people either.With govt not defining poverty, researchers have had to work with other data. A superbly researched paper (“A handbook on inequality, poverty and unmet social needs in Singapore”), by Catherine J Smith, John A Donaldson, Sanushka Mudaliar, Mumtaz Md Kadir & Lam Keong Yeoh, quotes a separate study by one of the authors, who had used expenditure survey data. Per that study, “there are 110,000 to 140,000 households in Singapore who fit the definition of absolute poverty…these include the working poor, unemployed poor and poor retiree households”.Absolute poverty is defined as an economic situation where a person or a household doesn’t earn enough to cover basic needs.In a small country (population just over 6 million), 140,000 households, that is, around 560,000 people (reasonably assuming 4 people per household), is not a vanishingly small number. You wouldn’t think, visiting Singapore, there are more than 5.5 lakh people living in absolute poverty.Economists also use a concept called relative poverty – a measure that captures living standard relative to that enjoyed by those earning median wage (a median is defined as the middle value of a sequence of numbers, arranged in ascending or descending order).By this measure, per the handbook quoted above, 25% to 30% of Singaporeans live in relative poverty. The same research points out that many Singaporean middle-class families have faced “stagnating wages and an increased cost of living”. This double whammy hits middle-classes, and the poor, who are hit harder, in many countries, including India. But it’s also true for that island of gleaming high-rises.In a report on poverty and inequality in Singapore, BBC said this: “The city-state, which has some of the highest-paid ministers in the world, is a place of sometimes extreme contrasts, with glittering condominiums and towering facades just a stone's throw from one-room rental apartments inhabited by elderly and blue-collar families.”The same BBC report also quoted two local studies that concluded that in multiracial Singapore, it’s not race but class that’s become the deepest social faultline.Poverty, absolute or relative, and sharp income inequality in Singapore can be traced to pretty much the same set of reasons that’s produced similar outcomes in other countries. Policy attention on maintaining high GDP growth, low corporate taxes to attract investment, an emphasis on meritocracy, and the transition from old economy to knowledge economy. Implemented well, as Singapore govt has, this set of policies can produce shining economic performance – but it can also produce an underclass that gets caught in a deprivation trap. And the problem gets worse, as is the case in Singapore, when a society starts ageing. Elderly poor face the worst kind of poverty.None of this invalidates Singapore’s success story. But all of it tells us about a Singapore that most people don’t know exists.To saySingaporeans are crazy, rich is crazy, and full of rich irony.","At $141,500, its per capita income in PPP terms (a fairer measure than nominal dollar figures) ranks second after Luxembourg globally.

Demis Hassabis: Demis Hassabis: The video gamer and knight who became a Nobel Laureate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/demis-hassabis-the-video-gamer-and-knight-who-became-a-nobel-laureate/articleshow/114117951.cms,"Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind Technologies, the AI division behind Gemini, poses for a photo at the Google DeepMind offices in London, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2024 after being awarded with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.(AP Photo/Alastair Grant)

Demis Hassabis , Britain’s recent Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry, has a remarkable background that bridges the worlds of video games and artificial intelligence . Unlike most teenagers, who typically spend their time playing video games, Hassabis spent his formative years developing them. His big break came in 1994 when he co-designed the hit game Theme Park , a simulation where players manage amusement parks.Born in London to a Greek Cypriot father and a Singaporean mother, Hassabis excelled academically. He earned a double first in computer science from Cambridge University, later launching his own video game company. His intellectual curiosity led him to pursue a PhD in cognitive neuroscience , which became a stepping stone to co-founding the AI startup DeepMind . This venture was eventually acquired by Google for £400 million in 2014.Now 48 years old, Hassabis holds the position of Chief Executive at Google DeepMind, the company’s advanced AI unit. He was knighted in 2023 for his services to artificial intelligence, and his work has culminated in the Nobel Prize, which he shares with colleague John Jumper and US academic David Baker. Their award stems from groundbreaking work in using AI to predict and design the structure of proteins, a significant achievement in both the scientific and AI communities.Hassabis has long emphasised the connection between gaming and artificial intelligence, describing games as an entryway to the world of AI. His early passion for chess, coupled with a fascination for chess computers, sparked ideas about how machines learn, which would later influence his pioneering work in AI. His startup, DeepMind, achieved global recognition by building AI systems that outperformed humans in complex games like Go, chess, and Starcraft II.Beyond gaming and research, Hassabis’s expertise is highly valued by governments and thought leaders. In 2020, he was called upon to provide advice to the UK government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies during the Covid-19 pandemic. His reputation as a forward-thinking AI expert led figures like Dominic Cummings and Tony Blair to seek his counsel on national and global matters.As a leader in Google’s AI research, Hassabis is at the forefront of the global AI race, with major US tech companies such as Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft competing for breakthroughs. While deeply involved in advancing AI technologies, Hassabis is acutely aware of the risks. In recent years, he has voiced concern over the potential dangers of AI, likening its risks to those of pandemics and nuclear war. In 2023, he signed a statement urging global leaders to treat the threat of uncontrolled AI systems as seriously as they treat other existential challenges, such as climate change.However, Hassabis remains optimistic about AI’s potential for good. The Nobel Prize itself is a testament to this, particularly his work with AlphaFold, an AI system that accurately predicts protein structures . This development has far-reaching implications for medical research and drug development, showcasing the profound ways in which AI can benefit society.Despite his caution regarding AI's dangers, Hassabis continues to champion its capacity to address complex global problems. His leadership in both AI innovation and ethical considerations ensures that he will remain a key figure in the future of technology.","Demis Hassabis is the CEO of Google's AI division, DeepMind.
