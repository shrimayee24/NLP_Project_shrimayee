"Concept of ‘brain-dead’ unscientific, says petitioner: SC struggles to understand medical jargon, adjourns hearing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/concept-of-brain-dead-unscientific-says-petitioner-sc-struggles-to-understand-medical-jargon-adjourns-hearing/articleshow/123776993.cms,"NEW DELHI: Attuned to understand the legal jargons, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Monday found it difficult to digest the medical terminology saturated arguments of a doctor who challenged the validity of the definition of brain-dead in the Transplantation of Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994.Appealing against a Kerala HC judgment, Dr S Ganapathy told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that the concept of brain death and certification in India is unscientific and is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. He said Sections 2(d) and 2(e) THOTA, relatable to brain death, are unconstitutional.Section 2(d) provided the meaning of ‘brain-stem-death’ as a stage when all functions of the brainstem have ceased permanently and irreversibly. Sec 2(e) provided that ‘deceased person’ means a person in whom permanent disappearance of all evidence of life occurs, by reason of brain-stem death or in a cardio-pulmonary sense, at any time after live birth has taken place.As he continued to explain brain-stem death, and its different meanings in different countries, Justice Kant-led bench said, “It is almost impossible for us to understand the medical terminologies you use. Why don’t you make a presentation on this before the National Medical Commission or experts from the health ministry?”“Ultimately, even if the court or the authorities accept your definition of bran-death, ultimately it would require the government to move a Bill in Parliament to amend the law.Can SC direct Parliament to amend a law? Will it not violate the Constitution-mandated separation of power,” the bench asked.Dr Ganapathy said organ transplant is the biggest business in India and only the poor patients are declared brain-dead to enable harvesting of the organs for other rich patients. “Why is it that hospitals declare only poor patients as brain-dead and not the kin of a SC judge, advocate or a rich and influential person,” he asked.The bench said, “If Parliament chose a definition of brain-death, the courts must accept it. We will not be able to change it even as the Supreme Court. You may argue that the brain-death definition given in the law is incomplete, but it is not an incorrect one.”When the court was about to dispose of the appeal, Dr Ganapathy said his earlier petition, challenging another order of the Kerala HC asking him to approach appropriate authority regarding malpractice in hospitals in declaring a person brain-dead, is pending since 2018 and requested that the present appeal be tagged with that one. SC gladly agreed to escape the medical jargon.","Dr S Ganapathy challenged the validity of the definition of brain-dead in the Transplantation of Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994. He told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that the concept of brain death and certification in India is unscientific.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123777021,imgsize-960185,width-400,resizemode-4/image-used-for-representative-purposes.jpg"

AGRA: Semi high-speed trains Gatimaan Express and Vande Bharat, which usually run at 160 kmph, have been operating at a reduced speed of 130 kmph for over a year, largely due to the absence of the Kavach system on the Delhi-Agra rail route. The Railway Board had directed the speed reduction from 160 kmph to 130 kmph (maximum speed) until the automatic train protection system (Kavach) became operational.As per an RTI reply by Indian Railways to TOI, clarified: ""Train numbers 12049, 12050, 12001, 12002, 20171, 20172, 22469 and 22470 are currently being operated at a speed of 130 kmph. As per Railway Board letter no. 2021/Sig/Kavach/Vande Bharat dated June 24, 2024, the above-mentioned trains will be operated at a maximum speed of 130 kmph on the Agra-Delhi section until the automatic train protection (ATP) system becomes operational. ""On June 24, the Railway Board issued a letter and stated the issue of speed of these trains was examined, and specifically mentioned three trains: 20171/20172 (Hzt Nizamuddin-Rani Kamalapati Vande Bharat Express), 22470/22469 (Hzt Nizamuddin-Khajuraho Vande Bharat Express) and 12049/12050 (New Delhi-Virangana Lakshmibai Jhansi Gatimaan Express).Gatiman is India's first semi high-speed train, launched in April 2016 to connect Delhi's Hzt Nizamuddin station with Agra Cantt in just 100 minutes, which runs between Nizamuddin and Jhansi.It used to run at a speed of 160 kmph between Delhi and Agra as tracks were laid there to suit the train's speed. In addition, trains 20171/20172 and 22470/22469 also used to run at 160 kmph between Delhi and Agra.Similarly, New Delhi-Rani Kamalapati Shatabdi Exp (12002/12001) used to run at 150 kmph between Delhi and Agra. The RTI stated the combined ""punctuality of these trains between April 1 and July 31 stood at 77.9%."" Giving details about the Kavach system in the Delhi-Agra section, the RTI added: ""ATP work is in progress in the Palwal-Bhuteshwar section of North Central Railway. Equipment has been installed, energised and RFID tags are fixed at the site. An Independent Safety Assessment (ISA) inspection has been done by the inspecting authority and the ISA report is awaited. ATP work is in progress in Bhuteshwar-Agra section of North Central Railway. Tender awarded on March 31, 2025.""Kavach is an indigenously developed automatic train protection (ATP) system. It is a highly technology-intensive system which requires safety certification of the highest order (SIL-4). This system involves the placement of RFID tags on tracks in station areas and other places, installation of stationary 'Kavach' units at several places such as stations, and installation of towers and antennas along the tracks.","Gatiman is India's first semi high-speed train, launched in April 2016 to connect Delhi's Hzt Nizamuddin station with Agra Cantt in just 100 minutes.

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports. The move covers offering exemptions covers key materials such as nickel, gold, pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals, according to a Reuters report.Since assuming power in January, Trump has unleashed a global trade war, announcing reciprocal tariffs on most major countries around the world. After announcing high tariffs on most countries in April, the Trump administration later used these as tools to negotiate trade deals which it says are favourable to the US. While some trade deals have been announced, exact details of many are yet to emerge.The new directive identifies more than 45 categories of goods that will qualify for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who agree to framework deals reducing Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security law.It also brings US tariffs into line with commitments under existing arrangements with allies including Japan and the European Union. The exemptions for countries covered by these agreements will begin at 12:01 AM EDT (0401 GMT) on Monday.In the order, Trump notes that any decision to reduce tariffs will hinge on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and broader US national interests.According to the White House, the tariff cuts apply to goods that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or where domestic production is insufficient. Officials said the order also introduces carveouts for certain agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented pharmaceutical articles.Once a reciprocal trade deal is in place, the US trade representative, Commerce Department and customs will have authority to waive tariffs on qualifying imports without requiring a new executive order, a White House official added.The zero-tariff list includes graphite and different forms of nickel, crucial for stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries. It also covers pharmaceutical compounds such as lidocaine, used as an anaesthetic, and reagents used in medical diagnostic testing, as per Reuters.Gold imports in multiple forms, including powders, leaf and bullion, are also exempted. Switzerland, a major supplier, has been hit by tariffs of 39% as it has not yet secured a deal with Washington.Other categories benefiting from the changes are natural graphite, neodymium magnets and LEDs. At the same time, the order scraps earlier exemptions for certain plastics and polysilicon, a material vital for solar panels.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday.

NEW DELHI: A wildlife survey conducted in Arunachal Pradesh has brought out first-ever photographic evidence of the elusive Pallas’s cat in the state, reaffirming the eastern Himalayan terrain as a global biodiversity hotspot.The survey, conducted by WWF-India in association with the forest department of the Arunachal Pradesh government, also recorded the presence of other wild cats - snow leopard, common leopard, clouded leopard and marbled cat - above 4200 metres, indicating the landscape’s unique wild cat diversity.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh at nearly 5,000 metres is a powerful reminder of how little we still know about life in the high Himalayas,” said Rishi Kumar Sharma, head-science and conservation, Himalayas programme, WWF-India.Pallas’s cat is one of the most elusive and rarely photographed wild cats, and remains one of the least studied feline species. Its documentation in Arunachal Pradesh extends the known distribution of the species in the eastern Himalaya, adding to earlier confirmed records from Sikkim, Bhutan, and eastern Nepal.Though WWF-India conducted the survey during July-Sept last year, its findings were released only recently.The organisation claimed to have deployed 136 camera traps in 83 locations across 2,000 sq km of rugged high-altitude rangelands in West Kameng and Tawang districts, making it one of the most extensive wildlife monitoring exercises.Besides getting photographic record of Pallas’s cat, the survey documented the highest elevation records for common leopard at 4,600 metres above sea level (masl), clouded leopard at 4,650 masl, marbled cat at 4,326 masl, Himalayan wood owl at 4,194 masl and grey-headed flying squirrel at 4,506 masl.WWF-India’s findings noted that the elevation records for these species were the “highest in India to dateand may exceed previously known global elevation limits”.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh is a milestone for wildlife research in the eastern Himalayas.

NEW DELHI: Applicants for US non-immigrant visas (NIV) will now need to schedule their interview appointments in their country of citizenship or legal residency, barring a few exceptions for places where Uncle Sam is not conducting routine NIV operations.This means Indians requiring to travel to America at a short notice will no longer be able to book a quick B1 (business)/B2 (tourist) appointment date abroad - something they used to do during Covid-19 when the wait times back home was as high as three years due to massive backlog of applications - if and when a similar situation emerges here again.NIVs include those issued for tourism, business, to students, temporary workers, and those engaged to marry US citizens. This is the latest in a series of changes made by the Trump regime to visa rules.""Effective immediately, the department of state has updated instructions for non-immigrant visa applicants...

Two years ago, the US consulate in Frankfurt had set aside NIV interview appointments ""specifically for Indian applicants"" as interview wait period for B1/B2 visas in India that time was 15-20 months.""Indians would travel to Bangkok, Singapore and even Frankfurt for B1/B2 interviews. They would stay there for a week to 10 days, get their passport back from the US consulates there and return to India.

The exception: ""nationals of countries where the US govt is not conducting routine NIV operations must apply at the designated embassy or consulate, unless their residence is elsewhere"", said the state department. For instance, the designated locations for Russia are Astana and Warsaw, Islamabad for Afghanistan, and Dubai for Iran.In his second presidency, Donald Trump has been tightening visa rules.From last Tuesday (Sept 2), all non-immigrant visa applicants - including applicants under the age of 14 and over the age of 79 - ""will generally require an in-person interview with a consular officer"" barring a few exceptions, the US state dept said in a July 25 update.This exception includes ""applicants renewing a full validity B-1, B-2, B1/B2 visa... within 12 months of the prior visa's expiration, and who were at least 18-years-old at the time of the prior visa's issuance.""","The wait time for a B1/B2 interview in India as of now is three and a half months in Hyderabad and Mumbai.

However, past records of procurement scams suggest the rot may run much deeper.A closer scrutiny of the data reveals that in at least nine districts, procurement figures exceeded actual production reported in 2022-23. In Chhindwara, 7,628 tonnes of pulses were procured this year against a production of 3,074 tonnes in 2022-23. If accurate, this would mean the district's pulse production more than doubled in just a year.In Khargone, procurement reached 10,712 tonnes compared with 8,120 tonnes of output in 2022-23. Even in smaller districts like Umaria, Betul, Mandla, Dhar, and Satna, procurement exceeded last year's production - in some cases more than two-fold.Some districts that reported zero production in 2022-23 also showed procurement this year.In 2017, TOI reported how more pulses were procured than produced in Narsinghpur's Tendukheda block. At least 300 ""farmers"" who sold pulses worth Rs 7 crore could not be verified, leading to probe committees and demands for a CBI inquiry.

Justice Sanjeev Narula, however, ruled there was no infirmity in the SRB order as his offence was of the ""gravest order"" and struck at the security of the State. The HC said prolonged incarceration is a relevant factor and the reviewing authority must weigh it, but it cannot prevail over the larger interests of society where the underlying crime was designed to destabilise the State and spread fear among its citizens and international visitors.Sodozey was a close aide of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, one of the principal conspirators in the kidnapping case who was released in 1999 in exchange for passengers aboard the hijacked IC-814. He was convicted in 2002 under the provisions of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), a stringent anti-terror law of that time, besides IPC Foreigners Act, for acting under the banner of the banned terrorist outfit Harqat-ul-Ansar.He was awarded death penalty which the commuted to life imprisonment by SC in 2003.In the recent order, Justice Narula said: ""The petitioner, in concert with his co-conspirators, abducted and held captive four foreign nationals, not for private gain or personal animosity, but with the intent of compelling the sovereign Govt of India to yield to demands of a militant organisation. Such conduct is not merely an ordinary crime but an attack upon the very fabric of civil order, striking at rule of law and the security of the State. The broader objective, employing fear and intimidation to secure political ends, marks this case apart from conventional offences, placing it in a category of exceptional gravity.""The convict argued the maximum prescribed term of incarceration, inclusive of remissions, is capped at 25 years, and havincompleted over two decades in jail, he is eligible under the 2004 policy of Delhi to be released.","Nasir Mohd Sodozey alias Aftaab Ahmed had challenged the Sentence Review Board (SRB) order of June 30, 2023.

"Accept Aadhaar as voter ID proof, SC directs EC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/accept-aadhaar-as-voter-id-proof-sc-directs-ec/articleshow/123775716.cms,"NEW DELHI: Accepting a major demand of the opposition, the Supreme Court on Monday ordered the Election Commission to accept Aadhaar cards, in addition to the 11 documents specified under the Special Intensive Revision (SIR), as a proof of identity of a person to enable him to file application for inclusion in the Bihar electoral roll.After hearing senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who complained that EC was acting contrary to a series of directions by SC to accept Aadhaar as proof of identity, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi ordered, ""Aadhaar cards shall be accepted as proof of identity of a person for filing applications for inclusion/exclusion of names from the voter list. It shall be treated as the 12th document (under SIR).""The direction for inclusion of Aadhaar as a document in addition to the 11 allowed by EC came after the poll panel's strong resistance to the petitioners' repeated pleas for acceptance of Aadhaar as an identification document. Justices Kant and Bagchi said Aadhaar card is not alien to the Representation of People Act as one of its provisions provides for Aadhaar as identity proof.The Election Commission through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi told the bench that of a total of 7.24 crore names included in the draft Bihar voter list, 99.6% of voters have submitted one of the 11 documents specified under SIR. ""The clamour for making Aadhaar as an identity document is probably to include illegal migrants in the voter list without verification of their citizenship,"" he said.The bench took note of the EC's concern and said, ""The authorities concerned will verify the genuineness of Aadhaar cards like any other document submitted by a person seeking inclusion or exclusion of name from the voter list and that Aadhaar will not be considered a proof of citizenship."" It posted the matter for further hearing on Sept 15.EC, which was also being represented senior advocate Maninder Singh, told the bench that opposition parties have not been able to point out any serious lapse with regard to 65 lakh exclusions on the triple counts of death, permanent migration and dual enrolment. Dwivedi and Singh said RJD, leader of the opposition alliance in Bihar, has alleged mistakes with regard to only 265 names.SC also issued notice to EC on an application by Ashwini Upadhyay seeking intensive revision of electoral rolls in Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. The Mamata Banerjee govt has already filed a petition in SC against SIR in Bengal.When EC said Aadhaar is forged by illegal migrants, the bench said there are instances of even the other 11 documents, including passport and birth certificate, being forged.""Those who are claiming citizenship based on forged documents would have to be eliminated after scrutiny. No illegal migrant can be included in the voter list,"" the court said. The bench said EC revision manual suggests passport and birth certificate as proof of identity but to make the electoral roll inclusive, the commission went beyond these two to specify 11 documents which could be relied upon as identity proof.

DEHRADUN: At a construction site in Delhi, Rohit Kumar can sometimes be spotted running with bricks on his back. A resident of Bihar's Khagaria, he may look like another labourer battling at a work site. But Kumar is also a marathon runner.The 32-year-old has secured podium finishes in at least seven marathons, including Lucknow, Dehradun and Prayagraj. His latest feat - finishing second in a gruelling high-altitude marathon in Spiti in Aug - even took the Indian Army by surprise.Commending his effort, Army's Uttar Bharat posted on X: ""At just 32, Rohit Kumar, a daily wage labourer from Delhi, doesn't chase records or sponsorships. He runs to survive, fuelled by necessity, not luxury... No coach, no fancy gear. Just raw resolve.""Kumar said he has run in over 100 marathons, averaging five a month. ""Now I am focusing on quality runs. That is why I participated in the high-altitude Spiti marathon organised by the Army, where I finished second in the 77 km Kunzum La-Kaza Ultra under the Surya Spiti Challenge,"" he told TOI.His timing in the male open category was 7:48:52, close to winner Nikhil Singh's 7:42:44.Impressed, the Army has offered him support for future runs. ""I have been invited to another high-altitude marathon in Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh. They assured me of covering my travel, food and lodging. Hopefully, I will get another podium finish,"" he added.Kumar's story could have been different. After enrolling in a medical course in Russia, he spent two years there before money ran out & his farmer-parents called him back in 2017. Struggling to find jobs back home, he took work at construction sites.In 2020, stuck indoors during Covid, he began watching videos of global marathons in New York, London and Tokyo. Inspired, he started training, squeezing time between hard labour shifts. His day begins at 4.30am with running, followed by construction work from 8 am to 5 pm, where carrying loads up floors doubles as endurance training. In the evening, he swims for an hour before cooking dinner and resting.Kumar now dreams of representing India in the Triathlon at the 2028 LA Olympics. ""I spend Rs 20,000 a month on diet and equipment from my Rs 30,000 earnings to realise this dream,"" he said.Assuring all support to Kumar, PRO Defence (Dehradun), Lt Col Manish Srivastava said, “The Indian Army is always there to support such raw talents who have the potential to make the country proud in sporting events on national and international levels.

Urvashi Claims ₹70 Lakh Jewellery Stolen at London Gatwick, Claims No Support





MUMBAI: Oil bottles and coconuts—items that are confiscated during the airport security check have, in a twist of fate, ended up becoming ‘dangerous goods' for over 15 senior officials of Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) as they have lost their jobs for taking these goods for personal use, said aviation sources.Last month, the MIAL management allegedly forced over 15 middle management officials to resign for having pocketed these security restricted articles (SRA).These goods were marked for disposal.SRA items are objects such as knives, batteries, toys, cello tape, chilli, lighters, e-cigarettes, coconuts, oil, and so on, which are banned in the passenger cabin and hence confiscated from flyers by the CISF during pre-departure security check.The resignations happened last month, from Aug 1, after MIAL's HR department confronted these officials with CCTV footage taken in the previous months. The footage showed these officials taking these SRA items for personal use. Some of the officials TOI spoke to claimed were told to either submit a resignation right away or face termination.MIAL did not respond to a query sent by TOI.The CISF sends the confiscated items to the MIAL terminal operations department.At the end of each 12-hour shift a register entry is made of the confiscated SRA goods.""The items are bound for the garbage bin or are boxed and collected by NGO Rescue Foundation. We assumed taking an SRA item wouldn't be a major violation which calls for termination. For years now, none of the bosses bothered with the confiscated coconuts, oil bottles. It was more of a nuisance,"" said one of the officials who was made to resign. He added the officials who lost their jobs have been on the rolls of MIAL for over 1 to 2 decades and hold posts such as senior duty terminal officers, duty terminal manager, deputy manager and senior executive, among others. ""Our grievance is that we were kicked out without as much as a warning for a first-time offence,"" the official added.Advocate Ashok Shetty said, ""The punishment should be commensurate with the gravity of the misconduct and the length of service put in by the employee concerned. The Supreme Court of India emphasises due process and a fair hearing before terminating an employee."" He added that 15 people being forced to resign amounts to illegal termination without holding an inquiry.Mumbai airport handles about 1.5 lakh passengers a day. Despite placards displaying pictures of restricted items, passengers pack in these items. For instance: An entry made in May during a day shift duty had items such as e-cigarettes (2), match box (25), coconut (50), cells (10), tools (2), cutter (08), talcum powder (20), scissors (12), knife (9) and screwdriver (14).Passengers apparently pack in all sorts of restricted items. Some days the SRA confiscated items list stretches to over two dozen items—spanners, masking tape, toy gun, rope, candle, plier, spices, luggage chain, pepper spray, big umbrella, big bat, copra and chilli powder.","Over 15 senior officials of Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) have lost their jobs for taking these goods for personal use.

NEW DELHI: The water level of the Yamuna river in Agra rose further, exceeding the danger mark and reaching the walls of the Taj Mahal, officials said on Monday.Rising water levels have also flooded homes of residents living along the riverbank.The increase follows recent heavy rainfall in the lower Himalayan regions of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.According to local historian Raj Kishore Raje, the Yamuna’s water levels are similar to those in 2023 and have reached the Taj Mahal's walls, as last time.He added that there is no damage to the monument, as its construction is designed to withstand such water levels.The Mughal-era monument, situated on the banks of the Yamuna, remains safe.The district administration has set up a control room and is closely monitoring the situation to manage the flood risk.","The Yamuna River's water level in Agra has exceeded the danger mark, reaching the Taj Mahal's walls.

"Power bill down to Rs 18,000 a month from Rs 52,000: Why Mira Road society is first in Asia to be awarded certificate for green retrofitting",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/power-bill-down-to-rs-18000-a-month-from-rs-52000-why-mira-road-society-is-first-in-asia-to-be-awarded-certificate-for-green-retrofitting/articleshow/123770339.cms,"



Rahim Karovalia halts briefly between the two floors of a building in Mira Road to demonstrate the small wonder above us: A motion-sensor dimmable tubelight. As we approach it, its pale glow intensifies and lights up the landing. Karovalia's face lights up too as he motions to it, for this seemingly unremarkable electrical fixture has helped reduce the monthly electricity bill of his housing society by 65%.""Our electricity bill, which was previously around Rs 52,000, is now Rs 18,000,"" says Karovalia, 52, a managing committee member of Nav Yuwan Housing Society, a complex of 280 flats in Sector 4 of Mira Road (East), comprising of 1RK (400 sq ft) and 1 BHKs (580 sq ft) apartments.In Oct last year, a range of energy- and water-saving measures were implemented in this community. These included the installation of 150 motion-sensor lights in the buildings' corridors, lift lobbies and staircases; 14 high-efficiency floodlights mounted in the parking bay; a 44-kWp solar photovoltaic system set up on the terraces to power these upgrades; and a kitchen garden to promote urban greening. A composting unit is in the pipeline to feed the garden and support waste management.Nav Yuwan's home improvement solutions are part of a pilot designed and implemented by the nonprofit Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH), which aims to demonstrate that existing buildings can significantly reduce energy and water use, as well as emissions, through green retrofitting. This process involves upgrading or modifying buildings to improve sustainability and reduce their environmental footprint.At Nav Yuwan, the impact has been significant—an assessment reported 41% savings in energy, 35% in water, 59% in material efficiency, and a reduction in operational CO₂ emissions of 232.78 tCO₂/year. These achievements have earned the society a badge of honour, making it the first in Asia to receive the EDGE Advanced green building certification (in March this year) for meeting global benchmarks in emissions reduction and energy efficiency. Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies, or EDGE, is an international green building certification system developed by the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group.""We are very proud of the certification,"" says Karovalia, ""It demonstrates our efforts at sustainability to residents, vendors and the municipal corporation. It will, no doubt, also increase the value of our flats.""Beyond its immediate benefits to residents, the certification is significant because it positions the housing society as a successful model for green retrofitting. Nav Yuwan is not a newly-built development based on sustainable principles, but a 30-year-old housing complex retrofitted with modern materials and technologies to enhance its sustainability. The project's demonstrated efficiencies prove that older buildings can be upgraded to reduce climate-harming emissions—without the need for demolition or new construction—thereby positioning retrofitting as an effective climate solution. A study by the US-based nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) found that retrofitting an existing building produces 50–70% less carbon emissions than constructing a new one from the ground up.""Green retrofits improve thermal comfort, lower energy demand, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and extend the life of existing buildings,"" says Prerana Langa, CEO of AKAH, India. ""The Nav Yuwan pilot is a proof-of-concept for Climate Action Plan interventions on energy and water efficiency in residential sector and institutional buildings. It shows how practical, low-cost interventions can deliver meaningful measurable outcomes and improve resilience, without the need for new construction. ""The Nav Yuwan model aligns seamlessly with the Mira Bhayandar Climate Action Plan (MB CAP) 2024-2050—a joint initiative by the Mira Bhayandar Municipal Corporation and AKAH, launched in Jan this year—which targets a 36% reduction in emissions by 2047 through a focus on heat resilience and low-carbon housing. In 2023, Mira Bhayandar's residential sector accounted for 62% of the city's electricity consumption and 40.5% of its energy sector emissions.Nav Yuwan's retrofit has, therefore, prioritised energy-saving measures. These have not only been implemented in common areas, but in homes too. Each of the 280 flats at Nav Yuwan has been equipped with brushless DC (BLDC) fans that consume less than half the power of older models and generate lower electricity bills. ""We did not realise that small changes can have such big impacts,"" says Parvin Jasani, 64, whose monthly electricity bill has reduced from Rs 1,800 to Rs 1,000. ""We are now able to save more money."" Her husband, Bahadur, 63, notes that most people don't view their households as contributors to climate change—and as a result, don't know what changes to make to reduce their impact. ""Awareness of what people can do at the household level needs to be built,"" he says.AKAH built this understanding systematically through awareness and capacity-building programmes that combined technical guidance—such as the benefits of energy-efficient appliances—with behaviour change tips, like choosing bucket baths over showers and using air conditioners more efficiently. ""We always believed that the longer you use an appliance the more cost-effective it is. We did not realise that an old, energy-draining appliance can actually be more costly in the long run. Neither were we aware of the benefits of high-starred appliances,"" says Anisha Maknojiya, 48. This is why retrofits go hand-in-hand with awareness building.Word about the retrofit and its payoff has spread to other housing societies and several are keen to replicate the model, which costs Nav Yuwan Rs 17,500 per household unit. AKAH itself has retrofitted three municipal schools in Mira Bhayandar..Langa believes the model is easily scalable ""through policy inclusion in city CAPs, financing via CSR and municipal budgets, SHG/community funds for operation and maintenance, and bulk procurement to reduce costs.""""By linking retrofits to routine maintenance cycles, municipal budgets, and commercial investment returns, the model shifts from one-off projects to mainstream adoption,"" she says, ""This makes structural scale-up viable across Mira Bhayandar and replicable in other cities.""","Nav Yuwan Housing Society is the first in Asia to receive the EDGE Advanced green building certification for meeting global benchmarks in emissions reduction and energy efficiency.

Oracle India layoffs spark unease amid AI push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/oracle-india-layoffs-spark-unease-amid-ai-push/articleshow/123772084.cms,"



Bengaluru: Oracle India employees say project update emails have increasingly created unease, especially after recent layoffs, with many viewing them as a proxy for job cuts.Oracle, which employs close to 30,000 people in India, is facing anxiety similar to that of its global peers. ""Jobs as we know them just don't exist anymore,"" said an affected employee working in the database team. ""It was all over in less than 20 minutes — a Zoom invite, the manager on the call, and the HR rep telling me it wasn't about my performance but purely business reasons. My access was revoked very quickly. My RSUs were due to vest in February, but now I'll lose them,"" he said on condition of anonymity. ""My parents depend on me, and telling them was the hardest part,"" he said. Another laid-off employee was shocked when what began as a business update quickly turned into a layoff call, citing restructuring. ""I've signed up for outplacement services. But it will take some time. The HR only outlined the severance we would receive. The entire process felt cold and came as a complete shock,"" he added on condition of anonymity.Oracle is reportedly laying off employees in its cloud unit, impacting teams in both India and the US, according to a report by Data Center Dynamics.The job cuts are in the company's Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) division, which includes engineering, data centre operations, and AI/ML functions. Some media reports suggest that nearly 10% of Oracle's workforce in India has been affected. An email sent to Oracle did not receive a response before this article went to press. TOI could not independently verify the number of layoffs within India's OCI division.During her visit in 2016, Oracle CEO Safra Catz announced that Oracle would invest $400 million to build a state-of-the-art campus in Bengaluru, alongside additional investments to establish nine regional software and technology incubation centres across India and an initiative to train over 500,000 Indian students annually. The company already had a significant R&D footprint in Bengaluru, with Oracle India employing around 40,000 people in 2017. Oracle India's revenue grew to Rs 20,459 crore during the 2023-24 financial year from Rs 18,283 crore last year, representing an increase of 12%, according to data sourced from data intelligence platform Tofler. The company's net profit for 2023-24 was Rs 1,410 crore, a decrease of Rs 216 crore from Rs 1,626 crore in the previous year. However, financial details for the 2024-25 financial year are not available.A Reddit megathread revealed that one member of technical staff in Fusion India, with two years of service, received four months' severance, while another employee in the SaaS observability unit, with 5.6 years of service, was given eight months' severance. Some Oracle employees are facing the heat globally.Recently, online tech chronicler CRN reported that over 300 employees across California and Washington have been impacted. Some affected employees cited business reasons, including an AI deal, as Oracle layoffs hit its cloud infrastructure unit amid rising AI investments. Oracle and OpenAI have entered an agreement to develop 4.5 gigawatts of additional Stargate data centre capacity in the US. This investment is expected to create new jobs, accelerate America's reindustrialisation, and help advance US AI leadership. In a recent SEC filing, Catz said, ""Oracle is off to a strong start in FY26. Our MultiCloud database revenue continues to grow at over 100%, and we signed multiple large cloud services agreements including one that is expected to contribute more than $30 billion in annual revenue starting in FY28.""","Oracle India employees say project update emails have increasingly created unease, especially after recent layoffs.

GenZ protests in Nepal: 26 social media platforms were banned but not TikTok — Here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/genz-protests-in-nepal-26-social-media-platforms-were-banned-but-not-tiktok-heres-why/articleshow/123777566.cms,"Nepal Lifts Social Media Ban Following Deadly Protests

Why was TikTok not banned?



What's next?







GenZ protests in Nepal continued on Tuesday even after the government lifted ban on social media platforms, including Facebook, X and YouTube. The protests on Monday led to the death of at least 18 people, leaving 250 injured.“Stop the ban on social media. Stop corruption, not social media,” the crowds demanded, waving national flags.The district administration imposed an indefinite curfew in the capital and shut down schools, extending the restrictions to two other cities as well.However, what's interesting is that among the 26 banned apps, TikTok wasn't one of them.TikTok wasn’t banned this time because it, unlike some other platforms, formally registered in Nepal and continued to operate in compliance with local requirements.Under the new bill, social media companies must set up a liaison office or appoint a local point of contact, andTikTok had already agreed to such measures after its earlier ban in 2023.Back then, the app was blocked for allegedly disrupting “social harmony” and spreading indecent content, but the ban was lifted after TikTok executives pledged to respect Nepali laws, including the 2018 ban on pornography sites.Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli said that an investigation committee would be set up to probe the protests and the report would be submitted in 15 days.""I would like to assure you that an investigation committee will be formed to investigate and analyze today's entire incident and the damage, its condition and causes, and submit a report within 15 days to recommend steps to be taken to prevent such accidents in the future,"" he said.""I am deeply saddened by the loss of lives during today's demonstration. I express my deepest condolences to the families and relatives of those who lost their family members in this unthinkable incident. The government will provide appropriate relief to the families of the deceased and free treatment to the injured,"" he added.","Nepal lifts ban on social media platforms, including Facebook, X and YouTube.

AHMEDABAD: Twenty-six years after Mahendra Mills Ltd in Kalol, Gandhinagar, shut down, the Gujarat high court has ordered the auction of the mill's land within a week, fixing a base price of Rs 175 crore. The land parcels, measuring a total of 14,445 sq m, are not being put up for sale for the first time. An attempt in Jan 2014, with a base price of Rs 130.75 crore, failed to attract buyers.After obtaining valuations from two govt-approved valuers for the land - divided into three lots - Justice Mauna Bhatt fixed the auction base price at Rs 175 crore. The court took into account the valuation reports, expenditure incurred in the process, and the creditors' outstanding claims.According to the Textile Labour Association, 1,650 workers have been awaiting their dues for over 25 years since the mill closed in 1999. The company went into liquidation in 2001. Apart from other secured creditors, the mill owed its workers Rs 17.08 crore. So far, the official liquidator has disbursed only 19.2% of this amount, realised from the sale of other mill assets. The biggest asset-the land parcel-has remained unsold till now.The high court has permitted the official liquidator to proceed with the sale of the mill's assets through an e-auction, in line with the terms and conditions set by the ministry of corporate affairs. Part of the land is currently occupied by Sanrhea Technical Textiles Ltd, which has been allowed to continue its occupancy until the sale is finalised.Issuing directions for the auction, the HC clarified: ""It is made clear that finalisation of the auction is subject to the final order that may be passed by this court, and if required, the court will conduct a manual auction, inter-se bidding between bidders to fetch the maximum price of the property.""","Mahendra Mills Ltd in Kalol, Gandhinagar, shut down in 1999.

MUMBAI: Amazon is gearing up for a bigger spike in festive sales this year as the rejigging of GST slabs will make a range of products cheaper for consumers, boosting spending by the salaried class, many of whom scout for online deals when shopping for products, more so in the case of big-ticket items.Smartphones, electronics and durables are typically the most purchased products during festivals apart from ethnic apparel which is the go-to wear for festive. “We expect the festive sales to be bigger than last year. Consumers anyway have a habit of delaying big-ticket purchases till sales start and this time due to the GST cuts, the trend has accelerated. With a reduction in GST on millions of products along with exciting deals planned by sellers, customers can look forward to great savings this festive season,” Saurabh Srivastava, VP, categories at Amazon India told TOI.The govt’s move to ease registration process under the new GST regime as part of which sellers will no longer have to keep a registered office in every state is a “game changer,” Srivastava said, adding that it will reduce shipping costs for small sellers and increase their speed of delivery.Amazon has already started updating its system to enable sellers to pass on the GST benefits to consumers from Sept 22.","Amazon is gearing up for a bigger spike in festive sales this year.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22





DELHI/MUMBAI: The GST cut that makes cars cheaper and is expected to be a fillip for the auto industry in the second half of the year has caused a lull in sales in August as customers wait for the discounts to show up. Auto retail sales rose by just 3% in Aug to 19.6 lakh units, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations. Passenger-vehicle sales inched up by less than 1%.The month had begun briskly, with festive-season enquiries and bookings. But momentum stalled once govt unveiled its ‘GST 2.0’ reforms, which trim tax rates on several categories of cars by nearly 10 percentage points. Consumers, convinced that prices will fall, are deferring purchases until the new invoices come into force on Sept 22.Two-wheelers, usually more resilient, recorded only a 2% increase in sales. Floods in the North and patchy supplies of popular scooters curbed demand, though festival deliveries offered some lift. Commercial vehicles, helped by infrastructure projects, did better, growing by 9%. Three-wheeler sales slipped. The GST 2.0 reforms were announced by the PM on Aug 15.Twist In FinanceNon-bank lenders say the tax cut will shrink average ticket sizes and drag down loan growth for the year.The value of outstanding auto loans reached Rs 8.2 lakh crore in March, up 15.6% year on year. The increase was driven largely by a shift in consumer preference toward larger vehicles and SUVs, which pushed loan values higher even as the number of active loans grew at a slower pace of 9% to 1.59 crore.But if prices fall by about 10%, the volume of loans disbursed will moderate even if sales volumes eventually recover. As one financier put it: “The market value of vehicles has come down sharply, which means demand for loans will also come down.”","Auto retail sales rose by just 3% in Aug to 19.6 lakh units, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations.

Could France's economic turmoil spark eurozone debt crisis?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/could-frances-economic-turmoil-spark-eurozone-debt-crisis/articleshow/123777373.cms,".





Shortly before Francois Bayrou lost a confidence vote in parliament on Monday (September 8), the French prime minister warned that France's fiscal woes would put its ""very survival"" at risk.""You have the power to bring down the government, but you do not have the power to erase reality,"" Bayrou told lawmakers, adding the current reality in Europe's second-largest economy was that ""the burden of debt — already unbearable — will grow heavier and more costly.""What happens next is uncertain. Whether new elections will be called, as demanded by the far-right National Rally, or President Emmanuel Macron will manage to install another minority government, is the political side of the crisis.Economically, it's about money and France's towering debt burden. In absolute terms, no EU country holds more consolidated national debt than France. Sovereign debt has climbed to around €3.35 trillion ($3.9 trillion) — about 113% of gross domestic product (GDP), with the figure expected to rise further to 125% by 2030.Europe's debt kingFrance's debt-to-GDP ratio is so high that within the European Uniononly Greece and Italy surpass it.With a budget deficit of 5.4% to 5.8% this year, Paris also runs the largest budget shortfall in the 27-nation EU.To meet the EU's target of reducing the deficit to 3%, drastic savings are unavoidable.However, since cuts are currently politically untenable, financial markets have responded with higher risk premiums on French bonds. While German bonds carry an interest rate of about 2.7%, the French government needs to pay close to 3.5% interest for its debt.So should we worry about the stability of the single European currency, the euro, if the finances of the eurozone's second-largest economy slip out of control?""Yes, we should be worried. The eurozone is not stable at this point,"" says Friedrich Heinemann, an economist with the ZEW Leibniz Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim, Germany, even though he is ""not concerned"" about a new short-term debt crisis in the coming months.""But we have to ask where this is heading if a big country like France, which has seen a steadily rising debt ratio in recent years, now also faces further political destabilization,"" he told DW.Other major economies are also racking up historically high debt and must raise billions on capital markets. This fall, for example, Germany, Japan, and the US will need to issue new government bonds to finance their spending — a key reason global bond markets remain under pressure.The only reason the markets aren't even more nervous — meaning the spreads on French bonds aren't rising further — is the hope that the European Central Bank will step in and buy French bonds to stabilize the market, Heinemann thinks. ""But that hope could be misplaced, because the ECB has to be careful not to undermine its credibility.""It's been a long-standing political dilemma for successive French governments that whenever they propose austerity measures or economic reforms, parties on both the left and right cry foul and mobilize their supporters.Unions have already called a general strike for September 10, two days after the confidence vote.European Commission and ECB under pressureFrance now spends €67 billion annually just on interest payments. And it is under pressure because it has committed to gradually reducing its deficit in line with EU rules.But Heinemann also lays part of the blame on the steps of the European Commission because it ""helped create this mess.""""It kept turning a blind eye, even both eyes, when it came to France. Those were political compromises driven by fear of strengthening populists,"" he said, adding that ""France has already used up much of its fiscal space. Germany is in a much better position, with plenty of room for maneuver.""Stalled reformsAccording to Heinemann, France, like Germany, urgently needs major welfare reforms and spending cuts. The alternative would be higher taxes in a country that already imposes heavy tax burdens on both citizens and businesses.Therefore, Heinemann is skeptical that French politics can deliver a cross-party consensus on debt reduction. ""With populists on both the left and right gaining ground, I don't see that happening. The center is shrinking. That's why I'm pessimistic about France and don't see a solution.""For Andrew Kenningham, chief European economist at London-based Capital Economics, the risks to other European markets remain manageable for now.""So far, the problems seem largely confined to France itself, as long as the scale of the French issue doesn't grow too big,"" he said in a note to clients.But he warned of scenarios where France's crisis could escalate significantly, raising the risk of contagion.""After all, France is the eurozone's second-largest economy, with deep trade and financial ties to its neighbors, and it is also a leading EU political power,"" Kenningham noted, saying a crisis in France could therefore put the very viability of the European project into question.""We don't expect a crisis of that magnitude in the next one to two years. But if it were to happen, contagion could become a much bigger risk — one the ECB would have to address,"" he said.Bad timing for a political crisisFrance's turmoil comes at a time when the EU is locked in conflict with the United States over trade policy, including higher taxes on US tech giants proposed by France.It's poor timing for the EU to appear weakened by the political deadlock in its second-largest economy.For Heinemann, many political actors in France are ""Trumpists at heart,"" especially on the left and right of the political spectrum.""They could increase pressure on the European Commission to retaliate against Trump's tariffs with European tariffs,"" the economist warned, which would ""raise the risk of a real trade war"" and worsen the country's debt crisis even further.This article was originally written in German. It was first published on September 5, and updated on September 8 after the French prime minister lost a confidence vote in parliament.","France's debt-to-GDP ratio is so high that within the European Uniononly Greece and Italy surpass it.

NEW DELHI: LG Electronics India is looking to list on Indian bourses by middle of next month, with the company (the domestic arm of Korean global major LG Inc) understood to have re-valued its operations at around 20% lower to the peak of Rs 1 lakh crore that it had assessed earlier, banking sources have said.Also, the company may now sell around 10% of its equity in public offering against earlier plan for a 15% dilution, sources said. This would mean size of IPO may now be around Rs 10,000 crore against Rs 15,000 crore planned earlier.The sources told TOI that the company decided to opt for a lower valuation to factor in some of the corrections in Indian market since its last financial assessment. ""A lot of critical factors are behind the re-valuation, and these include the current geopolitical tensions and possible impact of the US tariffs,"" sources said.The IPO will be a full offer for sale by its Korean parent and the Indian company will not receive any money from this offer. Questions sent to LG India did not get any response. Sources said the company had delayed its public float in view of the volatility in local stock market.LG's IPO comes after Korean carmaker Hyundai's Indian arm got listed on the bourses in Oct 2024 through a Rs 27,870-crore IPO.As per the draft offer document filed by the company earlier, 35% of the offer will be reserved for retail investors, while 50% will be reserved for the institutional investors and the balance 15% will be marked for non-institutional investors (high net worth investors).In India, LG, which set up its business in the country about 27 years ago, is one of the leading white goods companies with a strong presence in categories like washing machines, refrigerators, panel televisions, inverter air conditioners and microwaves.It's been the number one player in this industry for 13 consecutive years (from 2011 to 2023) as per the value market share in the offline channel in India, a report by Redseer showed. Morgan Stanley India, Axis Capital, J P Morgan India, BofA Securities India and Citigroup Global Markets India are the lead managers to the LG Electronics offer.",LG Electronics India is looking to list on Indian bourses by middle of next month.

‘Conjuring’ Star Vera Farmiga Shares Creepy Bruise Photo, Teases Last Rites Secrets





The Rhode Island farmhouse that inspired the Hollywood horror film The Conjuring is going up for auction on Halloween.According to JJManning Auctioneers, the Burrillville property will be sold in a mortgage foreclosure auction on October 31.The house, known worldwide for its alleged paranormal activity, has long attracted ghost hunters and horror fans. Ed and Lorraine Warren, the paranormal investigators behind The Conjuring films, examined the farmhouse in the 1970s after the Perron family claimed they were tormented by violent hauntings.The 8.5-acre estate last sold in 2022 for $1.525 million to Bale Fire LLC, a company run by Boston developer and self-described medium Jacqueline Nunez. She turned the 18th-century house into a ghost tourism business, offering overnight stays and paranormal tours.perrBut the venture quickly ran into trouble. In 2023, Nuñez accused her property manager of theft after claiming she received the information from a spirit, WPRI reported. That dispute led to a legal battle with former employees over pay and treatment. Later that year, town officials revoked her entertainment licence, citing safety concerns and irregularities in her paperwork.Despite losing her licence, Nunez continued to run tours. Visitors complained of not receiving refunds for cancelled events, and she also clashed with figures in the paranormal community, including TV ghost hunter Jason Hawes, who accused her of harassment.By this summer, the business had collapsed under financial strain, leading the lender to move for foreclosure.Meanwhile, comedian Matt Rife and YouTuber Elton Castee, both known for their interest in the paranormal, have expressed interest in buying the house. The pair already owns another haunted property in Connecticut once linked to Ed and Lorraine Warren.The Burrillville farmhouse remains a magnet for believers, who speak of shadows, whispers, and sudden chills.","The Burrillville property will be sold in a mortgage foreclosure auction on October 31.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders. The meeting focused on artificial intelligence and investments in the United States.More than a dozen CEOs attended the event, including Bill Gates, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai. Trump, seated between first lady Melania Trump and Zuckerberg, asked each executive to share how much their companies were investing in America.One conspicuous absence was Elon Musk. The Tesla and SpaceX chief, once among Trump’s closest industry allies, has distanced himself in recent months following clashes over space policy and government contracts.Five Indian-origin executives — including Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Sundar Pichai (Google), Sanjay Mehrotra (Micron), Vivek Ranadive (TIBCO) and Shyam Sankar (Palantir) — were at the table. Their presence underscored the growing clout of Indian Americans in Silicon Valley and Washington, even as Trump moved to crack down on immigration.Trump brushed aside the significance of Friday’s jobs report, arguing that the “real economic numbers” will only be visible a year from now.He also downplayed current gains as being mostly construction-related and promised that the US would soon witness job growth “like our country has never seen before.”When asked if he planned to speak with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Trump confirmed, “I will be, yeah. We’re having a very good dialogue.” The remark came as Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on with no ceasefire in sight. Trump added that resolving the conflict had turned out to be “a bit tougher” than he initially expected, despite his claimed success in settling seven other wars.Sundar Pichai thanked Trump, telling him, “I’m glad it’s over” after a US judge threw out a landmark case that sought to break up Google’s Chrome browser. The ruling sparked a surge in Alphabet’s market value, which crossed $2.5 trillion this week. For Pichai, the dinner was a chance to reset ties with an administration that had frequently accused Google of bias.Bill Gates openly praised Trump’s Covid-19 vaccine initiative, calling it a model for rapid medical innovation. He said Microsoft was committed to helping the US government in disease research and listed ongoing projects on HIV, polio and sickle cell. Gates’ comments were made just hours after RFK Jr’s contentious hearing over vaccine policy.Trump said he did not watch health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s Senate testimony but heard he performed “very well.” Calling Kennedy a “very good person” who “means very well,” Trump noted he appreciates his different ideas, even if they are contentious. The hearing itself was marked by heated clashes over Kennedy’s sweeping health care and vaccine policy changes.","US president Donald Trump hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders.

US military-industrial complex is profiting from Ukraine war: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-military-industrial-complex-is-profiting-from-ukraine-war-report/articleshow/123776890.cms,"



While US president Donald Trump and some of his MAGA officials have accused India of fuelling Russia's war against Ukraine, a new report by the think tank, Observer Research Foundation (ORF), reveals that the US military-industrial complex has benefited enormously from the conflict, with an ""explosive"" growth in orders for arms, production, profits, and AI systems agreements.If the report is any indication, the boom has continued beyond Joe Biden's tenure as US Prez and into Trump's, despite the latter casting all blame on his predecessor for the conflict. From Feb 2022, when the war broke out, US has so far provided Ukraine with nearly $66.9 billion in military assistance, the report states.Between 2020 and 2024, 45% of Ukraine's arms came from the US, forming 9.3% of America's total arms exports in this period and peaking after the conflict began in 2022. Though the ORF report does not make a distinction or comparison between the two presidencies, this was the period of Biden's presidency.As president-elect in Dec last year, Trump criticised Biden administration's move to allow Ukrainian forces to use American long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory. Ever since he took office in Jan, Trump has repeatedly claimed that under his leadership, the war would not have broken out.However, 2024 onwards, and ""increasingly in 2025,"" US began shifting supplies to Ukraine from direct aid to sales, according to the report by Jaibal Naduvah of ORF. In Aug, for instance, US approved a $825 million sale of 3,350 extended range attack munitions (ERAM) missiles with associated equipment to Ukraine. Funding for these sales comes from Nato allies (Denmark, Norway, Netherlands) and US FMF programmes.In July, US persuaded European Nato states and Canada to buy over $10 billion in American arms, either to replenish stockpiles for Ukraine or for direct transfers under Nato PURL initiative. The agreement, clinched at the July 14 meeting between Trump and Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte, requires participating states to fund tranches of about $500 million each.Almost $2 billion has been committed via this route so far. On Aug 4, the first package of artillery & ammunition worth over $500 million was announced, funded by Netherlands. After that, Denmark, Norway and Sweden jointly pledged $500 million for equipment and munitions; and Germany and Canada declared they would fund a $500 million PURL package each for Ukraine.Further, at Nato summit in June, member states committed to raising annual defence and security spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, a 150% jump from the 2% target agreed in 2006 and reaffirmed in 2014 after the Crimea crisis. In 2025, all allies are expected to meet or exceed the 2% threshold. ""Notably, US accounted for 64% of Nato allies' arms imports in 2020-24, up from 52% in 2015-19, largely driven by Ukraine crisis,"" the report states.""US's share of global arms exports grew from 35% in 2014-19 to 43% in 2020-24, a rise of 21%. In 2024, the total value of transferred defence articles, services, and security cooperation activities under Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system was $117.9 billion, a 45.7% increase from $80.9 billion in 2023. Direct commercial sales in the same period rose to $200.8 billion from $157.5 billion, marking a 27.6% increase. Within US defence industrial base of more than 100,000 companies, five prime contractors - Lockheed Martin, RTX, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, and Boeing - secured over one-third of all Pentagon contracts... Continuous conflicts in different parts of the world - from Iraq and Afghanistan to Ukraine - along with growing Chinese threat, have generated steady windfalls,"" the report points out.""Ukraine conflict has set cash registers ringing for US defence contractors... Eisenhower's caution against the military-industrial complex is today more potent than ever,"" the report notes.","US military-industrial complex has benefited enormously from Ukraine conflict. US has so far provided Ukraine with nearly $66.9 billion in military assistance. 45% of Ukraine's arms came from the US, forming 9.3% of America's total arms exports in this period.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123777073,imgsize-23438,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump.jpg"
Ukrainian president Zelenskyy sees US tariffs on India as ‘right idea’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ukrainian-president-zelenskyy-sees-us-tariffs-on-india-as-right-idea/articleshow/123773209.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

Ukraine President Zelensky Supports Trump Tariffs Against India Over Russian Oil Trade. Here's Why





Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky jumped into the US-India tariff standoff on Monday when he backed the US decision to impose punitive import duties on countries making deals with Russia, while the Trump administration showed no signs of relenting on the vitriol its surrogates are spewing against New Delhi despite the US president’s assertions last week of a “special relationship” with India and that there’s “nothing to worry about”.Zelensky told ABC News in response to a question that he thought “the idea to put tariffs on the country (sic) who are continuing to make deals with Russia is the right idea”, even though 15% of his battered country’s diesel comes from India via refined Russian oil. US administration officials are now trying to press the EU to join the US in slapping additional sanctions on India for buying Russian oil even though, bizarrely, the EU is a beneficiary of Russian energy routed through India.White House trade counsellor Peter Navarro, meanwhile, resumed his rant against India on Monday, doubling down on the discredited view that only New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil was somehow fuelling Moscow’s war on Ukraine. “More bullshit from X. Fact: (India’s buying of Russian oil) “it’s blood money and people are dying,” Navarro said on X, whose owner Elon Musk has called him a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks”.In separate remarks on TV, the Trump surrogate expanded his attack to BRICS countries, calling them “vampires who are sucking our blood dry with their unfair trade practices”.“The bottomline is none of these countries can survive if they don’t sell to the US… let’s see what happens…I don’t see the BRICS alliance stay together since historically they all hate each other and kill each other,” Navarro said, after reports emerged of BRICS nations expanding and accelerating trade ties to counter the prospective loss of the US market due to high tariffs .Earlier, Navarro was mocked on X by readers who have challenged his views, pointing out, among other things, that China buys more Russian oil but has got a “hold” on additional sanctions, that the EU too buys Russian energy via India, that India’s refining and re-routing of Russian oil was approved by the previous US administration, and the US itself continues to trade with Moscow, all adding to Russia’s revenues. His response was to accuse “Indian special interests” of ""trying to interfere in domestic US dialogue with lies”.When Navarro ran a poll asking “should X present this ‘crap’ as comments from ‘diverse viewpoints’,” he was humiliated again: 80% of respondents said yes, pointing out that the community notes from readers on X takes into account viewpoints and approvals of contributors across regions and is not controlled by any one country.That again triggered Navarro who suggested Indians on X were weighing in on the poll. “India has the largest population in the world & all it can do is manage few hundred thousand X propagandists to jerk around a poll? Too funny. America: look at how foreign interests use our social media to advance their agenda,” he complained.Separately, meanwhile, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett insisted in a TV interview that India would continue to face sanctions because it is helping Moscow in its war against Ukraine, even though the question was about why the US is not sanctioning Russia itself directly. Several experts have called out the Trump administration for making India a fall guy for its inability to take on China and Russia directly, but Navarro, Hassett, and treasury secretary Scott Bessent continue to embarrass themselves by dancing around the issue, unable to explain why Beijing is getting a pass for buying Russian oil, and why India is being singled out.","Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky supports US tariffs against India over Russian oil trade.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert





Train operations on five rail sections in Punjab have been suspended due to damage caused to railway tracks and infrastructure by ongoing floods and heavy rains in the province, Dawn reported.According to an internal report compiled by the Pakistan Railways (PR) and cited by Dawn, the Narowal-Sialkot section has remained closed since August 27 after floodwater breached a portion of the track. The report said a Girder Span of bridge No 7 near Aik Nullah was also misaligned, allowing floodwater to maintain a high level and overtop the track. Repair works are underway and operations are expected to resume by September 12.The PR report further noted that the Chak Jhumra-Shaheenabad (Sargodha) section was closed for rail traffic on August 29 when an ""exceptionally high flood damaged bridge No 132 & 134 near Chiniot."" Efforts are ongoing to repair or reconstruct the bridge to restore train operations, it added, according to Dawn.Similarly, the Wazirabad-Sialkot section was closed on September 3 after floodwater overtopped the track between Wazirabad-Sodhra Kopra.The Jhang-Shaheenabad section has also been shut since August 28 after flooding breached an area near the Rivaz Railway Bridge over the river Chanab. ""The floodwater is still passing through the breached section, as the train traffic remains suspended,"" the report stated.Dawn further reported that the Khanewal-Shorkot section was closed on September 3 due to high flood levels at Abdul Hakim Bridge No 27 and breaches between Abdul Hakim and Darkana stations. Temporary disruptions were also recorded at Shahdra-Faisalabad, Lahore-Badami Bagh, Uggoki-Sialkot, Port Qasim-Bin Qasim, Kotri-Dadu, Tando Adam-Hyderabad, and Peshawar Saddar-Cant sections due to flooding, embankment cuts, mudslides, and fallen trees, the PR document noted.Meanwhile, the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) also reported widespread damage to its infrastructure.
