NEW DELHI: From Chennai to Patna, Enforcement Directorate (ED) has initiated a series of actions against bureaucrats and middlemen allegedly involved in taking bribes for influencing award of govt contracts.In one case, the agency Friday carried out searches at 16 locations in Chennai associated with various state officials and middlemen in connection with irregularities in award of govt contracts in Tamil Nadu.Around Rs 5 crore was seized during the searches.""The searches unearthed a deep-rooted and systemic corruption network involving prominent consultants across key govt departments. Evidence reveals that consultants/brokers acted as middlemen, floated shell companies and consultancy firms through which kickbacks were routed under the guise of service fees and consultancy payments,"" ED said.In another case related to irregularities in procurement of medical items in Patna Medical College and Hospital, ED attached 10 properties and other assets worth Rs 3 crore of various suppliers in Greater Noida, Patna and Darbhanga. The attachment in this case has exceeded Rs 6 crore, with over Rs 3 crore of assets attached earlier.PMCH case relates to procurement of medicines, reagents, machines and equipment at exorbitant rates and in higher quantities. Former PMCH superintendent OP Choudhary is one of the accused in the case. The alleged irregularities were committed during 2008-10.ED said the total irregularities and loss to govt has been estimated to be over Rs 12 crore. Bihar vigilance department has also filed a case and chargesheet against the accused persons.In the Chennai case, ED conducted searches in Chennai and Vellore on May 6 at 16 at premises associated with certain officers and prominent consultants engaged with Tamil Nadu govt departments.ED's money laundering case is based on an FIR by state vigilance department that had booked S Pandian, superintendent in the state's environment department, and others in an alleged disproportionate assets case.The agency claimed the web of corruption was found to operate through fixed commissions paid to officials for obtaining illegal and expedited clearances.ED said its investigation in the Chennai case has ""confirmed the role of key consultants: Prabhakar Sigamony, AK Nathan, Naveen Kumar, Santhosh Kumar and Vinoth Kumar, in facilitating illegal approvals"".

'India saw 9.3% excess deaths during first 2 Covid years': Government sources,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-saw-9-3-excess-deaths-during-first-2-covid-years-government-sources/articleshow/121071073.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: India recorded 9.3% 'excess deaths' in 2020-21, the first two years of Covid-19 pandemic, government sources said on Saturday referring to the latest Civil Registration System (CRS) data.Excess deaths, which refer to additional deaths from any cause observed during these years, over and above the expected fatalities in the absence of pandemic, was much higher in other high- and middle-income countries, govt sources said.""US reported 17.6% more deaths than expected in 2020-21 while Italy and UK reported 11.8% excess deaths and Russia reported 29.9% such deaths. France, Germany and Canada reported 6.7%, 5.3% and 5.2% excess deaths. Among the middle-income countries, Mexico had 43.6% excess mortality while Brazil had 12.6% excess mortality,"" they added.In the past, reports of exorbitantly high excess deaths in India during 2020 and 2021, based on modelling methodology, have emerged in public domain. A WHO report estimated India's excess deaths at 47 lakh. Another report in a top journal cited a figure of about 41 lakh excess deaths in this period. Some experts also suggested that the excess deaths were essentially caused Covid-19 and that Indian govt played them down.Govt sources said excess deaths in these years are not equal to deaths caused due to Covid. It includes reported Covid deaths (4.81 lakh by the end of 2021), unreported Covid-19 deaths, deaths due to all other causes, and possible indirect effects of Covid-19, they said.Officials from health ministry said the number of deaths documented in CRS has been increasing over time, even in the years preceding Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. The annual increment observed each year, compared to the previous year, has varied from 1.3% in 2016 to 9.9% in 2019, with the average increase over three preceding years (2016 to 2019) estimated at 6.4% per annum. ""Our teams conducted preliminary analyses of CRS data to assess cumulative excess deaths in the years 2020 and 2021,"" said an official. He added that based on the three-year (2016-19) annual rate of increase of 6.4% mentioned above, the expected number of deaths would be 81,31,869 in 2020 and 86,54,185 in 2021. However, the observed deaths were 81,15,882 in 2020 and 1,02,24,506 in 2021.""The excess deaths, defined as observed minus expected deaths, were (-)15,987 and 15,70,321, respectively,"" said the official. ""Thus, the total excess deaths over the two-year period amounted to 15,54,334. As a percentage, this is 9.3% higher than the expected deaths. This translates into about 1,249 excess deaths per one million population,"" he added.",Excess deaths refer to additional deaths from any cause observed during these years.

NEW DELHI: Before the pause in hostilities on Saturday evening, cross-border combat had rapidly moved up the escalation ladder with India strongly striking back at Pakistan by targeting nine airbases and two radar sites to inflict heavy damage in the early hours of the day.The operational situation seemed to be flaring up once again barely two hours after the cessation of hostilities at 5pm, with multiple ceasefire violations by Pakistan and air intrusions by its drones being reported from all along the western front.Senior officers, however, stressed that ""all major military actions"" have stopped from either side, though it may take some time for things to settle down on the ground amid the surcharged tensions between the rival forces.""As decided, Indian DGMO Lt-General Rajiv Ghai will talk to his Pakistani counterpart Major General Kashif Abdullah on Monday to work out the nuts and bolts of the truce,"" a senior officer said.The exchange of fire and shelling along the 778-km Line of Control petered out later in the night after taking place at multiple locations like Akhnoor, Nowshera, Poonch, Rajouri, Jammu, RS Pura, Arnia and Kathua in the evening.Some of the drones spotted at different locations in J&K, Rajasthan and Gujarat were taken down, while the rest flew back. ""There is no firing happening along the LoC now,"" an officer said.In the early hours of Saturday, India's swift and calibrated precision attacks came after Pakistan deployed fighters like F-16s and JF-17s, high-speed missiles like Fatah, armed drones and loitering munitions against Indian military bases at over 26 locations under its Operation Bunyan al-Marsoos (Iron Wall).With Pakistan firing several missiles at different airbases, India accepted it sustained ""limited damage to equipment and personnel"" at IAF bases in Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj. Pakistan, however, has suffered ""very heavy and unsustainable losses"" after Operation Sindoor was launched in the early hours of May 7.India's hit-back was particularly severe. Long-range weapons fired by IAF fighters caused extensive damage to crucial Pakistani airbases like Skardu, Jacobabad, Bholari and Rahim Yar Khan, with deep craters being formed on their runways.The other airbases to be targeted were Rafiqui, Murid, Nur Khan-Chaklala, Sukkur and Chunian as well as radar sites at the Pasrur and Sialkot aviation bases. The weapons used included BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, Crystal Maze-2 missiles, Scalp air-to-ground cruise missiles, Hammer air-to-ground precision-guided munitions and Spice-2000 precision-guided bombs.""In addition, the loss of air defence weapon systems and radars made the defence of Pakistani airspace untenable,"" Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said. Colonel Sofia Qureshi, in turn, said there was also ""extensive and precise damage"" to military infrastructure, command control centres, and logistical installations across the LoC.The officials did not take questions about how many fighters India had lost during the high-tempo Operation Sindoor, nor were the number of casualties given.They, however, warned Pakistan to cease and desist. ""Every misadventure by Pakistan has been met with strength. Every future escalation will invite a decisive response. We remain fully operationally, ready to launch whatever may be required in the nation's defence,"" Commodore Raghu R Nair said, after the truce was announced.The military officers also slammed Pakistan for a ""malicious misinformation campaign"" with ""totally false"" claims of destruction of an Indian S-400 air defence system in Adampur, the BrahMos missile base in Nagrota and the Suratgarh and Sirsa airfields, among others.""Pakistan also made false allegations that the Indian Army had damaged mosques.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Saturday dismissed claims that the pause in hostilities between India and Pakistan was driven by US pressure , emphasising that the agreement was firmly on New Delhi's terms. Contrasting the current understanding with past instances where India lost strategic advantages, the party credited the govt for rewriting the narrative.Citing India's new ' war doctrine ' that any act of terror will be treated as an 'act of war' against India, a BJP neta said only the US and Israel had comparable doctrines, marking India's assertive global stance.The functionary also highlighted India's leverage over the Indus Waters Treaty , which remains unaffected by the current India-Pakistan border understanding. Notably, World Bank, once a guarantor, has distanced itself from the treaty, strengthening India's position.""India is a rising economic power , while Pakistan is a struggling state. Our focus is the welfare of 140 crore Indians, not wasting time on a delinquent jihadi state,"" the BJP neta said. BJP contrasted the current pause in hostilities with historical agreements where India ceded advantages. The 1949 ceasefire, based on the Karachi Agreement, followed US-brokered talks and UN monitoring.The 1965 war ended with the Tashkent Declaration, mediated by the Soviet Union and the US, forcing India to return hard-won territories. The 1971 war, despite Pakistan's surrender, led to the Simla Agreement under Moscow's and Washington's influence. India released 99,000 prisoners without securing strategic gains, such as Pakistan vacating POK or formalising borders.The Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) operation in Sri Lanka (1987-1990) drained resources and ended in withdrawal, costing the life of former PM Rajiv Gandhi. Similarly, the 1999 Kargil war ceasefire, facilitated by the Clinton administration, saw India halt its offensive just as victory was in sight, missing a tactical opportunity.BJP said the current pause in hostilities reflected New Delhi's terms, prioritising national security and economic progress while maintaining strategic leverage. This approach, the party argued, ensured India's rise as a global power, unburdened by past concessions or external pressures.",BJP says pause in hostilities reflects New Delhi's terms.

NEW DELHI: Liver and kidney problems induced by alcohol consumption went up manifold in Andhra Pradesh between 2019 and 2024, a study by the state's health department has found, with the period under question coinciding with the YSRCP regime that is also facing charges of a massive ""liquor scam"".Studying the admissions under the Arogyasri scheme for free treatment to patients between 2014 and 2024, a three-doctor team set up by the health department found that alcohol-associated liver patients went up from 14,026 in 2014-19 to 29,369 in 2019-24.The worst affected were people in the 35-44 years age group - the number of patients in this category shot up from 4,419 to 9,362 during the two five-year periods, a startling 100% increase.Similarly, alcohol-related neurological patients shot up from 1,276 to 12,663 between 2014-19 and 2019-24, with the younger segment (35-44 years age group) being the worst hit - the number of patients in this segment rose from 260 to 2,882, a 1000% increase.Following the same pattern, alcohol-related kidney patients rose from 49,060 to 90,385, an 84% increase.While the jump in the number of patients associated with alcohol consumption would have been just a health problem, the backdrop of the alleged ""liquor scam"" during the Jaganmohan Reddy govt has added a political dimension to the medical woes of locals. The spike overlapped the change of govt in AP, and now, the comparative study of health department under the TDP govt indicts the previous YSRCP dispensation.Speaking with TOI, Krishna Babu, special chief secretary (health and family welfare) said making sense of the results of the study was tricky as medical problems because of alcohol use have shot up massively without the matching spike in alcohol consumption year-on-year.He said, ""We have to check the reason why it has happened. The reasons can be excess consumption, nature of alcohol used and the process of distillation.""The finger, thus, may point to the quality of liquor available in the state during the same period - a point that may be politically fraught given the backdrop of the ""liquor scam"", whereby the allegation is that national brands disappeared from liquor stores in AP and were replaced by unknown and lesser-known labels. YSRCP has denied the allegations of a scam, calling it a narrative peddled by the governing TDP to castigate the opposition party and besmirch its tenure.","Alcohol-associated liver patients went up from 14,026 in 2014-19 to 29,369 in 2019-24.

As she lists one mansion, Taylor Swift transforms another possibly for life with Travis Kelce

After taking some well-earned time off, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are slowly easing back into their busy schedules. Following the Kansas City Chiefs ’ Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in February and the conclusion of Taylor’s monumental “The Eras Tour,” the couple took a step back from the spotlight to relax and reconnect in private.As Taylor Swift renovates her Rhode Island mansion into a potential family home, Kelce is back to training for what could be his final NFL season while also upgrading his lifestyle to match their evolving relationship.Taylor Swift is already focused on her next musical chapter, with a new album in development and plans reportedly underway for a 2026 tour, according to sources. Meanwhile, she’s also making moves in real estate, listing her former Cape Cod mansion owned briefly between 2012 and 2013 for sale.The most notable step is Taylor Swift’s decision to renovate her $17.75 million mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. This historic 12,000-square-foot estate, perched on a scenic coastal cliff, is undergoing a $1.7 million transformation to become a primary residence. The upgrades include expanding the bedroom suite and lounge by 400 square feet, redesigning the kitchen, and adding a new bedroom.The living room is also being remodeled, and the front portico will be reconstructed. Permits were quietly filed in late 2024, with construction expected to finish by the end of 2025. Sources suggest Taylor Swift envisions this property as a future family retreat with Kelce.Now, as the off-season winds down, Travis Kelce is back at the Chiefs’ training facility, gearing up for what many believe could be his final NFL season. With a decorated career behind him, this upcoming chapter is set to be both meaningful and emotional.Alongside his return to football, Travis Kelce is also continuing his popular podcast, New Heights, which he co-hosts with his older brother and former Philadelphia Eagle, Jason Kelce. The podcast has become a fan favorite, offering a candid and often humorous glimpse into their lives both on and off the field.Parallel to Swift’s efforts, Kelce is also making big changes to accommodate their shared future. In response to safety concerns following a high-profile burglary at his Kansas City mansion where over $100,000 in valuables were stolen Kelce has significantly enhanced the security of his home. He installed a $40,000 alarm system, multiple CCTV cameras, motion detectors, and floodlights.Additionally, Kelce built a fortified safe room and an underground man cave. Two guard dogs, costing $9,000, and 24/7 private security at $6,000 per month have also been added. These improvements are largely aimed at ensuring Swift feels safe during visits, especially given the intense public and media attention surrounding their relationship.Beyond these two main properties, Swift is reportedly eyeing new real estate in Nashville and Kansas City. Nashville, her long-time base, offers proximity to family and friends, while Kansas City would place her closer to Kelce during the NFL season. Sources indicate that the couple may even be considering purchasing a home together in Kansas City, a move that strongly suggests they are planning for a more settled, domestic life.Also Read: “External forces trying to unbalance them”: Living Nostradamus claims cosmic fate ties Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, warns of looming challenges ahead All these developments point to a serious turn in their relationship.

Explained: Why India abstained instead of voting no on IMF Pakistan loan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explained-why-india-abstained-instead-of-voting-no-on-imf-pakistan-loan/articleshow/121039577.cms,"India abstained from voting on IMF loan package for Pakistan

Decision-making at the IMF

The IMF executive board consists of 25 directors who represent member countries or groups of countries. It handles daily operational matters, including loan approvals.

Unlike in the United Nations , where each country has one vote, IMF voting power reflects the economic size of each member. For instance, countries like the United States hold a disproportionately high voting share. Thus to simplify things, the IMF typically makes decisions by consensus.

, where each country has one vote, IMF voting power reflects the economic size of each member. For instance, countries like the United States hold a disproportionately high voting share. Thus to simplify things, the IMF typically makes decisions by consensus. In cases where a vote is required, the system does not allow a formal ""no"" vote. Directors can either vote in favor or abstain. There is no provision to vote against a loan or proposal.

Why India abstained?

India questioned the effectiveness of ongoing IMF assistance, noting that Pakistan has received support in 28 of the past 35 years including four programs in just the last five without meaningful or lasting reform.

India strongly highlighted the Pakistani military’s continued dominance in economic affairs, which undermines transparency, civilian oversight, and sustainable reform.

India firmly opposed providing funds to a country that continues to sponsor cross-border terrorism, warning that such support carries reputational risks for global institutions and undermines international norms.

NEW DELHI: India raised concerns during Friday's International Monetary Fund's Executive Board meeting regarding IMF's financial assistance to Pakistan While abstaining from voting, India said, ""Pakistan has been a prolonged borrower from the IMF, with a very poor track record of implementation and of adherence to the IMF's program conditions. ""India further highlighted that the recurring financial support has led Pakistan to amass significant debt obligations, effectively making it a 'too big to fail debtor' for the IMF.Read more: India targets Pakistan on IMF bailout package; abstains from voting over misuse of funds for terrorism Here's why India abstained to vote on Pakistan loan package according to government sources:India abstained from the recent IMF vote on approving a loan to Pakistan not due to a lack of opposition, but because IMF rules do not permit a formal “no” vote.By abstaining, India conveyed its strong dissent within the constraints of the IMF’s voting system and used the opportunity to formally record its objections. India’s key objections included:","The IMF executive board consists of 25 directors who represent member countries or groups of countries. Unlike in the United Nations, where each country has one vote, IMF voting power reflects the economic size of each member. There is no provision to vote against a loan or proposal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121040489,imgsize-1186275,width-400,resizemode-4/121040489.jpg"

Shilo Sanders' net worth in 2025: From bankruptcy to NFL success with the Buccaneers

The bankruptcy filing: Legal woes impacting his net worth



Endorsement deals: NIL success before the NFL



Asset management and legal scrutiny: A closer look



Shilo Sanders, son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, has always been in the spotlight, and in 2025, he's making headlines again. After going undrafted in the 2025 NFL Draft, he managed to secure a three-year, $2.965 million contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . But Shilo's financial journey isn't a simple success story, it’s layered with legal battles, financial hurdles, and a major comeback that’s still unfolding.Here’s a detailed look at his financial journey, net worth, and future outlook.Shilo Sanders' signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is a big deal, not just for his football career but also for his finances. As an undrafted free agent, he secured a three-year, $2.965 million contract. While this deal doesn’t make him an instant millionaire, it opens doors to long-term success, if he can make the roster. His contract breaks down to an average annual salary of about $988,333, which is a solid start for an undrafted player.However, the real financial opportunity comes in securing a spot on the team’s 53-man roster, which could unlock performance bonuses, incentives, and sponsorships, allowing Shilo to significantly boost his net worth in the coming years.Despite the recent NFL signing, Shilo Sanders has faced significant financial challenges. In October 2023, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, citing liabilities totaling a staggering $11.3 million. The debt primarily stems from a legal judgment against him, following a 2015 incident when he allegedly assaulted a security guard. The court ruled that Sanders owed $11.89 million in damages.At the time of the filing, Sanders listed his assets as being worth around $320,000. These assets included personal property and a 2023 Mercedes-Benz, which reportedly faced repossession efforts due to missed payments. Sanders' bankruptcy case has complicated his financial standing, and the resolution of his legal and debt issues will play a significant role in shaping his net worth moving forward.While Sanders’ financial situation has been strained by his bankruptcy, he also capitalized on Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals during his time at the University of Colorado. Before making the leap to the NFL, Shilo secured several lucrative endorsement deals. Brands like Porsche of Jackson, Actively Black, Google, Tint My Ride, EA Sports, and Starz signed him to promote their products and services.His NIL valuation was estimated to be around $539,000, and he ranked among the top 100 college athletes in terms of NIL earnings. These deals not only contributed to his earnings but also boosted his public profile, paving the way for his NFL contract.Shilo’s financial journey is not without controversy. During his bankruptcy proceedings, several financial discrepancies came to light. For example, Sanders had failed to disclose certain NIL deals and other income streams. Additionally, he owned companies like Big 21 LLC and SS21 LLC, which were purportedly used to manage his endorsement income.While Shilo Sanders is undoubtedly facing financial challenges, his NFL contract gives him a chance to turn things around. His three-year, $2.965 million deal with the Buccaneers provides a substantial base salary, but his real financial growth depends on his performance on the field and his ability to make the final roster.Also read - “I ain’t got no code yet”: Shilo Sanders cracks jokes on Day 1 with Bucs after surprise $2.9M NFL deal","Shilo Sanders, son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, signed a three-year, $2.965 million contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Bill Gates plans to spend his entire fortune over the next 20 years



Microsoft founder and billionaire Bill Gates recently accused Tesla CEO Elon Musk of ‘killing world’s poorest children’. In an interview to Financial Times, Microsoft founder critised Elon Musk for killing the poor children by sharing down the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ). Gates also highlighted that Elon Musk’s decision to cut down foreign aid funding could lead to increase in the cases of measles, HIV, and polio and more.“The picture of the world’s richest man killing the world’s poorest children is not a pretty one,” Gates told the Financial Times.In February 2025, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) effectively shut down USAID, calling it “a criminal organisation” and stating it was “time for it to die”. Gates argued that the abrupt cuts have left life-saving food and medicines expiring in warehouses, depriving vulnerable communities of essential aid.In the interview, Bill Gates also alleged that Elon Musk has cancelled grants to hospital in Gaza Province Mozambique, which prevented transmission of HIV. “I’d love for him to go in and meet the children that have now been infected with HIV because he cut that money,” said Gates.Bill Gates also announced his plans to spend nearly all his money in the next 20 years as the Gates Foundation will close in 2045. Gates mentioned that the foundation will allocate $200 billion towards global health, development and education. “We’ll have a lot more money because we’re spending down over the 20 years, as opposed to making an effort to be a perpetual foundation,” said Gates.“The foundation will continue to spend the bulk of its budget, which will rise to about $10bn a year, on global health, with vaccines, maternal and child health continuing to be a focus. But Gates said that private philanthropy could not make up the shortfall from the cuts to USAID, whose budget was $44bn last year,” mentions the report.","Microsoft founder and billionaire Bill Gates recently accused Tesla CEO Elon Musk of ‘killing world’s poorest children’ In an interview to Financial Times, Microsoft founder critised Elon Musk for killing the poor children by sharing down the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ).

Apple plans to add AI Search in Safari browser; Senior VP Eddy Cue points to 3 Google rivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-plans-to-add-ai-search-in-safari-browser-senior-vp-eddy-cue-points-to-3-google-rivals/articleshow/120993178.cms,"Apple in discussions with OpenAI, Perplexity and others

Apple is planning to add AI-powered search options in the Safari browser . According to a Bloomberg report, Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue said during his testimony with the US Justice Department that the company is “actively looking at” reshaping Safari. During the testimony, he revealed that searches on Safari dipped for the first time last month.“That has never happened in 22 years,” he said, adding this is due to people using AI. Cue said he believes that AI tools like OpenAI , Perplexity AI and Anthropic’s Claude AI, will eventually replace search engines like Google Chrome, further adding that Apple will bring these options to Safari in the future.“We will add them to the list — they probably won’t be the default,” he said.Currently, Google is the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser for which the company pays around $20 billion a year to keep. Analysts estimate this accounts for about 36% of the search advertising revenue Google earns through Safari.Cue said that Apple is in discussions with AI search providers like OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic to add their AI tools as an option to Safari.“Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices,” he said. “I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.”Apple currently integrates OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its Siri digital assistant and plans to add Google’s AI tool Gemini later this year. Cue said the company also considered other AI options, including Anthropic, Perplexity, China-based DeepSeek, and Grok from Elon Musk’s xAI.He added that the deal with OpenAI gives Apple the flexibility to bring in other AI providers to its operating system, including Apple’s own AI models.Google-parent company Alphabet’s shares dipped about 8% on Wednesday (May 7), wiping out $160 billion from the company’s market capitalisation following Eddy Cue’s testimony.","Apple is planning to add AI-powered search options in the Safari browser.

Nvidia targets $50 billion in China's AI boom – why it can't afford to miss out

Impact of US export restrictions on Nvidia

Broader economic implications for the US

China’s rapid AI advancements and competitive threats

Financial performance and market outlook

The path forward: Balancing growth and national security

“The world is right now hungry, anxious to engage AI,”

“Let us get the American AI out in front of everybody right now.”

Nvidia , the world’s leading producer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and a dominant force in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, is facing a critical challenge as US-China trade tensions continue to escalate. CEO Jensen Huang recently emphasized the significance of the Chinese AI market , which he estimates could reach $50 billion in the next two to three years.Speaking at ServiceNow’s Knowledge 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Huang described the potential loss of access to this market as ahighlighting the broader economic impact on US jobs, revenue, and technological leadership. This concern comes amid tighter US export restrictions that have significantly affected Nvidia’s business prospects in China, one of its largest international markets.China has long been a vital market for Nvidia, not only as a major consumer of its advanced AI chips but also as a hub for cutting-edge AI research and development. Nvidia’s GPUs, known for their unmatched parallel processing capabilities, are essential for training and deploying sophisticated AI models, making them indispensable for industries ranging from autonomous vehicles to cloud computing.Huang noted in his interview that China’s AI market could grow to $50 billion within the next two to three years, presenting a massive revenue opportunity. Given that Nvidia’s GPUs have become the backbone of the global AI industry, securing a share of this rapidly expanding market is critical for the company’s long-term growth.However, Nvidia’s ability to access this lucrative market has been increasingly constrained by US export controls aimed at limiting China’s technological advancements. Last month, the Trump administration further tightened these restrictions, requiring special licenses for Nvidia to ship its H20 chips to China. These chips, part of the Hopper architecture, were specifically designed to comply with earlier export regulations but are now caught in the latest wave of trade restrictions.As a result, Nvidia announced a staggering $5.5 billion quarterly charge, reflecting the financial blow of losing a critical revenue stream. This move marks one of the most significant financial impacts on the company since it became a trillion-dollar tech giant, raising concerns about the sustainability of its rapid growth.Huang highlighted the broader economic consequences of these export restrictions, emphasizing the potential loss of US jobs and tax revenue. During the interview, he argued that maintaining access to the Chinese market is not just about Nvidia’s bottom line but also about the long-term competitiveness of the US tech sector.“We just have to stay agile,” Huang said, stressing the importance of balancing national security concerns with the need for economic growth and technological leadership. He added that the ongoing restrictions could force Chinese companies to develop domestic alternatives, potentially reducing US influence in the global AI industry over the long term.Huang’s comments come amid growing concerns about China’s rapid progress in AI technology. At a separate tech conference in Washington, D.C., in April, Huang warned that China is “not behind” in AI and described Huawei as “one of the most formidable technology companies in the world.”This assessment aligns with recent reports indicating that Chinese firms like Huawei and DeepSeek have made significant strides in developing their own AI chips, potentially challenging Nvidia’s dominance in this critical sector. Huang’s remarks underscore the competitive pressure Nvidia faces as it navigates a complex geopolitical landscape.Despite these challenges, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the global AI market. The company’s market capitalization has approached $3 trillion, making it one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. However, its stock has experienced significant volatility in recent months, with shares down about 15% so far this year after nearly tripling in 2023.Nvidia is set to report its next quarterly earnings on May 28, with analysts expecting a 65% year-over-year revenue increase to $43.1 billion, according to data from LSEG. This projected growth reflects the ongoing demand for AI hardware, even as the company grapples with geopolitical uncertainties and supply chain challenges.Huang’s recent comments highlight the delicate balance Nvidia must strike as it seeks to maintain its leadership in the AI industry while navigating complex geopolitical challenges. As US policymakers weigh the risks and benefits of restricting high-tech exports to China, companies like Nvidia face tough decisions about how to adapt to an increasingly fragmented global market.Huang said during his Las Vegas appearance.With AI becoming a critical driver of economic growth and technological innovation, the stakes for Nvidia and the broader US tech sector have never been higher.","N Nvidia is the world’s leading producer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and a dominant force in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.

Mumbai: From Friday, commuters will have to pay double, or even treble, for BEST bus rides. The minimum bus fare will increase to Rs 10 from Rs 5 for non-AC buses, and to Rs 12 from Rs 6 for AC buses for 5km distance. Significantly, the hike for 50km travel will be as high as 200% for non-AC buses and 160% for AC buses.The last fare revision was in June 2019, when minimum fares dropped to Rs 5 from Rs 8 for non-AC bus travel.""Among the new introductions are more fare stages beyond 20km and up to 50km. The BEST has also reintroduced the concessional 50% fare (half ticket) for children aged between five and 12,"" said BEST spokesperson Sudas Sawant.While daily bus pass fare has increased to Rs 75 from Rs 60, the monthly unlimited bus pass has doubled to Rs 1,800 from Rs 900. With this pass, one can travel on all BEST routes, including those in the extended suburbs of Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Passengers travelling in buses crossing BMC limits will be charged an additional Rs 2 as there are extra taxes being paid for neighbouring cities, an official said.Most daily commuters said that they are not against the fare increase, but pointed out that such hikes and service improvement must go hand in hand.""The number of services has dropped sharply with the fleet dropping to nearly 2,800 buses. There are long waits at bus stops. Overcrowding and poor commuting experience have to be improved,"" they demanded.BEST general manager SVR Srinivas told TOI that the fare hike will bring in Rs 590-crore revenue to the cash-strapped undertaking. ""My priority is to increase the number of buses. We have already begun the process of rationalising routes, and have teamed up with Google to provide predictable journeys with Expected Time of Arrival and trip planning using technology.""He further said that BEST is also rationalising the workforce. ""We will address the issue of conductor shortage by mobilising staff from our internal resources/other departments,"" he added.In the new fare chart, baggage will be charged at the equivalent of an adult fare, subject to a maximum of Rs 30 for non-AC and Rs 35 for AC buses. All fares include a nutrition surcharge of 15 paise. For AC bus services, the fare also includes a 5% GST surcharge in addition to the base fare.","The minimum bus fare will increase to Rs 10 from Rs 5 for non-AC buses, and to Rs 12 from Rs 6 for AC buses for 5km distance.

X has received executive orders from the Indian government requiring X to block over 8,000 accounts in India, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment of the company’s local employees. The orders include demands to block access in India to accounts belonging to international news organizations and prominent X users.

Poll Do you think blocking accounts is an effective way to enforce local laws? No, it stifles communication Yes, it can deter illegal activity

In most cases, the Indian government has not specified which posts from an account have violated India's local laws. For a significant number of accounts, we did not receive any evidence or justification to block the accounts.

To comply with the orders, we will withhold the specified accounts in India alone. We have begun that process. However, we disagree with the Indian government’s demands. Blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship of existing and future content, and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech.

This is not an easy decision, however keeping the platform accessible in India is vital to Indians’ ability to access information.

We believe that making these executive orders public is essential for transparency – lack of disclosure discourages accountability and can contribute to arbitrary decision making. However, due to legal restrictions, we are unable to publish the executive orders at this time.

X is exploring all possible legal avenues available to the company. Unlike users located in India, X is restricted by Indian law in its ability to bring legal challenges against these executive orders. However, we encourage all users who are impacted by these blocking orders to seek appropriate relief from the courts.

According to internal documents obtained by Business Insider, the tech giant is also tracking "" good attrition "" – a metric that counts certain employee departures as positive outcomes for the company.This policy overhaul comes as Microsoft recently fired approximately 2,000 employees deemed underperformers without severance, part of a broader effort to shed low performers faster and prevent their return to the company.The company's new performance improvement process offers struggling employees two choices: accept a performance improvement plan (PIP) with ""clear expectations and a timeline for improvement"" or voluntarily leave with a separation package equivalent to 16 weeks of pay, Business Insider reports.""Employees with zero and 60% Rewards outcomes and/or on an active PIP will not be eligible for internal transfers,"" stated an internal email to managers from new Chief People Officer Amy Coleman . The email further specified that ""former employees who left with zero or 60% Rewards or during/after a PIP will not be eligible for rehire until two years after their termination date.""Microsoft's adoption of these policies mirrors similar approaches at other tech giants. The ""good attrition"" metric resembles Amazon's controversial ""unregretted attrition"" system, which sets goals for the percentage of employees organisations should lose annually.Meta maintains comparable internal block lists that prevent certain former employees from being rehired, using designations like ""non-regrettable attrition"" and ""do not rehire"" flags.Industry analysts see these changes as part of a broader shift across tech companies toward more rigorous performance expectations and reduced employee perks. The era of employee coddling appears to be ending as performance-based job cuts have become increasingly common.Microsoft's new policies indicate a significant departure from the company's previous ""growth mindset"" culture established under CEO Satya Nadella , which had moved away from the controversial stack-ranking system used prior to 2014. The company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the new policy changes.","Microsoft is implementing a controversial two-year rehire ban for employees terminated due to performance issues.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"

The Trump administration is considering cutting the steep 145% tariff on Chinese imports by more than half, possibly as early as next week, as US and Chinese officials gear up for high-level trade talks in Switzerland,reported, citing sources close to the negotiations.US officials are reportedly weighing a reduction of the levy to somewhere between 50% and 54%, a move aimed at easing tensions as trade negotiations unfold. The proposed cut, according to, would be accompanied by a separate plan to lower tariffs on imports from neighbouring South Asian countries to 25%.“They are going to be bringing it down to 50% while the negotiations are ongoing,” a source was quoted as saying byUS President Trump hinted at the potential tariff shift during a meeting with UK officials in the Oval Office, stating, “It’s at 145 so we know it’s coming down,” while expressing optimism over US-China ties. “I think we’re going to have a very good relationship,” he added. Retail industry leaders , including Walmart’s Doug McMillon, Target’s Brian Cornell, and Home Depot’s Ted Decker, reportedly urged Trump to consider easing the tariff burden during an April 21 meeting at the White House.Though the executives described the session as “productive” and “constructive,” no specific outcomes were disclosed.Retailers have since started preparing for a range of tariff outcomes. Jay Foreman, CEO of toy company Basic Fun, was quoted bythat many are now asking vendors to quote prices based on tariffs between 10% and 54% to ensure flexibility.He added that a 54% levy would still push prices up significantly, such as a Tonka truck jumping from $29.99 to $49.99 but that’s “workable.” A 145% tariff, however, would push the price to nearly $80, which he warned would “bring sales to a virtual standstill.”Nick Mowbray, CEO of toy brand Zuru, said “the speculation is 54%,” but noted that it has “definitely not been told explicitly to retail yet.”Meanwhile, White House dismissed the tariff rollback talk as speculation, reported the news agency. “When decisions on tariffs are made, they will come directly from the President. Anything else is just pure speculation,” said a White House spokesperson.Still, retail executives say treasury secretary Scott Bessent’s recent remarks at the Milken Institute Global Conference, that the current rate “isn’t sustainable”, gave them confidence that a shift is imminent.Lawrence Rosen, chairman of Cra-Z-Art, confirmed tothat retailers are hearing similar figures, “We are hearing China at 50% to 54% and other Asian countries at 25%.”Foreman revealed that Basic Fun has seven containers en route to the US under the 145% rate and plans to store them to avoid the costly levy. The rest remain in warehouses, awaiting green light.Noel Hacegaba, COO at the Port of Long Beach, said hopes are high the Switzerland talks will help “de-escalate growing trade tensions,” but stressed that shippers need “a strong signal” before adjusting supply routes.Retail expert Gerald Storch, former CEO of Toys R Us, toldthat since the White House meeting, retailers seem “less panicked” and have slightly “relaxed” their urgency for domestic sourcing.While the situation remains fluid, the toy industry, with 80% of US toy sales coming from China and broader retail sector are closely watching for any official word from Trump in the coming days.","The Trump administration is considering cutting the steep 145% tariff on Chinese imports by more than half, possibly as early as next week.

Walking into the crowded hotel conference room, Andrew Batey looked like any other tech guy attending ETHDenver, an annual cryptocurrency conference. A venture capital investor based in Florida, Batey, however, was at the conference not to network but to fight one of them - live on YouTube. At the hotel, a short drive from the conference convention center, under the watchful eye of a representative from the Colorado Combative Sports Commission, Batey, 40, stripped down to his boxers.He weighed in at just under 195 pounds, on target for the fight. The bare-chested venture capitalist raised his biceps and flexed for cameras.America's tech elite, not content with unfathomable wealth and rising political influence in Washington, have recently developed a new obsession - fighting. Across the United States, men like Batey are learning to punch, kick, knee, elbow and, in some cases, hammer an opponent over the head with their fists. The figurehead of the movement is Mark Zuckerberg, the billionaire CEO of Meta , who has charted his impressive physical transformation from skinny computer nerd to martial arts fighter on Instagram, one of the apps he owns.The tech industry's newfound devotion to martial arts is one facet of a broader cultural shift that has upended US politics. Many of these tech founders-turned-fighters are chasing a testosterone-heavy ideal of masculinity that is ascendant on social media and embraced by President Donald Trump. An enthusiastic practitioner of Brazilian jujitsu, Zuckerberg, 40, lamented this year that corporate culture was getting ""neutered"" and was devoid of ""masculine energy."" In 2023, Zuckerberg's fellow billionaire Elon Musk, a longtime corporate rival, challenged him to a televised cage match. But that fight never took place.Most of the tech world's aspiring fighters have a crucial thing in common: Before they started pursuing their extravagant new hobby, they made a lot of money.In 2018, Batey founded Beatdapp, a company that develops software to eliminate fraud in music streaming. He also runs a venture capital firm, Side Door Ventures, that invests in crypto startups.Two years ago, Batey's venture fund invested $500,000 in Karate Combat , a would-be competitor to the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The league operates as a hybrid between an athletic competition and a tech startup. Rather than offering traditional shares, Karate Combat gave Batey's firm Karate tokens - a cryptocurrency that fans can wager on Karate Combat fights, which stream on YouTube as well as TV channels like ESPN Deportes. Karate Combat's primary business is professional fighting - mixed martial arts contests featuring seasoned athletes, some of whom also fight in UFC. (A representative for Karate Combat declined to reveal how much money the league generates.)Last year, the company created a new competition for amateurs and started offering it as the undercard at pro events, which are sometimes held at crypto conferences. The competition was called Influencer Fight Club , and its premise was simple: Put a couple of tech guys in the ring and see what happens.Over the past 18 months, the competition has featured some big names in the crypto world, including Nic Carter, a venture investor known for his combative posts on the social site X. At a crypto conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last summer, Carter, boasting an impressive physique, knocked out a tattooed crypto marketer in one round. On social media, he was hailed as ""kingly"" and adopted the nickname ""Tungsten Daddy.

Trump: Maybe the Children Will Have Two Dolls Instead of 30 Dolls | WSJ News





US president Donald Trump has threatened a steep 100% tariff on Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls, after the company said it would continue producing toys overseas despite plans to reduce reliance on Chinese imports.Speaking from the Oval Office last week Trump responded sharply to Mattel’s recent decision to maintain offshore production. “I've heard Mattel said, 'Well, we're going to go counter, we're going to try going someplace else. Let him go,” he said of Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz. “We’ll put a 100% tariff on his toys, and he won’t sell one toy in the United States, and that's their biggest market.”Mattel recently announced a “pricing action” in its US business, blaming changes in global trade policy and tariffs.During its first-quarter earnings call, Kreiz explained that the firm was moving away from China as a manufacturing hub, but not bringing operations back to the US. He cited cost-efficiency and productivity in other countries as reasons for keeping production abroad.Toymakers are increasingly worried about the effects of Trump’s trade policy. With roughly 80% of global toy production based in China, industry leaders have urged the administration to exempt toys from tariffs.The Toy Association warned of serious disruptions and higher prices.Trump, however, brushed off those concerns, saying that girls don’t need many dolls. During an interview he said, ""I don't think that a beautiful baby girl needs—that's 11 years old—needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable. We had a trade deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars with China.""Reacting to the price hikes and similar moves by carmaker Ford, Trump said, “I think they’re just saying that to negotiate deals with me.”","Mattel recently announced a ‘pricing action’ in its US business, blaming changes in global trade policy and tariffs.

Poll Should the Bank of England adopt a more proactive approach to monetary policy? Yes, absolutely No, they should be cautious





LONDON: The Bank of England is widely expected to look past near-term inflationary pressures in the British economy and opt to cut interest rates on Thursday as a result of the potential shock to growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.Most economists believe it's a near-certainty that the nine-member monetary policy committee will sanction a quarter-point reduction in the bank's main interest rate, to 4.25%. The decision is to be announced at 12:02 p.m., two minutes later than usual as a result of the two-minute silence for Victory in Europe Day. There's some speculation that some members may opt for an even bigger half-point cut.Economists are going to be particularly interested in the bank's accompanying economic forecasts as they will be the first since US President Donald Trump made his tariff announcement in early April.Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to UK goods entering the United States, the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain.""With US trade policy presenting a new demand shock, there have been early signs that the MPC is willing to adopt a more proactive approach to loosening policy,"" said Edward Allenby, UK economist at Oxford Economics.The forecasts, particularly those regarding growth and inflation, will provide a steer as to whether a more proactive approach is likely. Since it started cutting interest rates in August 2024 from the 16-year high of 5.25%, the MPC has been consistent in lowering borrowing costs every three months.The imposition of US tariffs on British goods, and the potential for a wider global trade war, has the potential to weigh on growth as well as oil prices, which would consequently depress price pressures by lowering demand.Though UK inflation stands at 2.6% and could well hit double the bank's target rate of 2% in coming months as a result of a raft of price increases in April, such as domestic energy and water bills, economists think rate-setters will opt for a cut, given the anticipated slowdown.Unlike the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, which last month cut interest rates too, the US Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday as its policymakers wait to see how Trump's tariffs affect the US economy before making any moves.Inflation rates around the world are way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from the near zero rates during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then began to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed energy costs higher.As inflation rates have declined from multidecade highs, central banks, including the Fed, have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic.","Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates on Thursday.

Pope Leo XIV calls AI a challange for humanity in first major address as head of Catholic Church,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/pope-leo-xiv-calls-ai-a-challange-for-humanity-in-first-major-address-as-head-of-catholic-church/articleshow/121061970.cms,"AP photo





Pope Leo XIV , in his first major address since becoming head of the Catholic Church, described artificial intelligence (AI) as one of the most pressing issues facing humanity. During his first formal audience with the cardinals, he stressed the Church’s responsibility to respond to modern challenges while staying rooted in its teachings.Speaking from the Vatican on Saturday, the new pope said AI raises new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour. He drew a historical parallel between today’s digital revolution and the industrial revolution of the 19th century.Referring to Pope Leo XIII—his namesake—Pope Leo XIV explained his choice of name. Leo XIII led the Church from 1878 to 1903 and is remembered for shaping modern Catholic social thought. His 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum addressed workers’ rights and offered a middle ground between unregulated capitalism and socialist policies.“In our own day, the Church offers everyone the treasury of its social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour,” Leo said.The new pope’s concern about AI reflects a position held by his predecessor, Pope Francis . In the final year of his papacy, Francis warned about the dehumanising effects of AI and pushed for an international treaty to regulate its use. He told world leaders that humans—not machines—must always retain control over decisions involving force or social consequences.Francis also used his 2024 peace message to caution against the unchecked development of AI, saying such technology must be grounded in compassion, mercy, morality and forgiveness.","Pope Leo XIV said AI raises new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour.

The recovery of a superyacht that sank a year ago off the Sicilian coast was temporarily halted Saturday following the death of a specialist diver while working underwater, a spokesman for the company overseeing the operation said.UK tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter, and five others died in August after a powerful storm slammed the Bayesian and water submerged the luxury vessel that had lain at 49 meters (160 feet) below the surface.""We are saddened to confirm the tragic death of a specialist diver while doing underwater work earlier today (Friday),"" said David Wilson, spokesman for the British-based TMC Marine, in an emailed statement.He also said authorities started an investigation and ""all parties are offering their full cooperation.""The Palermo Port Authority, in charge of the investigation, declined to comment on the cause of the diver's death when contacted by The Associated Press.The local prosecutor's office has also sealed off the area where the 39-year-old Dutch diver died, local media reported.Marine salvage experts began work in early May to refloat the ship from the seabed off the Sicilian port of Porticello, importing one of the most powerful maritime cranes in Europe from Rotterdam.The plan was to cut the yacht's 75-meter (246-foot) aluminum mast - the second tallest in the world - to allow the hull to be brought to the surface more easily. It was thought initially the operation would take from 20 to 25 days to salvage the yacht, but now it is unclear when the Bayesian's complex recovery could be resumed.Dutch-based companies HEBO, a maritime services company from Rotterdam, and SMIT Salvage lead the salvage operation on site with support from Italian specialists.The 56-meter (183-foot)-long, 473-ton yacht sank during what appears to have been a sudden downburst, or localized powerful wind from a thunderstorm that spreads rapidly after hitting the surface. Prosecutors are investigating the captain and two crew members for possible responsibility in the sinking.In addition to Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah, Morgan Stanley International Chairman Jonathan Bloomer and his wife, Judy, attorney Chris Morvillo and his wife, Neda, and the ship's cook, Recaldo Thomas, died in the shipwreck.","UK tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter, and five others died in August after a powerful storm slammed the Bayesian and water submerged the luxury vessel.

Rome, May 10, 2025 -Along with the spiritual leadership of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, Pope Leo XIV now inherits oversight of the Vatican's shoddy finances -- and his predecessor's efforts to clean them up.The dire state of the Holy See accounts was among the topics cardinals tasked with choosing a successor to Pope Francis discussed ahead of the conclave, according to the Vatican.Their pick, American Robert Francis Prevost -- now Leo XIV -- is likely to continue Francis's push to bring some order, said the chairman of the Vatican's bank, known as the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR).""Francis has started the process, I'm sure Leo XIV will continue,"" Jean-Baptiste de Franssu, a French businessman who was appointed to the role by Francis in 2014 as part of a radical overhaul of the Holy See's economic framework, told AFP.The Vatican fills its coffers by running hospitals, museums, and owning a vast real estate portfolio, together with donations from the faithful.Yet, its finances regularly run in the red.In 2023, it reported a consolidated loss of almost 70 million euros ($79 million) on revenue of 1.2 billion euros.The Catholic Church's economic affairs have long been murky and scandal-prone.In a telling example, in 1982 the Banco Ambrosiano -- a bank majority-owned by the IOR -- collapsed amid accusations of money-laundering mafia money.Its director, Roberto Calvi, was found hanging that same year from London's Blackfriars Bridge.When Francis became pope in 2013, things were not much improved.Italy's central bank had recently suspended all bank card payments in the Vatican over its failure to implement anti-money laundering laws, and a year earlier the US had added the tiny city-state to its list of countries of concern for money-laundering.In 2014 Francis created a special secretariat for the economy, clamping down on corruption and stepping up scrutiny of investments.""There was no strong governance, the rules were not respected, we did not have the right competence,"" de Franssu recalled of his early days at IOR.Francis once likened the effort fix and bring transparency to the books to ""cleaning the Sphinx of Egypt with a toothbrush"", but the efforts produced some results, including the closure of nearly 5,000 suspect bank accounts.The Vatican's reputation improved: it joined the Single Euro Payments Area and was later commended by the Council of Europe for its fight against money laundering.""We have been more resistant than those that wanted to resist,"" said de Franssu.Yet problems persist.Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu , a former advisor to Francis who once one of the most powerful figures in the Vatican, was sentenced to five years and six months in jail for embezzlement in 2023.He was one of 10 defendants in a trial that began in 2021 focused on a disastrous investment by the Vatican in a luxury building in London.The accused included financiers, lawyers and ex-Vatican employees accused of a range of financial crimes in what prosecutors called a ""rotten predatory and lucrative system"".The trial involved the risky purchase of a building in London's upmarket Chelsea neighbourhood, that resulted in major losses for the Vatican.The scandal was particularly embarrassing because Church funds used for such ventures also came from the Peter's Pence, money donated by the faithful for the pope's charities.Becciu -- who was earlier removed from office and stripped of his cardinal ""rights and privileges"" and thus did not take part in the conclave that elected Leo XIV -- lodged an appeal.Among the ongoing financial challenges facing Leo are a decline in donations from the faithful, rising staff costs and a fragile retirement system.Francis said last year the latter currently ""cannot guarantee in the medium term the fulfilment of the pension obligation for future generations"".","Pope Leo XIV inherits oversight of the Vatican's shoddy finances.

China's consumption slide deepens as tariff war bites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-consumption-slide-deepens-as-tariff-war-bites/articleshow/121047576.cms,"China's consumer prices continued to fall in April, marking the third consecutive month of decline(AP)





BEIJING: China said Saturday that consumer prices slumped in April for the third straight month, reflecting persistent challenges as leaders attempt to revive an economy stymied by sluggish spending and a fierce trade war with Washington.The world's second-largest economy has grappled with persistent deflationary pressure in recent years, with longstanding woes in the property sector and export headwinds impeding growth.The latest figures come ahead of Saturday's start to a meeting of key economic officials from China and the United States in Switzerland, offering a potential offramp for the high-stakes trade war launched by President Donald Trump.US tariffs on imports from the manufacturing powerhouse now stand at a staggering 145 percent for many products, and reach as high as 245 percent cumulatively on others.Trump suggested Friday that the tariffs could be cut to 80 percent, though Beijing has demanded a complete cancellation of the levies that are compounding other challenges facing the Chinese economy.The consumer price index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, was down 0.1 percent last month year-on-year, according to data released Saturday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), following previous drops in February and March.The reading was in line with a Bloomberg forecast of a 0.1 percent year-on-year decline based on a survey of economists, and consistent with the slight drop recorded in March.NBS statistician Dong Lijuan said Saturday in a statement about the data that ""international imported factors have a certain downward impact on prices in some industries"".The NBS also announced Saturday that April's producer price index (PPI) declined 2.7 percent year-on-year, accelerating from the 2.5 percent drop recorded in March.China's PPI, another indicator of inflation, has in recent months remained mired in negative territory, and the drop recorded Saturday was in line with expectations.""Changes in the international trade environment and a rapid decline in some international bulk commodities have affected the decline in prices in related domestic industries,"" Dong said.China's exports rose last month despite the trade war, official data showed Friday, an unexpected development attributed by experts to a re-routing of trade to Southeast Asia to mitigate US tariffs.The trade figures from the Chinese customs bureau showed that while exports to the United States dropped sharply in April, those to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam surged by double digits.Chinese policymakers this week eased key monetary policy tools in a bid to ramp up domestic activity.Those included cuts to a key interest rate and moves to lower the amount banks must hold in reserve in a bid to boost lending, adding to Beijing's sweeping push to revitalise the economy since September.","China's consumer prices continued to fall in April, marking the third consecutive month of decline.
