"Rs 2,000 crore prime city land cleared of encroachers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-2000-crore-prime-city-land-clear-ed-of-encroachers/articleshow/111723793.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major eviction drive against encroachment of public land, the Land and Development Office (L&DO) under the Union housing and urban affairs ministry cleared almost 15 acres of prime land in Khyber Pass in Civil Lines area on Saturday.Sources said the current market value of the large patch of around 32 acres, including the cleared portion, in the area is estimated at over Rs 2,000 crore.The Nazul land (govt land) is owned by the L&DO and it was given to the defence ministry in 1935. There were hutments, known as Khyber Pass Hostel, for accommodation of the support staff of defence personnel. The cleared portion is worth around Rs 1,000 crore.Officials said though the eviction was to begin from March 4, it was stopped at the direction of Delhi High Court . After the matter was examined at length by HC and a judgment was passed on July 9 upholding the eviction order, the L&DO carried out the eviction on Saturday.They added that such valuable land cannot be allowed to be occupied by few individuals for the benefit of few at loss to the govt. The eviction was carried out with support of Delhi Police, Delhi administration, Municipal Corporation of Delhi and Central Public Works Department , sources said.Some of the occupants had earlier taken the matter to the Delhi High Court seeking relief after the L&DO had issued a public notice to the occupants on March 1, 2024 to vacate. The occupants had claimed that the hostels were allotted to their fathers and grand-fathers about 70 years back and hence they were entitled to resettlement.Challenging the eviction notice, petitioners had pleaded before the HC that they could not be evicted by following the due process of law as they were inducted by the ""Officers of the Armed Forces"" to cater to their needs and they were paying rents.The high court, in its order, took note that the petitioners did not show any document as to who inducted them and said since this issue requires leading of evidence, the petitioners needed to file suit and lead evidence to show that they were inducted lawfully by persons who were competent to do so.Relying on the affidavit of the petitioners, which mentioned that no rent has been paid by them after 2001 and, the HC observed that the ""petitioners cannot be called as legal occupants of the land in question and are rank trespassers"". It also rejected the argument that the petitioners were inducted lawfully and that they are authorised occupants.Dismissing the petition, the court said it ""does not find any reason"" to quash the notice dated March 1, 2024.","Land and Development Office (L&DO) cleared almost 15 acres of prime land in Khyber Pass in Civil Lines area on Saturday.

Case against officer's mother

(With reports from agencies)

NEW DELHI: In more trouble for IAS probationary officer Puja Khedkar , Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials have issued a notice of illegal encroachment at her residence. According to the PMC's Encroachment Department, Khedkar's residence had unauthorised construction or obstructions on public roads or footpaths under the corporation's jurisdiction.While the details of Khedkar's specific case are not publicly known, the PMC's encroachment removal process typically involves issuing notices, conducting surveys, and ultimately demolishing or clearing the illegal structures if the owner fails to comply.Khedkar has found herself in the middle of a massive controversy over alleged misuse of power and privileges.Officials said all documents presented by her to secure her candidature in the civil services examination and then for selection in the service will be re-examined by a single-member committee constituted by the Centre on Thursday.She may be terminated from service if found guilty, said officials.""The officer may be terminated from the service if found guilty. She may face criminal charges also in case she is found to have misrepresented a fact or done any sort of manipulation in documents relied upon for her selection,"" said PTI citing officials sources.Khedkar, a 2023-batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, is under probation and currently posted in her home cadre Maharashtra.The 34-year-old officer is in the eye of a storm over for allegedly misusing the disability and Other Backward Class (OBC) quota to secure a position in the IAS.The single-member probe committee of Manoj Kumar Dwivedi, additional secretary in the Department of Personnel and Training, has been asked to submit its report within two weeks.In the meantime, Khedkar on Thursday assumed her new role as assistant collector at the Washim District Collectorate in the Vidarbha region after being transferred from Pune where she allegedly bullied everyone around and also placed a red beacon atop a private Audi (a luxury sedan) car used by her that also had 'Maharashtra Government' written on it.Khedkar has been under intense scrutiny for allegedly manipulating benefits under the physical disabilities category and OBC quota to secure her position in the Indian Administrative Service.The controversial officer was shunted out to Washim after Pune district collector Suhas Diwase wrote to state additional chief secretary Nitin Gadre requesting him to consider giving a posting to Khedkar in another district to avoid ""administrative complications"".Diwase had sought action against Khedkar for her behaviour, including alleged aggressive treatment of junior staff, illegal occupation of the ante-chamber of additional collector Ajay More, and violations pertaining to sporting a red beacon on the Audi and flashing it during the day, among others.The Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO) has issued a notice to a private company there, which is the registered owner of the Audi car used by Khedkar.In a related development, Navi Mumbai police has reported to the Maharashtra government that Khedkar had allegedly tried to pressure a DCP-rank officer to release a man held in a theft case, an official said on Friday.The incident had occurred on May 18 at Panvel police station wherein Khedkar allegedly phoned Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Vivek Pansare and urged him to release a transporter, Ishwar Uttarwade, arrested in a theft case.Additionally, a video has emerged showing Khedkar's mother Manorama brandishing a gun and threatening a farmer in a land dispute case.

Satellite images reveal archaeological wealth beneath Bodh Gaya’s sacred site,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/satellite-images-reveal-archaeological-wealth-beneath-bodh-gayas-sacred-site/articleshow/111712577.cms,"NEW DELHI: A recent geospatial study conducted by the Bihar Heritage Development Society (BHDS) and Cardiff University has uncovered evidence suggesting the presence of significant archaeological wealth buried beneath the Mahabodhi temple complex and its surrounding areas in Bodh Gaya , Bihar.According to Harjot Kaur Bamhrah, additional chief secretary of the art, culture and youth department, ""The study has unearthed evidence of the presence of archaeological treasure beneath the soil of the UNESCO World Heritage site and its surrounding areas…It's a huge architectural wealth that needs further excavation.""The project, titled 'Archaeology on the footsteps of the Chinese traveller Xuanzang ', involves collaboration between the UK-based university and the BHDS.M B Rajni, a faculty member from the Bengaluru-based National Institute of Advanced Studies and a project member, analysed satellite images of the Mahabodhi temple and its surroundings, attempting to correlate the findings with the descriptions provided by Xuanzang, a 7th-century Chinese translator monk.The satellite images from recent years reveal an alignment of structures buried underground to the north of the temple. Notably, the images also show a shift in the course of the river Niranjana from east to west.The latest findings suggest that the Mahabodhi temple, the Sujata Stupa, and other archaeological remains were once situated on the same river bank, indicating a strong possibility that the monuments and archaeological remains currently located east of the river were part of the Mahabodhi complex. The BHDS plans to initiate research to define the boundaries of the Mahabodhi complex based on these new insights.Bijoy Kumar Choudhary, executive director of BHDS, elaborated on the findings, saying, ""Our fresh study has revealed several findings that include to the north of the temple premises, a square monastery complex enclosed by a wall with a surrounding moat and an extended settlement to its north."" The square wall of the monastery complex, previously excavated by Alexander Cunningham in the 19th century, holds great potential for systematic excavation.Rajni's report further details the analysis of satellite imagery, identifying two concentric squares: an outer square enclosing 4.9 acres and an inner square enclosing 2.5 acres. The squares significantly overlap with the Samanvay Ashram, and the well observed by Cunningham at the centre of the monastery's pillared court might correspond to one of the two wells located within the Ashram.The southern boundary of the Ashram, marked by a compound wall on a raised ridge, aligns with the southern boundary of the outer square, suggesting the presence of buried remnants of an earlier wall.","Satellite images from recent years reveal an alignment of structures buried underground to the north of the temple.

NEW DELHI: Probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar , in the eye of a storm over the authenticity of her disability and OBC status claims that got her appointed to the civil services, could face termination of service and even criminal charges of forgery if the one-man panel set by the Centre to probe the matter finds any misrepresentation or suppression of facts on her part.Sources in the government said the panel of DoPT additional secretary Manoj Dwivedi will, over the next two weeks, probe how she obtained the documents establishing her disability and OBC status, and whether proper vetting was carried out by the issuing authority.Khedkar is said to have recurrently failed to appear for mandatory medical tests at AIIMS Delhi to confirm her disability, despite having qualified for IAS in the ‘Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD)’ category.“The panel will submit its findings to DoPT which will then forward the report with recommendations to the Maharashtra government, since she is allocated to the Maharashtra cadre. If found guilty of forging her OBC and disability papers, the state government could terminate her. Also, she may face criminal liability for forgery and misrepresentation,” a source said.The DoPT panel looking into Khedkar’s claims is likely to take the help of social justice ministry to verify her OBC status. Although she claims to be from the economically weaker category, the affidavit filed by her father, an ex-bureaucrat and a candidate in the recent Lok Sabha polls, declared his assets at over Rs 40 crore. Khedkar was shown as the owner of flats and plots worth crores.The panel will, in consultation with experts from AIIMS Delhi, also examine if the visual and mental disability claimed by her meets the benchmarks for employment in the government.A senior government functionary said this was not the first case of a civil services aspirant making incorrect disability claims for selection in the PwBD category. “There are instances almost every year when those selected on the basis of false disability claims have evaded the mandatory medical test at AIIMS Delhi and even escalated the matter to the Central Administrative Tribunal seeking testing elsewhere. Eventually, however, they could not secure an appointment after having failed the test,” the functionary told",Pooja Khedkar is in the eye of a storm over the authenticity of her disability and OBC status claims that got her appointed to the civil services.

Supreme Court Ruling: Citizenship Proof Cannot Be Demanded Without Evidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-pick-anybody-randomly-ask-for-citizenship-proof-supreme-court/articleshow/111670723.cms,"NEW DELHI: Noting that while Section 9 of the Foreigners Act outs the burden on an individual to prove he/she is not a foreigner, Supreme Court, in an important ruling, has held that this does not mean govt can pick a person at random, knock on their door, and demand they prove their citizenship. There must be some material against the person before proceedings under the law can be initiated, it stressed.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Ahsanuddin Amanullah held that ""in the absence of the basic/primary material, it cannot be left to the untrammelled or arbitrary discretion of the authorities to initiate proceedings"", which have life-altering and very serious consequences for the person.It said, Section 9 could not be invoked on the basis of hearsay or bald and vague allegation(s).""...the question is that does Section 9 of the Act empower the executive to pick a person at random, knock at his/her/their door, tell him/her/they/them 'We suspect you of being a foreigner'?... Obviously, the State cannot proceed in such a manner. Neither can we as a court countenance such an approach,"" the bench observed, while setting aside the order of the Foreigners Tribunal and Gauhati high court declaring a person from Assam an illegal Bangladeshi migrant.The bench accepted the submission of advocate Kaushik Choudhury who, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that Section 9 could not be used arbitrarily and settled principles of natural justice could not be given a go-by.""It needs no reiteration that a person charged or accused would generally not be able to prove to the negative, if he/she is not aware of the evidence/material against him/her which leads to the person being labelled suspect. Ipso facto just an allegation/accusation cannot lead to shifting of the burden to the accused, unless he/she is confronted with the allegation as also the material backing such allegation,"" the court said.The court said that there was no material in possession of authority which could raise suspicion on his nationality. After fighting a legal battle for two decades, SC came to his rescue and declared him Indian as all his relatives were also declared Indian citizens. The court also said that minor spelling mistakes in names on official documents could not be the sole reason to deny authenticity as happened in the case.""However, mere allegation, that too, being as vague as to mechanically reproduce simply the words which mirror the text of provisions in the Act cannot be permitted under law. Even for the person to discharge the burden statutorily imposed on him by virtue of Section 9 of the Act, the person has to be intimated of the information and material available against him, such that he/she can contest and defend the proceedings against him,""the court said.","Section 9 of the Foreigners Act outs the burden on an individual to prove he/she is not a foreigner.

He underlined that the healthcare facilities of Army and CAPFs should be regularly made available to benefit the residents of nearby villages. He stressed upon maximum use of solar energy and other renewable sources of energy like windmills etc in these villages.Prime minister Narendra Modi prefers to call the border villages as ‘first villages’, a change from the past when they were referred to as the ‘last villages’. VVP was launched in February last year in a bid to win over the hearts and confidence of border residents, who form the first line of defence against any border transgressions or war. Happy border population makes the base for a stronger information network, was the mantra behind the VVP initiative.The home minister had, coinciding with the visit of residents of VVP villages to Delhi this year to watch the Republic Day parade, said that VVP has helped “bridge the distance between hearts”, with the government spend on the infrastructure upgrade of these villages in the last five years being twice the total expenditure incurred on their development in 70 years of Independence.Shah on Saturday directed senior ministers and officials to continue their efforts to understand the issues of VVP villages. Ministers and officials have been undertaking visits to the border villages on PM’s direction. So far, more than 6000 events have been organised in VVP villages, which include about 4000 service delivery and awareness camps. More than 600 projects have been sanctioned by the Govt. of India for employment generation.Under VVP scheme, 136 border villages are being provided connectivity through 113 all-weather road projects at a cost of Rs 2420 crore. 4G connectivity is being worked on rapidly in these areas and by December 2024, all VVP villages will be covered. Appropriate steps are being taken to ensure financial inclusion in all these villages and India Post-Payment Banks (IPPB) are also being facilitated there.Work is being done to develop tourist circuits to bring vibrancy to these vibrant villages. In this endeavour, capacity building and tourism-related infrastructure is being developed in coordination with the tourism ministry.","Vibrant Villages Programme (VVP) aimed at accelerated and integrated development of villages bordering China.

PTR fencing fails to curb man-tiger conflicts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ptr-fencing-fails-to-curb-man-tiger-conflicts/articleshow/111719057.cms,"PILIBHIT: The poor quality of the 9-foot-high chain-link fencing , spanning 42.5 km between the Mala, Mahof, and Barahi forest ranges of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) and adjacent agricultural fields, has undermined efforts to mitigate man-tiger conflicts .Initially introduced in a 17.5 km stretch as a pilot project in 2019-20, the fencing was expanded by 25 km in 2023-24, costing Rs 7.75 crore, after PTR authorities claimed it was more effective than solar fencing.PTR authorities initially deemed the chain-link fencing sturdy enough to last decades. However, it has sustained significant damage, with the base wall deteriorating and the wire mesh bent by illegal infiltrators. This damage has failed to prevent wild animals , especially tigers, from entering agricultural fields and has not curbed human infiltration into the core forest area, perpetuating man-wildlife conflicts.A member of the field forest force , speaking anonymously, revealed that the inferior quality of the fencing had been reported to the former Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), who took no action.The current DFO of PTR, Manish Singh, said, “a panel of forest officials has been formed to investigate and report within a week. Inquiries into the fencing work in the Barahi forest range will be handled by the Haripur range officer, while the Mahof range officer will examine the Mala forest range, and vice versa.”“Since the contractor’s final payment has not been cleared and sufficient funds, including security money, remain with the department, the contractor will be directed to repair the damages and ensure the fencing meets the assigned standards, Singh added.","Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) has 42.5 km of chain-link fencing.

Teaching law in regional languages can improve access to legal system: CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/teaching-law-in-regional-languages-can-improve-access-to-legal-system-cji/articleshow/111712584.cms,"LUCKNOW: Chief Justice of India Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud on Saturday said law students should be well-versed with regional languages and laws related to regional issues so that people's access to the legal system can be improved.Addressing the third convocation of Ram Manohar Lohia National Law University, Lucknow, Justice DY Chandrachud underscored the importance of imparting legal education in easy language, asserting that it is currently a shortcoming in the legal profession.Citing an analysis done by the research department of the Supreme Court on 81 universities and colleges, the CJI said, ""It was found that common people experience hurdles in understanding their rights and schemes meant for them as they do not know English.""""This means that in law universities, legal education is imparted English, and many times, students at legal aid centres are not able explain legal procedures to the common people in regional languages,"" he said.Justice Chandrachud said he was not blaming anyone or suggesting that English should be removed from legal education, only suggesting that regional languages should also be adopted in it.The CJI further said, ""Laws related to regional issues should also be taught in our universities. Suppose a person comes from a village to the university or to the university's legal aid centre and shares his land-related problem. If the student does not know the meaning of Khasra (land record) and Khatauni (land record document), how will the student be able to help that person?""""After coming to Uttar Pradesh, I realised how precious land is to the people. I understood the meaning and importance of 'taal' and 'talaiyaa' (pond) in legal language,"" he added.""This is a country of diversities, some based on language, some on region. In Uttar Pradesh, there are different dialects. In Lucknow people speak Hindustani, while in eastern Uttar Pradesh they use Bhojpuri. This begs the question: how can values of justice and the Constitution be made to reach the people,"" he said.Justice Chandrachud pointed out that in higher courts, the proceedings are held in English but the people whose cases are heard often do not understand the arguments being presented in the court.""As the Chief Justice of India, I have given some directives by which the process of justice can become easy for the common man. For example, various judgements delivered in English are being translated in different languages, which even the common man can understand,"" he saidElaborating further on making the process of imparting legal education in easy language, the CJI said, ""...in different provisions of the Constitution, there are some laws and basic principles. We teach those principles well in English, but find it difficult to explain them in regional languages. If we are not able to make the common man understand the principles of law in easy language, it is a shortcoming of the legal profession education.""He pointed out that many countries conduct both legal education and legal proceedings in regional languages so that all citizens can not only access the legal system but also aspire to be lawyers and judges.""It is only when we teach core principles of law to our students efficiently while acquainting them with the local context and local legal terms, that we can create socially responsible lawyers in the future, who can truly understand the issues and concerns of the local community,"" the CJI said.UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Supreme Court Justice Vikram Nath, Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court Arun Bhansali, judges of the Allahabad High Court, Vice-Chancellor of RMLNLU Prof Amar Pal Singh were present at the convocation.","Chief Justice of India Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud said law students should be well-versed with regional languages and laws related to regional issues.

"World population to peak at 10.3b by 2080s, life expectancy returns to pre-Covid levels : UN report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/world-population-to-peak-at-10-3b-by-2080s-life-expectancy-returns-to-pre-covid-levels-un-report/articleshow/111669844.cms,"NEW DELHI: The world’s population is expected to peak within the current century to reach around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s, up from 8.2 billion in 2024. After peaking, it is projected to start declining, gradually falling to 10.2 billion by the end of the century.While in 63 countries, like China and Japan, population peaked before 2024, India and the US are placed among 126 countries where the peak is expected in the second half of the century or beyond 2100.Significantly, one in four people live in a country whose population has already peaked.These findings, part of the ‘ World Population Prospects 2024’ report released by the UN on Thursday, also highlight that since 2022, life expectancy has returned to pre-Covid levels in nearly all countries and areas. After a brief decline during the pandemic, global life expectancy at birth has reached 73.3 years in 2024 (an increase of 8.4 years since 1995) up from 70.9 years during the pandemic.“Further reductions in mortality are projected to result in an average longevity of around 77.4 years globally in 2054. By the late 2050s, more than half of all global deaths will occur at age 80 or higher, a substantial increase from 17% in 1995,” the report shows.By the late 2070s, the number of persons at ages 65 years and higher globally is projected to reach 2.2 billion, surpassing the number of children (under age 18). By the mid-2030s, it is projected that there will be 265 million persons aged 80 years or older, more than the number of infants (1 year of age or less).Even in countries that are still growing rapidly and have relatively youthful populations, the number of persons aged 65 or older is expected to rise over the next 30 years.According to a press statement released from New York, the analysis in the report prepared by the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) shows that the size of the world’s population in 2100 is now expected to be 6% lower — or 700 million fewer — than anticipated a decade ago according to the ‘World Population Prospects 2024’ report released by the UN on Thursday.In 63 countries and areas, containing 28% of the world’s population in 2024, the size of the population peaked before 2024. This category includes countries like China, Germany, Japan and the Russian Federation, and the total population of this group is projected to decline by 14% over the next thirty years.For another 48 countries with 10% of the world’s population, including Brazil, Iran, Türkiye and Vietnam, the population is projected to peak between 2025 and 2054.In the remaining 126 countries, including India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the United States of America, the population is expected to increase through 2054 and, potentially, to peak in the second half of the century or beyond 2100.In nine countries of this last group, including Angola, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger and Somalia, very rapid growth is projected, with their total population doubling between 2024 and 2054.The report highlights that rapid fertility declines in populous countries is a likely cause for the global population to peak within this century (80%), contrasting with a decade ago when the probability was around 30%.“The demographic landscape has evolved greatly in recent years,"" said Li Junhua, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. ""In some countries, the birth rate is now even lower than previously anticipated, and we are also seeing slightly faster declines in some high-fertility regions. The earlier and lower peak is a hopeful sign. This could mean reduced environmental pressures from human impacts due to lower aggregate consumption,” Junhua added.“The earlier population peak is due to several factors, including lower levels of fertility in some of the world’s largest countries, especially China. Globally, women are having one child fewer, on average, than they did around 1990,” the analysis shows.The data brings into focus that in more than half of all countries, the average number of live births per woman is below 2.1—the level required for a population to maintain a constant size over the long term without migration—and nearly a fifth of all countries and areas, including China, Italy, the Republic of Korea and Spain, now have “ultra-low” fertility, with fewer than 1.4 live births per woman over a lifetime.On what the journey onwards is expected to look like, the report states that the main driver of global population increase through mid-century will be the momentum created by growth in the past. ""The number of women at ages 15–49 is projected to grow from nearly 2 billion in 2024 to a peak of around 2.2 billion in the late 2050s, driving continued growth even if the number of births per woman falls to the replacement level."" Moreover, today’s youthful age structure, which is a product of past growth, will account for 79% of the population increase through 2054, adding about 1.4 billion people.The analysis also shows that the countries with youthful populations and declining fertility have a limited time to benefit economically from an increasing concentration of population in the working ages. ""In about 100 countries or areas, the working-age population (between 20 and 64 years) will grow through 2054, offering a window of opportunity known as the demographic dividend,"" the UN report states and recommends that to capitalize on this opportunity, countries must invest in education, health, and infrastructure, and implement reforms to create jobs and improve government efficiency.For some populations, immigration will be the main driver of future growth. ""In 50 countries and areas, immigration is projected to attenuate the decline in population size due to sustained low levels of fertility and an older age structure. However, in 14 countries and areas already experiencing ultra-low fertility, emigration is likely to contribute to reducing population size through 2054,"" the report states.The data also shows that early pregnancies remain a challenge, particularly in low-income countries. In 2024, 4.7 million babies, or about 3.5% of the total worldwide, were born to mothers under age 18 – and some 340,000, to girls under age 15 – with serious consequences for the health and well-being of both the young mothers and their children.The UN calls for investing in the education of youth, especially girls, and increasing the ages at marriage and first childbearing in countries where these milestone events tend to occur early will have positive effects on women’s health, educational attainment and labour force participation. ""These efforts will also contribute to slowing population growth and reducing the scale of the investments required to achieve sustainable development while ensuring that no one is left behind,"" the report asserts.","The world’s population is expected to peak within the current century to reach around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s. After peaking, it is projected to start declining, gradually falling to 10.2 billion by the end of the century. In 63 countries, like China and Japan, population peaked before 2024, India and the US are placed among 126 countries where the peak is expected in the second half of thecentury or beyond 2100.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111669848,imgsize-2260147,width-400,resizemode-4/111669848.jpg"

There are many more issues of Haryana Sikhs that would also be resolved”, said Assandh.Regarding the called gathering by farm unions at Amupur village in support of Sikh families on July 12, Assandh said he has ordered the manager of Gurdwara Patshahi Chhevin in Kurukshetra, to arrange langar and tea for the gathering.About another decision taken by HSGMC executive, Assandh said that it has also been decided to either take on rent or build a new Sarai (inn) at Amritsar to provide a stay facility to Haryana Sikhs visiting Darbar Sahib.“There is a shortage of stay facility in Sarai for Haryana Sikhs visiting Darbar Sahib in Amritsar.

BENGALURU: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday detained former Karnataka Minister B Nagendra on Friday in connection with the alleged Valmiki Development Corporation scam.This action followed raids conducted by the ED on Wednesday at various locations linked to Nagendra and MLA Basanagouda Daddal, concerning the alleged embezzlement of funds from Valmiki Development Corporation.Nagendra, who had resigned on June 6 amid the ongoing investigation, has professed his innocence, asserting he would be cleared of all allegations through the investigation process.Union Minister and BJP MP Shobha Karandlaje has implicated Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in the scam, demanding his resignation.She stated, ""On July 3, I wrote to the Union Home Minister and demanded a CBI probe into this. When the CBI probe is going on, the Karnataka government formed an SIT to hide this scam . Now the SIT is not helping the CBI, but the probe is going on and the ED conducted raids. At various places, searches are being conducted in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Bellary. The Karnataka CM is involved in this, so we demand the resignation of Siddaramaiah. He should resign and face the probe then only justice will be delivered.""Shobha Karandlaje further explained, ""Siddaramaiah is the Finance Minister. Without his instructions, no one will have the courage to transfer Rs 187 crores from the bank to companies.""In response to the ED raids , Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister stated that the raids were unnecessary, emphasizing that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) had already conducted thorough investigations and recovered the money.He said, ""There was no need for ED raid. Our SIT officers have already done an investigation and money has been recovered. CBI have already filed an FIR and they have provisions to take up the investigation, ED doesn't have that provision. There is a procedure for how it can be done, not on NR Ramesh or somebody's complaint ED can do an investigation.""The controversy surrounding the Maharshi Valmiki Scheduled Tribes Development Corporation first came to light after the suicide of an official, Chandrasekaran, on May 26. Chandrasekaran, a resident of Kenchappa colony in Vinobanagar and a superintendent at the Corporation's Bengaluru office, left behind a six-page suicide note alleging multi-crore corruption within the Corporation and naming three officials involved.This note prompted investigations, with Chandrasekaran's allegations drawing widespread attention. The ED raids and subsequent detention of Nagendra have added further intensity to the case, raising serious questions about the governance and integrity of the Valmiki Development Corporation and its officials.The SIT’s prior intervention and the ED's involvement place a spotlight on potential overlaps or conflicts between state mechanisms like the SIT and central agencies like the CBI and ED. This complex interaction underscores the broad impacts of corruption allegations and the administrative responses elicited at various government levels.The ongoing investigations and their outcomes will likely have significant implications for political and administrative accountability in Karnataka, with particular focus on the roles and responsibilities of high-ranking officials within the state’s finance and development sectors.As the situation unfolds, the ED, CBI, and SIT continue their respective probes into the matter, which remains a hotbed of political and legal activity. The ultimate findings will determine the veracity of the claims and the extent of involvement by key figures, including those at the highest levels of the state government.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) detained former Karnataka Minister B Nagendra on Friday in connection with the alleged Valmiki Development Corporation scam.

Last year, 102 students scored full marks.Thosithaa Lakshmi N from Chengalpet, Nilanjana K from Tirunelveli and Gokul from Rasipuram secured the first three ranks in the engineering rank list.“The number of students scoring above 195 has come down from 2,911 last year to 2,862 this year. Due to a big increase in the intake of seats by colleges, the cut-off may come down by up to one mark for top colleges compared to last year,” career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi said.In the 150 to 180 marks bracket, the cut-off may rise by up to eight marks as more than 15,000 students have scored in this range this year, he added. However, engineering colleges said students who scored below 180 cut-off marks have a bright chance to get admitted to top colleges.“With more seats available this year, we can expect students with below 180 cut-off marks can join reputed colleges this year,” said B Chidambarajan, director, SRM Valliammai Engineering College.Earlier, K Veera Raghava Rao, commissioner, directorate of technical education (DOTE) released the engineering rank list and the schedule for admissions. This year, 1,99,868 students feature in the rank list.“The number of students in the engineering rank list has increased by 11.7% compared to previous year. We will release the list of colleges with seat matrix by July 15 on TNEA website,” he said.Engineering counselling will begin on July 22 for special categories. The online general counselling will be conducted in three rounds from July 29 to September 3.Engineering colleges have submitted applications to the fee committee to revise the tuition fee for govt quota seats and management quota seats for 2024-25.As of now, engineering colleges collect Rs 85,000 for management quota (Rs 87,000 for accredited courses) and Rs 50,000 for government quota seats (Rs 55,000 for accredited courses). A few top colleges were allowed to collect Rs 1.25 lakh for management quota seats after they submitted their balance sheet with the fee committee.","As many as 65 students scored 200 of 200 marks in the engineering rank list released on Wednesday.

Still stuck in Space: What astronaut Sunita Williams said about her return to Earth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/still-stuck-in-space-what-astronaut-sunita-williams-said-about-her-return-to-earth/articleshow/111648877.cms,"Two American astronauts , Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams , who are currently waiting to depart from the International Space Station , expressed their confidence on Wednesday that the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they arrived on would safely bring them back to Earth, despite the significant uncertainties surrounding the vehicle's performance.The astronauts launched on June 5 aboard the new spaceship, which Nasa hopes to certify for transporting crews to and from the space station.However, their return has been delayed due to thruster malfunctions and helium leaks that were discovered during the journey.Although no specific date has been set for their return, Nasa officials indicated on Wednesday that they are targeting ""late July.""When asked during a press conference from the station if they still had faith in the Starliner team and the spacecraft, mission commander Wilmore responded, ""We're absolutely confident."" Williams added, ""I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem.""The astronauts have been keeping themselves busy on the ISS, carrying out various tasks and experiments, such as changing the pump on a machine that recycles urine into drinking water and conducting gene sequencing in microgravity.Before Wilmore and Williams can return to Earth, engineering teams need to conduct more simulations on the ground to better understand the root causes of the technical issues Starliner experienced and modify the spacecraft's flight plan if necessary.The spacecraft had a known helium leak before launch, but additional leaks emerged during the flight. Additionally, some of Starliner's thrusters, which provide fine maneuvering, initially failed to engage during its approach to the station, delaying docking. Engineers are still investigating the reasons behind these issues.Despite the challenges, Nasa and Boeing maintain that Starliner could safely return to Earth in case of an emergency, particularly since the problems affected only certain orientation-controlling thrusters. They have no concerns about the more powerful thrusters responsible for the ""deorbit burn"" that will bring the spaceship back.However, much remains uncertain, including whether the malfunctioning thrusters have become degraded, which would necessitate relying on other thrusters during descent.","Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams are currently waiting to depart from the International Space Station.

John Cena announces in-ring retirement in 2025, invites superstars to 'come get some' | WWE on ESPN

Among many international celebrities spotted at the grand wedding ceremonies of business tycoon Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant ,WWE star John Cena too arrived in style and had the photographers going gaga over his presence in Mumbai. The 16 time WWE World champion was even seen shaking a leg in joy.The future WWE Hall of famer famously known as ‘The Champ’, arrived at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's Grand wedding in Mumbai.The 47 year old who is also a Hollywood movie star for the past 5 years, arrived on July 12th for the wedding. Previously, Cena touched down in Mumbai wearing a casual outfit. The wedding took place at the Nita Ambani Cultural Centre, Mumbai. He was cheered and clicked by the fans in huge numbers outside the airport amidst heavy security.Several International celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Justin Bieber, Rihanna, etc have all been a part of this grand wedding and its festivities going on in the last few months. It has been the talk of the town and regarded as one of the biggest and most awaited wedding ceremonies across the globe. The WWE legend, Cena was seen striking his signature ‘You Can't See Me’ pose in a light blue 'Sherwani' after arriving at the wedding place. He was seen in a jovial mood all throughout.During all this, the moment that took everyone by surprise was seeing Cena shake a leg and dance vigorously at the ‘Baraat’ ceremony that takes place specially for the groom. It looked like John was enjoying his time at the wedding thoroughly and did not hesitate one bit even from shaking his leg when asked by the friends of the groom. It was the rarest of the rare sights for the wrestling and Hollywood fans across the world.John Cena has recently been in the news globally since he shocked the world last week at Money in the Bank Premium Live Event by announcing his retirement from wrestling after WrestleMania 41 is done with. Millions of fans have gone emotional after this announcement from Cena. What comes as a relief is the fact that before retiring, Cena is going to wrestle in the WWE for at least 30 to 40 dates as he announced at Money in the Bank.Notably, the ‘Fast and the Furious’ star has only made sporadic appearances in the WWE for the past 5 years and has not been a permanent fixture. After attending the wedding ceremony of the Ambani's, Cena departed from Mumbai last night in a dark blue Sherwani. While seeing him shake his leg and pose for the Paparazzi would have filled the hearts of Cena's fans not just in India but across the globe, the fans eagerly await his next line of movies and his last WWE tour.","The future WWE Hall of famer famously known as ‘The Champ’, arrived at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's Grand wedding in Mumbai.

The WWE has given us some truly iconic moments over its last 70 years of entertainment. Throughout the last seven decades, we have witnessed some of the greatest wrestlers in the ring battle it out for championship belts. However, not every WWE legend is created equal. There are a few who stand out, even among the brightest stars of the game.There are some whose brilliance sets them apart, even when they're grouped with legends.Today, we’ll be taking a look at the Top 10 WWE Legends of all time.If it wasn’t for the greatness of Hulk Hogan , WWE, and all its various businesses might not be where they are today. Hogan stood together with Vince McMahon and helped him expand the WWE brand. His larger-than-life persona helped McMahon sneak his wrestling promotion into the homes of millions. Throughout his career, Hogan won the WWE Championship six times and toppled legends like Andre the Giant, Roddy Piper, and Randy Savage.Even after an eight-year absence, Hogan returned for Wrestlemania X-8 and gave one of the best performances ever against The Rock . His longevity and ability to win crowds is what makes him a WWE Legend. Hogan made his debut back in 1977 and is still celebrated as one of the best wrestlers to ever grace the ring. We might never see a star who can pull in the masses as effectively as Hogan could at the peak of his career.John Cena has been the WWE Champion a total of 16 times. He arrived in 2002 and completely burst onto the scene by deciding to challenge former WWE superstar Kurt Angle in his first ever appearance. However, despite his hot start, Cena might’ve fizzled out if the company hadn’t found him rapping on buses.Thanks to his skills on the mic, the Thuganomics era began, and Cena was unstoppable. John Cena started with awkward raps full of witty insults and used that to become the face of the company. The crowd just couldn’t get enough of him, and his rapid ascent took Cena to his first WWE title back in 2005.It’s been 19 years since then, and he's still going strong. John Cena has taken on legends like The Rock, Randy Orton, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, and more throughout his decade-long reign at the top of WWE. Next year, Cena’s time in the ring will come to an end, he’s already one of the best to ever do it and will surely be giving us some historic moments as he prepares for his final run.The Undertaker is easily one of the greatest wrestlers of all time and for a man who doesn’t speak often, he is also one of the best showmen the WWE has ever seen. He was so loved by the crowd that it only took him a year to beat Hulk Hogan and become the WWE Champion. His zombie-like fighting style and his supernatural character were loved by the fans.What truly made The Undertaker great wasn’t the belts he won, it was the stories he delivered. From his scuffle with Kane to his Hell in a Cell bout with Mankind and even his entire row with Randy Orton, the Undertaker has always given us some of the best stories in the WWE. He even strung together 21 Wrestlemania victories in a row until Brock Lesnar somehow toppled the giant at Wrestlemania XXX.There aren’t many who can electrify an arena like The Rock. He arrived to the WWE as a third-generation wrestler, and the expectations were high. If he hadn’t found his way to the Nation of Domination, we might not have been able to witness his greatness. However, The Rock was able to completely reinvent his character, and his mic skills did all the rest.Within two years of his debut, The Rock won the WWE Championship at Survivor Series. Since then, he’s won the belt a total of eight times, solidifying himself as one of the greatest of all time. Rock has taken on and beat legends like Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, John Cena, Triple H, and many more. He more than deserves to be counted among the greatest WWE legends.“Stone Cold” Steve Austin is the reason WWE was able to outlast WCW in the Monday Night Wars. If it weren’t for the antihero persona of Austin, WWE, as we know it, might have looked completely different. No one expected Austin to be a success, but as it turns out, a wrestler who doesn’t care about authority, flips everyone off and drinks beer in the ring was all the rage back in the 1990s.His shenanigans in the ring and rivalry against McMahon saw Austin rise to the top of WWE. He beat Shawn Michaels at Wrestlemania XIV and etched his name into the history books by becoming the WWE Champion. Since then, we’ve seen Stone Cold turn heel and partner with McMahon on his way to five more championships. The Stone Cold Stunner outlined an era of WWE greatness and will go down as one of the best ever.Randy Savage the Macho Man is one of the most entertaining wrestlers to ever step into the ring. He brought life to the storylines he played a part in. His rivalries against Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Ric Flair, and more legends like the Ultimate Warrior go on to show, just how big of a star he was.Savage chose his wife, Miss Elizabeth, to manage him, and what a decision that was. The amount of legendary moments we’ve had due to Savage being jealous of his wife is enough to get him to the Hall of Fame. Even today, Savage’s image is used to advertise products for Slim Jim all around the world. Randy Savage is a timeless hero and a legend of the game.Not many expected a wrestler of Shawn’s size and build to become the WWE Champion, yet Michaels did it three times. After his relationship with Marty Jannetty came to an end, Michaels was dubbed the Heartbreak Kid and the rest is history. He kept working and took out some of the best competitors in the business like John Cena, Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio , and many more.Michaels also gave us one of the best Wrestlemania performances of all time at Wrestlemania XXV against The Undertaker. The Deadman won the day, but Michaels reminded the people that he’s one of the best wrestlers this brand has ever seen. Today, Michaels helps Ava run WWE NXT. Even after stepping out of the ring, Shawn is working on bringing new talents to the fans at home.We said that not many people expected someone of Shawn Michaels’ size to become WWE Champion, and this is even more true in the case of Rey Mysterio. Rey has never been able to tower over an opponent throughout his lengthy WWE career. However, his athleticism has allowed him to reach the pinnacle of WWE by winning three world championships.At the peak of his career, Mysterio was facing off against the likes of Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle. Mysterio left the company after more than a decade of greatness. Upon his return in 2019, he continued to impress, and his legend only grew. Even now, Rey continues to give us some amazing storylines, facing off against Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns and his own son, Dominik Mysterio.Before Mysterio won the Royal Rumble match in 2006, the world thought it'd be impossible for a man of his size to achieve such a thing. However, Mysterio made a career out of proving people wrong, and he did so tons of times on his way to multiple championship belts.Ultimate Warrior was pure energy every time he stepped into the WWE ring. Everything from his fae paint to the arm bands and his toned muscles made the people believe that The Ultimate Warrior was a force of nature. Thanks to his out-of-this-world presence and personality, he was able to reach the pinnacle of the WWE world and battled with the likes of Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, and Rick Dude.Ultimate Warrior’s reputation among his fellow stars might not be spotless, but his savagery and skills in the ring sure were. The Ultimate Warrior is a Hall of Famer and is easily one of the best competitors the WWE has ever seen.Ever since Bret Hard took his leave, the WWE has not seen a showman who can even be compared to him. The Hitman was a master of his trade and made a career out of selling his fights on realism. Hart was a true champion and had the pride and ego of one as well. Thankfully, he also had the skills and quality to win over the hearts of the fans.Throughout his career, Hart faced off against many legends like Ric Flair, Steve Austin, The Undertaker, and Shawn Michaels. Whoever he faced became a bigger and better star thanks to the impact Bret Hart had on his peers. It can also be said that it was Bret Hart himself who paved the way for smaller wrestlers like Shawn Michaels. Many consider the Hitman to be the greatest wrestler ever, and an argument can surely be made for the five-time WWE Champion. The WWE would look a lot different without all those who were inspired by the brilliance of The Hitman.","The WWE has given us some truly iconic moments over its last 70 years of entertainment.

How TCS got 70% employees back to office by linking variable pay to attendance; others penalised monetarily,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-tcs-got-70-employees-back-to-office-by-linking-variable-pay-to-attendance-others-penalised-monetarily/articleshow/111679529.cms,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's largest IT services company, has said that 70% of its employees are back in office and the number is increasing every week. Interestingly, the development comes within months of TCS changing its policy to link variable pay to work from the office.At a press conference post declaration of TCS’ Q1 FY25 results, Milind Lakkad , chief HR officer said that confirmed that employees who did not adhere to the policy of working from the office five days a week were penalized monetarily, although he did not provide specific numbers.""There are implications for people not coming to office. We do not give out the amounts of what that impact would be. It is something we are doing more from basically bringing in the discipline standpoint and not for any other reasons,"" he was quoted as saying.Lakkad expressed confidence in the situation, stating, ""I'm also not worried about that. In fact, people have realised the value of coming to office, some of them have come to office for the first time because they joined TCS during the pandemic. All of that is basically creating positive energy in the system.""Also Read | Infosys & Wipro see sharp decline in number of employees earning over Rs 1 crore - here’s why In April, TCS made changed its variable pay policy. The updated policy considers work from office as a key determinant in calculating variable pay for employees. The policy has been divided into four attendance slabs, each corresponding to a specific percentage of variable pay.According to an earlier TOI report, employees who spend less than 60% of their time working from the office will not be entitled to any variable pay for that quarter. Those who attend office between 60-75% of the time will receive half of their variable pay. Employees with an office attendance of 75-85% will be eligible for three-quarters of their variable pay.

"Why consumer court asked Zomato to pay Rs 60,000 to Karnataka woman for not delivering Momos worth Rs 133",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-consumer-court-asked-zomato-to-pay-rs-60000-to-karnataka-woman-for-not-delivering-momos-worth-rs-133/articleshow/111719431.cms,"What the consumer court said in its ruling

A consumer court in Karnataka reportedly ruled in favour of a woman who didn't receive her momos order placed through food delivery app Zomato last year. According to a report in Indian Express, the order by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Dharwad came recently.The woman named Sheethal reportedly placed the order on August 31, 2023, but despite receiving a delivery confirmation, the momos never arrived.Sheethal contacted both the restaurant and Zomato but received no resolution. Zomato requested 72 hours to investigate but never followed up. Left with no choice, Sheethal filed a legal notice against Zomato in September 2023.In court, Zomato denied any wrongdoing. However, the court pointed out that Zomato's inaction for months contradicted their initial request for time to address the issue. Finally, in May 2024, Zomato refunded Sheethal the original cost of the momos (Rs 133.25).The court found Zomato deficient in service and liable for the inconvenience caused to Sheethal. Zomato was ordered to pay Sheethal Rs 50,000 as compensation for the mental stress and Rs 10,000 to cover her legal expenses, bringing the total award to Rs 60,000.“Zomato is carrying out their business of supplying materials in response to the online orders placed by the customer. Despite receipt of the purchase money, Zomato did not deliver the required product to the complainant. By looking into these facts of the case on hand in our opinion Op no. 1 (Zomato) alone is liable to answer the claim of the complainant,” the commission reportedly said.In the order, Eshappa K Bhute, president of the commission, ordered Zomato to pay Sheethal Rs 50,000 as compensation towards the inconvenience and mental agony caused to her and Rs 10,000 towards her litigation cost.","A consumer court in Karnataka reportedly ruled in favour of a woman who didn't receive her momos order placed through food delivery app Zomato last year.

'Rust' case against Alec Baldwin dismissed over withheld evidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rust-case-against-alec-baldwin-dismissed-over-withheld-evidence/articleshow/111724345.cms,"SANTA FE: A judge in New Mexico dismissed the case against Alec Baldwin on Friday after finding that the state had withheld evidence that could have shed light on how live rounds got onto a film set where the cinematographer was fatally shot.The dismissal was with prejudice, meaning that the prosecution of Baldwin is over. If he had been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Baldwin would have faced up to 18 months in prison.""There is no way for the court to right this wrong,"" Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said in court as Baldwin wept.It was a stunning end to the trial of Baldwin, who was rehearsing with a gun on the ""Rust"" film set in 2021 when it fired a live round, killing Halyna Hutchins , the movie's cinematographer. Baldwin had been told the gun was ""cold,"" meaning it had no live ammunition.The dismissal followed a dramatic scene when the lead prosecutor, Kari T. Morrissey, went from questioning witnesses to taking the stand herself. She gave an account of why a batch of ammunition that had been turned in to the state several months ago by a witness who claimed it was related to the ""Rust"" shooting had been put in an entirely different case file and was not handed over to the defense.""It was my impression that they did not match the live rounds from the set of 'Rust,'"" Morrissey said on the stand, saying that she had only viewed a photo of the ammunition.But when the ammunition was brought into the courtroom earlier Friday at the judge's request it became clear that some of the rounds resembled those found on the ""Rust"" set.The new evidence was brought into the courtroom in a manila envelope. Marlowe Sommer put on blue latex gloves, cut it open with a pair of scissors and got down from the bench to examine the ammunition inside in the well of the courtroom as the prosecution and defense surrounded her. The examination determined that three of the rounds did, in fact, resemble the live rounds found on the set of ""Rust"" after the shooting.""I never saw them until today,"" Morrissey testified when she took the stand.The failure to disclose the ammunition posed a major legal problem because the state is required to turn over key evidence to the defense.""They buried it,"" Luke Nikas, a lawyer for Baldwin, said in court. ""They put it under a different case with a different number.""The judge's order lifted a significant weight from Baldwin, a television and movie star whose life and career has been under a shadow of potential criminal liability for nearly three years, as the case against him has gone through a series of twists and turns.Baldwin still faces lawsuits, including one from Hutchins' husband, Matthew Hutchins. Although a settlement was announced in that case, it has not been fully resolved.""We respect the court's decision,"" a lawyer for Hutchins, Brian J. Panish, said in a statement Friday. ""We look forward to presenting all the evidence to a jury and holding Mr. Baldwin accountable for his actions in the senseless death of Halyna Hutchins.""Baldwin has vehemently denied responsibility for Hutchins' death, saying that he had no reason to believe that the gun he was handed on set that day could have been loaded with live ammunition. Live rounds are generally banned on film sets, and witnesses said that the gun was declared ""cold.""Lawyers for Baldwin have fought the criminal prosecution at every turn, filing motions to dismiss over the grand jury proceedings, the legal theory of the case and the FBI testing that broke key internal parts of the gun. But the judge rejected each of their attempts, until the latest one.Morrissey had blamed the movie's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, for the live rounds, which the armorer denied. Gutierrez-Reed was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for loading the live round into the gun that Baldwin was rehearsing with and is serving 18 months in prison.The ammunition examined in court Friday came from a man named Troy Teske, a friend of Gutierrez-Reed's stepfather, Thell Reed, who is a well-known Hollywood armorer.Teske first surfaced in the trial Thursday, as Baldwin's defense team questioned a crime scene technician. It emerged that Teske, a retired police officer, had gone to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office around the time of Gutierrez-Reed's trial and handed over some ammunition that he believed was related to the case.The crime scene technician, Marissa Poppell, testified that she had spoken to Teske and saved the ammunition but that she put it under a different case number than the ""Rust"" case.Morrissey said in court that, after viewing a photo provided by Teske, she had determined that the ammunition was not relevant to the ""Rust"" investigation because it did not look similar to the live rounds that were collected on the movie set. ""This has no evidentiary value whatsoever,"" she said in court. And under questioning from Morrissey on Thursday, Poppell said the rounds that Teske had brought to the sheriff's office looked dissimilar to the live rounds found on the ""Rust"" set.But when the ammunition was brought into court, and it became clear that some resembled the ammunition collected on the set, Marlowe Sommer sent the jury home for the weekend and continued the hearing on whether the evidence had been mishandled. She found that it had.""The state's willful withholding of this information was intentional and deliberate,"" Marlowe Sommer said. ""If this conduct does not rise to the level of bad faith, it certainly comes so near to bad faith as to show signs of scorching prejudice.""While on the stand, Morrissey acknowledged that the other special prosecutor, Erlinda O. Johnson, had resigned from the case. Johnson walked out of the proceedings earlier Friday, the third day of the trial, after conferring with the judge; she did not immediately respond to a request for comment.As Morrissey left the courthouse Friday, she told a crowd of reporters and TV cameras that ""there is absolutely no evidence that any of that ammunition is related to the incident involving Ms. Hutchins.""She added, ""I understand that the court disagrees with me, and I respect the court's decision.""That decision Friday was the latest twist in a case that has had many. After Baldwin was first charged in January 2023, the manslaughter charge was downgraded as prosecutors acknowledged that it was based on a law that did not exist at the time of the shooting.Then, the special prosecutor handling the case stepped down after Baldwin's lawyers argued that her appointment violated the state constitution because she also served in another branch of government, as a state lawmaker.A new prosecution team took over, and it temporarily dismissed the charges against Baldwin after his lawyers argued that the gun might have been modified in such a way that made it more likely to discharge without pulling the trigger. When a forensic report undermined that claim, the new prosecution team, led by Morrissey, decided to take the case to a grand jury, which indicted Baldwin on a charge of involuntary manslaughter.There had been signs of tensions behind the scenes and criticism of the investigation. Robert Shilling, a former chief of the New Mexico State Police who worked as an investigator for the district attorney's office before being removed from the case, sharply criticized the investigation in an email to prosecutors that later became public.""The conduct of the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office during and after their initial investigation is reprehensible and unprofessional to a degree I still have no words for,"" he wrote in the email. ""Not I or 200 more proficient investigators than I can/could clean up the mess delivered to your office in October 2022 (1 year since the initial incident inexcusable).""During the court proceedings Friday, as it looked increasingly possible that the new evidence could disrupt the case, Baldwin seemed to relax somewhat after two days of trial that had drawn dozens of journalists to the courthouse and thousands more spectators to the livestream of the trial online.When the case was dismissed, Baldwin, openly weeping, turned around and embraced his wife, Hilaria Baldwin, before walking out of court a free man.","The dismissal was with prejudice, meaning that the prosecution of Baldwin is over. If he had been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Baldwin would have faced up to 18 months in prison. ""There is no way for the court to right this wrong,"" Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said in court.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111724375,imgsize-647174,width-400,resizemode-4/111724375.jpg"

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Oli-led Nepal government to be sworn-in on Monday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/oli-led-nepal-government-to-be-sworn-in-on-monday/articleshow/111724071.cms,"KATHMANDU: K P Sharma Oli , set to become Nepal's new Prime Minister, on Saturday held consultations with his alliance partner Nepali Congress in preparing the list of ministers to be inducted into the new coalition government that is likely to be sworn in on Monday. President Ram Chandra Paudel is expected to appoint Oli, 72, as the new Prime Minister of the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist ( CPN-UML )-Nepali Congress (NC)coalition on Sunday.""However, the President is likely to administer the oath to the new Prime Minister and other members of the cabinet on Monday morning. A small cabinet is likely to be announced on Monday before the oath-taking ceremony starts,"" said sources close to the NC and UML.Amid political turmoil in the Himalayan nation, CPN-UML chairman Oli, 72, is set to become prime minister once again after incumbent Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' on Friday failed to win a trust vote in Parliament.Late on Friday night, Oli staked his claim to become the next Prime Minister with the backing of NC president Sher Bahadur Deuba and submitted the signature of 165 House of Representatives (HoR) members -- 77 from his party and 88 from the NC -- to form the government under Article 76-2 of the Constitution.Out of a total of 21 ministries, the Nepali Congress will get nine and the UML eight plus the post of Prime Minister, a source close to Oli said.""Key positions such as Home, Foreign, Finance and Energy will be divided between NC and UML. Nepali Congress is likely to get the portfolio of Home while the Finance will go to the UML,"" the source said.Earlier in the day on Saturday, CPN-UML held a high-level meeting to discuss the future course of action and finalise the names of ministers to be included in the new cabinet.However, in the beginning, there will be a small cabinet, which will be expanded later, according to senior leader of the party and Standing Committee member Rajan Bhattarai.Nepali Congress also held its Central Work Performance Committee meeting to discuss and finalise the ministerial list and the policy to be adopted by the party.""The meeting discussed the ongoing political developments and finalised the names to be included in the Oli-led cabinet,"" said former Deputy Prime Minister and senior NC leader Prakash Man Singh.Although Deuba and Oli have already held preliminary discussions regarding the modality of the new coalition and power-sharing, the matter will be finalised by Saturday night.During a crucial meeting last week, Deuba and Oli had agreed to share the post of Prime Minister by turns and that the CPN-UML chief would lead the government for the first 18 months.Besides CPN-Maoist, CPN-Unified Socialist and Rastriya Swotantra Party, which had voted in favour of Prachanda during the floor test, Rastriya Prajatantra Party and other smaller parties are likely to back the NC-UML coalition.Also, smaller parties such as Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP), JSP Nepal, Janamat Party, Nagarik Unmukti Party and Lokatantrik Samajwadi Party are likely to join the Oli-led coalition, according to party sources.Prachanda, 69, chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre (CPN-MC), faced the trust vote as CPN-UML withdrew support from his government last week after inking a power-sharing deal with the largest party in the House, the NC.Prachanda lost the vote of confidence as he received only 63 votes in the 275-member HoR with 194 votes against the motion. At least 138 votes are needed to win the vote of trust.Nepal is facing frequent political instability as the country has seen 14 governments in the past 16 years after the Republican system was introduced.Meanwhile, a leading newspaper in Nepal commented that it takes decades, even centuries, to build a nation.The five-year term of Parliament is the minimum required for a set of leaders to make some impactful decisions for the country. There certainly are provisions for changes in the government, even in the midst of the parliamentary term, but these should be exceptional cases, The Kathmandu Post wrote in an editorial this week.""What we have got, however, is a perpetuity of the coalition culture. It is this perpetuity that has halted the nation-building process for decades now. With the same set of three old men playing the hot potato game around power, nation-building has become a staccato performance at best.""Just as one performer comes to the stage and starts his performance, he is pushed to the sidelines in the middle of the act,"" it added, apparently referring to the exit of Prachanda as the prime minister, just 18 months after he assumed office.","K P Sharma Oli, 72, is set to become Nepal's new Prime Minister.

A labour crunch awaits Starmer plan to spur UK housebuilding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/a-labour-crunch-awaits-starmer-plan-to-spur-uk-housebuilding/articleshow/111724262.cms,"Green Skills

More builders needed

Prime Minister Keir Starmer ’s promise to “get Britain building again” will quickly face a shortage of skilled workers in the very industries he’s hoping will power the turnaround.The UK is facing a supply crunch of builders, solar-panel installers and engineers, raising questions about who will carry out Starmer’s mission to radically expand clean power and build 1.5 million homes over the next five years.While the Labour Party has pledged to expand training in key sectors, the scale of the shortages suggest they will slow early efforts to ramp up activity in those sectors.The UK needs about 400,000 workers to meet its net zero targets, 30% more than the oil-and-gas sector staff available to fill those roles, according to a PwC analysis. Meanwhile, the UK’s construction workforce has declined about 14% in the past five years.Green jobs cover a wide range of sectors associated with industries that will help shift the economy away from fossil fuels. Those include wind and solar installations, heat pumps, carbon capture and storage, battery technologies. More broadly defined it can also include project developers and people who manage planning permission.UK businesses in these sectors warn they’re already struggling to find staff as they were particularly badly hit by a mix of Brexit , higher inactivity rates, and a lack of training opportunities. Vacancies per job are still above pre-Covid levels in key policy areas like construction, electricity, gas and education. The fear is that Labour’s plans will supercharge demand and stoke up talent wars, pushing up wages without a matching boost in output.“We welcome the government’s focus on making the UK a clean energy superpower, but the lack of green skills in the UK’s workforce will put this mission at risk,” said Charlotte Eaton, chief people officer at Ovo Energy which employs some 5,000 people across the UK. “The government must urgently map out the regional workforce and identify skills shortages so it can invest where the need is greatest.”In the run-up to Labour’s landslide election victory, the party had frequently cited skills shortages as evidence of what they said was economic mismanagement by the Conservatives’ during their 14 years in power. Starmer has appointed Jacqui Smith, a former home secretary, as minister for skills, further and higher education. Labour plans to link immigration with training policies and also roll out training programs in sectors like health and social care and construction.Bank of England policy maker Jonathan Haskel warned that the UK labor market has gotten worse at matching jobseekers to vacancies, meaning that shortages are set to persist even as unemployment picks up. While the UK’s unemployment rate hit the highest level in 2 1/2 years, strong wage growth remains a concern for the BOE ahead of its meeting in August, when it decides whether to reduce interest rates from a 16-year high.The UK jobs market has shrunk since the pandemic. The number of people in employment has fallen since 2019 after some 800,000 workers dropped out of the labor force mainly due to long-term sickness. Few have returned. Almost a quarter of the UK’s working-age population is economically inactive — out of work and not looking for a job. That’s the most since 2015.Labour has set a target for the country to produce zero fossil-fuel pollution from electricity by 2030. It’s announced a flurry of plans to achieve it, from reforming planning rules to speed up the construction of clean energy infrastructure to a public company that will co-invest alongside the private sector in wind and solar projects, as well as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.This, Labour says, will create 650,000 jobs. But energy bosses worry the UK doesn’t have enough skilled workers to fill them.Axel Thiemann, chief executive officer of renewable energy producer Sonnedix, is building a solar power plant in Durham that will provide about 100 green jobs once completed next year. He’s having difficulty hiring across a wide range of occupations, from construction personnel and to electricity grid technicians and people who can manage building permit applications.“The same people that used to have one project on the desk now see maybe three or four,” Thiemann said. That’s delaying activity, as well as boosting costs and tightening competition for staff, he added.Such concerns are widespread among energy companies whose appetite for green jobs is growing more rapidly than the supply of talent. A PwC analysis estimated the UK needs 400,000 workers to meet its net zero targets, yet it only has about 270,000 staff in the oil and gas sector who can fill those roles. About a third are set to retire by 2030, leaving the UK with a gap of 200,000 workers.A top barrier to installing heat pumps in homes is the lack of engineers with the skills to do the job, according to Nesta, an innovation charity.LinkedIn figures showed just one in eight UK workers had green skills, yet hiring for such roles is growing 30% more rapidly than the overall rate. An even smaller proportion of the youngest workers, who will make up about a third of the labor force by 2030, enter the jobs market with green skills.Sue Duke, head of global public policy at LinkedIn, said the government needs to start delivering large-scale training programs straight away, while businesses have to upskill new joiners and retrain existing workers.“Workers are coming out of education without any green skills, and they’re not getting exposed to green skilling in those early jobs in their career,” Duke said. “There’s a big awareness gap when it comes to acquiring those skills — only one in five know where to go to get these green skills, then there’s an availability of training challenge as well.”Housing is another area where Labour is high on ambitions and short on workers.The government vowed to fix Britain’s housing crisis by building about 300,000 homes every year over the next parliament term. That’s target that hasn’t been met by any government over the last 14 years. At most, builders delivered about 250,000 homes a year in recent times.Even at these subdued levels, the industry has been struggling to get enough builders.“It’s already the category with the fourth biggest tightening in hiring conditions despite the fact that job postings demand hasn’t been particularly strong,” said Jack Kennedy, economist at Indeed, who warned of looming wage pressures. “If that demand starts to take off, then clearly that that squeeze is only gonna exacerbate.”The UK’s construction workforce declined about 14% over the last five years to around 2.1 million in the first quarter of 2024. EU workers left after Brexit, while the number of domestic constructors, who make up the bulk of the workforce, fell by 300,000 over the last five years as many older workers retired early. The sector has also lost its appeal to younger staff who tend to drop out of generally low-paid apprenticeships, according to Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association.“New investment in skills and capacity will initially be needed just to get them back to where they were two to three years ago, before the government even thinks of 300,000 net additional homes per year or more,” Francis said.The government’s net zero target is only exacerbating shortages. In addition to delivering 1.5 million homes, more construction workers are needed to make existing homes more energy efficient, build infrastructure and decarbonize the energy network.“Most sectors are struggling for for labor, but it’s going to be highlighted in construction because of competing demands from housing and developing other technologies,” said Peter Wassell, technical director at Sedgwick, which handles insurance claims on behalf of other companies.","The UK is facing a supply crunch of builders, solar-panel installers and engineers.

"Who is Priscila Barbosa, Brazilian immigrant who made $10,000 a month defrauding rideshare apps",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/priscila-barbosa-brazilian-immigrant-uber-and-instacart/articleshow/111666866.cms,"Early days in US

A scheme of epic proportions

A web of deceit: The scheme unfolds

Legal consequences: The fall

In the annals of American dream-chasing, few stories are as dramatic or cautionary as that of Priscila Barbosa . Barbosa’s story began in Sorocaba, Brazil, an industrial city where she grew up as the eldest daughter of a hardworking family. Her parents, an electrician and a postal worker, invested in her education, providing English lessons and ballet classes.She studied IT, taught computer skills, and even ran a successful healthy meal delivery service, Fit Express, until Brazil’s recession hit hard. Desperate to support her family, Barbosa accepted a suggestion from an acquaintance to move to the US on a tourist visa and drive for Uber and Lyft.According to a Wired report, Barbosa's journey to the United States began on April 24, 2018, at New York's JFK International Airport. Standing just outside customs with two suitcases filled with clothes and Brazilian bikinis, she found herself in a predicament when her US contact, who had promised to help her settle and drive for Uber and Lyft, disappeared. With only an iPhone, $117, and no return ticket, Barbosa was determined to make her American dream a reality.As per the Wired report, Barbosa’s journey would eventually lead her to the center of a massive fraud conspiracy involving rideshare and delivery services. Alongside fellow Brazilian national Guilherme da Silveira and 17 other co-defendants, Barbosa was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. They had orchestrated a scheme to create fraudulent driver accounts using stolen identities, which they then rented or sold to unqualified drivers.Using the dark web and other sources, they obtained over 2,000 identities, bypassing stringent background checks required by companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. They exploited referral bonus programs and used ""bots"" and GPS spoofing technology to maximize earnings. According to the indictment, Barbosa's role in creating and managing these accounts was integral to the scheme's success, which netted her over $791,000.Barbosa, with da Silveira, used the stolen identities to create fraudulent driver accounts. They edited driver’s license images to match the photos of the drivers renting or buying the accounts, circumventing facial recognition technology. They advertised these accounts on WhatsApp, targeting Brazilian nationals living in the US, and managed the accounts by collecting rental payments and troubleshooting issues.The scheme was elaborate and far-reaching. They exploited referral bonus programs, used “bots” and GPS spoofing to inflate earnings, and managed to siphon off hundreds of thousands of dollars. The operation was so sophisticated that it exposed glaring vulnerabilities in the gig economy’s security measures, the Wired report said.In May 2021, Barbosa and her co-defendants were charged, and by April 2022, she and da Silveira had pleaded guilty. Barbosa was sentenced to three years in prison, three years of supervised release, and fined $20,000. Sixteen other defendants were arrested, with three still at large.For those who suspect they might be victims of this scheme, resources are available through the IRS and the US Department of Justice’s Victim Assistance Program.","Priscila Barbosa was sentenced to three years in prison, three years of supervised release, and fined $20,000.

Boeing begins flying 777X with FAA in path to certification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boeing-begins-flying-777x-with-faa-in-path-to-certification/articleshow/111724305.cms,"Boeing Co. has started conducting flight trials of its 777-9 aircraft with US regulators on board, achieving a milestone toward certifying its jumbo airliner after years of setbacks.The company announced that it took the initial test flight late Friday with Federal Aviation Administration personnel. Achieving so-called Type Inspection Authorization marks the start of certification flight testing, a key step in one of the most extensive commercial test efforts that Boeing has ever undertaken.“The certification flight test will continue validating the airplane’s safety, reliability and performance,” Boeing said in an emailed statement. “We appreciate our regulator’s rigorous oversight.”The FAA declined to comment on the certification effort, but noted that “safety always drives the timeline.” “Generally this kind of thorough process takes many months,” the regulator said in an emailed statement.The accomplishment, which was first reported by the Air Current, reinforces confidence in Boeing’s prediction that its hulking twin-engine jet is on track to enter the market in 2025 after years of delays. Boeing has logged around 480 orders for the 777-9, and two other planned models: the smaller 777-8 passenger jet and a freight-hauler.Boeing’s pilots have already racked up more than 3,500 flight hours over 1,200 test flights since the first 777X took to the air in January 2020. The planemaker has four dedicated aircraft that are being used to test every aspect of its safety and operations, ranging from stability and control to cabin noise.Touted as a more-efficient replacement to Boeing’s four-engine 737 jumbo jetliner and Airbus SE’s A380, the 777X has been in development for more than a decade and was originally slated to enter the market in 2020. The delays have frustrated customers such as Emirates, Qatar Airways and Deutsche Lufthansa AG, forcing them to refurbish and continue flying aging jetliners they’d intended to replace.The upgraded wide-body was caught up in the tougher regulatory scrutiny of Boeing’s products that followed two fatal crashes of its 737 Max jets in 2018 and 2019 that combined killed 346 people. The FAA and European regulators demanded extensive testing and redesign of several 777X components, including a critical avionics system and actuator-control electronics.The commercial entry of the final two Max models has also been delayed as the FAA required that the planemaker redo engineering studies and redesign an engine deicing system prone to failure in certain conditions.",Boeing's 777-9 aircraft takes its first test flight with US regulators on board. The milestone marks the start of certification flight testing for the jumbo jet.
