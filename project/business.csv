‘Idol of Ram Lalla ended India’s North-South divide’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/idol-of-ram-lalla-ended-indias-north-south-divide/articleshow/110047197.cms,"With his deep devotion and proficiency in his ancestral sculpting business, MBA-turned-master sculptor Arun Yogiraj , who has attained the status of a celebrity after giving shape to the Ram Lalla idol , talks about the uphill task, sacrifices he had to make to realise India’s dream and how it has helped bridge the North and South divide in an interview with TOI’s Ankur Tewari. Excerpts:





How has the perception of people and your family changed after Jan 22 ‘Pran Pratishtha’ ceremony? Do they treat you like God?

How has life changed? How have you taken all the accolades coming in?

While carving the most-awaited idol, did you experience added pressure due to the debate over the North-South divide ?

Today, devotees worldwide are thanking PM Narendra Modi for making Ram temple possible. What’s your take?

You recently shared with fans the photo of the second Ram Lalla idol. What was the idea behind carving another idol? Which stone was used and where will it be kept?

While carving out the idol, did you have any idea it would be the lucky one?

If given a chance, will you settle down in Ayodhya, the town which has given you so much fame?

Today, everyone is showering praise on Arun Yogiraj, the man behind Ram Lalla idol. Tell us something about those who worked behind the scenes — your family?

Which other projects are you working on?

They are giving me immense love and respect. Though my family is proud of my achievement, I am still the same Arun for them. But, when I venture out, it’s a different world. The amount of love I am getting from people is overwhelming... Their love for Ram Lalla and me is the same.I was lucky that Lord Ram chose me for His idol. I also want to thank my ancestors and parents for knowledge transfer.Due to them, the whole of India recognises me today and wants to see me, talk to me and embrace me. But I want to remain grounded and give back all the love to my family and fans.I gave special attention to detail to ensure that the idol did not reflect aesthetics that were typically South Indian as I wanted to encapsulate the whole of India in it. I had to make a lot of changes so that North Indian devotees don’t feel disconnected.... Now, it is interesting to see some people are finding a resemblance of Venkateswara Swami and others comparing the idol with that of Krishna’s in Gujarat and Mathura. This proves that the idol has ended all the divide. The only division today is geographical and different ways of life.Lord Ram has been re-seated in his grand temple in Ayodhya after five centuries. Generations of generations left with the same wish, but it was PM Modi who realised this dream. Today, the world is recognising Bharat’s global march as a spiritual and cultural powerhouse under PM Modi. The youth is also driven towards our culture and heritage and it’s only due to two legends — Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath . Great leadership I must say.When my idol got selected on Dec 29 last year, I was asked to stay in Ayodhya to coordinate the ‘vastra’ and ‘abhushan’ that Ram Lalla had to wear on the consecration day. Since I had no work, I carved the mini Ram Lalla from Krishna shila — the same stone from which the main idol was sculpted – out of fun. I later presented it to Champat Rai, general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra.Tell us something about the sublime eyes of Ram Lalla which took the world by storm?Aacharya Ganesh Shastri of Kashi had given me just a 20-minute ‘mahurat’ to carve the retina before taking a holy dip in the Saryu river and offering prayers at Hanuman Garhi and Kanak Bhawan in Ayodhya. My only thought at that moment was to ensure the eyes mesmerise the devotees as they would be seeing the idol from a distance of around 30ft. I think Lord Ram guided me. He wanted the divine eyes to be like this.I just concentrated on my work. I gave my best and God chose me. But it was a lot of pressure. I really burnt the midnight oil and left no stone unturned to give shape to Ram Lalla idol as the whole country was waiting with bated breath. While carving the idol, I had almost lost one of my eyes when a tiny piece of stone pierced the cornea. I was on antibiotics for weeks. A lot of sacrifices had to be made during the course of giving shape to the idol. First, I had to do a lot of homework. I went through around 1,000 images of Ram Lalla to ensure the best result. I followed all rituals every day, avoided sugar and spices to stay calm. Every day, it was taking a new shape, but the Lord guided me.I don’t think of all these things. But, if Lord Ram wants me to do his ‘sewa’, I will bow to his wish. However, I love Mysuru too.My wife has always supported me through thick and thin. It was difficult for her to stay away from me. At times, my kids fell ill but she did not inform me. I am blessed to have her as she is the one who has kept me composed. She has played a key role in Ram Lalla idol and all credit goes to her.No project will ever be bigger than Ram Lalla. Presently, I am busy completing backlog and will be able to take new projects later.","MBA-turned-master sculptor Arun Yogiraj has attained the status of a celebrity after giving shape to the Ram Lalla idol.

"When will Madurai, Trichy wake up?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-will-madurai-trichy-wake-up/articleshow/110047138.cms,"TRICHY/MADURAI: The recent mauling of a girl in Chennai by two rottweilers is yet to serve as a wake-up call for Trichy and Madurai which do not have regulations for rearing pet animals. Many foreign dog breeds considered as aggressive and ferocious are reared in these cities. Civic bodies are now waiting for the model code of conduct to be lifted to tighten rules.According to the animal husbandry department , Trichy district has 24,505 pet dogs and 20,988 stray dogs .Residents point out that some people take along even multiple pets for morning walks. “Most owners bring their pet dogs out with leash. But muzzles are needed as walkers and joggers are using the public space,” Shabbeer Hussain, a resident of KK Nagar, said.Madurai residents and animal activists have called upon the corporation to bring comprehensive rules for pet dog registration and hold a survey of the dog population. Corporation officials said that a resolution on dog ownership has been passed and rules are to be formulated into a bylaw after the general election.However, enforcement of existing rules remains lax with many residents unaware of the necessity of a licence. A senior veterinarian pointed out that licences are primarily used only by breeders, activists and trainers. Every year dog owners have to renew their dog registration with the corporation after paying the tariff based on the number of dogs they own.A pet licensing system would help the urban local body collect data on the number of pet dogs and breeds reared. Besides, the system would help the animal husbandry department to ensure anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) coverage for all pet dogs. In Trichy, the department has administered ARV to 11,554 pet dogs in 2023-24. Officials said that the licensing system will help differentiate between pet dogs and stray dogs.Madurai corporation plans to eact bylaws on pet ownership, including ban on straying of certain breeds in public places, mandatory registration and muzzling requirements while the pet is taken to the public places including parks. S Vasuki, zonal chairperson of Madurai East, rued the absence of a clear rule governing dog ownership. “Many adopt street dogs without understanding the responsibility involved. Some abandon pets when they pose a threat to public safety, such as biting incidents,” she added.“Licensing should be introduced initially for foreign breeds. For better regulation, breeding and sales of rare dog breeds should be brought under GST,” K M Karthik, Trichy-based animal volunteer, said. “We will introduce the pet dog licensing system by passing a resolution in the council. The process will take shape once the election model code of conduct is lifted,” Dr T Manivannan, city health officer, said.pup-rottweiler near Mattuthavani market.

Meet the foster moms who are opening their hearts and homes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meet-the-foster-moms-who-are-opening-their-hearts-and-homes/articleshow/110046567.cms,"It is one thing to

a child you have given birth to or adopted, and quite another to love and care for someone who may be with you for only a few months or years. This Mother’s Day, three foster carers talk to Neha Bhayana about why it’s important to take in

who would otherwise languish in a shelter or orphanage.

‘His parents are missing but till then I get the joy of raising him’

Leela Jedia | Has one foster child

‘We have raised five children. We can love one more’

Liji Thomas | Has 5 biological children and 1 foster child

‘I can never forget the day when my younger foster son called me aai’

Jyoti Patwardhan | Has two foster kids

This Mother’s Day is special for Leela Jedia.The Chittorgarh-based government school teacher had yearned to be a mother for years. Her wish came true on January 10 when she got six-year-old Rihaan* home from a local institution through a foster-care scheme. Rihaan’s biological parents have gone missing, so the district authorities had decided to place him with a foster family. States are slowly trying to deinstitutionalise care for children who are not eligible for adoption as it is considered better for the child’s development to live in a family set-up.Leela knows Rihaan may be taken away from her someday, but she is happy to be his mom till then. “If he is reunited with his parents, it will be good. But till then, I feel blessed to experience the joy of raising a child. He has completed our family. Hear him say ‘mamma’ is a beautiful feeling,” says the 55-yearold, adding that they will be happy to have him forever if his parents are not found.The Jedias had applied to adopt a child but they have been on the wait-list for years. When they learnt about kids who spend years in shelters because they are not eligible for adoption or are not getting adopted, they approached theFoster Care Society, Udaipur, for support.Now, when Leela returns from work every evening, Rihaan runs to open the door and the duo then spends the evening playing and doing homework. Rihaan knew very little compared to most six-year-olds, so Leela has been teaching him colours, the names of fruits and vegetables as well as basic manners like not making noise while chewing food. “I cook different subzis daily as I want him to develop a taste for all vegetables. He is not fond of sweets though, unless we get his favourite gulaab jamun,” she says.They have enrolled Rihaan in a reputed English-medium school and engaged a tuition teacher as well to help him reach on par with other kids in his class.Leela hopes to bring home one more child, ideally a girl, via adoption or foster care. “All couples who are financially stable should foster a child, even if they have biological children. Children who stay in orphanages have to move out when they turn 18. At that point, they have to suddenly face the world outside. When they are with a family, we educate them, teach them good values, and make them competent enough to live in the world,” she says. “Hum ek bache ki life bana sakte hai and khud bhi maa baap hone ka sukh pa sakte hai (we can make a child’s life better and also experience the joy of being parents.)”Most couples feel overwhelmed with the responsibility of even one or two children. But Kozhikode residents Liji and Bijo Thomas felt blessed to have five kids. In fact, when their eldest daughter — she is 25 and their youngest is 13 — got married and moved to Kanpur last year, Liji felt a void. Since they are not eligible to adopt as they already have biological children, they applied for foster care via the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) and brought a 12-year-old boy home in January after due procedures. Seventeen children have been placed in long-term foster care in Kozhikode so far.Sahil’s* parents were unable to care for him due to confidential reasons and had voluntarily put him in a government-run children’s home four years ago. They gave consent for placing him in foster care too. Liji is happy they got the opportunity to look after Sahil. “We have the experience and the resources which come from parenting five children so we thought why not take in one more child and let him also benefit from what we had learned over the years. A child growing up in an institution has very little chance of understanding how society or family functions. If you do not experience love when you are growing up, you will never be able to give love,” she says.While Liji works as a medical writer, Bijo is a software developer. They both work from home. When Sahil joined the family, they realised he did not know how to read or write and did not even understand basic concepts like right or left, front or back. Liji and Bijo started teaching him from scratch. Within three months, Sahil started to read Malayalam and has memorised four long poems and several songs. “Sahil’s papers had stated that he has an intellectual disability but I don't feel that’s the case. I feel he’s just been neglected,” says Liji. She is also training Sahil to conduct himself appropriately and encouraging him to participate in household chores like all their kids. “He is 12 but did not even know how to wear a belt, so we taught him. Now he can dress himself independently. He is learning something new every day and feels so proud of himself,” says Liji.Though the family does not celebrate Mother’s Day, Liji says she feels special daily, thanks to the love and hugs she receives from her children. “My kids are very affectionate. Sahil tends to be a little distant in comparison but whenever I praise him, he smiles widely. He loves it when I put my arm around him or give him a hug; he hugs back immediately and I can sense that he is happy,” she says.Liji wishes more families would volunteer to foster. “We see a lot of children who are neglected and sadly, we call them anti-social elements but it is not their fault. They have not been given the right direction. I feel if we all raise children to be people who are good and who do good, the world will be a richer place. That’s a small contribution we can make,” she says.Jyoti Patwardhan was nervous when she brought two boys, aged seven and nine years, to her home in 2020 via Maharashtra’s foster care programme. The consumer court judge, who is single, had always wanted a girl, so she didn’t know if she would feel love for the brothers who were offered to her and she was also concerned about the adjustment issues they may face. But all her doubts vanished on the first night itself. “While Vihaan* slept peacefully, the younger one Ved* tiptoed into my room and asked if he could sleep next to me. When I nodded, he crept into the bed, looked up with innocent eyes and asked if he could call me ‘aai’. I can never forget that moment. I was so touched. All my worries melted away and I knew I had made the right decision,” says the 50-year-old Akola resident.When Jyoti met the official handling their foster care arrangement a few weeks later, she got to know that while other kids at the shelter used to demand chocolates or toys, Ved always said “mujhe mummy chahiye” (I want a mother). The brothers had been put in the institution by their biological mother as she was unable to look after them.They recently became ‘legally free’ for adoption so Jyoti has applied to adopt them — a foster parent can seek to adopt the child after two years together. “My world is complete with my sons and my only aim is to raise them to be good men,” says Jyoti who has no plans to get married. She revealed that Vihaan hopes to join the military when he grows up — he is inspired by the photographs he has seen of Jyoti’s father who was a captain in the army and grandfather who was the first flight lieutenant of India.Jyoti is certain her sons will have a grand surprise planned for her on Mother’s Day. “They go out of their way to celebrate my birthday and Mother’s Day. They decorate the house, get a cake and buy me clips and earrings from the money collected in their piggy bank,” she says.*Names changed to protect identity.","This Mother's Day, three foster carers talk to Neha Bhayana about why it’s important to take in children who would otherwise languish in a shelter or orphanage.

HC allows medico to hold degree despite 'wrongly-gained admission',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-allows-medico-to-hold-degree-despite-wrongly-gained-admission/articleshow/110042941.cms,"MUMBAI: The Bombay HC held that a student wrongly gained admission in 2012 to an MBBS degree course in a top Mumbai college as an OBC on a non-creamy layer certificate based on false and suppression of information, but observing that doctors are needed, did not cancel her admission as she had completed the course.""In our country, where the ratio of doctors to population is very low'' withdrawing her qualification would ""be a national loss, as citizens would be deprived of one doctor,'' said a division bench of Justices A S Chandurkar and Jitendra Jain, noting at the same time that the ""unfair means"" by her parents to secure her admission as an OBC has ""deprived another eligible candidate''.""If the medical profession is based on a foundation of false information , it would certainly be a blot on the noble profession,'' the HC said, adding how no student should build their foundation on suppression of facts . But the HC wanted to strike a balance.It held that the Mumbai suburban collector was justified in 2013 in cancelling the non-creamy layer certificate issued to the student Lubna Mujawar as an OBC category candidate.The Lokmanya Tilak Medical College at Sion had then cancelled her admission to the MBBS course, in Feb 2014. But the HC said due to the passage of time and as she, based on interim orders that allowed her to study, completed her course in 2017, she should now be conferred with the degree. Under the interim orders which were in operation from Feb 2014 onwards, the petitioner has completed the course of MBBS and, therefore, it would not be proper at this stage to withdraw the qualification obtained by the petitioner more so when the petitioner has qualified as a doctor, the court said.The HC said the student gained admission on her father giving false information and not disclosing that the mother worked for the municipal corporation. The HC directed the student to now pay the fees as an open category student for the course, within three months, and also additionally pay the college Rs 50,000.In 2012, based on a petition seeking inquiry into OBC admissions in MBBS courses based on non-creamy layer certificate an inquiry was conducted against all students who had been admitted.The petitioner, Lubna Mujawar, said since her father had given her mother a talaq, he did not mention her income on the certificate. The MUHS said he falsely stated they were not staying together to avoid being hit by the Rs 4.5 lakh income limit for non-creamy status. Such practice would set a wrong precedent, argued MUHS counsel RV Govilkar and state's lawyer Abhay Patki."," Bombay HC held that a student wrongly gained admission to an MBBS degree course in a top Mumbai college as an OBC on a non-creamy layer certificate based on false and suppression of information.

DIFFERENT KEEPSAKE

Glittering lehengas, elaborate rituals, and sumptuous food. The wedding of Gujarat-based real estate developer Piyush Patel's twin daughters in February last year had it all. Yet, one absence loomed large: that of their mother Daxaben, who passed away months before the event due to a brain stroke. The void was hard to fill, but Patel was determined to plug it a little.He decided to commission an artist and give his daughters a surprise they'd remember the rest of their lives: a life-size hyper-realistic silicone model of their mother, adorned in a bright turquoise saree, real gold jewellery, and a warm smile.Seeing it, not just the daughters, but many other guests present cried, he recalls. ""It was like she was really there, blessing our daughters,"" he adds. From photographs to pooja rituals, Daxaben's model marked her presence at the wedding ceremony. It sits in their home even today, with fresh clothes and makeup, for occasions like birthdays, festivals, and more.Vadodara-based artist Vibha Patel, who made the statue, says she gets many requests to make silicone models for people who've lost near and dear ones, but they often back out after getting to know the cost. Such models typically cost around Rs 3-5 lakhs to make. While not everyone can afford a silicone model, people are finding different ways of keeping the memory of their late mothers alive. From rings made from strands of their hair that were preserved for years, to using technology to photoshop them into wedding albums, the modes adopted are many.Noida-based digital artist Divyanshu Garg, who goes by the name @ind_cyborg on Instagram, has received multiple such photoshop requests over the last few months. Earlier this year, he received one such request from Ami Kaur, who is from a Sikh family living in Thailand. Kaur's younger brother got married two years ago, but their mother was alive to only attend the engagement, and then succumbed to cancer. As his second marriage anniversary was approaching, Kaur decided to approach Garg to recreate a photograph of the wedding: one with their mother present in it. It was a surprise not only for her brother, but also their father, she adds. In the 'reaction' video uploaded on Garg's channel, there are plenty of tears and long hugs, as they hold the photo. ""For a person who has lost their mother, the grieving period is never over. But this really helps. We got many copies made,"" Kaur says.While photoshop technology helped Kaur and her family make their mother a part of a big day, some opt for live paintings of their late moms instead. In a reel that went viral in February, a California-based painter Kim-Vi Tran captured her journey of painting an Indian American bride's late mother into the surroundings. She also added a rainbow behind the late mother, ""to remind the couple that she was there, cheering them on,"" Tran wrote in her caption.Some rely on a different kind of technology. Delhi-based artist Preety Maggo started 'Magic of Memories' five years ago, which helps clients preserve a range of remnants - from strands of hair to even drops of blood, umbilical cords, and breastmilk in the form of jewellery. While she has been subjected to online trolling due to the nature of bodily elements involved - which some find 'odd' to preserve -Maggo has stayed the course. She makes jewellery that not only helps children remember their late mothers, but also mothers who've lost their newborns. ""I know what it means for people who have only these parts left as memories,"" she says.Just last week, Kolkata-based Dipika, herself a mother of two children, reached out to get pendants made with the last remaining strands of hair of her mother. She wanted to keep one for herself, and gift another to her brother, who is getting married later this month. The strands are designed in a manner that spells 'MOM'. Why hair? Dipika says there's a reason behind it. ""My mother loved her hair,"" she says. However, after undergoing a kidney transplant, she had a reaction to some of the medicines prescribed, and started losing her hair, leaving her with no option but to wear scarves. In December, she passed away after battling for her life. Through the pendants, Dipika says she not only wanted to preserve her memory, but also hold on to something that her mother loved a lot. As she waits for the shipments to arrive in order to surprise her brother, she cannot contain her excitement.As they say, there are as many ways to deal with grief as there are people.","People are finding different ways of keeping the memory of their late mothers alive.

Speaking at the event held at Bharat Mandapam, Jaishankar acknowledged arbitration as a fundamental aspect of modern dispute resolution .""We all do know it as an efficient and equitable method of resolving disputes and providing a streamlined alternative for what can often be very intricate judicial processes.So whether it is in domestic or international arenas, arbitration certainly inspires confidence, it fosters economic growth , and it upholds the rule of law,"" the EAM said.Jaishankar stressed the significance of arbitration in India, particularly during a period of rapid economic growth in a globalized context.

These initiatives, along with legal reforms such as the insolvency and bankruptcy code and amendments to financial laws, have contributed to creating a stable and positive business environment.Jaishankar emphasized the importance of strengthening dispute resolution mechanisms, including commercial courts and alternative dispute resolution, as they enhance investor confidence and reduce the burden on the judiciary. As the Foreign Minister, he acknowledged the significance of arbitration in facilitating international trade and investment by providing a stable and predictable dispute resolution mechanism.In a post on X, Jaishankar expressed his satisfaction in attending the launch of the Arbitration Bar of India, saying that ""'Arbitrate in India!' should be a natural accompaniment of @makeinindia as our economy grows and the nation globalizes.""

No bail to DHFL promoters seeking relief for spending half of maximum term in jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-bail-to-dhfl-promoters-seeking-relief-for-spending-half-of-maximum-term-in-jail/articleshow/110043042.cms,"MUMBAI: Refusing to grant bail to DHFL promoters Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawan, who sought the relief on the grounds that they had already spent more than half the maximum sentence of seven years in jail, a special PMLA court said the one year that the duo consumed in stalling their bail pleas had to be deducted from the computation of the time they had spent as undertrials.The brothers were arrested in 2020 in a money laundering case in which Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor and others are also accused.In Dec last year, Kapoor was granted bail in the case after the judge pointed out that he had spent more than the minimum punishment period of three years, without the framing of charges and a trial. In an 83-page order, the judge had cited a table chronicling 207 dates in the case, emphasising that Kapoor was not responsible for the delays.Section 436A of the Criminal Procedure Code allows the release of undertrial prisoners upon completion of half of the maximum jail sentence. In the case of the Wadhawans , the judge, though, said the section does not provide an absolute right of bail and it may be denied where the trial is delayed because of the accused.The judge said there cannot be any dispute that filing a bail plea is a constitutional right of any accused. ""...but certainly if such accused files bail application... and strategically keeps the same pending for uncertain period, ie for a long period of one year, can it be held that he is exercising his constitutional right of bail and such leisure on his part has lawful exemption under the explanation to Section 436A? Certainly, conduct of the accused itself is an answer to this question. In my opinion, this much period of one year has to be deducted while computation of period under Section 436A...,"" Special Judge M G Deshpande said.The judge further said when it was noticed that the accused kept the bail pleas under Section 436A strategically pending, causing impediment in the progress of the trial of other undertrial prisoners, co-accused Avinash Bhosale and Sanjay Chhabria, a noting was also made in the daily court recordings about how the lawyer would simply appear and not pursue the pleas.""It is only thereafter, arguments in these two applications began and finally concluded on March 26... Can it be said that both applicants are bona fide exercising their right under Section 436A...? Is it not a delay in proceeding caused by applicants... ?"" the judge said.The judge referred to the earlier bail pleas kept pending by the duo from 2022 till March 2023 when they were finally decided. The judge said after excluding this period, the remaining period does not qualify for bail.In October 2023, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 70.4 crore of erstwhile DHFL promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan as part of a money laundering investigation linked to an alleged bank loan fraud case.The attached assets were in the form of paintings and sculptures worth nearly Rs 28.6 crore, watches worth Rs 5 crore diamond jewellery worth over Rs 10.7 crore.",The brothers were arrested in 2020 in a money laundering case in which Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor and others are also accused.

TISS student moves HC against ‘arbitrary’ suspension for attending protest march,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tiss-student-moves-hc-against-arbitrary-suspension-for-attending-protest-march/articleshow/110043035.cms,"MUMBAI: Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) research scholar, Ramadas KS , has moved the Bombay High Court against the institute's suspension order. He was suspended for two years from the institute and debarred from entering all the four campuses, in an order passed last month. In his petition, Ramadas has appealed to the court to set aside the inquiry report of the institute's empowered committee and the revocation of the suspension order and restore his entitlements as a student.He said that he was 'unlawfully, arbitrarily and unfairly suspended by the institute'Ramadas has also asked for the withdrawal of the public notice issued by the institute on April 20, two days after the suspension order was passed. The public notice, stated the petition, was 'malicious' and 'defamatory' in nature and 'puts his life and academic pursuits under grave threat'. He also pointed out that his legitimate participation in student life and exercise of his constitutional rights has been deemed as 'anti-national' by the institute.The petition also seeks directions to the union ministry of social justice and empowerment to ensure the continuation and monthly disbursal of the national fellowship he was entitled to. In his petition, Ramadas mentioned that he did not receive the fellowship amount for April 2024, in pursuance of the suspension order. Ramadas has also set an interim stay on the suspension order and the continuation of the fellowship pending the hearing and the final disposal of the petition.UGC is also one of the respondents in the petition, as the guidelines for students' entitlements allows him freedom of thought and expression. The petition mentioned that he moved the court as the students' handbook of the institute does not provide details on the internal appeal process against an empowered committee's order. It also added that the public notice was issued by the highest authority and therefore, he would not get an independent or fair hearing in the appeal.The research scholar was suspended on April 18 based on the recommendations of the empowered committee. He was accused of participating in a protest march in New Delhi in January and also for urging people to watch the documentary 'Ram ke Naam' during the Pran Pratishthan.Ramadas, in his petition, claimed that he had attended the protest march in his personal capacity as a member of two students' organisations and that the march was to raise issues related to education, including the National Education Policy , fee hikes, employment guarantee, among others. He also stated that he had not organised any screening of the documentary but only posted a message in Malayalam urging people to watch the award-winning documentary. He claimed that the accusation that he had organised a screening was baseless and false.","Research scholar, Ramadas KS, has moved the Bombay High Court against the institute's suspension order.

From ghosts to 'orange turd': Highlights of Stormy Daniels' testimony against Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-ghosts-to-orange-turd-highlights-of-stormy-daniels-testimony-against-trump/articleshow/110037363.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a public spectacle in New York City, adult film actress Stormy Daniels took the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial , delivering testimony that veered into unexpected and bizarre territories. Daniels, a pivotal figure due to her alleged past with Trump, faced a barrage of questions that not only dealt with the core accusations but also strayed into the realms of the paranormal and the absurd.Trump, charged with 34 felony counts related to falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments, vehemently denies the allegations, including any encounter with Daniels.As she recounted her version of events, the courtroom was gripped by her detailed narrative, so much so that Trump’s legal team twice moved for a mistrial, citing the prejudicial nature of her testimony. Both motions were denied by Judge Juan Merchan.As per a Newsweek report, during her testimony, Daniels discussed an array of topics that seemed to stretch the bounds of relevance. The defense attempted to undermine her credibility by questioning her about her paranormal show, Spooky Babes, where she explores ghostly activities. Daniels admitted to profiting from her claims of communicating with the dead, attributing some mysterious happenings at her home to a possum rather than supernatural causes.The cross-examination took another odd turn when Daniels’ “Making America Horny Again” strip club tour was brought up. This tour, playing on Trump's famous slogan, was highlighted by the defense to suggest Daniels had monetized her alleged encounter with Trump. Daniels distanced herself from the tour's name, indicating she had no control over its branding across various venues, despite acknowledging some promotional posts on her social media.Further, Daniels' use of colorful language came under scrutiny when she was confronted about a social media post referring to the flushing of an ""orange turd."" Daniels clarified that the post was hyperbolic and, although not explicitly naming Trump, she conceded under pressure that it was indeed him she was referring to.The trial, with Daniels’ testimony, has not only illuminated the legal challenges Trump faces but also showcased the unusual and sensational elements that can emerge in such high-profile cases.","Adult film actress Stormy Daniels took the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial.

Any other developer who wants to move out of Azure, we will offer a full year of free cloud usage, as long as you don't return to Azure after that!"" he wrote on X and in a blog post on Ola.Krutrim, the AI unicorn founded by Aggarwal, has also opened up its cloud platform to enterprises, researchers, and developers for access to AI computing infrastructure, Krutrim's foundational models, and open-source models hosted on its platform. In January, Krutrim raised $50 million in a funding round led by Matrix Partners India. Aggarwal said the funding was at a valuation of over $1 billion. This makes it perhaps India's first unicorn in the pure AI space.Aggarwal's decision to leave Azure was triggered by a recent post on LinkedIn, where he criticized the use of the pronoun 'they' as an ""illness."" LinkedIn removed the post for violating its professional community policies. Aggarwal expressed his belief that the pronoun issue represents a ""woke political ideology of entitlement"" that does not belong in India. ""I wouldn't have entered this debate, but LinkedIn has assumed that Indians need to adopt pronouns in our lives, and that we can't criticize it. They will bully us into agreeing with them or cancel us. And if they can do this to me, I'm sure the average user stands no chance. As a founder and CEO, this western DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) system significantly impacts my business as it fosters an entitlement mindset in our professional lives, and I will fight it,"" he wrote on X.Aggarwal emphasized the importance of Indian tech platforms , expressing his concern that his life would be governed by western Big Tech monopolies, leading to cultural subsumption. He clarified that his stance is not against global tech companies, but rather against the imposition of forced ideology as a free-thinking Indian.To address this concern, Ola plans to collaborate with the Indian developer community to create a social media framework based on ONDC and UPI. ""The only 'community guidelines' should be Indian law. No corporate entity should be able to decide what will be banned.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

These aircraft, previously ferrying passengers across Asia, are set to become airborne nuclear command centers.The ""Doomsday"" planes, officially designated as E-4B ""Nightwatch,"" are designed to serve as command-and-control centers for the US military in scenarios such as nuclear wars, where ground facilities are compromised.The aircraft are equipped to host essential figures including the US president and the secretary of defense, allowing them to manage US forces globally from the air, a CNN report said.The transformation of these planes includes fortifying them against the effects of electromagnetic pulses, a type of energy burst from nuclear explosions that can severely damage electrical systems. According to the US Department of Homeland Security, such pulses threaten critical infrastructure on a large scale.Sierra Nevada, based in Colorado, confirmed the acquisition of the jets but declined to provide detailed comments. However, this purchase follows closely on the heels of a significant contract awarded to Sierra Nevada by the Air Force on April 26. Valued at $13 billion, this contract tasks the company with developing and producing the Survivable Airborne Operations Center by 2036, as outlined by a Defense Department announcement.""The development of this critical national security weapon system ensures the Department’s Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications capability is operationally relevant and secure for decades to come,"" said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek.The aircraft involved in this upgrade are the newer 747-800 models, which will replace the older 747-200 airframes that have been in service since the 1980s. The shift not only promises enhanced capabilities but also greater resilience for America's airborne military command structures.Korean Air's decision to sell these aircraft is part of its strategy to renew its fleet, with the transaction expected to be finalized by September 30, 2025. The airline had nine 747-800 passenger jets as of October last year.As part of its expansion and to accommodate this new project, Sierra Nevada has recently opened a large aircraft maintenance facility in Dayton, Ohio, and is in the process of building a second hangar of similar size.This move to modernize and secure the United States' airborne command capabilities marks a critical step in national defense, ensuring readiness and operational effectiveness in the face of evolving global threats.","Sierra Nevada Corporation has acquired five Boeing 747 aircraft from Korean Air to transform them into the next generation of US Air Force's strategic command and control planes.

This month, the Pentagon confirmed the inclusion of AeroVironment ’s Switchblade 600 drone as part of the first tranche of technologies under the Replicator project.Announced by Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks in August 2023, the initiative seeks to deploy thousands of unmanned aerial and surface vehicles within two years, a report in Asia Times said.The Switchblade 600 has demonstrated its effectiveness in Ukraine, targeting armored vehicles over distances exceeding 38 kilometers. Its success is pivotal as the Pentagon looks to quickly ramp up operational capabilities through leveraging commercial technology, supported by a significant budget allocation. This year alone, the initiative has secured about US$500 million, with a request for an equal amount for the next fiscal year.Beyond aerial drones, the initiative is expanding into maritime territories with the Production-Ready Inexpensive Maritime Expeditionary (PRIME) program. This effort aims to diversify the maritime drone vendor base and includes developing low-cost, highly autonomous unmanned boats capable of challenging tasks in strategic areas like the Taiwan Strait.Despite its ambitious scope, the Replicator program faces hurdles such as bureaucratic delays, cultural resistance within the military, and the rapid advancements of competing drone technologies by China. The initiative’s success is crucial as it seeks not only to enhance U.S. military readiness but also to maintain a strategic edge in the face of evolving global threats.","The Pentagon confirmed the inclusion of AeroVironment ’s Switchblade 600 drone as part of the first tranche of technologies under the Replicator project.

The IMF 's assessment came as its support team arrived in Pakistan on Friday to discuss a new bailout package under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), following Islamabad's request.The IMF staff report, issued earlier this month, stated that ""Pakistan's capacity to repay the fund is subject to significant risks and remains critically dependent on policy implementation and timely external financing."" The report further highlighted the exceptionally high risks that could jeopardize policy implementation and erode repayment capacity and debt sustainability, including delayed adoption of reforms, high public debt and gross financing needs, low gross reserves, the State Bank of Pakistan's net FX derivative position, a decline in inflows, and sociopolitical factors.The report emphasized that restoring external viability is crucial for ensuring Pakistan's capacity to repay the fund, which depends on strong policy implementation, including external asset accumulation and exchange rate flexibility. Geopolitical instability was also mentioned as an additional source of risk, despite some reduction in uncertainty surrounding global financial conditions since the last review.According to the IMF, Pakistan requires gross financing of USD 123 billion over the next five years, with the country expected to seek USD 21 billion in fiscal year 2024-25, USD 23 billion in 2025-26, USD 22 billion in 2026-27, USD 29 billion in 2027-28, and USD 28 billion in 2028-29.Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the IMF support team will discuss the first phase of the next long-term loan programme with Pakistan's financial team, focusing on data collection from various departments and discussions on the upcoming budget for the fiscal year 2025 (FY2025) with the Ministry of Finance officials. The team is expected to stay in Pakistan for over 10 days.Pakistan has decided to seek a rollover of around USD 12 billion in debt from key allies like China in the 2024-25 fiscal year to address the USD 23 billion gap in its external financing. The Finance Ministry insiders stated that USD 5 billion from Saudi Arabia, USD 3 billion from the UAE, and USD 4 billion from China will be rolled over, with estimates of further new financing from China to be included in the next financial year's budget.The country is expected to receive more than USD 1 billion from the IMF under the fresh loan programme, along with new financing from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. The federal government aims to achieve budget targets before the anticipated arrival of the IMF review mission in Pakistan, with negotiations for a new loan programme expected to commence in mid-May, ahead of the budget presentation in June.Despite narrowly avoiding default last summer and experiencing some economic stabilization, Pakistan continues to face high fiscal shortfalls and stagnating growth, with the external account deficit being controlled through import control mechanisms at the expense of economic growth, which is expected to be around 2 per cent this year compared to negative growth last year.","IMF has expressed serious concerns about Pakistan's ability to repay its debts, particularly to the global lender itself.

Moosa Zameer, Maldives minister of foreign affairs made the announcement on Saturday, putting an end to speculation surrounding the exact number of personnel repatriated from Maldives to India.The personnel, previously stationed in the Maldives to manage two helicopter platforms and a Dornier aircraft primarily used for medical evacuations, were repatriated by Friday, in line with the agreement reached between the two nations in February in New Delhi, setting a deadline of May 10.The agreement was prompted on the request of President Mohamed Muizzu , known for his pro-China stance, shortly after assuming office in November.Reports indicate that personnel withdrawal occurred in phases from various locations in the Maldives. Zameer mentioned that 26 soldiers left Gan between March 7 and March 9, followed by 25 from Hanimaadhoo between April 7 and April 9, and 12 from Kadhdhoo on a recent Tuesday, with the final batch of 13 withdrawing on Thursday.Earlier assertions by the Maldivian government suggested the presence of 89 Indian soldiers responsible for operating two military helicopters and a Dornier aircraft. Zameer clarified that civilian employees from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the manufacturer of the gifted helicopters, have replaced the military personnel.Addressing concerns raised regarding the possibility of military personnel remaining in civilian attire, Zameer dismissed such claims, stating that there was no deception involved and reiterated the Indian government's affirmation that the replacements are civilians. ""Indian military was not here under any deception, were they? So there is no reason for us to have doubts when the Government of India has stated that these are civilians"", he said.Minister of defence Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon confirmed the status of the replacements. ""The command and control of the aircraft are now officially under the Defence Ministry and Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF),"" Ghassan was quoted as saying by the Edition.mv.Relations between India and Maldives have undergone strain since Muizzu's assumption of office, despite the Maldives' historically close ties with India. During Zameer's recent visit to India, external affairs minister S Jaishankar emphasized the development of bilateral ties based on mutual interests and reciprocal sensitivity.The discussions between Jaishankar and Zameer covered various aspects of the India-Maldives partnership, focusing on fostering opportunities for future collaboration. The Maldives holds strategic significance for India in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), playing a vital role in initiatives such as 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and the 'Neighbourhood First Policy'.","Maldives announced that the 76 Indian military personnel in the country have been replaced with civilian employees of the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.

But for the convenience of both sides, we thought it might be okay for us to delay it a little bit’, further adding that discussions are being held for Muizzu's visit to Delhi very soon.Zameer highlighted the significance of economic cooperation with India for the Maldivian economy. He acknowledged the benefits derived from Indian assistance in the form of grants and debt relief, underscoring the importance of ongoing engagement between the two nations.Regarding Maldives' role as a key partner in the Indian Ocean region, Zameer reiterated the commitment to peace and security in collaboration with neighboring countries like India and Sri Lanka.Addressing concerns about Chinese vessel ports in Maldivian waters, he said, Regarding the port call for Chinese vessels, we issued personal rotation and friendly portable permits, and diplomatic clearances came from the Chinese side, which is very common in Maldives…But they didn't come for research in the Maldivian waters, we have not permitted the Chinese vessel for research in the Maldivian waters.""On derogatory remarks against India, Zameer said, ""If you have seen as you said, we have said that it's not the stand of the government or we believe that it shouldn't have been done. We are taking proper action to make sure that this doesn’t get repeated. There has been a misunderstanding, in social media. The governments of Maldives and India understand what has happened and we have passed that stage now.""Zameer's visit comes in the backdrop of recent discussions between India and Maldives centered on the orderly replacement of Indian military personnel stationed in Maldives.During his visit, foreign ministers of India and Maldives will engage in discussions regarding bilateral and regional matters, aiming to provide impetus to the strained diplomatic relationship.","Maldives foreign minister Moosa Zameer, who is currently on a visit to India, highlighted that President Mohamed Muizzu’s decision to visit China before India was based on convenience.

An Assistant Minister ranked official, Xu, 60, appointed by Chinese President Xi Jinping for the sensitive job, said he regards his posting in New Delhi as an ""honourable mission and a sacred duty"" to improve and advance the bilateral ties.""It is an honourable mission and a sacred duty. I will do my best to deepen understanding and friendship between the two peoples, expand exchanges and cooperation in various fields, and improve and advance the bilateral relationship ,"" Xu told PTI and China's state-run CGTN-TV in a media interaction here before leaving for New Delhi to take up his posting.""China is ready to work with India to accommodate each other's concerns, find a mutually acceptable solution to specific issues through dialogue at an early date, and turn the page as soon as possible,"" Xu said without elaborating further.Xu previously served as China's Ambassador to Afghanistan and Romania, besides senior cadre-level postings in the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).He succeeds veteran Chinese diplomat Sun Weidong, who completed his tenure in October 2022.

I think they’re lovely.”“I think they’re cute,” said another.A third quipped, “Well that’s an extreme way to get your dogs cared for while you’re at work lol.”While these panda dogs captured some netizens heart, certain visitors accused the sanctuary of animal cruelty.Although resembling giant pandas, some observers noticed peculiar behavior, including head shaking, prompting widespread outrage when visitors discovered they were observing chow-chow dogs instead of pandas.Nevertheless, the zoo defended its choice to exhibit painted dogs instead of pandas, asserting that the dye used on the chow-chow dogs was non-harmful and consisted of non-toxic substances.An employee at the zoo informed a local news outlet, Jiangsu News, that the initiative was aimed at increasing visitor numbers and enhancing the enjoyment of the zoo experience. He explained that the zoo had not yet introduced actual pandas due to space constraints, as the facility was too small to accommodate a giant panda enclosure.In 2016, Singapore's Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) investigated a similar case involving three chow chows in the country that were dyed to resemble pandas. The owner had started a service renting out the pure-bred dogs for photo shoots but denied any cruelty. AVA stated at the time that it was examining the situation to ensure animal welfare was not compromised, but also noted that the use of safe, non-toxic food dyes was unlikely to harm the dogs, reported The Strait Times.",Two dogs with panda-like coats confused netizens when the video of a zoo in China went viral online on May 1.

The UNGA hall broke into an applause after the vote was cast.The resolution determined that ""the State of Palestine is qualified for membership in the United Nations"" in accordance with Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations and ""should therefore be admitted to membership in the United Nations"".It recommended that the Security Council ""reconsider the matter favourably, in the light of this determination"".India was the first non-Arab State to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organisation as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in 1974. India was also one of the first countries to recognise the State of Palestine in 1988 and in 1996, Delhi opened its Representative Office to the Palestine Authority in Gaza, which was later shifted to Ramallah in 2003.Earlier this month, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Ruchira Kamboj had said that while Palestine's application for membership at the UN was not approved by the Security Council because of the veto in the UNSC, ""I would like to state here at the very outset that in keeping with India's long-standing position, we hope that this would be reconsidered in due course and that Palestine's endeavour to become a member of the United Nations will get endorsed"".An annex to the resolution said that the additional rights and privileges of participation of the State of Palestine will be effective as of the 79th session of the General Assembly that begins in September this year.These include the right to be seated among member states in alphabetical order; the right to make statements on behalf of a group, including among representatives of major groups; the right of members of the delegation of the State of Palestine to be elected as officers in the plenary and the Main Committees of the General Assembly and the right to full and effective participation in UN conferences and international conferences and meetings convened under the auspices of the General Assembly.Palestine, in its capacity as an observer state, does not have the right to vote in the General Assembly or to put forward its candidature to UN organs.In April, Palestine had sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres requesting that its application for full UN membership be considered again. For a state to be granted full UN membership, its application must be approved both by the Security Council and the General Assembly, where a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting is required for the state to be admitted as a full member.Last month, the US had vetoed a resolution in the Security Council on the Palestinian bid to be granted full membership of the United Nations. The 15-nation Council had voted on a draft resolution that would have recommended to the 193-member UN General Assembly ""that the State of Palestine be admitted to membership in the United Nations"".The resolution got 12 votes in its favour, with Switzerland and the UK abstaining and the US casting its veto. To be adopted, the draft resolution required at least nine Council members voting in its favour, with no vetoes by any of its five permanent members - China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and United States.Currently, Palestine is a ""non-member observer state"" at the UN, a status granted to it by the General Assembly in 2012. This status allows Palestine to participate in proceedings of the world body but it cannot vote on resolutions. The only other non-member observer state at the UN is the Holy See, representing the Vatican.","The 193-member General Assembly met in the morning for an emergency special session.
