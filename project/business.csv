Global agreement reached to eliminate hazardous pesticide chlorpyrifos with exemptions for India and other countries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/global-agreement-reached-to-eliminate-hazardous-pesticide-chlorpyrifos-with-exemptions-for-india-and-other-countries/articleshow/120863171.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a significant decision, countries across the globe on Saturday struck a major deal to eliminate the use of one of the most hazardous pesticides , Chlorpyrifos, with certain exemptions, under the Stockholm Convention at the ongoing meet in Geneva.India, which opposed its complete elimination at this stage, will continue to use it for another five years as per its registered uses for 12 crops, including rice, wheat, gram, sugarcane, beans, cotton, mustard, brinjal, onion, apple, barley, and groundnut, to deal with certain pests and termites.Over 40 countries, including all 27 European Union (EU) nations, the UK, and the US, have already banned the use of Chlorpyrifos on food crops. India, during the negotiation, pitched for exemptions, arguing the need for its use in certain crops in the absence of alternatives. The country, along with other nations, including Russia, Kenya, Zambia, and Costa Rica, also favoured exemptions for ensuring food security .Though India and many countries will continue to use it for select exempted purposes in the cultivation of certain crops while dealing with pests, the decision will ultimately push the users to look for alternatives in the final goal of complete elimination of the use of Chlorpyrifos, a highly toxic organophosphate pesticide with harmful effects on health and the environment.The decision was taken at the ongoing Conference of the Parties (COPs) to the Basel, Rotterdam, and Stockholm (BRS) Convention in Geneva, being held to galvanise global efforts to manage hazardous chemicals and waste in an environmentally sound manner.Experts who have been tracking the development at the Convention welcome the listing of Chlorpyrifos in Annex A (meant for elimination) of the Convention but expressed their concerns at the long list of exemptions.“The world can no longer turn a blind eye to the overwhelming scientific evidence on Chlorpyrifos. Its global elimination is a critical step toward safeguarding public health, environmental integrity, and the rights of future generations,” said Dileep Kumar of the Pesticide Action Network (PAN) India.""We support a broad spectrum evaluation and speeding up the separation of highly hazardous chemicals for elimination. The survival of life, including biodiversity, is at stake. Also, national govts have to take up their own independent physico-chemical and ecotoxicological evaluation to propose such chemicals for elimination,” said Narasimha Reddy Donthi, a public policy expert.The specific exemptions allowed under the decision include 18 crop-pest complexes (rice, maize, wheat, sugarcane, onion, peanut, barley, cabbage, chickpea, cotton, pineapple, and rapeseed, among others); control of leaf-cutting ants for agricultural use; control of locusts; control of ticks in cattle; and wood preservation against borers and termites in building foundations.","India, which opposed its complete elimination at this stage, will continue to use it for another five years as per its registered uses for 12 crops. Over 40 countries, including all 27 European Union (EU) nations, the UK, and the US, have already banned the use of Chlorpyrifos on food crops.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120863183,imgsize-924494,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-27.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a retaliatory move, Pakistan has shut its ports for ships coming from India after the latter banned imports from the neighbouring nation in another economic crackdown after the Pahalgam terror attack.""In view of the recent development of maritime situation with neighbouring country, Pakistan in order to safeguard maritime sovereignty, economic interest and national security enforces following measures with immediate effect: Indian flag carriers shall not be allowed to visit any Pakistani port, Pakistani flag carriers shall not visit any Indian port (and) any exemption or dispensation shall be examined and decided on case to case basis,"" Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported quoting its ministry of maritime affairs' ports and shipping wing.India has imposed a complete ban on imports of all goods from Pakistan, citing national security and public policy concerns, according to an official order. While a 200% import duty following the 2019 Pulwama attack had already curtailed direct trade, the new restrictions also block Pakistani goods arriving via third countries.The move comes just over a week after India rolled out a series of punitive measures against Pakistan—including suspending the Indus Waters Treaty , closing the Attari land border crossing, and downgrading diplomatic ties—in response to the recent terror attack.Relations between India and Pakistan plunged after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people, most of them tourists. In response to the escalating tensions, India imposed fresh punitive measures, including the immediate suspension of mail and parcel exchanges with Pakistan by both air and land routes.","Pakistan has shut its ports for ships coming from India after the latter banned imports from the neighbouring nation.

"Courtrooms have winners & losers, but mediation's healing: CJI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/courtrooms-have-winners-losers-but-mediations-healing-cji/articleshow/120861373.cms,"NEW DELHI: CJI Sanjiv Khanna on Saturday said courtroom adjudication is grim and shallow, as it results in a winner and a loser - a process that fails to heal strained relationships between parties. He contrasted this with mediation, which, he said, seeks to provide a holistic solution that restores relationships.Speaking at the first National Mediation Conference inaugurated by President Droupadi Murmu, CJI Khanna said ' community mediation ' provision in the Mediation Act, 2023 is salutary as this can be an effective tool to resolve disputes that are likely to affect peace, harmony and tranquility among residents or families in a specific area or locality.

In this way, courtroom litigation and adjudication are grim and shallow. At times, the root cause remains unaddressed, and the ailment and pain remain. The relationships are strained, if not broken.

It does not involve legal and procedural complexities. It is flexible and personalised, not bound by rigid procedure. And above all, it is empathetic - aiming not to win over the other side, but to bring together.""Mediator's neutrality is crucial to achieve resolution of a dispute, said Justrice Khanna, adding that ""a skilled mediator senses not only what is being said, but what lies beneath the words.""","CJI Sanjiv Khanna said courtroom adjudication is grim and shallow.

Pahalgam attack aftermath: Long leaves cancelled at ordnance factories,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-attack-aftermath-long-leaves-cancelled-at-ordnance-factories/articleshow/120858421.cms,"AI generated image

Poll Do you support the cancellation of long leaves for employees in defense manufacturing during times of national security tensions? No, it affects employee well-being. Yes, it's necessary for national security.

‘Cancellation of leaves aimed at accelerating defence production’



NAGPUR/JABALPUR/KOLKATA: Amid surging tensions with Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack , Munitions India Limited (MIL), agglomerate of the 12 ordnance factories across the country, has cancelled long leaves of its employees at most plants, sources told TOI on Friday. No leave beyond two days is permitted for the next two months.Senior management sources, including those on the board, denied the directive had anything to do with the post-April 22 tension. The official reason - from Ordnance Factory Chandrapur to Jabalpur - is that they have missed production targets for April and are catching up. Officials at Chandrapur cited pressure of global export orders.MIL said it put its employees on ""alert mode"" after the Pahalgam attack. ""If there is urgency to expedite our production, we should be able to do it... But there is no official decision to cancel leave of employees across the 12 factories,"" a senior MIL official told TOI.On condition of anonymity, an official at Jabalpur’s Ordnance Factory-Khamaria said the order was issued “in view of national security”. An official at Ordnance Factory-Itarsi echoed this.In case of emergency, employees can apply to the “appropriate authorities”, says the order issued Thursday.At Gun & Shell Factory-Cossipore in Bengal, an employee confirmed that an order had been issued on Friday, cancelling leaves in the “current scenario”. An officer in Kolkata refused to confirm or deny the development but said it would be “logical if leaves were cancelled given the current situation”.Leaves of all employees of Badmal Ordnance Factory in Balangir, Odisha, have also been cancelled for 60 days. There is, however, no such order at OF-Bhandara (Maharashtra) under MIL, which manufactures powerful explosives RDX and HMX.A senior official from the Department of Defence Production, under which the ordnance factories come, told TOI, “We have not issued any official circular in this regard to ordnance factories. But some PSUs have internally instructed their employees to avoid going on leave due to the current scenario.”Mukesh Singh, president of Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMS), one of the largest unions of the ordnance factories, told TOI, “We have come to know from our employees working in MIL that their leave has been cancelled. However, we have not got any official communication from the company as yet.”The Pune-headquartered MIL is the main ammunition manufacturing company under ministry of defence. The 12 units under it produce the Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launcher, IAF bombs, armour-piercing tank ammunition, high-explosive tank ammo and artillery shells, plus infantry weapons like 81mm and 51mm mortar bombs, and hand grenades (including a multi-mode type that can be switched between offensive and defensive modes). They also produce 5.56mm, 7.62mm and 9mm bullets for the full range of firearms used by infantry.At OFK and OF-Chandrapur, all 7,000 employees have been told no extended leaves will be allowed, and those sanctioned stand cancelled. The same held for OF-Itarsi.OFK is one of the largest ammunition manufacturers for the military. In the Balakot air strike, 1000-pound bombs made at OFK were used by IAF to pound locations across the LoC. And during the Kargil War, OFK supplied the fuzes for Bofors shells that smashed Pakistani positions atop mountain tops.Leaves have not been cancelled at non-MIL ordnance factories — like the five in Kanpur and Jabalpur-based Gun Carriage Factory, which manufactures the Dhanush 155mm artillery guns.A senior officer of Ordnance Factory Chandrapur (OFC) said cancellation of leaves is aimed at accelerating production. Apart from orders from Indian armed forces, MIL — a defence PSU carved out of erstwhile Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) — is also sitting on a huge export order, said sources.","MIL, agglomerate of the 12 ordnance factories across the country, has cancelled long leaves of its employees at most plants.

NEW DELHI: An FIR has been registered against renowned singer Sonu Nigam following allegations of disrespectful comments about the Kannadiga community during a musical programme in Bengaluru.The complaint was initiated by Dharmaraj A, who heads the Bengaluru city district unit of Karnataka rakshana vedike , an organisation advocating for Kannada interests.The allegations claimed that Sonu Nigam made ""objectionable and emotionally provocative"" remarks that offended the Kannadiga community's sensibilities and fostered discord amongst various linguistic groups in Karnataka.The official complaint stated, ""This complaint is lodged against the renowned singer Shri Sonu Nigam for making objectionable and emotionally provocative statements during a musical event held on April 25 and 26, at East Point College of Engineering and Technology, Virgonagar, Bengaluru, which falls under your police station's jurisdiction. His statements have deeply hurt the sentiments of the Kannadiga community, incited hatred among various linguistic communities in Karnataka, and are likely to provoke violence. A video of Shri Sonu Nigam's statement has gone viral, causing widespread outrage among millions of Kannadigas across the state.""The event took place while the singer was performing at East Point College of Engineering and Technology in Virgonagar, Bengaluru, on April 25. When a fan persistently requested him to perform a Kannada song, Sonu refused, stating that the fan was making demands in an aggressive manner. He then stated, ""Yahi kaaran hai, Pahalgam mein jo hua hai na. Yahi kaaran hai jo kar rahe ho, jo kiya tha na abhi. Dekho toh kaun saamne khada hai."" The response drew severe backlash from not just the Kannadiga community but also from public across India, who spoke against making the comparison.Police officials have registered the case under Sections 351(2), 352(I), and 353 of the Indian Penal Code and have commenced their investigation.The controversial remarks were delivered during a stage performance and were recorded on video, which subsequently spread across social media platforms, triggering significant backlash from Karnataka residents.","FIR has been registered against renowned singer Sonu Nigam.

US approves HawkEye 360 sale to boost India’s surveillance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-approves-hawkeye-360-sale-to-boost-indias-surveillance/articleshow/120859058.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move to boost New Delhi’s surveillance power amid heightened military tension, the US state department has approved the sale of HawkEye 360 technology to India, which will help the country gain maritime domain awareness in the Indo-Pacific, aided by a growing constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit.The proposed sale, the state department statement said, “will improve India's capabilities to meet current and future threats by bolstering its maritime domain awareness, analytical abilities and strategic posture”.A US Defence Security Cooperation Agency statement said New Delhi requested purchase of the SeaVision software, including its preferred software enhancements, training as a technical assistance field team, remote software, analytic support, documents, and other logistics and programme support elements. The estimated total cost is $131 million. “The principal contractor will be Hawkeye360, located in Herndon, Virginia,” the statement said.HawkEye 360, an American geospatial analytics private company, collects and analyses radio frequency (RF) signal location with a constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit. These satellites detect and geolocate radio frequency (RF) emissions. They track communication signals from ships, aircraft, vehicles, and coastal systems. Some vessels, which ‘go dark’ to roam undetected in disputed areas and evade tracking after turning off their Automatic Identification System (AIS), can also be detected with this advanced technology.Indian forces can now identify illegal fishing, smuggling and perform effective surveillance in the Indian Ocean Region with the help of this technology.With this technology, India gains deeper visibility across its Exclusive Economic Zone. Currently, the Indian Navy uses P8i reconnaissance aircraft and Sea Guardian drones to monitor strategic locations and detect vessels keeping their AIS switched off.The Hawkeye 360 system uses Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as additional layers. Each layer improves detection, verification and classification of threats. EO satellites capture high-resolution daytime imagery; infrared sensors identify thermal emissions from engines and exhausts; and SAR satellites capture radar-based images regardless of weather and time. This layer confirms ship size, speed, and location. The system combines speed, precision, and adaptability and works continuously across all weather and time conditions.“The proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the US by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defence partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions,” the US statement said.","The HawkEye 360 system uses Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as additional layers.

Focus on security and intelligence operations Implement economic and diplomatic measures

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday announced a series of sweeping punitive measures against Pakistan, halting all imports, suspending mail services, and denying port access to Pakistani vessels with immediate effect.The move marks a sharp escalation following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people, most of them tourists.A notification issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) on May 2, and now incorporated into the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023, states: “Direct or indirect import or transit of all goods originating in or exported from Pakistan, whether or not freely importable or otherwise permitted, shall be prohibited with immediate effect, until further orders.” Any exemptions will require explicit government approval.The Department of Posts has simultaneously suspended the exchange of all categories of mail and parcels from Pakistan via air and land routes. A government official said this suspension is in response to ""cross-border linkages"" identified in the Pahalgam strike and vowed “severe punishment to those involved in the attack.”India has also barred ships bearing the Pakistani flag from docking at any Indian port. The directive, issued in the interest of national security, also prohibits Indian-flagged vessels from visiting Pakistani ports. “This order is issued to ensure safety of Indian assets, cargo and connected infrastructure, in public interest and for interest of Indian shipping,” the notification reads.Trade data reveals limited bilateral exchange in recent years. From April 2024 to January 2025, India imported just $2.88 million worth of goods from Pakistan—mainly fruits, nuts, oilseeds, and medicinal plants—while exports stood at $1.18 billion, dominated by organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Previous years saw similar trends, with 2022–23 exports at $627.1 million and imports at $20.11 million.Other major Indian exports to Pakistan have included sugar, cereals, vegetables, tea, petroleum products, fertilisers, and auto parts.",The move marks a sharp escalation following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam.

No, they need improvement Yes, very efficient

NEW DELHI: The Army is going in for the procurement of another lot of man-portable air defence missile systems , which can intercept and destroy hostile fighter jets, aircraft, drones and helicopters at ranges up to 6-km, amid the ongoing tensions with Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror massacre.The defence ministry-Army on Friday issued the tender or RFP (request for proposal) for 48 launchers, 48 night-vision sights, 85 missiles and a missile test station of the very short-range air defence system-new generation ( VSHORADS-NG ). Vendors have been told to submit their bids by May 20.""The fire-and-forget VSHORADS-NG, based on infra-red homing technology, are needed by Army to meet the evolving dynamic air threat. There are major shortages in such man-portable systems for terminal and point defence against all types of aerial threats,"" an officer said.The RFP said the all-weather air defence system, which should have anti-jamming characteristics and be capable of being para-dropped, will be employed across all kinds of terrain, ranging from plains and deserts to high-altitude areas of around 4,500-metres.The indigenous VSHORADS being developed by DRDO is still not ready for production and induction, with the latest set of trials being conducted in Feb this year. Consequently, the Army and IAF had earlier also inducted a limited number of such systems under emergency provisions due to the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh with China.They included the Russian Igla-S man-portable air defence systems, assembled in India by Adani Defence. While the Army and IAF have the old Igla-1M systems since 1989, the shoulder-fired Igla-S is an improved variant with a longer interception range of up to 6-km.Now, the tense situation with Pakistan seems to have triggered a fresh round of procurements. A tri-Service case for acquisition of 5,175 VSHORADS and associated equipment was initiated way back in June 2009, which eventually led to the Igla-S system being selected over the French and Swedish systems in the fray. But the major project, which was to include an initial off-the-shelf purchase followed by technology transfer to Bharat Dynamics for subsequent production, did not take off.In Jan 2023, the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council had accorded ""acceptance of necessity"" for procurement of the infrared-homing VSHORADS missiles under design and development by DRDO at a cost of Rs 1,920 crore, as was then reported by TOI","The defence ministry-Army on Friday issued the tender or RFP for 48 launchers, 48 night-vision sights, 85 missiles and a missile test station.

‘Move doesn’t reflect desire for justice, but is diversionary ploy’



Poll Do you believe that Pakistan's proposal for a 'neutral' probe is genuine? No, it is a deception Yes, it is genuine

NEW DELHI: India has rejected Pakistan's proposal for a ""neutral"" probe into the mass killings at Pahalgam by dismissing it as a deception meant to distract attention from Islamabad's complicity in the slaughter of innocent tourists. ""They are pursuing their familiar playbook of deception and duplicity.The term 'neutral' is nothing but a loaded euphemism for the blatant lie that those making the offer were not complicit in the carnage. They are trying to pull the wool over the world's eyes,"" an official told TOI.It does not reflect a desire for justice, but is a diversionary ploy. They are trying to deflect international attention, evade scrutiny and accountability and undermine India’s right to defend its sovereignty and security.”Another source said, “Neutrality in investigation implies a dispute over facts, but here the facts about the identity of the perpetrators and their masterminds are incontrovertible and consistent with the pattern of use of terror gangs as an instrument of proxy war. It is the Pakistani state itself that has been using terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e Mohammad to further its objectives.” Pakistan’s PM Shehbaz Sharif first spoke of “a credible and neutral probe”, and found endorsement from China. Then, US secretary of state Marco Rubio last week asked India to work together with Pakistan, raising eyebrows here.“The focus must not be merely on individual perpetrators but on the Pakistani state that has enabled, equipped and exported terrorism. It is time for the international community to hold Pakistan accountable for not just the Pahalgam killings but also for raising and sustaining a terror infrastructure that has been responsible for killings in different countries. Falling for Pakistan’s neutrality rhetoric is a betrayal of justice for the victims of Pahalgam but also of victims of all the terror attacks that have been traced to Pakistan,” said a source, pointing to the arrests of Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh, one of the plotters of the 9/11 attack, in Pakistan.India’s contempt for the idea of an allegedly neutral probe is rooted in the bitter experience it has had with Pakistan over the decades. Sources pointed out that Islamabad had denied any link to the 26/11 assault on Mumbai until investigation forced them to acknowledge Ajmal Kasab’s Pakistani citizenship. India agreed to a joint probe into the attack on the Pathankot airbase only to realise that Pakistan used the mechanism to stall the investigation and protect the perpetrators.“Blaming the alleged non-state actors for the terror attacks they organise is a tactic which has no takers now.

Somewhat concerned Very concerned

NEW DELHI: Days before the Pahalgam massacre, terror chatter picked up from across the border indicated terrorists' plans to hit tourist places in J&K, particularly hotels on outskirts of Srinagar, more specifically areas like Dachigam, etc, senior officials following the investigations told TOI on Saturday.J&K Police sources, however, insisted that while intelligence was available on likely terror plans to target tourists and hotels, it was generic in nature, also naming non-local migrant labourers, Hindu pilgrims and Kashmiri pandits as potential targets and several areas like Kulgam, Pulwama, etc, as ""vulnerable spots"". There was no mention of Baisaran, which had no history of terror activity or attacks, in these inputs. The intelligence was followed up, with J&K Police brass camping in Srinagar to ensure that security at several prominent tourist places and hotels was tightened.Sources said the two local terrorists - Adil Thoker and Asif Sheikh - in the Pahalgam attack team had blended in with the tourists before herding them into the food stalls area, making it easier for the male victims to be segregated. They added that the entry and exit to Baisaran, which is open round the year barring periods of heavy snowfall and Amarnath Yatra - is ticketed and a fence installed since a tender to manage it for three years was awarded to a Bijbehara businessman last year.The outskirts of Srinagar in the foothills of Zabarwan range were seen as prone to attacks as a group of Pakistani terrorists linked to two attacks in Oct 2024 - at Gagangir, in which six non-local labourers and a doctor were killed, and at Buta Pathri, which left two Army personnel and two Army porters dead - was supposedly active there. Investigations so far suggest that Hashim Musa, the Pakistani assailant in Pahalgam also involved in Gagangir and Buta Pathri attacks, was in Tral along with another Pakistani and two local terrorists, days before they struck in Baisaran.An officer said agencies have looked into the possibility of terrorists having initially planned to strike during PM Modi's April 19 visit to J&K to flag off a train service between Katra and Srinagar. The motive of the terrorists, backed by Pakistan's ISI, could have been to divert attention from the major rail infrastructure upgrade, a source said adding that when the PM's visit was called due to bad weather, the terrorists, who were possibly hiding in Tral by then, waited until April 22 to execute the attack.A second police officer said the terrorists chose to hit tourists to demolish the 'normalcy' narrative, with the record tourist arrivals in the Valley being cited as a barometer of normalcy. Overground support, another functionary said, was a reality with three of every 10 OGWs being hardcore, ideologically committed cadre. Hitting the other seven, who may be working for some quick money, by having their houses demolished may be counter-productive as they also double up as intelligence assets, it was stressed. The houses of nearly nine OGWs in J&K were demolished in the wake of Pahalgam attack; the Omar Abdullah govt is said to have requested the Centre to exercise caution.Officials on Saturday flagged use and recovery of sophisticated weapons - suspected to be left behind by NATO troops in Afghanistan - in Kashmir.","Terror chatter picked up from across the border indicated terrorists' plans to hit tourist places in J&K.

NEW DELHI: In a significant escalation of economic offensive in the wake of the Pahalgam attack , govt on Saturday moved to choke trade flows from Pakistan by imposing a blanket ban on all shipments - direct or routed through third countries, as well as mails and parcels from its hostile neighbour.It also barred Pakistan-flagged ships from entering Indian ports and prohibited Indian vessels from docking in Pakistan, signalling a hardening stance amid deteriorating bilateral ties.""This comprehensive ban, including indirect imports, will enable custom authorities to prevent Pakistani goods from entering India through circumvention,"" an official told TOI. This is the second major non-military offensive after visa restrictions were announced.While direct trade is relatively low, third-party trade is estimated to be in multiples of direct trade between the two countries. Govt’s decision to impose 200% tariff on Pakistani imports and withdrawal of MFN (most favoured nation) status after the Pulwama attack has resulted in more consignments flowing through other countries as direct imports from Pakistan crashed from nearly $500 million in 2018-19 to $480,000 in 2023-24. Horticulture produce, cement, salt and cotton yarn were the most affected products, sources said.Even before this, considerable amounts of goods were entering from Pakistan via third countries. After 2019, these flows increased, particularly through UAE and Sri Lanka, possibly by misusing trade agreements — an issue that Indian authorities failed to adequately monitor.A lot of Pakistani fruits, dry dates, leather and textiles are repackaged and relabelled in UAE, while chemicals and specialty products are routed through Singapore. Indonesia is said to be the transit route for cement, soda ash and raw materials used by the textiles sector. Similarly, dry fruits, salt and leather goods are reprocessed and routed through Sri Lanka using SAFTA benefits.

NEW DELHI: In a first of its kind initiative, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR ) - India's premier agri research organisation - has developed the country's first genome-edited climate-resilient varieties of rice to boost yields and conserve water.The ICAR claimed that the cultivation of these improved rice varieties -- ‘ DRR Dhan 100 (Kamala)’ and ‘ Pusa DST Rice 1 ’ -- in about 5 million hectares of the recommended area will produce 4.5 million tons of additional paddy and save a minimum 7,500 million cubic meters of irrigation water. Besides, it will also reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (32,000 tons).Genome-editing, particularly the CRISPR-Cas technology , is being recognised as a breakthrough in precision breeding. It enables scientists to make targeted changes in the native genes of living organisms, creating new and desirable traits without introducing foreign DNA.""Development of these two varieties using genome editing technology has paved the way for using this innovative method in other crops too for higher yields, climate resilience and improved quality to achieve the targets of Viksit Bharat,"" said an official note, released by the ICAR, on late Saturday. Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will formally release these two varieties on Sunday.Recognizing the transformative potential of new technology, the ICAR initiated a genome-editing research project in rice in 2018 and selected two widely cultivated mega rice varieties -- ‘Samba Mahsuri (BPT5204)’ and ‘MTU1010 (Cottondora Sannalu)’ -- to further enhance their qualities through technological interventions.The ICAR scientists eventually enhanced these varieties with better stress tolerance, improved yield, and climate adaptability without compromising their existing strengths, and developed two new genome-edited varieties ‘Kamala’ and ‘Pusa DST Rice 1’.""The initiative marks a significant step forward in India’s efforts to ensure food security and sustainable agriculture in the face of mounting environmental challenges. There are few concerns about the Intellectual Property Rights of the technology which are being looked after and will be resolved in times to come,"" said the ICAR.The genome-edited 'DRR Dhan 100 (Kamala)' is recommended for cultivation across major rice-growing states, including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The other new variety - ‘Pusa DST Rice 1' - is also recommended for cultivation in most of these states.Currently, genome-editing programmes have also been initiated by the ICAR in many crops including oilseeds and pulses.","Indian Council of Agricultural Research has developed the country's first genome-edited climate-resilient varieties of rice.

Alex Smith respects his friendship with Kelce too much to ask for Taylor Swift perks

ESPN’s Alex Smith Talks NFL Draft, Commanders, Mahomes & More with Rich Eisen | Full Interview

No jealousy, just pride in Kelce and Mahomes’ evolution

Former NFL quarterback Alex Smith has nothing but admiration for his longtime friend and ex-teammate Travis Kelce — but when it comes to asking for favors involving Kelce’s high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift, Smith draws a clear boundary. In a recent appearance on The Rich Eisen Show, the former Kansas City Chiefs star shared a candid take on why he's never — and likely will never — ask Kelce for concert tickets to see Swift perform.While Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour continues to break records with over $2 billion in revenue and her global fan base only grows stronger, it's not surprising that her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, has become an unexpected gateway to one of the hottest tickets in entertainment. Still, Smith, who played five seasons with Kelce in Kansas City before the Patrick Mahomes era began, isn’t using their bond for personal gain.“I haven’t hit him up on that,” Smith told Rich Eisen when asked if he’s ever requested concert tickets. “Nor do I ever expect to. He’s got enough people, I’m sure, bringing that up to him.”It wasn’t just a polite deflection — Smith was emphatic in his stance, even after Eisen pointed out that Greg Olsen had confessed to asking. Smith didn’t budge. “Again, these are special relationships. And to go ask for a handout… from his girlfriend? It’s just not my thing.”What stood out most was Smith’s tone — one not of bitterness, but of genuine pride. When the conversation shifted to Kelce’s relationship with quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Smith lit up with respect and admiration.“These guys are like stepbrothers off the field,” Smith said. “They are so incredibly close — they give each other such direct feedback all the time.”He also mentioned their recent business venture together. “I think they just opened a steakhouse,” Smith added, referencing their growing partnership beyond football.Also Read: Are Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce skipping the 2025 Met Gala to avoid the spotlight—or to hide deeper issues in their relationship?

Base Salary: $2 million

Stock Awards & Other Compensation: Majority of his earnings

Security Expenses: Alphabet spent $8.27 million on Pichai’s personal security, marking a 22% increase from the previous year

Google spends 22% more on CEO Sundar PIchai's security

Google’s parent company Alphabet has revealed CEO Sundar Pichai’s earnings for the year 2024. As per Alphabet’s 2025 Proxy Statement, Sundar Pichai’s total compensation for the year 2024 is $10.72 million. This figure reveals a significant decrease as compared to his $226 million earnings of 2022. This drop is mainly attributed to the absence of a large triennial stock award that Pichai received in the previous reporting period. While the overall compensation saw a considerable reduction, details of the breakdown reveal a base salary of $2 million for Pichai. The remaining portion of his 2024 package consisted of stock awards and other compensation.While his base salary remained steady at $2 million (₹16 crore), the majority of Pichai's $10.73 million compensation package consisted of stock-based rewards, along with bonuses and other executive perks. Also, a significant allocation of $8.27 million was designated towards Pichai's personal security expenses. This represents a 22% increase in security-related spending compared to the $6.7 million allocated in 2023.The Proxy Statement also revealed that Google paid $8.27 million for CEO Sundar Pichai’s personal security in 2024. The figure is up almost 22% from $6.78 million in 2023. The increase reportedly came as Pichai travelled extensively in 2024. In a proxy statement with the securities exchange, the company said “In 2024, Sundar’s security arrangements included residential security and consultation fees, security monitoring services, car and driver services, and personal security during all travel.”“We believe these arrangements and costs are reasonable, appropriate, necessary and in the best interests of Alphabet and its stockholders, as they mitigate risks to our business,” it further added. In the document, the company says that “we do not consider these additional security arrangements to be a personal benefit to Sundar because they arise from the nature of his employment responsibilities.”","Google's parent company Alphabet has revealed CEO Sundar Pichai’s earnings for the year 2024.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-know-about-facebook-founders-viral-rawdog-routine/articleshow/120843936.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-called ‘rawdog’ morning routine has recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings.

Elon Musk says DOGE is a way of life

Elon Musk plans to keep his ‘tiny office’ in White House

Elon Musk on if DOGE has been effective

Elon Musk says he didn’t always like the job

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is scaling back his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), a federal initiative aimed at reducing government spending and modernizing technology systems. Musk, who was serving as a special government employee, is transitioning from daily in-person engagements at the White House to remote participation. In an hour-long interview on Wednesday April 30, Musk told reporters “Now we’re getting more of a rhythm. And so the amount of time that it’s necessary for me to spend here is much less, and I can return to primarily running my companies, which do need me.”During the interview, Musk insisted that the transition does not mean that DOGE work is done. The task force which was originally set up to terminate on July 4, 2026, will reportedly continue till the end of 2028. Asked about the possibility of extending DOGE's mandate, Musk responded, ""I think so,"" adding, ""It's up to the president.”The Tesla CEO also compared DOGE to Buddhism, stating “It’s a way of life, like Buddhism”. When asked who will lead DOGE, Musk stated “You wouldn’t ask who would lead Buddhism.”Stating that during the “intense” three months of the Trump administration, he occasionally slept over at the White House at Trump’s invitation. Musk has frequently traveled with Trump in recent months. Sharing an exchange after such travels, Musk said: “He (Donald Trump) was like: 'Where are you staying?' I was like: 'I don't know. At a friend's house, I guess.' And then he was like: 'Why don't you stay here?' I was like: 'Sure.'”He would stay over in the White House’s Lincoln Bedroom where he occasionally played video games – Diablo and Path of Exile.Musk, during the interview, recalled that Trump once called him late at night and suggested he get ice cream from the White House kitchen. “He’ll actually call late at night and say, ‘Oh, by the way, make sure you get some ice cream from the kitchen,’” Musk said, jokingly adding “Don’t tell RFK.”During his tenure at White House, Musk told reporters that he was assigned an office on the top floor of the West Wing. Stating that he intends to keep the “comically tiny office”, he added that it's a tight space and gets only a ""glimmer of sunlight.""“It has a view of nothing,” he said. “It has a window but all you see is the HVAC unit, which is fine. It makes it harder to shoot me, I guess. There's not a good line of sight.”During the interview, Musk told the reporters that DOGE has cut $160 billion in federal spending which is far short of the $2 trillion goal he set last year. He said “In the grand scheme of things, I think we've been effective. Not as effective as I like ... but we've made progress.”He further added: “There's a long way to go. It's pretty difficult ... It's like: How much pain is the Cabinet and Congress willing to take? It can be done. But it requires dealing with a lot of complaints.”Musk also talked about the backlash DOGE faced for its actions and how his companies, especially Tesla became a target of protests and vandalism. He said “Being attacked relentlessly is not super fun” adding ""Seeing cars on fire is not fun.""","Tesla CEO Elon Musk is scaling back his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency.

In a rare occurrence, an IndiGo aircraft winging its way from Jaipur to Chandigarh Friday morning saw each of its two engines flame out momentarily one by one. First one engine of the ATR aircraft had a flameout for a few seconds and then its auto ignition brought it back to life almost immediately. Then the second engine had the exact same occurrence. The aircraft landed safely in Chandigarh and is grounded there for engines inspection.The Directorate Genera of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has sought a report from the airline, said a senior regulatory official. “This happened during very heavy rain that had lashed the region on Friday morning. The first engine recovered and restarted after a momentary flame out. Then some time later, the same thing happened with the second engine. Luckily both the engines did not flameout simultaneously.”Airline sources say: “The aircraft landed safely in Chandigarh. It is now grounded for inspection. What had seemingly happened was that the engine performance due to weather-related issues dropped in terms of parameters like RPM. The engine showed a reduction in propeller speed (the combustion that drives the engine ‘flames out’). The engine control systems detected and corrected the issue. Passengers did not feel anything unusual. The matter has been reported to the engine manufacturer and the DGCA.”",The ATR aircraft landed safely in Chandigarh and is grounded there for engines inspection.

Who is Anthony Albanese? Australian Labor Party leader wins a second term to become PM again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/who-is-anthony-albanese-australian-labor-party-leader-wins-a-second-term-to-become-pm-again/articleshow/120850322.cms,"Anthony Albanese

'No Australian left behind'

Net-zero energy policy

Political system

Marriage

Anthony Albanese on Saturday secured a second term as Australia’s prime minister, becoming the first leader in 21 years to guide his party to back-to-back election victories .The last to achieve that feat was John Howard , who won his fourth consecutive term in 2004.This win marks a major personal and political milestone for Albanese, who has often spoken about his modest beginnings.Albanese was raised by a single mother in public housing in Sydney and is now at the centre of Australia’s political stage.“There’s a lot of undecided voters. We have a mountain to climb. No one’s been reelected since 2004,” Albanese said on the eve of the election.Albanese’s life story has resonated with many Australians. His mother was an invalid pensioner, and they lived in public housing, which shaped his views on fairness and opportunity. His campaign pledge has always been clear: to leave no Australian behind.His government’s early priority was holding a referendum in 2023 to create an Indigenous advisory body to Parliament, known as the Voice. Though the proposal was rejected, it was a historic attempt to address the long-standing disadvantage faced by Indigenous Australians, who make up 4% of the population.Critics have accused his government of being out of touch with ordinary Australians during a period of rising inflation.One of the biggest differences between Albanese’s centre-left Labor Party and the conservative Liberal Party is their energy policy. Both agree on reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but Labor wants to replace fossil fuel power with renewable energy. The Liberals, meanwhile, support building nuclear reactors.Albanese has presented himself as a moderniser focused on making government more efficient and fair.Since Howard left office in 2007, Australia has had six different prime ministers. Some, like Kevin Rudd, even served twice. For years, it was common for parties to replace their leaders before the next election.That started to change in 2013, when Rudd returned as leader and made it harder to remove a sitting Labor prime minister. Now, 75% of Labor MPs must agree to a change, and regular party members also get a vote. The Liberal Party has made similar rule changes to slow down leadership challenges.Because of these reforms, Albanese is now the first prime minister since Howard to finish a full term and win a second one.Albanese is engaged to Jodie Haydon and plans to become the first Australian prime minister to marry while in office. He proposed on Valentine’s Day last year. But the couple delayed the wedding, worried it might seem out of touch during a cost-of-living crisis . Albanese now says they’ll marry after the election and before the end of the year.Their purchase of a A$4.3 million ($2.7 million) home by the water at Copacabana Beach also drew attention, especially as many Australians are struggling to afford housing.“I understand I’m fortunate. I also know what it is like to struggle,” Albanese said, addressing the criticism.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","Anthony Albanese is the first leader in 21 years to guide his party to back-to- back election victories.

Phoebe Gates names the most common bias in venture capital



""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""

""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'”

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates’ daughter, Phoebe Gates, has shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni , Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was:According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced.Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking:she added.Gates and Kianni’s experiences mirror a recent Oxfam study on rising CEO pay, which found that among 45,501 companies in 168 countries with over $10 million in revenue, women occupy fewer than 7% of top leadership roles, the report added.What BIll Gates said about funding Phoebe’s Phia appIn a New York Times interview published soon after Phia’s launch, Bill Gates said that he was “happy” not to fund his daughter Phoebe’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, because doing so would have meant micromanaging the business.“I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.” Gates explained that had he invested, “then I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky, and I probably would have been overly nice, but wondered if it was the right thing to do? Luckily, it never happened.”Instead of providing capital, Gates offers guidance to his daughter on personnel issues, noting, “When it comes to shopping, I’m not exactly the target audience.”","Phoebe Gates, 22, is co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia.

The actor said that India has a treasure trove of stories that haven't been told before or explored in depth. ""Like the amazing epics Mahabharata and Ramayana. To make that into a movie, it would be a very long kind of a movie... to select which parts to do and really flesh those things out. Even the Panchatantras, our folk stories.

He went on to congratulate Albanese, recognizing the historic nature of the Labor Party’s win.Soon after, PM Modi took to social media to congratulate the Australian PM.

Analyst Antony Green from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation predicted Labor would win 76 seats, while the coalition would secure 36 seats, with unaligned parties likely to hold 13.The campaign was heavily focused on energy policy and inflation, with both parties acknowledging the country’s ongoing cost-of-living crisis, as reported by the Associated Press. Dutton’s Liberal Party blamed government spending for rising inflation and proposed drastic cuts to public services, including eliminating one in five public sector jobs. Meanwhile, Albanese’s Labor Party criticized Dutton’s nuclear energy proposals and accused his party of adopting divisive US-style politics.The six-week electoral process further garnered worldwide attention, primarily due to the significant influence of US President Trump.

More than seven decades after gaining independence together in 1947, India and Pakistan have taken sharply divergent economic paths, with one of the starkest contrasts visible in their foreign exchange reserves — a key indicator of financial stability and economic resilience.According to a detailed analysis by The Economic Times (ET), India’s forex reserves currently stand at over $688 billion, while Pakistan’s reserves have barely crossed $15 billion. This massive gap highlights decades of different policy choices, governance structures, and economic strategies pursued by the two countries.At the time of independence, both nations inherited a weak economic structure with limited reserves, a by-product of colonial rule. For India, progress remained slow until the 1991 balance of payments crisis, when reserves fell below $2 billion — insufficient to fund even three weeks of imports. However, that crisis triggered sweeping economic liberalization, which included devaluation of the rupee, reduced trade barriers, and opening up to foreign investment. These reforms laid the foundation for steady growth in reserves.Over the following decades, India’s services sector boomed, fuelled by an IT revolution, strong remittance inflows, and consistent foreign investment.By 2008, India’s reserves surpassed $300 billion, and even amid global crises like the 2008 financial meltdown and the COVID-19 pandemic, the country managed to maintain a robust external balance. As of 2025, the reserves have reached an all-time high of $688 billion, acting as a solid buffer in times of global uncertainty.In contrast, Pakistan’s economic trajectory has been marred by volatility. Despite early industrial promise in the 1960s, recurring political instability, military interventions, and inconsistent policy directions prevented sustainable economic growth. Over time, the country became increasingly reliant on external aid from the U.S., China, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), without developing a diversified export base.Pakistan’s export profile remained limited — largely focused on low-value textiles — while its dependence on imported energy and a widening current account deficit put constant pressure on reserves. Since the 1980s, Pakistan has entered over 20 IMF programs, yet structural reforms have often remained incomplete or postponed. In 2023, the country faced a critical low in reserves, dropping below $4 billion.The reasons behind the forex divergence are rooted in deeper structural and strategic differences. India successfully diversified its economy into high-growth sectors like pharmaceuticals and technology, while Pakistan struggled to expand beyond its traditional industries. India maintained a consistent reform trajectory post-1991, regardless of political changes, while Pakistan swung between populist and austerity policies under IMF pressure.Central bank autonomy also played a role — India's Reserve Bank maintained a focus on stability and inflation control, whereas Pakistan’s monetary policy often faced political influence. Moreover, India's ability to attract large-scale foreign direct investment (FDI) and its global diaspora’s high remittances from Western economies bolstered its forex cushion. In contrast, Pakistan’s remittance inflows were smaller and more vulnerable to Middle Eastern economic cycles.Geopolitical strategy further widened the economic gap. India deepened economic diplomacy and trade ties globally, while Pakistan often prioritized security alliances over economic cooperation.","India's forex reserves currently stand at over $688 billion, while Pakistan’s reserves have barely crossed $15 billion.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on how Trump’s tariffs may not have impact on company’s retail game: ‘I think when you’ve got…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-on-how-trumps-tariffs-may-not-have-impact-on-companys-retail-game-i-think-when-youve-got/articleshow/120849743.cms,"Jassy highlights advantages of Amazon’s diverse marketplace

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has presented an optimistic outlook regarding the potential impact of US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, suggesting that the company's extensive retail operations may remain largely unaffected. He elaborated that the very structure of Amazon's e-commerce platform, with its capacity to offer opportunities to a wide array of sellers, may provide an advantage to sellers based in China amidst these new import duties.In comments during a call with analysts following the release of Amazon's strong first-quarter earnings results, Jassy explained that the tariffs on goods from China would negatively impact the US-based sellers.“Retailers who aren’t buying directly from China are typically buying from companies who themselves are buying from China, marking these items up, rebranding and selling to US consumers,” Jassy told analysts on a call.However, he suggested that the complex global supply chain could inadvertently give Chinese sellers an advantage on the e-commerce platform.“These retailers are buying the product at a higher price than Chinese sellers selling directly to US consumers in our marketplace. So, the total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China direct sellers,” he added.Furthermore, Jassy highlighted the inherent advantage of Amazon's vast and diverse marketplace, which hosts approximately two million independent sellers. He posited that if some US sellers struggle due to increased tariff costs and are forced to reduce their presence, other sellers, potentially those based in different countries, would likely step in to fill the resulting gap in supply.“I think when you’ve got larger diversity like we have, we have a better chance of some of those sellers deciding that they’re going to capture [market] share, and they’re not going to pass on all or any of those tariffs to customers,” Jassy noted.While acknowledging that many sellers might pass on the increased tariff costs to consumers through higher prices, Jassy also pointed out that some sellers, including those operating from different nations, might view the situation as an opportunity to gain market share by absorbing some or all of the tariff costs to attract new customers. He believes that Amazon's large and diverse seller base increases the likelihood of such competitive pricing strategies emerging.Moreover, recent reports have suggested that Amazon is pressurising sellers to bear the increased costs due to tariffs to minimise its impact on its profits. The company said that it is doing what’s best for its customers.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has presented an optimistic outlook regarding the potential impact of US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts.
