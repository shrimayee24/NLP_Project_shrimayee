CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking his urgent intervention to direct the Ministry of Railways to expedite sanctioned projects in the state by releasing required funds and reviving those kept in abeyance.Stalin highlighted that the progress of several crucial railway projects is being hindered by ""delays in releasing funds by the Ministry of Railways"" and the practice of providing partial funding for individual projects.He noted that while the state government has granted administrative approval for acquiring 2,500.61 hectares for various federal railway projects, the Railway Department is yet to allocate funds for 931.52 hectares, an official release said.""The delays in releasing funds and the piecemeal allocation... have hindered the progress of railway projects in Tamil Nadu,"" the chief minister stated, adding that this has created a state of ""prolonged uncertainty"" for affected landowners.Stalin pointed out that land acquisition is 94 per cent complete for 19 major projects, with 1,198.02 hectares already handed over to the Railways.

HAL Clarifies AMCA Status, Says It Will Bid For India's Fifth-Generation Fighter Jet In 2035 Phase

NEW DELHI: Rubbishing speculation of possible delays in the delivery of the first batch of indigenous LCA Mk1A fighter jets to IAF, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Thursday said that “five LCA Mk1A aircraft are fully ready for delivery, incorporating major contracted capabilities in accordance with the agreed specifications”.HAL also said that “an additional nine aircraft have already been built and flown. Upon receipt of engines from General Electric (US company), these aircraft will be made ready for delivery”. “All design and development issues identified are being addressed in an expedited manner. HAL is in active discussions with IAF to deliver the aircraft at the earliest,” it said in a statement.HAL has received five engines from GE as on date. The supply position from GE is positive, and the future delivery outlook aligns with HAL’s delivery plans, the company said. HAL assured that it will meet the guidance projected for the current financial year.Besides LCA Mk1A aircraft, the company said it is simultaneously advancing multiple strategic programmes, including Indian Multi Role Helicopter (IMRH), Tejas LCA Mk2 and Combat Air Teaming System (CATS), all of which are expected to enter production after 2032.HAL had received the first contract from IAF for 83 LCA Mk1A jets (73 fighters and 10 trainers) in Feb 2021, and later, a follow-on contract in Sept 2025 for 97 additional LCA Mk1A aircraft (68 fighters and 29 twin-seaters) at a cost of over Rs 62,370 crore.The delivery of these aircraft would commence during 2027-28 and be completed over a period of six years.The aircraft would have an indigenous content of over 64%, with 67 additional items incorporated. In all, IAF had ordered 180 of these aircraft in two tranches.Some of the planes were supposed to be delivered last year, but IAF insisted that HAL provide the aircraft in a fully operational configuration. On Oct 17 last year, the company conducted the first flight of the first Tejas Mk1A prototype from its Nashik facility. At present, HAL’s fighter aircraft production capacity stands at 24 aircraft per year. At this rate, fulfilling the 180 aircraft Tejas Mk1A order would take over seven years, with IAF expected to receive the complete fleet no earlier than around 2033.Beyond the 180 Mk1A jets, IAF had previously acquired 40 LCA Mk1 (IOC/FOC variants), making a total of 220 LCA-type aircraft contracted or ordered across all variants.","HAL has received five engines from GE as on date.

Sonia Gandhi Targets Modi Govt On ASHA, Anganwadi Workers In Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Sonia Gandhi Saturday described as ""politically motivated and frivolous"" a criminal revision petition before a Delhi court against a 2025 magisterial order that declined to order an FIR over alleged inclusion of her name in electoral rolls in 1980, three years before she acquired Indian citizenship.The petition before special judge Vishal Gogne of Rouse Avenue sessions court alleges that the Italian origin Sonia's name was added using forged documents. The Congress senior described the claims as ""wholly misconceived"" and the plea as ""abuse of the process of law"".The plea was filed by one Vikas Tripathi, challenging magistrate Vaibhav Chaurasiya's refusal on Sept 11 last year to order the FIR. Sonia had been sent notices on Dec 9, 2025, over the plea. Judge Gogne noted the reply on Saturday and listed the matter for arguments on Feb 21.In her reply, Sonia said the trial (magistrate) court had rightly held that issues of citizenship fall ""exclusively within the domain of the Central govt"", while electoral roll disputes are ""vested solely with Election Commission of India "". She argued that criminal courts cannot entertain private complaints disguised as IPC or BNS offences, as this would violate the doctrine of separation of powers and Article 329 of the Constitution, which bars judicial interference in the electoral process.Sonia added that a ""controversy raised in the media more than 25 years back"" was being recycled to file the revision plea, with allegations that were ""speculative and unsupported"" by authentic documents, and which failed to specify the documents allegedly forged or their source.Although the plea claims Sonia's name was ""re-entered"" in electoral rolls with a qualifying date of Jan 1, 1983, no supporting document was placed on record. ""It is incomprehensible on what basis it has been claimed that the respondent got her name re-entered,"" the reply states.","The petition alleges that the Italian origin Sonia's name was added using forged documents.

From Tamil Pride To Global Trust: How PM Modi Used Culture To Reset India-Malaysia Relations

KUALA LUMPUR/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday chose an Indian community event in Kuala Lumpur to shower praise on Tamil culture and highlight the presence of several Tamilians in key positions in India. The focus on Tamilians was, though, very much in order as they make up an overwhelming majority of people of Indian origins in Malaysia.Tamil literature is eternal and its culture global, he emphasised, noting that Malaysia is home to the second largest population of Indian-origin community in the world.In India, he said, Vice-President C P Radhakrishnan is a Tamilian and so are key members of his govt, EAM S Jaishankar and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. A junior minister L Murugan is from Tamil Nadu as well, he added.Though he has often voiced his admiration for Tamil language and culture, his generous praise at the event in Kuala Lumpur had political significance as well, as Tamil Nadu is headed for the assembly polls.At the 'Selamat Datang Modi Ji (welcome Modi)' event, Modi recalled that when he first visited Malaysia in 2015, India was in the 11th spot of the economic ladder and today, a decade later, in the top three.""With the world's largest digital public infrastructure propelling country's economy, creating third largest start-up hub in the world, the country is ensuring clean and green growth,"" he added, announcing that ""UPI would be available in Malaysia very soon. ""He announced India's decision to open its first consulate in Malaysia to strengthen ongoing cooperation between India and Malaysia and expand outreach to the Indian community in Malaysia.He said Tamil is India's gift to the world. Noting that Tamil diaspora has been present in Malaysia for many centuries, he said inspired by its history, India had established the Thiruvalluvar Chair at the University of Malaya and would now set up a Thiruvalluvar Centre to further strengthen shared heritage.The Prime Minister praised his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim for the warm welcome accorded to him and said it emphasised his love and respect for India and the Indian community.

"BJP mocks NC’s ‘special status’ call for J&K, says no return of Article 370",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-mocks-ncs-special-status-call-for-jk-says-no-return-of-article-370/articleshow/128046244.cms,"'Whole Of Jammu And Kashmir Should Be Reunited With India': British MP Bob Blackman

JAMMU: Governing National Conference’s (NC) insistence on restoration of J&K’s “special status” since forming the govt in 2024 drew on Saturday a sharp counter from BJP, which argued that there is no such term in the Indian Constitution while dismissing the call as “no status”.“Show me where the words ‘special status’ are written for J&K in the Indian Constitution. If they can find it, I am ready to face any punishment,” leader of opposition, BJP’s Sunil Sharma, said in the assembly.The dare came in response to NC legislator Javid Hassan Baig’s demand for special status while speaking on Friday’s budget presented by CM Omar Abdullah . Baig contended that the term was enshrined in Article 370 , which defined the constitutional relationship between the erstwhile J&K state and the Indian Union.Baig said Article 35A, which flowed from Article 370, was even more important as it safeguarded land rights and govt jobs for J&K’s people. He further argued that J&K’s Constitution existed under the Constitution of India, granting the region internal autonomy, while external sovereignty had been surrendered to the Union.Article 370, Article 35A, the J&K Constitution and J&K state flag, taken together, constituted what was known as “special status” and it is this NC wanted restored, Baig explained.Sharma countered saying NC’s demand must be backed by an explicit constitutional term while asserting that “Article 370 has been buried”. “What is special status? Where is it mentioned? It is mentioned nowhere. Many states seek special packages and incentives, which can include employment or development packages. They can be called special status,” Sharma said.Outside the assembly, Sharma reiterated that there is no reference to “special status” in the context of J&K’s accession or merger with India and accused NC of misleading voters.On Nov 6, 2024, soon after NC was voted to office, the assembly passed a resolution seeking restoration of “special status” but did not spell out what it meant by the term. In May last year, a key NC meeting chaired by president Farooq Abdullah adopted a resolution for restoration of special status and full J&K statehood. That resolution, too, stopped short of defining the phrase.Former CM Mehbooba Mufi’s PDP and Sajad Lone’s Peoples Conference (PC) have earlier asked NC to clarify its position.","National Conference wants restoration of J&K’s “special status” since forming the govt in 2024.

Signal to Islamabad

NEW DELHI: As New Delhi and Washington announced the framework for an interim trade agreement on Saturday, a map of India released by the US trade representative’s (USTR) office drew attention.The map, shared alongside details of the trade deal framework, shows the entire Jammu and Kashmir region – including Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) – as part of India.It also depicts Aksai Chin, a region claimed by China, within Indian territory. China claims the territory and has objected to India’s position, a dispute that has remained a sensitive issue in bilateral ties between New Delhi and Beijing.In a post on X US trade representative said, “From tree nuts and dried distillers’ grains to red sorghum and fresh and processed fruit, the US-India Agreement will provide new market access for American products.While India has consistently maintained that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of the country and does not require external validation of its sovereignty, the depiction marks a departure from earlier US government maps, which typically showed the other claims as a part of the map.The timing of the map release is notable, coming as India and the US are moving to better the trade ties following months of speculation.Earlier this year, the Trump administration imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods, including an additional 25% for Russian oil imports – the highest levied on a US ally – amid stalled trade negotiations. Under the interim framework announced, that tariff is set to be reduced to 18%, one of the lowest among Asian countries.Though the USTR did not comment on the map, it comes as an embarrassment for Pakistan, which claims PoK.The release also comes amid sustained diplomatic outreach by Pakistan to Washington in recent months, including multiple visits by Pakistan’s PM Shehbaz Sharif and army chief, Asim Munir, and meetings with President Trump.The interim trade pact, expected to be signed by mid-March, is aimed at easing trade tensions and providing relief to Indian exporters after months of uncertainty.","The US trade representative's office released a map of India on Saturday.

Supreme Court Stays Its Order On Aravalli Definition, Environment Minister Welcomes Move

An evolving movement

In the heat of Rajasthan ’s desert districts, a tree has become the focal point of a widening confrontation. Markets have shut, saints have gone on strike, political rivals have shared protest stages, and thousands have gathered under open skies to demand its protection.What began in Bikaner as a local objection to the alleged felling of khejri trees for solar power projects has since evolved into the ‘Khejri Bachao Andolan’, a statewide campaign pressing for stricter legal safeguards and an immediate ban on cutting the species.The movement has drawn support across party lines, producing a rare moment of political convergence.The khejri, botanically known asand recognised as Rajasthan’s state tree, occupies a distinctive place in the ecology of the Thar desert.Amid the ongoing protests, chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma, assuring the protection of the khejri, termed the tree as the state’s “” a wish-fulfilling tree in Indian tradition.In an arid landscape where survival is closely tied to ecology, the reference reaffirms the tree’s symbolic and practical importance. For many communities in western Rajasthan, the debate now extends beyond development policy into questions of history, identity and survival.The present phase of the movement intensified in early February, when over 360 saints and local residents began a hunger strike in Bikaner, demanding an immediate ban on the felling of khejri trees for solar power projects. The protest site was initially the Polytechnic College ground near the Collectorate before shifting to the Bishnoi Dharamshala, where the hunger strike continues.In Bikaner, markets remained closed for hours on Monday after a call by trader associations. Government and private schools in urban areas observed a half-day holiday in solidarity. Thousands gathered at the Polytechnic College ground before marching towards the Collectorate, where organisers announced an indefinite sit-in.Protesters came not only from different districts of Rajasthan but also from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Organisers said they had arranged food for nearly one lakh participants, with hundreds of volunteers handling logistics. Police deployed additional forces, erected barricades near the Collectorate and kept water cannons on standby. Despite the scale and tensions, the protest remained peaceful.Four protesters were admitted to Prince Bijay Singh Memorial Hospital as their health deteriorated during the hunger strike, while several others received medical assistance at camps set up near the site.Mokhram Dharaniya, one of the hospitalised protesters, said, “People are sitting on a hunger strike, including me. Our protest will continue until our demands are met.”At the centre of the agitation are allegations that large numbers of khejri trees have been cut to facilitate solar power projects in western Rajasthan. The region has emerged as a hub for renewable energy, given its high solar irradiance and availability of land. While solar development is central to India’s energy transition goals, protesters argue that project implementation has come at the cost of ecologically vital trees.Tensions escalated when the state government announced a restriction on felling khejri trees only in the Jodhpur and Bikaner divisions. Protesters rejected the move as inadequate, demanding a blanket statewide ban. During one address by a government representative, protesters reportedly took away the microphone, insisting on a written assurance.Minister for skill, employment and entrepreneurship KK Bishnoi and State Animal Welfare Board chairman Jaswant Bishnoi visited the Bishnoi Dharamshala and offered juice to the hunger strikers in an attempt to persuade them to break their fast.The minister said the government was ready to provide a written commitment and appealed to protesters to end the hunger strike. However, saints on the stage refused to withdraw without formal documentation.Agitation leader Parsaram Bishnoi said, “The hunger strike did not end. The government order was incomplete as it failed to cover the entire state.”Former minister Bhanwar Singh Bhati said: “All sections of society participating in the agitation decided to continue until a complete ban on cutting Khejri trees was imposed across Rajasthan.”The issue has resonated in the Rajasthan Assembly. Congress MLA Dungar Ram Gedar raised the matter during Zero Hour, accusing the government of failing to act despite a persistent two-year protest led by the Bishnoi community in Bikaner.“Khejri being the state tree, there is an urgent need for a strict law to protect it,” Gedar said.Independent MLA Ravindra Singh Bhati stated that the matter was already under discussion in the assembly. “Bhagat Singh (the Indian freedom fighter) said that sometimes a blast is needed to make the voice heard. If it takes gheraoing the Assembly to save khejri, I will be at the forefront,” he said.Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma told the assembly that his government was drafting a conservation law for the khejri tree, which he described as the state’s “Kalpavriksha”.“In August, saints from Bikaner, Phalodi, Jodhpur and Nagaur met me. Following that, I instructed officials to prepare the draft legislation. The process is under way, and it will soon be presented in the assembly,” he said.The chief minister also used the assembly session to defend his government’s broader record, speaking about economic growth, recruitment reforms and water supply projects.However, protesters have maintained that until a formal statewide ban is issued, the agitation will continue.Former chief minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot expressed support for the public movement, describing the indiscriminate cutting of khejri trees in the name of development as “extremely painful and unacceptable.”He recalled the historical sacrifice associated with the tree and said environmental protection must be prioritised.In a development seen as politically significant, former chief minister Vasundhara Raje publicly backed the movement that has put her own party, the BJP, in the dock.Sharing a photograph of herself worshipping a khejri tree, she wrote, “I also worship the Khejri tree. Rising above politics, we should all come forward to protect it. We must save it. I stand with everyone in the campaign to save the Khejri tree and the Oran (grazing land).” She also quoted a proverb revered in the Bishnoi community:(If a tree can be saved, even at the cost of one’s head, consider it a bargain).Observers have noted that her intervention has added to political pressure on the state government.Any discussion of the khejri in Rajasthan inevitably returns to the events of 1730 in the village of Khejarli near Jodhpur. According to historical accounts, 363 members of the Bishnoi community, led by Amrita Devi Bishnoi, sacrificed their lives to prevent the felling of khejri trees ordered for royal construction.The episode, often referred to as the Khejarli massacre, is widely regarded as one of the earliest recorded instances of environmental resistance. Amrita Devi is said to have declared that the loss of her head would be a small price to save a tree. Her sacrifice and that of the others form a cornerstone of Bishnoi identity and environmental ethics in the region.Protesters in the current agitation have repeatedly invoked this legacy. Even Ashok Gehlot referred to the sacrifice of 363 individuals, including Amrita Devi Bishnoi, and said their legacy should be honoured.The khejri is uniquely adapted to arid (extremely dry) and semi-arid climates. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater and survive prolonged drought. Unlike many other species, it does not compete aggressively with crops and is often grown in agricultural fields in a traditional agroforestry system.An agroforestry system is a land-use practice where trees are grown alongside crops or livestock on the same land to improve productivity and sustainability.Its leaves, known as “loong,” are used as fodder for livestock. Its pods, called “sangri,” are a staple ingredient in traditional Rajasthani cuisine, particularly in the dish. The wood is used as fuel and timber, while its bark and other parts have been used in traditional medicine.Ecologically, the tree improves soil fertility by fixing nitrogen, reduces desertification by stabilising sand dunes and provides shade in extreme heat. In regions where annual rainfall is minimal, it plays a crucial role in sustaining both human and animal life.Given these attributes, many in Rajasthan see the khejri not just as a tree but as a symbol of resilience and survival in a harsh environment.Currently, khejri trees are protected under various forest and environmental regulations, but protesters argue that enforcement is inconsistent and that ambiguities in existing laws create loopholes. Former Luni MLA Mahendra Vishnoi said, “Confusion exists in current laws concerning khejri conservation. The penalties must be precise and severe. Without a fear of the law, this destruction will persist.”Environmental activist Mokhram Dharniya alleged administrative inaction. “The administration has betrayed us repeatedly. Over the past year, we have held numerous protests, receiving assurances each time, while the trees continue to be axed. We will not permit the cutting of khejri anymore,” he said.One of the demands emerging from the agitation is a provision imposing a fine of Rs 1 lakh for violations. Activists have also called for a temporary statewide ban on felling until a comprehensive conservation law is enacted.The agitation has extended beyond Bikaner. In Barmer, protesters gathered at the Collectorate, and some youths climbed the gate and raised slogans after police closed the premises. A memorandum addressed to the chief minister was submitted.The movement has also taken on a deeply personal dimension for some families. Following the death of environmental activist Radheshyam Bishnoi in a road accident last year, his mother Ratni Devi and wife Nirma Bishnoi have continued his work and are now on a hunger strike demanding protection for khejri trees.Meanwhile, reports of illegal logging in other parts of the state, including in the forest area of Bayana subdivision in Bharatpur district, have further fuelled concerns about enforcement.Activists said the issue concerns the entire desert belt, including Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Pali, Jalore, Phalodi, Sriganganagar, and Churu.Protesters alleged that thousands of khejri trees were felled in recent years, largely for infrastructure and solar power projects.Founder of the Khejri Bachao Andolan, Parasram Bishnoi, said the agitation would continue until the state enacts a specific law making the cutting of khejri trees a punishable offence.“Large tracts of desert land are being indiscriminately handed over to solar parks, destroying the local ecosystem. Without legal protection, the desert’s survival is at stake,” Bishnoi told TOI.He added that participation is swelling daily and asserted that the onus now lies on the state government led by chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma.Bishnoi alleged that khejri trees were uprooted across vast desert areas both in the name of renewable energy projects and by an illegal wood mafia, with little effective oversight.The unfolding debate reflects a broader tension between renewable energy expansion and environmental safeguards. Rajasthan is a key state in India’s solar mission. Large tracts of land are being allocated for solar parks, transmission corridors and associated infrastructure.While renewable energy is seen as essential for climate mitigation, local communities argue that development planning must take into account ecological realities and traditional land-use patterns. The khejri, embedded in agricultural and grazing systems, is not easily replaceable.For many protesters, the demand is not to halt development but to ensure that it does not erode the ecological foundation of desert life.As the Khejri Bachao Andolan entered its sixth day, its trajectory remains uncertain. The state government has indicated it is drafting legislation. Protesters insist on immediate written assurances and a comprehensive statewide ban.What is clear is that the agitation has tapped into a powerful historical memory and a deeply rooted cultural ethos. The khejri tree stands at the intersection of ecology, economy and identity in Rajasthan. Its fate has become a test case for how the state balances development with conservation in one of India’s most fragile landscapes.Whether the movement results in a new conservation law, stricter enforcement or a recalibration of project implementation, it has already reaffirmed the enduring symbolic power of a tree that many in Rajasthan consider their “Kalpavriksha”.","What began in Bikaner as a local objection to the alleged felling of khejri trees for solar power projects has since evolved into a statewide campaign. The movement has drawn support across party lines, producing a rare moment of political convergence. Markets have shut, saints have gone on strike, political rivals have shared protest stages.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128031778,imgsize-121300,width-400,resizemode-4/stories-2026-02-07t171238357.jpg"

India Blasts Pakistan At United Nations For Pushing Divisive Kashmir Agenda And Spreading Falsehoods

JAMMU: Under PM Narendra Modi ’s leadership, Govt of India (GoI) remains firmly committed to the vision of building a developed and prosperous Jammu and Kashmir , Union home minister Amit Shah said at a high-level meeting he chaired on Saturday to review the progress of development projects in the Union Territory.The meeting was attended by LG Manoj Sinha, CM Omar Abdullah, Union home. secretary Govind Mohan, J&K chief secretary Atal Dulloo and DGP Nalin Prabhat and other senior officials.While noting that the development projects in the UT had made unprecedented progress, which he credited to the continuous and dedicated efforts being made by Modi govt, the home minister said J&K needed to develop the full potential of its hydropower projects. Special focus should be laid on achieving 100% saturation of govt’s welfare schemes and ensuring that the benefits of all projects reach the intended beneficiaries, he added.Shah underlined the need for aggressive marketing of tourist destinations in J&K to explore the full tourism potential available here. He assured that the Centre would provide all possible assistance in the plan to develop new tourist destinations in the region.Stressing the need to focus on developing sports infrastructure and establishing sports academies to connect the youth with development, he said efforts would be made to secure an investment of Rs 200 crore for this purpose. Shah, who is also the Union cooperation minister, called for taking steps to promote the dairy sector in J&K through the National Dairy Development Board.The home minister said India was steadily progressing towards the goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047, marking 100 years of Independence, and GoI would continue to extend wholehearted support to J&K to achieve that.“Jammu & Kashmir has been brought under the ambit of the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment scheme for the first time in FY 2025-26, enabling access to 50-year interest-free loans for capital projects, he said, underlining that strengthened fiscal discipline would assist in stabilising the UT’s fiscal deficit over time.","The meeting was attended by LG Manoj Sinha, CM Omar Abdullah, Union home. secretary Govind Mohan, J&K chief secretary Atal Dulloo and DGP Nalin Prabhat.

CHENNAI: Diversity in judicial appointments, regional benches of the Supreme Court, increase in the retirement age of high court judges from 62 to 65 and the constitutional status for the collegium which selects and transfers judges — these are the salient features of a private member Bill moved by the DMK’s Rajya Sabha member P Wilson seeking necessary amendments to the Constitution. It seeks representation for candidates from SC/ST and OBCs in proportion to their population.Wilson proposed measures to bring greater transparency to appointments in the higher judiciary. The Bill called for the establishment of permanent regional benches of the Supreme Court in Chennai, New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.Other primary changes sought by the member included an amendment to Article 15 (prohibits discrimination) of the Constitution to allow state govts to make special provisions for socially and educationally backward classes, SCs, and STs, in proportion to their population as determined by a caste census.In matters of judicial appointments, the member proposed amendments to Articles 124, 217, and 224 to include new clauses to ensure representation of SCs, STs, OBCs, religious minorities and women proportional to their population in judicial appointments, mandating the Union govt to frame a Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) in consultation with the Chief Justice of India (CJI) outlining appointment procedures.“State govts must be consulted when appointing judges to the HCs and the apex court.The Centre must act on collegium recommendations within 60 days, and within 30 days if reiterated,” Wilson said.This apart, the Bill proposed increasing the retirement age of HC judges from 62 to 65 years. Another main ingredient of the Bill was the proposal for changes to census powers under the seventh schedule of the Constitution.The Bill sought to modify the legislative powers relating to the census by removing the census from the Union list and adding it to the concurrent list of the Constitution, allowing both the Union and state govts to conduct census exercises.","DMK’s Rajya Sabha member P Wilson seeks necessary amendments to the Constitution.

Oil-smuggling syndicate exposed at sea: Coast Guard intercepts 3 vessels near Mumbai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/oil-smuggling-syndicate-exposed-at-sea-coast-guard-intercepts-3-vessels-near-mumbai/articleshow/128037175.cms,"Image/X

NEW DELHI: The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) on Friday intercepted three vessels about 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai, busting an international oil-smuggling racket during a coordinated mid-sea operation carried out on February 5–6.The operation followed intelligence gathered through technology-enabled maritime surveillance. According to the Coast Guard, the vessels were involved in the illegal transfer of oil and oil-based cargo sourced from conflict-ridden regions, using mid-sea ship-to-ship transfers in international waters to evade customs duties owed to coastal states, including India.Sharing details in a post on X, the Indian Coast Guard said that the action was the result of a “meticulously coordinated sea–air operation.” It said the syndicate “exploited mid-sea transfers in international waters to move cheap oil from conflict-ridden regions to motor tankers, evading duties owed to coastal states.”Explaining how the operation unfolded, the ICG said that its technology-driven systems first detected a motor tanker showing suspicious behaviour within the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).This led to a digital investigation and data-pattern analysis, which identified two more vessels converging on the tanker, raising suspicion of an illicit oil transfer at sea.According to the Coast Guard, specialist boarding teams intercepted the three vessels and carried out sustained rummaging operations.“Electronic data corroboration, verification of documents and interrogation of crew exposed the modus operandi and a global handler network,” the ICG said in its post.Initial investigations revealed that the vessels frequently changed their identities to evade law enforcement by coastal states. The Coast Guard said that the racket was run by a network of handlers operating from multiple countries, coordinating the sale and transfer of oil cargo between seagoing vessels.The intercepted vessels are being escorted to Mumbai for further investigation and will be handed over to Indian Customs and other law enforcement agencies for legal action.Describing the broader significance of the operation, the Coast Guard said the crackdown reinforced India’s role as a “net provider of maritime security and guardian of the rules-based international order” in the region.",The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) intercepted three vessels about 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has enhanced the financial powers of the city's municipal commissioner from Rs 5 crore to Rs 50 crore, paving the way for faster project approvals, the CMO said on Saturday.Regarding the decision, chief minister Rekha Gupta said empowering local bodies for development is the government's top priority.She emphasised that the decision has been taken with public interest at its core and will directly benefit the people of the capital.Timely execution of development works will ensure better utilisation of resources, enhance the effectiveness of public expenditure, she said.At present, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) commissioner is empowered to approve projects only up to Rs 5 crore. Projects exceeding this amount required approval from the corporation's standing committee, followed by final clearance from the House of the Corporation, an statement by the Delhi chief minister office said.This multi-tiered approval mechanism often led to avoidable delays in the execution of development works, it said.""By increasing the commissioner's financial powers to Rs 50 crore, the implementation process of schemes will become simpler, faster, and more effective,"" the statement said.The enhanced delegation of powers will facilitate the timely execution of works related to roads, drains, sanitation, community facilities, and other essential civic services, it said.It will also help accelerate long-pending projects, reduce procedural bottlenecks, and ensure that development initiatives reach citizens without unnecessary delay, the statement added.","The Delhi government has enhanced the financial powers of the city's municipal commissioner.

'Frivolous and politically motivated': Sonia Gandhi opposes plea over 1980 voter list entry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/frivolous-and-politically-motivated-sonia-gandhi-opposes-plea-over-1980-voter-list-entry/articleshow/128027827.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress leader Sonia Gandhi has opposed a criminal revision petition filed against her in the Rouse Avenue Court, calling it ""wholly misconceived, frivolous, politically motivated and an abuse of the process of law. "" She argued that matters of citizenship and electoral rolls cannot be turned into criminal proceedings four decades later.The reply, filed through her counsel before the court of special judge (CBI) Vishal Gogne, contests allegations that she was included in the electoral rolls before acquiring Indian citizenship.She urged that the plea be dismissed as baseless and speculative.According to her response, the complainant’s accusations rest on assumptions, media reports and personal presumptions and not on authentic government records.The reply further emphasises that no specific document has been identified as forged or fabricated, rendering the charges void of material substance. Matters of citizenship, it maintains, fall solely under the jurisdiction of the Central Government, while the Election Commission of India is responsible for maintaining electoral rolls.Arguing that criminal courts cannot assume jurisdiction in such matters, the reply states that entertaining the petition would amount to interference in the electoral process.It further denies that Gandhi’s name was ever re‑entered in the voter list based on any forged or improper application, saying the complainant has failed to produce any authentic document or effort to lawfully obtain one.Sonia Gandhi's reply also dismisses as “baseless” the assertions that fabricated identity documents were used or that Gandhi had voted in the 1980 general election. It also objects to the complainant’s reliance on decades‑old media reports, noting such sources carry no legal weight and cannot serve as a foundation for criminal proceedings.The response underscores that the complaint seeks to revive a matter from 1980–83—over four decades later—without foundational proof, making it both stale and legally untenable.Procedural objections have also been raised, alleging non‑compliance with mandatory requirements under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNSS), including the absence of a valid affidavit, which, Gandhi’s counsel argues, deprives the court of jurisdiction.The revision petition, filed by advocate Vikas Tripathi, challenges a September 2025 order of the Magistrate Court that had dismissed his earlier complaint at the threshold. The Magistrate had held that questions of citizenship and electoral registration fall within the purview of the Central Government and Election Commission, and cannot be adjudicated through a criminal complaint.","Congress leader Sonia Gandhi has opposed a criminal revision petition filed against her in the Rouse Avenue Court.

"Ola, Uber and other app-based taxi drivers to hold day-long strike – all you need to know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ola-uber-and-other-app-based-taxi-drivers-to-hold-day-long-strike-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/128021472.cms,"NEW DELHI: App-based transport workers across India observed an All-India Breakdown on February 7 after unions representing gig drivers and delivery workers called for a nationwide shutdown to protest falling incomes, rising costs and what they described as increasing exploitation by platform companies.The protest was called by the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union and the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers, and involved drivers and delivery workers associated with major platforms such as Ola, Uber, Rapido, Porter and other app-based transport services. Unions said the agitation was aimed at pressing the Centre and state governments to implement minimum base fares under the Motor Vehicle Aggregator Guidelines, 2025.According to the unions, the failure to notify base fares has allowed aggregator companies to continue fixing prices unilaterally, forcing workers to put in longer hours for declining earnings and bear operational risks without protection.Shaik Salauddin, founder president of TGPWU and co-founder and national general secretary of IFAT, said the lack of government action had worsened working conditions for gig workers.“The Aggregator Guidelines, 2025, clearly mandate consultation with recognised worker unions before fare fixation. However, governments have failed to act, enabling platforms to deepen exploitation,” Salauddin said.The shutdown coincided with a day-long nationwide strike by app-based taxi and autorickshaw drivers called by the Maharashtra Kamgar Sabha to press demands including action against what they termed illegal bike taxi services and grievances related to mandatory panic button installations.In a statement, the union said drivers were facing a financial burden due to repeated changes in panic button approvals.“While there are 140 panic button device providers approved by the Central government, the state government has declared nearly 70 per cent of these companies unauthorised. As a result, cab drivers are being forced to remove previously installed devices and spend approximately Rs 12,000 unnecessarily to install new devices, causing severe financial hardship,” the statement said.Speaking to PTI, Maharashtra Kamgar Sabha head Dr Keshav Kshirsagar said the strike began across Maharashtra and other parts of the country in the morning and received support from most autorickshaw and taxi drivers. However, taxis and autorickshaws remained available on app-based platforms such as Uber, Ola and Rapido in several areas despite the call to keep vehicles off the roads.The unions have also flagged concerns over loss of income due to an increase in autorickshaws under the open permit policy and alleged that victims of accidents involving illegal bike taxis are denied insurance benefits.The February 7 protest follows earlier nationwide strikes by gig workers, including a shutdown by platform-based delivery workers on December 31, when unions warned of service disruptions during peak hours over low wages, long working hours and lack of social security.“In today's time, Swiggy Zomato delivery boys, Blinkit Zepto riders, Ola Uber drivers, are a workforce on the back of which these big companies have become unicorns; they have got billion-dollar valuations. In this entire ecosystem that has been created, if there's one group of people who are oppressed and under immense pressure, it's the gig workers,” an AAP MP said in an interview with ANI.Amid the nationwide agitation, a delegation of transport and delivery gig workers met Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi on Friday to press for central legislation and better implementation of regulations at the state level.Shaik Salauddin said the delegation raised long-standing concerns during the meeting. “This delegation included drivers and delivery workers from the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers. In Congress-ruled states, and even where we serve as the opposition, the election promises made to these workers have been acted upon. At the central level, the government is providing social-security schemes, but that is not a substitute for statutory law,” he said.Salauddin also praised the Karnataka government for enacting legislation for gig workers. “There was a detailed discussion. For about half an hour, the delegation described their problems one by one. We called on Congress governments in states where implementation has stalled to act promptly. We again congratulated Karnataka for being the first state to introduce a comprehensive law,” he added.Union leaders said protests would continue unless governments move to enforce fare regulations and provide statutory protections for gig workers in the app-based transport and delivery sector.",The protest was called by the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union and the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers. The shutdown coincided with a day-long nationwide strike by app-based taxi and autorickshaw drivers.

India-US Trade Deal Explained: What The White House Says On Tariffs, Markets And Tech Shifts

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Jairam Ramesh on Saturday took a “Dost dost na raha” jibe at PM Modi , referring to his and US President Donald Trump’s friendship, after the recently announced India-US trade framework.Ramesh criticised the deal, saying it benefits American farmers at the expense of Indian ones and raised concerns over India’s agreement to stop importing oil from Russia, confirmed by the White House.In an X post, Ramesh said, ""Nothing in the recently released US-India joint statement has been made clear regarding the details. But from what has come to light so far, it’s evident that: India will no longer import oil from Russia. Separately, the US has also announced that if India buys oil from Russia, directly or indirectly, a 25 per cent penalty could be reimposed.""""To help American farmers at the expense of Indian farmers, India will slash import duties by a huge margin. India’s annual imports from the US will triple, wiping out our long-standing surplus in goods trade. Uncertainty will persist over India’s exports of IT and other services to the US.India’s goods exports will face higher duties in the US than before.”Ramesh added that the ""photo-ops"" did not amount to much benefits for India.“All those hugs and photo-ops have yielded no special results.

Dost dost na raha,"" he added.The Congress leader’s criticism comes in response to the framework announced by India and the US for an Interim Agreement on trade. The framework reaffirms the countries’ commitment to broader Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) negotiations, launched by Donald Trump and PM Modi on February 13.These negotiations are expected to include additional market access commitments and support more resilient supply chains.As per the joint statement, the US will apply a reciprocal tariff rate of 18 per cent on Indian-originating goods, including textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, plastic and rubber, organic chemicals, home decor, artisanal products, and certain machinery.The US will also remove tariffs on certain aircraft and aircraft parts from India, previously imposed to address national security concerns.India, in turn, will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a wide range of food and agricultural products, including dried distillers’ grains (DDGs), red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits.India also intends to purchase $500 billion of US energy products, aircraft and aircraft parts, precious metals, technology products, and coking coal over the next five years.","Congress MP Jairam Ramesh took a “Dost dost na raha” jibe at PM Modi after the recently announced India-US trade framework.

Grand Welcome To Dance Record: Indian Diaspora Gears Up For PM Modi's Malaysia Visit

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday departed for a two-day visit to Malaysia, aiming to deepen defence and security cooperation and interact with the Indian diaspora in the country.Announcing his departure on X, PM Modi said, “At the invitation of my friend, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, I will be visiting Malaysia, a nation with which India’s ties are deep-rooted and extensive. This visit will boost our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and enhance cooperation across sectors.”“Malaysia is home to a vibrant Indian diaspora. Looking forward to today’s community programme in Kuala Lumpur, where I will get an opportunity to interact with our diaspora,” he added.In a statement quoted by PTI, PM Modi said, “The historic ties between India and Malaysia have seen steadfast progress in recent years. I look forward to my discussions with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, and further enhancing our comprehensive strategic partnership.”He further stated, “We will aim to deepen our defence and security ties, enhance our economic and innovation partnership, and expand our collaboration into new domains.”This visit marks PM Modi’s third trip to Malaysia and the first since bilateral relations were elevated to a “Comprehensive Strategic Partnership” in August 2024. The relationship had previously been upgraded to an “Enhanced Strategic Partnership” during PM Modi’s visit in 2015. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were first established in 1957.During the visit, PM Modi will hold bilateral talks with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. India is also exploring opportunities for defence collaboration, including the sale of Dornier aircraft and maintenance of Scorpene submarines and SU-30 aircraft, according to the ministry of external affairs.The prime mnister will engage with members of the Indian diaspora and business representatives in Malaysia, which is home to a 2.9 million-strong Indian community, the third-largest in the world and the second-largest PIO community, numbering 2.75 million.Malaysia is a key partner for India in ASEAN and the Indo-Pacific region and a central pillar of India’s Act East Policy. The Torana Gate in Kuala Lumpur, inaugurated by PM Modi and then Malaysian PM Najib Razak in 2015, symbolizes the enduring friendship between the two nations.PM Modi had previously met Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro on July 6, 2025, participated virtually in the 22nd ASEAN-India Summit in Kuala Lumpur on October 26, and spoke with him over a phone call on October 22.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves for two-day visit to Malaysia.

IFS/IAS appointees can’t reappear for 2026 Civil Services exam; IPS can’t choose IPS again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ifs/ias-appointees-cant-reappear-for-2026-civil-services-exam-ips-cant-choose-ips-again/articleshow/128019955.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at regulating repeated attempts at Civil Services Examination (CSE) by candidates selected for IAS , Indian Foreign Service (IFS) or IPS, the updated rules for the elite recruitment exam bar candidates already appointed to IAS or IFS, from appearing in CSE 2026.Even if such an appointment happens after 'prelims' 2026, the candidate will not be allowed to write the 'mains' exam or be considered for service from CSE-2026, as per the CSE 2026 rules notified on Wednesday.A candidate already appointed to IPS from an earlier CSE can apply for and appear in CSE-2026, but cannot relist IPS as his service preference. If a candidate is allocated IPS or any Group ‘A’ central service through CSE-2026, they will be allowed one improvement attempt in CSE-2027 by using a one-time training exemption. If a candidate selected through CSE-2026 neither joins training nor avails of exemption, his 2026 service allocation shall stand cancelled.Where a candidate selected through CSE-2026 reappears in CSE 2027 and obtains a better service, he must choose between 2026 and 2027 batch. If the candidate does not get any service in 2027 exam, he will be allowed to go back and join the service allocated based on CSE 2026. If the candidate does not join training of the finally chosen service (2026 or 2027), both the allocations shall get cancelled.After availing one improvement attempt (CSE-2027), the candidate cannot appear in CSE-2028 onwards unless he/she resigns from service. Candidates already in service from CSE-2025 or earlier, will have one chance to reappear in CSE 2026 or CSE 2027 without resigning. If they wish to appear for CSE 2028 and beyond, they must first resign from the allocated service. UPSC in its CSE 2026 notification has also done away with the cap on examination centre capacity for 'persons with benchmark disabilities' (PwBD) candidates , allowing them to be accommodated on priority. Initially, the existing capacity of each centre will be utilised by both PwBD and non-PwBD candidates. However, once a centre reaches full capacity, it will no longer be available for selection by non-PwBD candidates, while PwBD candidates will continue to have the option to select the same centre.CSE 2026 will also have more examination centres -- Meerut to decongest Delhi-NCR, Kanpur to ease pressure around Lucknow, and Bhubaneswar to supplement centres near Cuttack. It further allows candidates to indicate their preferred nearby cities from a dropdown menu, in addition to the notified examination centres. This data will serve as a survey of candidate preferences and may be used to identify locations for the creation of new examination centres, where feasible.","The updated rules for the elite recruitment exam bar candidates already appointed to IAS or IFS, from appearing in CSE 2026.

JAMMU: Border-related challenges had changed significantly over the past 60 years, and therefore advanced technological solutions must be adopted to effectively address them, Union home minister Amit Shah said Friday as he visited the Gurnam and Bobiyan outposts located along the India-Pakistan International Border in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir Later in the evening, Shah chaired a high-level security review meeting in Jammu at Lok Bhavan, which was attended by LG Manoj Sinha, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi, Union home secretary, IB director, J&K chief secretary and DGP, heads of CAPFs and other senior officers.At the meeting, while the home minister appreciated the efforts of the security agencies in dismantling the terror ecosystem, he directed them to remain alert and continue work in a coordinated mode to ensure that the gains made in recent times are sustained and the goal of a ‘terror free J&K’ is achieved at the earliest. He assured that all the resources would be made available by the govt to achieve this.Shah said the terror eco-system nurtured by elements inimical to the country in J&K had been almost crippled due to the concerted efforts of the Narendra Modi govt. Efforts for de-radicalisation had seen major success, he said, and instructed for taking more initiatives for youth engagement. Innovative measures to further reinforce the watertight security cordon were also discussed in the meeting.This was the second security review meeting chaired by the Union home minister within a month. On Jan 8, he had chaired a high-level review meeting in Delhi on J&K’s security situation.Earlier in the day, the home minister, addressing BSF personnel at the border posts in the sensitive Hiranagar sector, said while courage, alertness and dedication of personnel remained crucial, many emerging challenges were now technology-driven. “The govt will invest substantial funds to modernise the entire border security system based on technology. This modernisation will provide improved border infrastructure and advanced equipment for BSF personnel, enabling them to perform their duties more effectively,” he said.Lauding the border guarding troops, Shah said whenever the country’s borders had faced threats of intrusion or infiltration, BSF had stood like an impregnable wall, resolute in its commitment to safeguarding the nation. “The bravery and valour displayed by BSF during Operation Sindoor have added a golden chapter to its six-decade-long history,” he added.The home minister commended the sacrifices of BSF sub-inspector Mohammed Imteyaz and constable Deepak Chingakham in Pakistani firing during Operation Sindoor.Under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, the Govt of India was fully committed to the welfare of security personnel, the minister said, and announced that a special welfare scheme for BSF personnel will be introduced soon. He also appreciated the significant contribution of BSF women personnel towards border security. He later had lunch with the soldiers.","Amit Shah visited the Gurnam and Bobiyan outposts located along the India- Pakistan International Border in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir.

What’s at stake when it comes to your plate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-at-stake-when-it-comes-to-your-plate/articleshow/127979060.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. ‘Would you like fries with that?’ The girl behind the counter asked the American standing before me at the McDonald’s outlet. He hesitated. A long hesitation for what should have been the simplest of decisions. Big Mac. Drink. Fries. Yes or no. I grew impatient. Why was his choice so difficult? Only later did it strike me that the difficulty did not lie in the fries. It lay in the burger itself. Vegetarian. Vegan . Flexitarian. A single patty had splintered into moral choices. In that moment, under fluorescent lights and digital menus, I realised that food , once a matter of hunger , had quietly become a matter of conscience. The World Economic Forum recently published data on changing global food habits. Vegetarianism, once considered marginal in the West, is steadily rising across Europe and the United States. Curiously, it is declining in large emerging economies such as India, where traditional diets are slowly yielding to speed, packaging and convenience. Among Gen Z in Europe, vegetarianism is being embraced with fresh intensity: protecting animals, reducing environmental strain. The logic is simple. Growing plants asks less of the earth than raising animals. Vegetables require less land, water and energy. Fewer forests are cleared, fewer resources extracted, fewer gases released. That is why a vegetarian diet produces nearly two and a half times less carbon emissions than a meat-based one. Eating vegetarian for a year can save emissions equal to removing a small family car from the road for six months. Yet the case for meat-eating carries its own dignity. Across history, meat has been nourishment in difficult climates, insurance against crop failure, and a compact source of strength where options were limited. For many communities even today, meat is not indulgence but woven into livelihoods and traditions. In this light, meat-eating is not moral neglect, but practical inheritance. But long before climate charts and sustainability panels, the Tamil land approached food through a softer instinct—not calculation, but empathy. Across the world today, vegetarianism is no longer eccentric. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs adopt plant-based diets for health and longevity. European govts encourage reduced meat consumption. What appears newly awakened is, in truth, deeply old. This is where Thiruvalluvar excels as a poet of compassion. Avisorinthu āayiram vēṭṭalin oṉdṟaṉ Uyirsegutthu uṇṇāamai naṉdṟu Better than a thousand burnt offerings Is One life un-killed, un-eaten . A thousand ritual fires may blaze, but they do not equal the quiet mercy of restraint. Tamil Sangam literature echoes this gentleness. Puranānūru speaks of ascetics as kollā nōṉbiṉar, those who have vowed not to kill. Akanānūru describes hospitality through rice, milk, curd, fruits, honey, and vegetables. Meat appears openly in most places; its absence elsewhere is deliberate. Vegetarian food is not portrayed as denial, but as choice shaped by feeling. Power too once learned restraint. Emperor Ashoka’s edicts from the third century BCE recorded reduced slaughter, protected animals, and banned killing on certain days. After Kalinga, remorse hardened into mercy, carved into stone. Valluvar reminds us that progress is not only about what we invent but about what we choose not to harm. It was the same voice that echoed in saint poet Vallalar’s verse: ‘I shed tears seeing plants that wither without water’. And somewhere between a burger choice and a spared life, the question remains quietly unanswered.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Biometric and border control integration across all six nations. Common digital application and data-sharing platforms. Security and immigration protocols to ensure regional safety and streamlined entry.





The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) comprising of Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region. This initiative, often described as a “Schengen-style visa” for the Gulf, aims to let visitors enter all six member states on a single travel permit, eliminating the need to apply for separate visas for each country.Officials sometimes refer to this new permit as the GCC Grand Tours Visa or Unified GCC Tourist Visa. Travel and tourism authorities have repeatedly emphasised that this is not just a travel document but a key step in deeper regional economic integration and tourism growth.Although the unified visa was originally expected to start as early as late 2025, plans have been pushed to 2026 due to the complexity of aligning immigration systems, security protocols and data-sharing across six sovereign states. According to travel industry reporting, the rollout will unfold in stages:No exact day or month has been publicly confirmed yet as authorities have only reiterated that the visa will go live in 2026 (at latest early 2027 according to some officials).The unified GCC visa will be designed primarily for non-citizen visitors (tourists, business travellers, conference attendees and multiple-destination holidaymakers) who want to explore the Gulf without the hassle of applying for individual visas for each country. Key predicted eligibility criteria include:Authorities are expected to launch an online application portal where travellers can submit their details digitally and receive the visa electronically, similar to e-visa systems in other regions.Official fee structures have not yet been confirmed by GCC authorities, but industry sources and draft proposals indicate that the unified visa could cost in the range of US $100–$150 (approx. AED 367–550). This price range would make the unified GCC visa competitive with other regional multi-country visas, and far simpler than paying for six separate tourist visas for each member state.The digital process and single-application design are expected to reduce administrative overheads and processing delays, helping travellers plan trips without multiple embassy visits.While final rules are still pending official publication, proposals for the unified visa include several options:The exact structure (single entry vs multi-entry, extension rules, etc.) will be published when the official visa framework and application system launch, but authorities have emphasized flexibility to accommodate both short holidays and longer multi-destination itineraries.The GCC Unified Visa is considered a game-changer for travel and tourism in the Middle East Officials have drawn inspiration from the European Schengen visa model, though the GCC’s version will be adapted to regional needs and security standards. Before the visa becomes fully operational, GCC member states need to finalise:If pilot testing in late 2026 goes smoothly, widespread availability could follow in early 2027 though authorities remain optimistic about a 2026 launch for general applications.The GCC Unified Visa 2026 promises a major shift in how travellers explore the Gulf. It's launch is expected in 2026 (pilot late-year, full rollout to follow), eligibility includes tourists and other visitors with valid travel credentials, fees is estimated at US $100–$150 range with validity of likely 30–90 days, with single or multiple entries. This unified system could be a milestone for regional travel and a boost for the Gulf’s tourism, business and investment landscape.","The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region.

MUMBAI: Most companies reporting their financial results for Q3FY26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits attributing it to the new labour code. TOI takes a look at what brought about these changes and how does it affect stakeholders.The change relates mainly to gratuity payments under the Code on Social Security, 2020. The new rules redefine “wages” for calculating gratuity and expand eligibility for fixed-term employees.Under the revised rules, wages used to calculate gratuity must form at least 50% of an employee’s total cost-to-company (CTC). If allowances exceed 50% of CTC, the excess must be added back to wages for gratuity calculation. This increases the base on which gratuity is calculated.The law also allows fixed-term employees to become eligible for gratuity after completing one year of service instead of the earlier five-year requirement. Because of these changes, companies must account for higher future gratuity payouts, forcing them to create one-time provisions in their financial statements.The government introduced the change through the Code on Social Security, 2020, which forms part of four consolidated labour codes replacing 29 older labour laws.The codes were passed by Parliament in 2020, but detailed implementation rules were notified later.The reform aimed to simplify labour laws, improve social security coverage and reflect modern employment practices. A key concern was that many companies structured salaries with a low basic pay and high allowances to reduce statutory payouts such as provident fund and gratuity. The new definition of wages reduces this flexibility.Another trigger was the growing use of fixed-term employment across industries. The government sought to extend social security benefits to such workers, especially in sectors with high attrition and contractual hiring.The new labour codes, including the Social Security Code, came into force on November 21, 2025. While the central framework became effective from that date, states continue to finalise detailed implementation rules.Employees benefit mainly through higher gratuity payouts and wider eligibility. Because gratuity calculations now use a broader wage base, many employees will receive higher retirement or exit benefits.Fixed-term employees, who earlier did not qualify unless they completed five years of service, can now receive gratuity after one year. This benefits workers in sectors with short-term or project-based employment.The changes also aim to bring more transparency to salary structures and expand social security coverage.The financial impact varies depending on salary structure and workforce composition.Manufacturing and heavy industries: These sectors rely heavily on contract and fixed-term workers. The new rules increase gratuity liabilities and could push companies to review workforce models.Technology and IT services: These companies often use allowance-heavy salary structures. They may need to restructure compensation to meet the wage definition norms.Banking and financial services: The sector may see higher statutory benefit costs and increased liabilities for outsourced and contractual staff.Construction: The sector employs a large informal workforce. The new rules increase compliance requirements and settlement obligations.Retail and e-commerce: Companies with seasonal hiring and gig-based employment may face higher employee benefit costs and classification challenges.Healthcare: Round-the-clock operations and contract staffing could raise wage and benefit compliance costs.Manufacturing and heavy industries are expected to make the largest one-time provisions. These sectors typically have a large contract workforce, lower basic salary structures and higher dependence on fixed-term employment, which significantly increases gratuity liabilities.Technology and financial services companies are also likely to see sizeable increases due to changes in salary structure norms, though typically less than manufacturing.","Most companies reporting their financial results for Q3FY26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits.

Ramadan 2026 working hours in the UAE explained: Penalties and rules for private sector and government employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ramadan-2026-working-hours-in-the-uae-explained-penalties-and-rules-for-private-sector-and-government-employees/articleshow/127923197.cms,"Ramadan 2026 in UAE: How Will Working Hours Change for You?

Why working hours change during Ramadan in the UAE



UAE Ramadan 2026: Reduced Working Hours for Private and Government Sectors

Private sector during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE: Mandatory two-hour reduction



How it works:



If a regular workday was 8 hours, it becomes 6 hours during Ramadan.

Employers may offer additional flexibility, such as remote work or staggered schedules, provided the reduced hours rule is followed.

This rule is not optional as companies that do not implement the reduction can face legal consequences, including labour complaints and possible penalties if inspected by MoHRE.

Tip for employees:

Government/public sector during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE: Set reduced hours and flexibility



Typical government hours during Ramadan 2026



Monday to Thursday: 9:00 am to 2:30 pm

9:00 am to 2:30 pm Friday: 9:00 am to 12:00 pm (shorter to allow for Jummah prayer and family time)

Flexible arrangements



School hours and broader work-life adjustments during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE



UAE Employers Face Penalties for Ignoring Ramadan Working Hour Laws

Legal backing and employer responsibilities during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE



Employers should:



Apply the two-hour reduction for private sector workers.

Ensure government department staff adhere to the FAHR-issued Ramadan hours.

Offer reasonable flexibility when operationally possible to support employee well-being.

Failure to comply with mandated Ramadan working hours may expose employers to labour disputes, inspections or penalties — especially in the private sector where these reductions are legally binding.

What this means for UAE workers during Ramadan 2026



Shorter workdays with at least two hours reduced for private workers.

Government hours typically from 9 am to 2:30 pm (Mon–Thu) and 9 am to 12 pm (Fri).

Flexibility options such as remote work where feasible.

School schedule adjustments and broader lifestyle shifts in line with Ramadan culture.





As the holy month of Ramadan 2026 approaches (expected to begin around February 18–19, 2026 after the crescent moon sighting), residents and workers across the United Arab Emirates are preparing for annual adjustments to daily routines including reduced working hours in both the private and government sectors. These changes are designed to help employees balance work responsibilities with fasting, prayer and family time during the sacred month.The working-hour adjustments are not just tradition or goodwill, they are formally recognised within UAE labour regulations and official government circulars.Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, during which many Muslims fast from dawn until dusk, engage in prayer, reflection and community gatherings. In recognition of the physical and spiritual demands of fasting, authorities in the UAE modify work schedules to allow workers time to maintain energy, attend religious activities and manage family life.According to the UAE’s labour law (Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021), working hours during Ramadan are specifically determined by executive regulations, requiring shorter daily schedules for employees unless otherwise authorised.For most private sector employees in the UAE, daily working hours are reduced by two hours throughout Ramadan. This reduction applies to all employees under the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE), regardless of their religion or fasting status.Any private sector employer who keeps standard hours throughout Ramadan is not complying with UAE labour regulations and can be reported to authorities.For federal government employees, the Federal Authority for Government Human Resources (FAHR) issues specific working schedules to balance productivity and observance.These hours represent a reduction of about 3.5 hours on weekdays and 1.5 hours on Fridays compared with normal schedules.Government entities are also encouraged to introduce flexible work options, including remote work on Fridays for up to 70% of staff where operationally feasible, without affecting service delivery.In addition to workplace changes, school hours are usually shortened during Ramadan to accommodate fasting students and teachers, with many institutions operating on adjusted timetables.At the same time, routine city services such as public parking, tolls and other community functions also adapt their timings to reflect the daily rhythm of Ramadan life.Under UAE law, the obligation to reduce working hours in Ramadan is grounded in Article 17 of the Labour Law and its executive regulations, which explicitly empower authorities to set specific working hours during Ramadan.For 2026’s Ramadan season, likely starting mid-February, both private and public sector employees in the UAE should expect:These changes offer a practical blend of cultural respect and workplace productivity, helping employees maintain spiritual practices without sacrificing essential functions of daily life in the UAE during the holy month.","Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, during which many Muslims fast from dawn until dusk.

Why Amazon is shutting down Amazon Go and Fresh stores

Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain. The decision of the company to shut down the Amazon Fresh stores will lead to thousands of job cuts across the US. Last week, the e-commerce major announced that it will close around 60 Fresh stores which will put an end to the effort of six-years. As reported by Business Insider, the WARN notices filed in various states confirm the sale of layoffs. As aper the filling, in California only the company will shut down 20 Fresh stores which will affect around 3,900 workers. Most Fresh locations closed to the public on February 1, though California stores will remain open until mid-March due to state law.As Amazon is shutting down the Fresh stores, it has outlined two main options for the affected employees. The company is giving a choice to the employees in which they can either choose the severance pay or can take transfer within the company. The workers will continue to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after the closure announcement, or until April 28. The compensation offered by the company will be based on either the minimum pay for their employee class of their average hours worked over the past 60 days whichever is higher.The report further adds that employees who do not secure another role within the company by late April will then receive severance packages, calculated as one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of four weeks’ pay, with the possibility of up to 20 weeks depending on tenure.For those seeking to remain within Amazon, the company is encouraging Fresh workers to apply for similar positions at Whole Foods Stores or Amazon grocery warehouse via its internal A to Z portal. An Amazon spokesperson said: “All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we’re providing career transition services to help them explore options.”Amazon Fresh associates typically earned between $16 and $20 per hour, according to data from job site Indeed. Their responsibilities ranged from picking delivery orders to handling checkout operations.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model. On the other hand, Whole Food Market acquired in 2017 by Amazon say strong growth with sales rising more than 40% in recent years. Also, Amazon’s online grocery business also witnessed a surge with perishable grocery sales through Same-Day Delivery growing 40x since January 2025, making fresh groceries one of the most-ordered categories on its platform.",Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain.

Despite a significant selloff in software stocks triggered by Anthropic's legal AI tools, they argue AI will enhance, not replace, existing software, enabling greater productivity and innovation.

Nvidia's Huang chimes in with Pichai, calls selloff 'most illogical thing in the world'

What exactly triggered the selloff

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Why the fear runs deeper than one plugin

Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't buying the panic. During the company's earnings call, Pichai pushed back against the market hysteria triggered by Anthropic's new AI plugins, calling it overblown. AI is ""an enabling tool,"" he said, just as it has been for Google 's own products—Search, YouTube and others. Companies ""seizing the moment"" will find the same opportunity ahead, he added.His comments come as software stocks worldwide nurse heavy losses. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins, wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single session. Analysts dubbed it a 'SaaSpocalypse'. Pichai's view? The scramble is overdone.Pichai isn't alone in questioning the market reaction. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was even more direct at a Cisco event, calling the selloff ""the most illogical thing in the world."" His take: AI will use existing software tools, not reinvent them. ""Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?"" he asked. Huang added that Nvidia itself has adopted such tools extensively, freeing up employees to focus on designing chips and computer systems.Software company executives have also pushed back, arguing they do far more than just build code. Their offerings include data management and purpose-built solutions that are difficult to replicate, especially for enterprises outside the tech world like retail and oil and gas.Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its agentic AI assistant for non-technical professionals. Most covered standard enterprise functions—sales, marketing, finance, customer support. But the legal plugin rattled nerves. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings.Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan called it ""a sign of intensifying competition"" that could hurt big players in the legal space. The fallout was swift. Thomson Reuters and RELX both closed down around 15%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. Indian IT stocks weren't spared—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5%, Wipro fell nearly 5%.The concern isn't just about legal workflows. There's a dawning realisation that AI tools can now do far more than most non-techies realise. With relatively simple prompts, they can take over a user's computer, write software, analyse stock market data, manage emails and countless other tasks. People have taken to social media describing how they built their first software program without ever learning to code. Shopify's CEO built software that could interpret his recent MRI.Meta's CFO Susan Li told investors last week that the company has seen a 30% year-over-year increase in output per engineer driven by AI coding tools. Power users have seen an 80% boost.Anthropic's numbers back up the concern. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, months after launch. The company is reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation. Jefferies noted that OpenAI is losing corporate ground to Claude, with enterprises now making up 80% of Anthropic's business.Pichai and Huang are betting the panic subsides. Wall Street isn't so sure yet.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismiss market panic over AI plugins, calling it overblown.

Impact on Mutual Funds

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-led Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Friday kept the repo rate unchanged at 5.25% in line with expectations from market analysts and economists. The decision to hold the repo rate was driven by resilient GDP growth and benign inflation, amid global headwinds.“After a detailed assessment of the evolving macroeconomic conditions and the outlook, the MPC voted unanimously to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent; consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) remains at 5.00 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 5.50 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the neutral stance,” announced RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra.“The MPC noted that since the last policy meeting, external headwinds have intensified though the successful completion of trade deals augurs well for the economic outlook. Overall, the near-term domestic inflation and growth outlook remain positive,” he added.What does the RBI monetary policy say on India’s GDP growth and inflation outlook? What does the decision to keep repo rate at 5.25% mean for your loan EMIs, fixed deposit and mutual fund investments? We take a look:According to RBI, on the growth front, economic activity remains resilient.The First Advance Estimates suggest continuing growth momentum, driven by domestic factors amidst a challenging external environment. The growth outlook remains favourable.The Indian economy continues on a steadily improving trajectory, with real GDP poised to register significantly higher growth of 7.4% in 2025-26, as compared to the previous year, it said.Real GDP growth projections for Q1:2026-27 and Q2 have been revised upwards to 6.9% and 7.0%, respectively . The risks are evenly balanced.The projections for the full year to the April policy have been deferred by RBI as the new GDP series will be released later in the month.RBI noted that the headline CPI inflation remained low in November and December even as it firmed up by one percentage point in these two months. This increase was largely driven by the lower rate of deflation in the food group. Excluding gold, core inflation remained stable at 2.6 per cent in December.“In terms of the headline inflation trajectory, despite the anticipated momentum being muted, unfavourable base effects stemming from large decline in prices observed during Q4:2024-25 would lead to an uptick in y-o-y inflation in Q4:2025-26. Considering all these factors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at 2.1 per cent with Q4 at 3.2 per cent. CPI inflation for Q1:2026-27 and Q2 are projected at 4.0 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively. Excluding precious metals, the underlying inflation pressures remain muted. The risks are evenly balanced,” RBI governor said.In view of the impending release of the new CPI series (base 2024=100) on February 12, 2026, similar to growth, RBI will now share CPI inflation projection for the full year 2026-27 in the April policy.RBI has cut the repo rate by 1.25% since early 2025. This has led to a similar lowering in loan rates and hence EMIs for borrowers. With the central bank maintaining the status quo on repo rate, EMIs are unlikely to come down further for now.According to Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar, a status-quo decision reinforces the central bank’s preference to monitor inflation trends, liquidity conditions and transmission before initiating the next phase of rate action.“The cumulative easing already delivered has largely flowed through to retail lending, making home loan rates relatively competitive compared to recent years. Even in a pause scenario, affordability conditions remain supportive, aided by steady spreads, lender competition and selective seasonal concessions. Borrowers can continue to optimize savings by retaining higher EMIs to compress loan tenures and reduce total interest costs,” he says.“Balance transfer opportunities and loan restructuring options also remain relevant for those seeking incremental efficiencies. Stable rates, combined with sustained housing demand and improved project execution, create a conducive environment for long-term home buyers, particularly end users focused on financial predictability rather than short-term rate movements,” he adds.When the RBI cuts the repo rate, banks in turn lower the rates for fixed deposits. “A pause in the repo rate sustains the gradual moderation in deposit returns already underway following earlier policy actions. High-yield fixed deposits are becoming increasingly selective, with most mainstream offerings consolidating within a narrower band. While current liquidity conditions continue to support deposit mobilisation, the likelihood of materially higher FD rates emerging remains limited in a steady-rate environment,” Adhil Shetty says.“Investors assessing locking strategies may benefit from spreading allocations across multi-year tenures to preserve returns before further repricing takes place. Senior citizen premiums remain an advantage, though these too are expected to evolve as banks adjust to a stable but lower reference-rate regime,” he said.According to Adhil Shetty, bond market participants may interpret this as supportive of stable-to-gradually-softening yields, creating a constructive environment for medium- to long-duration debt and gilt funds over time.“For mutual fund investors, a stable rate regime allows capital appreciation opportunities in debt portfolios without immediate yield compression, while equity markets benefit from policy continuity and earnings visibility. A balanced asset allocation approach—combining steady SIP flows in equities with calibrated duration exposure in debt—continues to remain an effective strategy for navigating evolving interest rate cycles,” he says.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-led Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Friday kept the repo rate unchanged at 5.25% in line with expectations from market analysts and economists.

Inside the 32-hour operation to contain Mumbai–Pune Expressway gas leak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/32-hour-delay-what-slowed-punemumbai-expressway-tanker-gas-leak-response/articleshow/127952077.cms,"Pune- Mega Cycling Event, Traffic System, Future Skills & More

What needs to be done immediately

A clearly defined, legally binding SOP must be put in place for responding to chemical and gas tanker emergencies

It should spell out roles of oil companies, district administrations, police, fire brigades, and disaster response teams, along with strict response timelines

Petroleum companies, gas refineries, and chemical manufacturers must be mandated to deploy dedicated rescue and recovery vans, equipped to handle compressed gas leaks

These units should be strategically stationed along major highways and industrial corridors to ensure rapid response

Movement of highly hazardous gas tankers should be restricted to designated time windows — preferably during low-traffic hours — to minimise public risk and allow quicker isolation of accident sites if required

Drivers transporting hazardous materials must undergo compulsory training in emergency response

Each tanker should carry a basic emergency kit capable of addressing minor leakages, along with real-time communication systems to alert authorities instantly

State govts need to invest in specialised training for fire services, police, and disaster management personnel to handle hazardous material emergencies

Regular mock drills on highways and near industrial hubs must be institutionalised

Growing risk on highways

The scale of hazardous material movement across the country is staggering

Nearly 1,000 propylene gas tankers travel daily from refineries in Kochi, Visakhapatnam, Chennai, and Jamnagar, supplying industries across India

In addition, around 4,000 ammonia tankers originate from Maharashtra's industrial hubs such as Taloja and Chembur, moving to southern states and other regions

Experts warn that while propylene is highly flammable, an ammonia leak would be far more dangerous, releasing toxic gases that could make containment virtually impossible in densely populated or high-traffic areas

Expert Speak

— Amit Bhargava | Co-founder & CEO of Canada-based EnviroApp (hazmat shipping solutions company)





PUNE: The 32-hour-long operation to neutralise a leaking propylene gas tanker on the Pune–Mumbai expressway threw a harsh spotlight on the lack of preparedness, specialised manpower, and equipment within the state's hazardous materials (hazmat) response system, disaster management experts said.The long-winded series of events began around 5pm on Tuesday evening, when a tanker carrying nearly 21,000kg of highly flammable propylene gas overturned near the Adoshi tunnel.Bhalchandra Chavan, director of the state disaster management department, told TOI, ""We could not operate at the site as we did not have the capabilities and trained personnel to operate in such an environment. We were totally dependent on private agencies that eventually helped us. To tackle such emergencies, we will take the necessary steps and train our personnel.""A senior official from state disaster management added, ""As multiple agencies were on board and since the gas was highly inflammable, we took extra precautions to ensure the safety of commuters and personnel involved in the operation. This took extra time since the operation was in the ghat section and there was huge traffic congestion.So, it hampered the operation and thereby consumed extra time.""Despite the gravity of the situation, specialised response teams did not reach the site for several hours. Officials confirmed that the operation eventually stretched to over 32 hours not because of the complexity alone, but due to delays in mobilising trained hazmat experts and appropriate equipment.Technical intervention was finally led by a private agency, Mec Elec Industrial Services, whose team reached the site only on Wednesday morning. By then, propylene continued to escape the tanker. ""This was not a conventional fuel spill. Propylene is a compressed, highly volatile gas. Any wrong move could have triggered a massive blast,"" said a senior disaster management official, pointing out that most state agencies lacked hands-on experience in such scenarios.ZN Gawade, technical director of Mec Elec Industrial Services (MEIS), Thane, a private agency which played a crucial role in the operation, told TOI that the situation on the ground was extremely volatile and critical.""All three top-mounted ball valves on the tanker were damaged in the rollover and were leaking. Liquid propylene was discharging from every connection, forcing authorities to stop traffic in both directions. Lower Explosive Limit readings were alarmingly high even 500m from the site, underscoring the severe explosion risk,"" he said.Working under life-threatening conditions, the response team managed to arrest two out of three leaks — one liquid and one vapour valve. The third valve, however, posed a formidable challenge. Bent sharply during impact, its handle jammed against the weld cap, making operation impossible while liquid propylene continued to escape, officials said.Gawade reached the site on Wednesday morning, travelling against traffic flow in a police-escorted ambulance. After a detailed technical assessment, the team opted for a high-risk decanting strategy — transferring the tanker's contents through the single operable vapour valve into multiple empty propylene tankers.""The objective was to reduce the liquid level inside the damaged tanker until the leaking valve began releasing vapour instead of liquid, significantly lowering the hazard,"" he said.""By around 4.30pm, specialised transfer hoses were connected and liquid transfer was initiated using pressure differential, with receiving tankers carefully depressurised. The process was repeated thrice, each transfer conducted with extreme caution due to loosened valves and mechanical instability,"" said Madhav Divekar, director of MEIS.Once the leaking valve began venting vapour — indicating the liquid level dropped below roughly 50% — authorities prepared for the next critical phase: lifting the overturned tanker. The operation was carried out with extensive multi-agency support, including the police, NDRF, fire brigade, and other state and local agencies. Four cranes and multiple fire tenders were deployed, and the plan was rehearsed in detail before execution, Divekar said.""As anticipated, the leak briefly intensified when residual liquid contacted the damaged valve via the dip pipe. The response team swiftly arrested the final leak, preventing escalation at a critical moment. At around 1.30am on Thursday, the tanker was escorted through the ghat section under strict safety supervision,"" he said.""Despite still containing a significant quantity of propylene, another delicate operation was undertaken, partially opening the bent liquid valve to decant additional product into a fourth tanker. The tanker was finally transported to the Khalapur tanker testing station, reaching the facility at around 5am. By then, the technical team worked continuously for almost 36 hours, navigating one of the most complex and hazardous compressed-gas response operations witnessed on an Indian highway in recent years,"" Divekar added.India has thousands of hazmat tankers moving daily. Therefore, it is essential to have designated routes for transportation of ‘dangerous goods' across highways to prevent incidents like this","The long-winded series of events began around 5pm on Tuesday evening, when a tanker carrying nearly 21,000kg of highly flammable propylene gas overturned near the Adoshi tunnel. Officials confirmed that the operation eventually stretched to over 32 hours not because of the complexity alone, but due to delays in mobilising trained hazmat experts and appropriate equipment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127972569,imgsize-85718,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/the-long-winded-series-of-events-began-around-5pm-on-tuesday-evening-when-a-tanker-carrying-nearly-21000kg-of-highly-flammable-propylene-gas-overturned-near-the-adoshi-tunnel.jpg"

'Reasons For Reducing Russian Oil Imports Are...' Foreign Expert Explains India-US Trade Framework

India will reportedly reduce its Russian oil imports following the deal with the US, who has agreed to cut trade tariffs in exchange. US President Donald Trump signed an order removing the additional 25 per cent duty on Indian imports after India promised to decrease Russian oil purchases.While refiners haven't received official orders to stop buying Russian oil, they've been informally told to scale back, according to sources quoted by PTI.Officially, when asked during the MEA briefing last week about India putting a stop on buying Russian oil, spokesperson Rabdhir Jaiwal cited energy security guiding India's decisions. “The government has stated publicly on several occasions that ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion Indians is the supreme priority of our government. Diversifying our energy sourcing in keeping with objective market conditions and evolving international dynamics is at the core of our strategy to ensure this. All of India’s decisions were taken and will be taken with this in mind,” he said.Most Indian refiners will honor their existing orders but won't place new ones. Companies like HPCL, MRPL, and HMEL already stopped buying Russian oil after US sanctions last year.IOC and BPCL are planning to wind down their purchases. Reliance Industries, India's biggest buyer, will likely stop after receiving its final shipment of 150,000 barrels.Nayara Energy stands as an exception. The company faces sanctions from the EU and UK due to its Russian connections, with Rosneft holding a 49.13 per cent stake. This has left Nayara with limited options, forcing it to continue buying Russian oil from non-sanctioned entities.India's Russian oil imports have been falling since US sanctions hit Rosneft and Lukoil. December 2025 saw imports of 1.2 million barrels per day, down from 2.1 million in May 2023. January saw further decline to 1.1 million barrels. Experts expect this number to drop below 1 million soon.""Russian volumes remain largely locked in for the next 8-10 weeks and continue to be economically critical for India's complex refining system,"" said Sumit Ritolia from Kpler. He expects imports to stay between 1.1-1.3 million barrels daily through early Q2.India, which imports 90% of its oil needs, benefited from discounted Russian oil after Western sanctions following the Ukraine invasion. The new US deal might include increased American oil purchases and potential Venezuelan oil imports.Prashant Vasisht from Icra noted that replacing Russian oil shouldn't significantly impact India's import bill, estimating an increase of less than 2%. He suggested Venezuelan crude, being cheaper and suitable for Indian refineries, could be a viable alternative.","India will reportedly reduce its Russian oil imports following the deal with the US, who has agreed to cut trade tariffs in exchange.

Future of a giant golden Trump statue ‘Don Colossus’ remains uncertain despite completion; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/future-of-a-giant-golden-trump-statue-don-colossus-remains-uncertain-despite-completion-heres-why/articleshow/128060007.cms,"(Image credits: AFP)

A massive gold-leafed statue of US President Donald Trump lies on its back inside a sculpture studio in Ohio, its future uncertain more than a year after it was completed.The 15-foot bronze sculpture, dubbed “Don Colossus,” depicts Trump raising his fist moments after surviving an assassination attempt in July 2024. Once installed on a 6,000-pound base, it is designed to stand two storeys tall.The statue was commissioned for $360,000 by cryptocurrency entrepreneurs backing Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. But it has yet to be formally erected, partly because sculptor Alan Cottrill says he has not been fully paid.“I would be a fool to install it without the payment being made, and I am not a fool,” said Cottrill, 73, who says he is still owed around $92,000, as quoted by AP.The stalled project has become a symbol of the instability surrounding cryptocurrency ventures, and of the shifting alliances within Trump’s political and financial orbit.Cottrill alleges that after he was hired, the project’s backers went behind his back and began using images of the sculpture to promote their $PATRIOT cryptocurrency. The token is a meme coin — a digital asset with no intrinsic value that depends on speculation and online communities to build its price.Trump’s close ties to the crypto sector have drawn accusations of major conflicts of interest. Bloomberg News estimates the Trump family fortune grew by $1.4 billion last year from digital assets alone.The $PATRIOT coin launched in November 2024 and drew strong interest as Trump swept the US presidential election that month. But its momentum was short-lived.Days before his January inauguration, and just ahead of the planned unveiling of the statue, Trump launched his own cryptocurrency, $TRUMP. As $TRUMP surged, $PATRIOT’s value collapsed. Although it continues to trade, the coin is now worth more than 95 per cent less than its peak.Those behind $PATRIOT include Republican strategist Dustin Stockton, who was investigated by federal agents over his work on “We Build The Wall,” a fundraising effort that led Trump adviser Steve Bannon to plead guilty to defrauding donors. Stockton did not immediately respond to AFP requests for comment.At his studio in Zanesville, Ohio, about 300 miles west of Washington, Cottrill speaks proudly of his work and his long career. He has sculpted at least 17 US presidents, including a statue of Thomas Edison that stands at the US Capitol.“When they said 15-feet tall, they were starting to get to the scale of my ego,” he laughed.Cottrill says it took a month to create the life-sized figure, followed by three more months to enlarge it, cast it in bronze, and have his team polish and buff the surface by hand.“It’s just overpowering. It’s mammoth,” he said.The project was not without creative disputes. Cottrill said he sculpted the 79-year-old Republican leader’s “turkey neck,” but the crypto backers objected and asked for a more flattering, less realistic look.Trump’s hair proved to be another challenge.“The hardest thing was sculpting his hair. Holy shmoly! Oi yoi yoi!” he exclaimed. “You can’t sculpt and cast something that is…” he paused, trying to find the right word, “wispy.”Asked to reflect on his experience working with the cryptocurrency world, Cottrill was blunt. “The short answer is, I won’t do it again.”More than a year after it was finished, the statue now appears to have a home at the Trump National Doral golf resort in Miami. Cottrill installed the base there last month, but no unveiling date has been announced.","The 15-foot bronze sculpture depicts Trump raising his fist moments after surviving an assassination attempt in July 2024.
