BHOPAL: The design of the newly constructed Aishbagh railway overbridge in Bhopal has come under scrutiny, with experts raising concerns and state minister Vishwas Sarang set to visit the site on 14 June for inspection.The overbridge is not yet open to traffic. Officials are considering correcting the identified issues before its formal inauguration. Similar concerns had earlier been raised about the Ganesh Mandir–Gayatri Mandir flyover, which was inaugurated by chief minister Mohan Yadav.Following media reports and expert inputs, some engineers involved in that project were suspended.“The turn in the middle of the overbridge at the right angle is an issue. Bhaiya (Sarang) has taken up the issue with engineers involved in the project and correction as required would be made in the design,” said Mukesh Lodhi, PRO to Sarang. He confirmed the minister’s scheduled visit.Retired chief engineer, PWD, V K Amar, told, “Design of the overbridge is glaringly faulty. Whenever there is a turn on an overbridge, you give a curve so as to alert the driver about the turn ahead but here, you have a turn on the right angle without any curve and any driver would be taken by surprise at the turn and it would become an accident-prone area.""""The design will have to be altered by giving a curve 100 metres ahead of the actual turn, so that a driver is ready for the turn as it arrives,"" he said.The Rs 18 crore overbridge was completed after an eight-year delay. Local residents have also raised concerns.“Residents waited ten years for this bridge. Instead of relief upon its completion, the community raised significant safety issues. The primary concern centres on the sharp 90-degree turn at the bridge’s peak, which vehicles must traverse, posing considerable risks,” said Aslam, a resident of Aishbagh locality.Railway authorities clarified that their responsibility was limited to the section over the tracks. “We are responsible for the bridges built over the railway tracks. The approach roads of the bridge were built by PWD,” said Nawal Agrawal, PRO of Bhopal Railway Division.An engineer associated with the project, speaking toon condition of anonymity, cited limited space and the presence of a nearby metro station as factors behind what he described as a “distinctive design”.PWD officials said an inspection team had assessed the site and would submit a report. Additional Chief Secretary (PWD) Neeraj Mandoli did not respond to calls or messages.",The design of the Aishbagh railway overbridge in Bhopal has come under scrutiny.

Poll Do you think the Vande Bharat train service will boost tourism in Jammu and Kashmir? Yes, definitely No, not really

NEW DELHI: A day after travelling on the newly launched Vande Bharat train from Srinagar to Katra, Jammu and Kashmir National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah visited the Vaishno Devi shrine and offered prayers on Wednesday.""I had a good darshan and I hope that we will get what I prayed for. We want prosperity, unity, brotherhood. We all want India to grow so that we can be part of that,"" the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said.Farooq Abdullah also praised the Vande Bharat train service, calling it the ""biggest gift"" for the people of Jammu and Kashmir as it connects the territory with the entire country.""This is the biggest gift to connect Jammu and Kashmir with the entire country... I had tears in my eyes when I crossed the Chenab Bridge. Finally, the day has come when we can travel to the country from Kashmir by train.

Engine failure, bird hit among several theories

On Cam: How Boeing 787 Whistleblower's Disaster Warning Was Ignored | Ahmedabad Crash | Air India

DGCA statement hints at dual engine failure |

MUMBAI: Two short videos surfaced after AI 171 crashed outside Ahmedabad airport - many questions followed, from those who have flown commercial airliners. On social media, pilots were asking:1. Why was the aircraft landing gear not retracted?2. Did the aircraft suffer a dual engine failure?3. Did the engines die because of possible fuel contamination or blockage?4. Were the flaps on the wings lowered for take-off?5. Could a bird hit have contributed to the crash?The final investigation report into the AI-171 accident, set to be released before June 12 next year, will have a detailed analysis of probable causes and contributory factors. But for aviation professionals, the two videos offered many clues.Also read: Air India Ahmedabad-London flight crashes near airport shortly after takeoff; 241 dead ""Within 5 secs of lift off, pilots normally put the landing gear up,"" said Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert. Capt Manoj Hathi, ex-Air India official who has held posts of director (ops) and director (air-safety) said: ""As soon as a positive rate of climb is reached, the landing gear is retracted.""A lowered landing gear increases drag and fuel consumption, while reducing aircraft speed. Retracting the landing gear allows for a smooth aerodynamic flow helping the aircraft climb up. But the clips showed the landing gear extended even as the plane climbed to over 400 feet above ground.Also read: Ahmedabad air crash: Why accidents are common during take-offs, landings What could be the reason why AI-171 had not retracted its landing gear although it had climbed to a height of around 400 feet?""In case there is a distraction the pilots could forget to put the gear up.The distraction could be dual engine failure, bird hit or combination of both. The plume of dust as the aircraft crosses the runway end shows it was low on power and possibly a dual engine problem,"" said air safety expert Capt Amit Singh.Capt Manoj Hathi, a former AI official, said, ""It's possible that a dual engine flame-out was the reason the landing gear could not be retracted. Dual engine failure could occur due to bird ingestion or fuel contamination. Looking at the trajectory and body angle of the aircraft, it appears as if the aircraft has stalled because of loss of speed.""Other pilots, who requested anonymity, too, spoke about dual engine failure and possible fuel contamination. The possibility of a dual engine failure is a rare event with about seven documented accidents in the past seven decades.DGCA in its statement said the pilots gave a MAYDAY call seconds after take-off, further supporting the theory that a dual engine failure occurred probably after the aircraft crossed the speed beyond which a take-off cannot be safely aborted.Video clips show the aircraft gliding and descending over a congested area chock-a-block with buildings. Seconds later, the aircraft nose is raised - AI-171's pilots were probably trying to keep the aircraft from crashing in a congested locality. But raising the nose results in loss of airspeed.The clip shows the aircraft disappear from view and crash. But even if the pilots had not pulled up the nose it would have continued to glide, descend and eventually crash, said Capt Singh. The other point was the flaps - aerodynamic devices that are lowered to increase lift on the wing. While some pilots said the flaps were not lowered as is the norm during take-off, others said the pictures show they were lowered.Investigation into aircraft accidents carried out by civil aviation authorities such as the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) follow norms laid down in the International Civil Aviation Organisation's Annex 13. It states that the primary objective of an investigation should not be to assign blame, but to identify and prevent future similar incidents.Under Annex 13, a preliminary report should be ready within 30 days of the event. But ICAO leaves it to the state (India, in this case) to decide whether to make it public or keep it private. The final report, though, which should be published within a year of the accident, is made public.","Two short videos surfaced after AI 171 crashed outside Ahmedabad airport.

HP EliteBook Ultra G1i Review: Thin, light, power in a premium package

Deloitte is letting its US employees spend part of their annual wellness subsidy on Lego sets, puzzles, and other stress-relieving items. According to a Business Insider, the action is part of a revamped effort by the company to support worker well-being. According to internal policy documents seen by the publication, the Big Four consulting firm updated its long-running benefits program at the start of its financial year on June 1. The program gives most salaried employees up to $1,000 annually to spend on approved items that promote mental, physical, or financial wellness, the report says. Legos, along with puzzles, kitchen appliances, spa services, gaming consoles, and ergonomic pillows, are among the new additions.Deloitte US had 172,800 employees in 2024. As per the report, employees have welcomed the change. A Deloitte employee said that the update sparked jokes and excitement on internal chats. “Most of the responses are things like ‘Lego?!?!? Finally!’ or jokes about how they can now rationalise buying the coveted Millennium Falcon Star Wars Lego set,” they said. The $850 set leaves a small remainder of the subsidy for other qualifying purchases.Another Deloitte employee said that the benefit helps manage the intense pace of work: “Knocking out a four-hour Lego build in under two hours is a great stress reliever.”However, not all employees are happy with it. Some Deloitte employees remain skeptical. One staffer told BI the perk exists “because of how much this job sucks.”The updated program comes as Deloitte’s US division faces challenges, particularly in its government consulting arm. By April 2025, at least 127 federal contracts had been modified or canceled following the White House’s push to cut spending. Deloitte Consulting CEO Jason Salzetti later confirmed that a “small percentage” of employees in the government division would be laid off.","The Big Four consulting firm updated its long-running benefits program at the start of its financial year on June 1.

Bill Gates spent $38 million on equestrian real estate for daughter Jennifer

A 4.5-acre horse farm for $8.7 million.

In 2016, he bought a neighboring 4.5-acre estate for $13.5 million.

He then snapped up two vacant lots for around $5 million.

Another 5.2-acre compound with barns and residential buildings was acquired for $8.7 million.

Finally, a 1.3-acre plot was purchased for $2.5 million to complete the puzzle.

‘Like Pac-Man’: Bill Gates quietly bought out an entire neighborhood

The Bill Gates’ approach to parenting

“We absolutely did not just buy them things. It was much more of an upbringing like I grew up in. A very middle-class household where money did dictate whether I got an extra pair of shoes that year or not.”

Jennifer Gates: From equestrian star to pediatrician

“Pediatrician incoming!!!”

“This is a dream come true,”

After Stanford, Jennifer Gates got a 124-acre horse estate

When it comes to supporting their children’s passions, most parents settle for lessons, gear, or maybe even a trip to a championship. But when you're Bill Gates , the Microsoft co-founder and one of the richest men in the world, the scale of parental support takes a whole new dimension.In what might be one of the most extravagant gestures of modern parenthood, Gates reportedly spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams. What began as a simple rental in 2011 evolved into a strategic series of acquisitions that transformed the elite Mallet Hill Court neighborhood into a private horse-centric haven, complete with barns, mansions, and lots of privacy.The Gates family initially dipped their toes into Wellington’s equestrian scene in 2011, renting a home for four months at a cost of $500,000. Their teenage daughter, Jennifer, was already training as a competitive show jumper, and Wellington, a hub for global equestrian sports, was the perfect base.By 2013, Bill Gates had made his first major purchase:From there, the acquisitions accelerated:In total, Bill Gates acquired 18 acres of land, effectively transforming a residential street into a private equestrian neighborhood.The scale and strategy of the acquisitions caught local attention. As one local told the Daily Mail, Gates was “gobbling up properties like Pac-Man.” Many purchases were reportedly made at two to three times the appraised market value, all in a bid to secure surrounding lots and guarantee privacy for Jennifer and her team.Stuart Roffman, a former property owner on the street, explained that despite the gated entrance, the activity level was still high. “Between trucks, stable hands, grooms, and house staff, that's a lot of people on a small street,” he noted. Gates’ solution? Buy the neighbors out.Although the purchase spree appears lavish, Melinda French Gates defended their parenting approach in a 2024 interview with The New York Times, saying,She emphasised that Jennifer and her siblings were raised with allowances, chores, and boundaries. “They were explicitly told not to mention private jets to their classmates,” Melinda added, underscoring an attempt to keep their lives grounded, despite the multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio.Now 29 years old, Jennifer Gates has successfully balanced her equestrian career with impressive academic achievements. A graduate of Stanford University, she later attended medical school and recently announced her residency in Pediatrics Research at Mount Sinai, one of her top choices.In a recent Instagram post, she wrote:she added, celebrating the match to her desired program.Jennifer is now married to Olympic show jumper Nayel Nassar and continues to compete in equestrian events while working in the medical field.Florida isn’t the only state where Jennifer enjoys equestrian luxury. For her graduation from Stanford, the Gates family purchased a 124-acre equestrian estate in North Salem, New York, reportedly worth $15.8 million. The property, located near New York City, consists of three large parcels, giving her ample space to house horses, practice riding, and enjoy countryside serenity.Bill Gates once downplayed the perks of wealth by saying,But in this case, the metaphorical burger came with a mansion, barns, paddocks, and full-time staff. What began as a teenager’s passion has turned into a lifestyle, supported by one of the most influential tech moguls in history.While many parents support their children's hobbies with encouragement or a few lessons, Bill Gates offered Jennifer a community, a sanctuary, and the freedom to chase her dreams without compromise. His investment wasn’t just financial—it was deeply personal. It showed how belief in a child’s passion can create a legacy beyond wealth.","Bill Gates spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams. Many purchases were reportedly made at two to three times the appraised market value, all in a bid to secure surrounding lots and guarantee privacy for Jennifer and her team.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121778948,imgsize-35262,width-400,resizemode-4/Bill-Gates-bought-his-daughter-an-entire-neighborhood-worth-38-million-and-you-wont-believe-why.jpg"

Ahmedabad Plane Crash: What we know so far

Flight: Air India AI 171

Aircraft Type: Boeing 787 Dreamliner

Route: Ahmedabad to London (Gatwick)

Crash Site: Meghaninagar, close to Ahmedabad Airport

Onboard: 230 passengers, 2 pilots, and 10 crew members

Casualties: Initial reports suggest dozens feared dead, many seriously injured

: On June 12, tragedy hit the Gujarat skies when Air India Flight AI 171, which was flying from Ahmedabad to London, crashed just after takeoff from Meghaninagar, a crowded area. The plane had 230 passengers, 2 pilots, and 10 cabin crew members, and soon after taking off from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport, it crashed into a residential complex. The whole place erupted in heavy black smoke that could be seen as far as Vastrapur, sending thousands into panic and pandemonium.Emergency response teams were deployed within minutes, firefighters, police units, and paramedics flooded the site as images of the twisted fuselage and blazing wreckage began circulating online. This tragic incident, the first major air crash in India since 2020, has once again turned the spotlight on India’s aviation safety standards, emergency preparedness, and the historical pattern of catastrophic air disasters that have marked the country’s aviation timeline over the past several decades.The latest tragedy is not the only one. India has a checkered history of deadly air crashes, a lot of which prompted reforms in aviation rule and plane operation.Here's a vivid description of the worst commercial air tragedies in Indian history, reminders of the risks that come with flying.Flying as part of the Vande Bharat Mission, this Dubai repatriation flight overshot Kozhikode's tabletop runway during low visibility and heavy rains. The Boeing 737 plane slipped into a 30-foot gorge and split in two. Both pilots were killed instantaneously. Over 100 passengers were injured, some seriously. The crash put serious questions regarding the safety of tabletop runways and raised questions internationally.Another Dubai-bound flight ended in tragedy at Mangalore's tabletop runway, when the plane overshot the runway and fell into a ravine, erupting into flames. A mere 8 people survived, most of whom were sitting in the front rows. Pilot fatigue and bad judgment were cited as reasons by investigators.The plane crashed while going for a go-around and crashed into a populated residential area close to the airport. Inadequate coordination among the flight crew and poor training were the reasons behind this crash. It is one of the deadliest air crashes in the history of Bihar.Involving a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747 and a Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76, this tragedy is listed as the world's most fatal mid-air collision. It resulted from miscommunication and disobedience of altitude commands. The tragedy prompted a full revamp of air traffic control procedures in India, including the mandatory fitting of Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS).Upon takeoff, the plane crashed into a truck that had strayed onto the runway by mistake, causing a blazing crash. The unusual and virtually avoidable accident revealed wide-open holes in airport security and vehicle control procedures.Airbus A320 descended prematurely and crashed short of the runway at HAL Airport, killing 92 individuals. The incident led India's civil aviation authorities to review landing procedures and simulator training for new-generation aircraft.During the effort to land in adverse visibility conditions, the plane crashed short of the runway. The crash and explosion claimed only two survivors. This accident now shares a shivering resemblance with the 2025 crash, both taking place close to the same airport, renewed suspicion over local weather equipment, pilot navigation, and approach aids.Immediately after takeoff, the Boeing 747 experienced instrument failure, which caused spatial disorientation and a fatal dive into the sea. This is one of the first instances where human factors, including situational awareness loss, resulted in a calamitous event.It has been confirmed by authorities that a full-scale investigation has been launched, with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) as the lead, assisted by Air India and the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB). The aircraft is said to have lost altitude minutes into the flight, and suspicion has fallen on either mechanical malfunction, bird hit, or human error.","On June 12, tragedy hit the Gujarat skies when Air India Flight AI 171, which was flying from Ahmedabad to London, crashed just after takeoff.

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty post breakdown above the recent 5 weeks broader consolidation range (56,000-53,500) on last Friday has rallied to a fresh all time high of 57049 on Monday’s session. However, profit booking at higher levels saw the index gave up its gains and closed Thursday session around 56082 levels.

The index is currently trading above its short- and long-term moving averages signaling overall positive bias.

The last four sessions profit booking have helped the index to cool off the overbought condition. We expect the index to hold above the support area of 55,200-55,500 and head higher towards 57,000 and 57,700 levels in the coming weeks.

Stock market recommendations:Nifty traded in a 170 points range in the first three sessions of the current week. However, sharp decline in Thursday's session saw the index breach the 25,000 levels on the weekly expiry session and closed at 24888 levels.The Nifty has strong support in the range of 24,600–24,700 zone, which coincides with the confluence of the 20-day EMA and the rising trendline connecting the previous two significant swing lows. Sustaining above this support band would likely set the stage for a continuation of the uptrend towards immediate resistance levels at 25,300 and 25,500 in the near term.Importantly, the index has posted an impressive 16% rally from its April lows. Following this, it underwent a healthy consolidation phase with a mild 3% retracement before resuming its upward trajectory. This pattern of extended rallies followed by shallow corrections is characteristic of a structurally strong bull market, suggesting the potential for further upside. Any intermediate dips from current levels should be viewed as incremental buying opportunities.Market internals continue to exhibit strength, particularly in the broader indices. Outperformance is evident in the relative strength ratio of the Nifty 500 versus the Nifty 100, which has been on a steady upward trajectory. Furthermore, market breadth remains robust, with approximately 62% of stocks within the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Small cap 100 trading above their 200-day Simple Moving Averages—a technical indicator that bodes well for the sustainability and depth of the ongoing uptrend.The stock is seen breaking above the last two months consolidation pattern with strong volume signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.The daily 14 periods RSI is in up trend and is seen sustaining above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 363 levels being the 138.2% external retracement of the previous decline (333-244).The stock has recently generated a breakout above a bullish Flag pattern signaling continuation of the up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.The daily MACD is in uptrend and is seen sustaining above its nine periods average signaling positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 383 levels in the coming weeks being the presence of the 200 days EMA.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy, and Prince Pipes and Fittings are the top stock picks for today.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Viswashkumar's account of the crash

Rescued from the debris

Survivor’s phone went dead after 3 calls: Last conversations before silence

All 15 passengers from Diu identified; just 1 survivor: Diu additional district magistrate Vivek Kumar

In the tragedy that claimed 241 lives, Viswashkumar Ramesh — a British citizen of Indian origin — emerged as the sole survivor of Air India flight AI-171, a rare miracle amid immense grief.The London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed moments after taking off from Ahmedabad on Thursday afternoon, killing nearly everyone on board and on the ground. Among the passengers were Viswashkumar and his brother, Ajaykumar Ramesh. Within 30 seconds, fate tore the siblings apart forever.Viswashkumar, seated in Seat 11A, somehow staggered out of the wreckage — bloodied, dazed, and alive. His brother, who sat across the aisle in Seat 11J, is feared dead.A British citizen of Indian descent, Viswashkumar has lived in the UK for over 15 years.He and his brother Ajaykumar hailed from Diu, a coastal town in India. They were among 15 residents from Bucharwada and Vanakbara villages on the flight.In London, the brothers ran a garment business, while also managing a fishing enterprise back in Diu.From his hospital bed in Ward B7, Bed 11 of Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, Viswashkumar told his cousin Dhirendra Somabhai that the aircraft made a strange noise and seemed to hang mid-air before the pilot’s chilling distress call: “Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!”He remembers little else — just jumping through a door, then waking amid chaos.Bystanders and rescue teams pulled him out of the burning debris. Video clips show him stumbling, bloodied, and shouting in Gujarati: “Plane fatyo che! Plane fatyo che!” (The plane exploded).At the hospital, overwhelmed with shock and loss, he cried: “Where is my brother? Leave me alone. I don’t want to talk. Can anyone tell me where he is?”According to Ayub Mansuri, a close family friend who had driven the brothers to the airport that morning, Viswashkumar’s father in London informed them about the crash.“I spoke to Viswash three times after the crash. Then his phone went dead,” Mansuri said. “I rushed to the hospital and found him with head injuries and bruises.”The night before the crash, Viswash and his cousin Dhirendra were together in Patelwadi.“He told me, ‘I don’t know when we’ll meet next,’” Dhirendra recalled, now haunted by the memory.Around 2:30pm, officials sealed off the hospital ward after identifying him as the lone survivor. The Gujarat ATS and Ahmedabad Crime Branch have since restricted access to ensure safety and assist in the ongoing investigation.Diu additional district magistrate Vivek Kumar confirmed: “All 15 passengers from our region have been identified. Only one has survived. A team from our administration has already left for Ahmedabad.”In the midst of a nation mourning its worst aviation disaster in recent memory, Viswashkumar Ramesh’s survival is both a mystery and a miracle — a lone light in a sky darkened by loss.","Viswashkumar Ramesh, a British citizen of Indian origin, is the sole survivor of Air India flight AI-171.

The Boeing 787-8, carrying 242 passengers and crew, failed to gain altitude, impacting near the airport.

Flight AI-171 seen moments after lifting off from Ahmedabad airport, flying unusually low with its landing gear still deployed — the aircraft appears to struggle for altitude just 425 feet above the ground before vanishing behind buildings near Meghaninagar.

A massive explosion engulfs the BJ Medical College hostel building as the Dreamliner crashes into the doctors’ mess, triggering a fireball and dense black smoke that rose above the Meghaninagar skyline. Eyewitnesses described the sound as “like a bomb going off”.

The mangled remains of Air India’s 787-8 Dreamliner sprawled across the residential block and mess hall — its tail section wedged into the rooftop and debris scattered across half a kilometre. The scale of destruction left little hope for survivors.

NEW DELHI: In just 34 seconds, a routine takeoff turned into India’s deadliest single-aircraft crash. And in those same 34 seconds, three images, now etched into the nation’s memory, captured the full descent into horror.The first photo shows Air India’s London-bound Dreamliner moments after it lifts off from Runway 23 of Ahmedabad airport at 1.39pm. The aircraft, an 11-year-old Boeing 787-8, appears unusually low, barely clearing the airport perimeter. Its landing gear is still down. It isn’t climbing — it’s gliding flat, almost hesitantly, as if fighting an invisible drag. Flaps aren’t visibly engaged. For a wide-body aircraft carrying over 240 people, the trajectory looks disturbingly unnatural.The second frame freezes the exact moment of impact. The aircraft, having lost altitude rapidly, tears into the BJ Medical College hostel mess in Meghaninagar. The image captures a deafening blast — an orange-white fireball erupting from the ground, hurling metal, glass, and flame into the sky. Black smoke begins to rise instantly. Eyewitnesses said they heard the plane coming in too low.The third photo is aftermath.Nothing resembling an aircraft remains. The fuselage has splintered; debris strewn across the hostel quarters and adjacent lanes. A section of the empennage — the aircraft’s tail — hangs grotesquely from the roof of the mess building. The landing gear is embedded in a nearby wall. The crash site, just 3km from the end of the runway, looks like a war zone.AI-171, with 242 passengers and crew onboard, had taken off late — and didn’t get far. Captain Sumeet Sabharwal’s calm “Mayday” call to Ahmedabad ATC was the last transmission. After climbing to just 425 feet, the plane nosedived, leaving little time for response, and no chance for recovery.The crash killed at least 245 people, including former Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani and several doctors and residents on the college campus. One man, seated in 11A — a UK national of Indian origin — survived and walked out of the burning fuselage. The death toll is expected to rise, with nearly 290 body bags in use by rescue teams.Initial probes point to a double engine failure, possibly due to bird strike — though investigators have not ruled out technical or procedural lapses. This was the first crash involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner since its launch. The aircraft had logged over 41,000 flight hours, with 8,000 takeoffs and landings in the past year alone.The Tata Group has announced ₹1 crore compensation for each victim’s family and has pledged support to rebuild the BJ Medical College hostel.As firefighters, NDRF teams, and hospital staff sifted through the charred remains, the three photos — frozen moments from a tragedy — told the full story in a way words never could.","Boeing 787-8, carrying 242 passengers and crew, failed to gain altitude, impacting near the airport.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the site of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad on Friday, a day after the deadly accident killed 241 people, including 12 crew members.He was accompanied by Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and senior Union ministers as he reviewed the situation on the ground.The crash, which occurred shortly after take-off on June 12, involved Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner en route from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick.Among the 241 people onboard were 169 Indian nationals, 53 British nationals, seven Portuguese citizens, and one Canadian national.According to the airline, one passenger miraculously survived the crash. The survivor, a British national of Indian origin, is currently undergoing treatment.The aircraft, piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal — a Line Training Captain with over 8,200 hours of flying experience — took off from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.Shortly after take-off from runway 23, the crew issued a Mayday call to Air Traffic Control (ATC).However, all communication was lost moments later, and the aircraft crashed just beyond the airport perimeter into the BJ Medical College campus in Meghaninagar — specifically into a residential building housing young doctors.An official said thick black smoke was seen billowing from the site minutes after impact. The crash sparked a massive fire, fuelled by an estimated 125,000 litres of aviation fuel on board.Union home minister Amit Shah, who was briefed by Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel shortly after the incident, said there was virtually “no chance of saving anyone” due to the extreme temperatures caused by the burning fuel.Speaking to reporters, Shah said, “The moment we received the information, I alerted the Prime Minister, the Gujarat Home Minister, the Civil Aviation Ministry and all key agencies. The PM called back immediately, and a coordinated rescue effort began within minutes.”Shah also revealed that over 1,000 DNA samples had been collected to help identify victims. The official death toll will be released after these tests are completed.Union Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu confirmed that the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which operates under the Ministry of Civil Aviation, has launched a formal probe into the incident.The investigation will follow international guidelines laid out by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).Naidu also announced that a high-level committee of experts from multiple disciplines will be formed to examine the circumstances of the crash and suggest measures to enhance aviation safety in India.In a related development, the US-based National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is preparing to send a team of investigators to assist with the probe, as per international protocols involving aircraft built by American manufacturers.Tata Group, the owner of Air India, has announced a compensation of ₹1 crore (approximately £95,000) for the families of each deceased passenger.A dedicated helpline has also been set up for families and relatives of those on board. For callers within India, the number is 1800 5691 444. For those calling from abroad, the helpline number is +91 8062779200.Air India Managing Director and CEO Campbell Wilson also visited the crash site to assess the situation and support ongoing relief efforts.The crash left a trail of devastation in the BJ Medical College campus, where the aircraft’s nose struck a residential block for junior doctors, while the tail section hit the doctors' mess just after a large group had finished lunch.The fire and impact killed at least three resident doctors and the pregnant wife of another. A 13-year-old boy who worked at a tea stall nearby also died.One doctor described the scene as “apocalyptic”, with smoke, heat, and screams filling the air. Many of the doctors present at the site joined rescue efforts, pulling out bodies and tending to the injured despite the trauma unfolding around them.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the site of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad.

What began as a journey of opportunity turned into a lifetime of service and deep community ties.“This new entry stamp isn't just a mark in a passport, it's a tribute to everything Dubai has given us,” said Jamaluddin, speaking to Gulf News. “My son wanted to honour the years I've spent here, and with the help of the Dubai Airports team, he made that possible.”Now a well-respected educator and community leader, Jamaluddin is the chairman and founder of Crescent English High School, an institution he established in 1984. The school has grown steadily under his leadership and today educates over 1,700 students, maintaining its reputation as one of the most affordable private schools in the UAE.Jamaluddin’s educational philosophy is rooted in values, not profit. He shared his guiding principle:“Money is not everything. Education is the best weapon for enlightenment.”F or four decades, he has nurtured generations of students, driven by a deep-seated commitment to social upliftment and access to quality learning. His leadership and efforts have left a lasting mark on Dubai’s educational ecosystem.Throughout his journey, Jamaluddin has drawn inspiration from the UAE’s leadership, particularly the late Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who he recalls seeing visiting construction sites in the early mornings. This connection, he believes, shaped both his values and his deep bond with Dubai.“He was always among the people and now His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai is continuing that legacy. It’s what makes Dubai what it is today,” he reflected.This personal insight into the UAE's visionary leadership underscores the emotional and symbolic significance of the commemorative gesture, a recognition of his enduring loyalty to the city.As part of the celebrations, students from Crescent English High School were invited for a special educational tour of Dubai International Airport (DXB). Organised by Dubai Airports, the tour offered students a rare glimpse behind the scenes, showcasing how DXB plays a pivotal role in global connectivity.The visit was more than just a field trip; it served as a tribute to their founder’s legacy and an educational opportunity to understand the infrastructure that supports Dubai’s status as a global hub.","Haji N.

Broader Impact





A major update to media regulation in the UAE has officially come into force, requiring all social media influencers and content creators engaged in commercial activities to obtain a business license before applying for a media license from the UAE Media Council.This shift is part of the broader Media Regulation Law, implemented on May 29, 2025, by the UAE Media Council, marking a significant development in the country's evolving digital media landscape. The regulation is aimed at fostering ethical, high-quality online content, while safeguarding societal norms and ensuring public trust.Previously, influencers and creators were only required to obtain a media license. The new regulation now mandates a business license first, reflecting the UAE’s commitment to more structured oversight of online commercial activity.The policy is part of the UAE’s Digital Participation Policy, designed to promote constructive engagement on social media while ensuring compliance with local laws and values. It gives the Media Council broad authority to monitor, modify, or remove digital content that violates regulations.Speaking at a recent press conference in Dubai, Maitha Al Suwaidi, CEO of Strategy and Media Policies Sector at the UAE Media Council, emphasized the broader vision behind the law.“This road map reflects our deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by new media. It is designed to foster a flexible, contemporary environment that aligns with global media trends while safeguarding the UAE’s core values,” she said.She also noted that the primary goals of the new licensing system are to build public trust, protect audiences, and elevate the quality of online content.In a supportive move aimed at easing the transition, the UAE Media Council has waived all permit fees for a period of three years for influencers and content creators applying under the new system.According to Maitha Al Suwaidi:“To support content creators, the Council is offering a three-year exemption from permit fees, providing a financial cushion for influencers to adapt to the new regulations.”This approach reflects an understanding of the financial and logistical challenges that many independent creators face, particularly those who are just beginning to commercialize their platforms.The updated Media Regulation Law also introduces stringent penalties for violations. Offenders may face fines of up to Dh1 million, with the severity of the penalty based on the frequency and gravity of the offense.The UAE Media Council retains full authority to delete or modify any content that contravenes the guidelines set forth in the new law, including posts that may be deemed defamatory, offensive, or otherwise disruptive to social harmony.Here’s a breakdown of what’s now required under the new law:The UAE’s updated media framework marks a defining moment in its approach to digital communication. It puts in place a modern and robust regulatory system that balances the freedom to create with responsibility and accountability, ultimately aiming to promote a safer, more credible, and culturally respectful digital environment.With the UAE emerging as a growing hub for digital talent, these regulatory developments are likely to shape influencer practices, guide content standards, and ensure that public engagement remains respectful and in line with national values."," Influencers earning from content in the UAE must get business licenses or risk fines up to Dh1 million.

A Shifting Landscape: New Additions and Deletions



Commitment to International Standards and Future Steps



UAE's Proactive Stance: A Glimpse at Recent Efforts







In a significant development for its global financial standing, the European Union on Tuesday announced the removal of the United Arab Emirates from its money-laundering ""high-risk"" list. This decision reflects growing international recognition of the UAE's intensified efforts to combat financial crimes. Alongside the UAE, seven other jurisdictions were also removed from the list: Barbados, Gibraltar, Jamaica, Panama, the Philippines, Senegal, and Uganda.While the UAE and others exited the high-risk list, the European Commission also revealed new additions. Monaco was included alongside nine other jurisdictions now subject to increased scrutiny of their money laundering controls. These newly added countries are Algeria, Angola, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Laos, Lebanon, Namibia, Nepal, and Venezuela.The EU's move aligns closely with the assessments of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a Paris-based international watchdog. The FATF reviews the efforts of over 200 countries and jurisdictions in preventing money laundering and terrorism financing, compiling a ""grey list"" for nations under increased monitoring. Notably, the FATF had already removed the Philippines from its list of countries facing increased monitoring in February, while adding Laos and Nepal.Monaco has been on the FATF list since mid-2024, a list which also includes EU member states Bulgaria and Croatia.Maria Luis Albuquerque, the EU's commissioner for financial services, underscored the importance of this update. She stated, ""The commission has now presented an update to the EU list which reiterates our strong commitment to aligning with international standards, particularly those set by the FATF.""The updated EU list is not yet final. It will now undergo scrutiny by the European Parliament and member states. If there are no objections, the revised list will officially enter into force within one month, as confirmed by the Commission.Monaco's government, upon taking note of this expected update, issued a statement acknowledging their anticipated placement on the EU list, unless the European Parliament or the Council of the EU decides otherwise. The principality also stressed its firm commitment to take all necessary steps to be removed from the FATF's grey list ""in the short term,"" indicating proactive measures to address international concerns.Also read: UAE Launches Major Money Laundering Crackdown, Collecting Dh339 Million in Fines The EU's decision to remove the UAE from its high-risk list comes amidst significant and widely publicized efforts by the Emirates to strengthen its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing framework. In recent months, UAE regulators have launched an intense crackdown, levying over Dh339 million in fines against local exchange houses, foreign bank branches, and insurance companies. This aggressive stance includes imposing hefty penalties, pursuing systemic weaknesses in monitoring suspicious transactions, and expanding regulatory oversight to high-risk sectors such as real estate, gold and jewellery trading, auditing, and corporate service providers. Furthermore, the UAE Ministry of Economy has teamed up with Dubai Police to enhance surveillance and data sharing on beneficiary ownership details, reinforcing the nation's commitment to protecting its financial system from abuse.","The European Union on Tuesday announced the removal of the United Arab Emirates from its money-laundering ""high-risk"" list.

A String of Heavy Penalties and Enforcement Actions



Latest Actions: On Tuesday, the CBUAE imposed Dh12.3 million in fines on six exchange houses. These penalties followed inspections that uncovered multiple violations, specifically failures to comply with the country's anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) framework. This move came just a week after the Central Bank had already issued a Dh3.5 million fine to another exchange house for similar shortcomings, with investigators citing significant lapses in the firm’s adherence to AML/CFT policies and procedures.





Earlier Major Fines: The intensity of the crackdown notably increased late last month. One exchange house was fined a staggering Dh100 million. Days before this, another exchange house received an even larger penalty of Dh200 million. In this specific Dh200 million case, the branch manager was personally fined Dh500,000 and permanently banned from working in any UAE-licensed financial institution, marking a strong stance against individual accountability.





Broader Reach: Foreign banks have also been subject to scrutiny. The Central Bank recently penalized two UAE branches of international banks with a combined Dh18.1 million in fines; one received Dh10.6 million, and the other Dh7.5 million, both for failing to meet AML/CFT compliance standards. Earlier in February, an exchange house operating in the UAE was given a penalty of Dh3.5 million. Furthermore, in March, five banks and two insurance companies were fined a combined Dh2.62 million by the CBUAE.

A Clear Message: Zero Tolerance and No Safe Haven







The United Arab Emirates is ringing a stark new alarm for financial institutions, unleashing an intense crackdown on money laundering and terrorism financing. UAE regulators have recently imposed staggering penalties totaling over Dh339 million, targeting a spectrum of financial institutions including local exchange houses, international bank branches, and insurance companies. This robust enforcement sends an unmistakable signal across the Emirates: the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing is paramount, and there will be no leniency for those who fail to protect the financial system from exploitation.The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has been particularly active in its crackdown, issuing a series of substantial fines.Across all these cases, regulators consistently identified a common issue: systemic weaknesses in how these institutions monitored and reported suspicious transactions, as well as in how they verified the identities of their clients and the true beneficiaries behind financial dealings.The UAE's intensified crackdown is no longer limited solely to the traditional banking sector. Authorities are actively expanding their regulatory oversight to include other sectors that have historically been less regulated but carry a high risk for illicit activities. These include:To boost the effectiveness of these expanded efforts, the UAE Ministry of Economy has teamed up with Dubai Police. Their collaboration focuses on tightening surveillance of suspicious transactions within these high-risk sectors.A crucial part of this partnership involves creating direct and secure data-sharing channels, particularly for beneficial ownership details. This aims to clearly identify the true individuals who ultimately own or control corporate structures and financial dealings, making it harder to hide illicit funds.With fines now reaching into the hundreds of millions of dirhams and strict bans being enforced at the individual level, the message from UAE regulators is unequivocal: there is absolute zero tolerance for institutions that fail to protect the financial system from abuse. As stated in a report by Justin Varghese, Your Money Editor, ""The message from UAE regulators is clear: there is zero tolerance for institutions that fail to protect the financial system from abuse. ""The UAE remains committed to enhancing its efforts to meet global compliance standards and avoid being placed on international watchlists. Consequently, businesses operating in any of these high-risk sectors are now under increased pressure to significantly upgrade their internal controls and procedures. Failure to do so could result in severe penalties, sending a strong deterrent message across the financial landscape.",CBUAE recently fined six exchange houses Dh12.3 million for breaching AML regulations.

Marriage contracts in the UAE: Why more couples are choosing prenups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/marriage-contracts-in-the-uae-why-more-couples-are-choosing-prenups/articleshow/121751700.cms,"Legal experts say prenuptial agreements can often reduce the bitterness and legal chaos that sometimes follow a marriage breakdown ( Representational Image)

A Landmark Legal Shift in the UAE

Learning from Experience: Fostering Clarity and Reducing Conflict

A Modern Tool for Financial Protection and Management

Custom-Fit Agreements: Bridging Cultural Divides





The fairytale notion of eternal bliss often overshadows the pragmatic realities of marriage, but in the Gulf region, a quiet revolution is taking foot. Increasingly, couples are choosing to safeguard their futures not just with vows, but with prenuptial agreements. This burgeoning trend is particularly pronounced in the UAE, a nation rapidly evolving its legal landscape to meet modern demands. Here, significant reforms have smoothed the path for drafting, recognizing, and enforcing these crucial contracts. While the concept of a prenup might still carry a whisper of social stigma, suggesting, perhaps, a lack of faith in enduring love, and certainly can't guarantee a ""happily ever after,"" legal minds are unequivocallychampioning their power. As highlighted in a Khaleej Times report, these agreements are proving to be remarkably effective tools in softening the sharp edges of separation, transforming what could be acrimonious legal battles into more manageable, and ultimately, less bitter transitions. It's a clear signal that for many, maturity and foresight are now as vital to a strong union as love itself.A pivotal development that profoundly impacted the landscape of prenuptial agreements in the UAE occurred in 2021.This was with the introduction of Abu Dhabi Law No. 14/2021 on Personal Status for Non-Muslim Foreigners, a legislative move subsequently reinforced by Resolution No. (8) of 2022. Together, these established a clear and robust legal framework specifically for civil marriages. This groundbreaking legislative change allowed non-Muslim couples, predominantly expatriates residing in the UAE, to enter into marriage under a civil contract, operating independently of traditional religious laws.Tyne Hugo, a Senior Associate from the prominent law firm BSA, elaborated on the profound implications of this legal evolution for prenuptial agreements, as reported by Khaleej Times. ""As the ceremony is civilly based, it effectively allows for prenuptial agreements to be signed before marriage,"" explained Hugo. She further clarified the significant new opportunities this presented, stating, ""Couples now have the opportunity to tailor their financial arrangements from the outset, something that was previously unavailable or legally ambiguous. ""Considering the UAE's diverse demographic, which includes millions of expatriates from various cultural backgrounds, officials have increasingly focused on fostering an environment where the country feels like a long-term home rather than merely a transient stopover. This strategic approach aligns with the growing acceptance of prenups. As Tyne Hugo further conveyed to Khaleej Times, ""To attract foreigners, the UAE must cater to their cultural norms, and in the West, prenups are not only common but expected. "" This underscores the UAE's commitment to adapting its legal framework to better serve its multinational populace.While a prenuptial agreement cannot guarantee the success or longevity of a marriage, legal professionals widely acknowledge its powerful utility in reducing both the emotional and legal fallout should a union fail.BSA, the law firm, shared insights from their experience, including a recent divorce case where, despite the absence of a prenup, the couple successfully managed to negotiate an amicable financial agreement. However, as Tyne Hugo pointed out in the Khaleej Times report, this ideal scenario is not always the case. ""That’s not always the case,"" she stated, adding a vivid illustration: ""We’ve seen divorces where couples fought over everything, including the cutlery. These kinds of disputes are often more about emotions than assets."" This stark comparison highlights the potential for contentious battles in the absence of clear pre-agreed terms.Conversely, couples who have proactively signed prenuptial agreements typically report experiencing significantly less conflict and achieve faster resolutions when facing marital dissolution. ""There’s clarity,"" Tyne Hugo confirmed to Khaleej Times, emphasizing, ""and that clarity helps prevent unnecessary legal battles.""This benefit is echoed in personal experiences, such as that of Maha A., a Lebanese designer who married in the previous year. She recounted her initial reaction to her fiancé's suggestion of a prenup, telling Khaleej Times, ""I was surprised when my fiancé suggested a prenup. At first, I felt hurt."" However, her perspective quickly shifted: ""But he explained it wasn’t about preparing for divorce, it was about protecting each other. We both have separate assets and wanted to keep things clear. In the end, it actually made me feel more secure."" Maha also revealed that the process itself, though not traditionally romantic, instigated vital conversations about potentially sensitive topics like spending habits, savings goals, and possible financial risks. ""It wasn’t romantic, but it was responsible,"" she wisely concluded.Although the topic of prenuptial agreements might still be uncomfortable for some families, they are increasingly being perceived not as a threat to the sanctity of marriage but rather as a sensible means to achieve financial clarity and mutual understanding within a partnership.""Prenups don’t just deal with how assets are split in case of a divorce; they can also outline how assets are managed during the marriage,"" Tyne Hugo explained to Khaleej Times. She detailed the expansive scope of these agreements, noting that ""Partners can decide whether to have joint or separate estates and shield themselves from each other’s financial liabilities."" This protective aspect is crucial: ""If one person goes into debt, the other can ensure their assets are protected from creditors,"" she further highlighted. This demonstrates how prenups serve as a vital tool for safeguarding individual financial interests within the marital union.Cultural differences undeniably continue to influence how prenuptial agreements are viewed and accepted. In more traditional or conservative families, the very notion of signing a legal document before marriage can be perceived as an admission of doubt or a sign of distrust in the relationship.""Some cultures may see this as a betrayal of what a marriage is supposed to be,"" Tyne Hugo acknowledged in her comments to Khaleej Times. Nevertheless, she underscored the remarkable adaptability of prenups: ""But the beauty of a prenup is that it’s entirely customisable. It can reflect any cultural or religious values the couple deems important."" This flexibility allows the agreement to be tailored to respect and incorporate various deeply held beliefs and practices.Despite traditional reservations, younger couples, particularly those from dual-nationality backgrounds or who have been raised in more globalized environments, are increasingly viewing prenups in a progressive light. This evolving perspective is indicative of a broader shift in societal attitudes towards financial planning within marriage.Speaking to Khaleej Times, Rania F., a licensed marriage and family therapist based in Dubai, confirmed this trend, that ""Couples are beginning to realise that love and legal planning are not mutually exclusive."" She offered a nuanced perspective on the purpose of such agreements: ""A prenup doesn’t mean you expect a divorce, it just means you’re mature enough to talk about money, expectations, and personal boundaries before problems arise. "" Rania F. also noted that a growing number of her clients are actively inquiring about prenups during premarital counseling sessions. This is particularly prevalent in situations where one partner owns a business, has children from a previous marriage, or carries significant debt, where the need for clear financial boundaries and protections becomes even more apparent.","Legal experts say prenuptial agreements can often reduce the bitterness and legal chaos that sometimes follow a marriage breakdown. This burgeoning trend is particularly pronounced in the UAE, a nation rapidly evolving its legal landscape to meet modern demands.

Paulina Gretzky set to inherit incredible fortune and stunning luxury boat from hockey icon Wayne Gretzky,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/paulina-gretzky-set-to-inherit-incredible-fortune-and-stunning-luxury-boat-from-hockey-icon-wayne-gretzky/articleshow/121780273.cms,"As Dustin Johnson vies for U.S. Open success, attention turns to Paulina Gretzky and her inheritance from hockey legend Wayne Gretzky (Getty Images)

Wayne Gretzky’s fortune and assets are shaping Paulina’s multi-million dollar legacy

The Steinway powerboat is more than just a toy—it’s a family heirloom in the making





As Dustin Johnson pursues another shot at U.S. Open glory, attention has shifted to his wife, Paulina Gretzky—not just for her support, but because of what she stands to inherit from her legendary father, the Great One, Wayne Gretzky. While Johnson has secured massive paydays from both the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, Paulina’s future is lined with generational wealth thanks to her father's illustrious career and lavish lifestyle.Wayne Gretzky, often referred to as “The Great One,” is more than just a hockey legend—he’s a financial powerhouse. With an estimated net worth of $250 million, Gretzky holds 61 NHL records and has turned his post-retirement years into a business empire. For Paulina, this means inheriting not only an enormous fortune but also a portfolio of jaw-dropping properties and luxury items.Among his holdings, Gretzky owns a lakefront estate in Idaho, multiple Florida homes, and a childhood residence in Brantford, Ontario. He even repurchased his famed ‘Gretzky Mansion’ in Thousand Oaks, California, only to flip it for a profit in 2021.But one of the most unique pieces in the Gretzky collection isn’t a home—it’s a custom, handcrafted 34-foot Steinway 340 HT powerboat.Commissioned in 2021, this bespoke mahogany boat—built by Couer Custom—is worth $900,000 and blends elegance with engineering. It can hit speeds of 50 mph but is designed for leisure. “I was relatively fast when I skated, but these days I drive my car slow,” Gretzky told Robb Report. “I'll take comfort over speed any day.”The boat features plush loungers, a main cockpit with cozy sofas, a stern sunpad, and even an electric bimini for added shade. Paulina’s mother, Janet Jones, played a pivotal role in designing its stylish aesthetic. “She’s the creative one in the family; the only thing I asked for was to have a Canadian flag at the back,” Gretzky added.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky sparks controversy by accusing Florida Panthers of buying success with tax loopholes Between her father’s sprawling real estate, massive fortune, and luxurious custom yacht, Paulina Gretzky’s future looks every bit as glamorous as her past—and Dustin Johnson may not be the biggest star in the household for much longer.","Paulina Gretzky stands to inherit a multi-million dollar fortune from her father, hockey legend Wayne Gretzki.

LONDON: A British Indian relative of an elderly Indian couple killed on board the Air India flight has spoken of his anger with the airline, saying the fleet that Air India uses is terrible.Tushar Jogi and his family were shell-shocked on Thursday when the news came through that the flight their relatives were on had crashed.Jogi’s cousin’s in-laws — Vallabh Nagji Agheda, a former general manager of the electricity board in Gujarat, and his wife, Vinaben Vallabh Agheda, a housewife, both from Vadodara — were in seats 21E and 21F on the Boeing aircraft. Both in their 70s, they were to come to the UK to spend a few months with their eldest daughter, her husband, and their grandchildren who live in Reading. The daughter and her whole family were en route to Heathrow on Thursday evening to fly to India.Jogi’s cousin, and his wife, an IT engineer, had been due to go to Gatwick on Thursday night to pick them up. The elderly couple have three daughters and the other two live in Gujarat. The two sisters had rushed to Ahmedabad on Thursday with their husbands to get DNA tests done so their parents’ remains could be handed over.“We are all absolutely shattered.We are all not able to digest this reality that we have lost them sadly — my cousin’s wife has lost both parents in just a single instant,” said Jogi, getting emotional. “They are the closest relatives we have in the UK. We don’t have any other family here. We are all a close-knit family,” he said, as he prepared to travel to Reading.Maharashtra-born Jogi, a British Indian social media influencer living in London, said though the couple were in their 70s they were enjoying the perfect retirement in Vadodara and spending time with all their grandchildren. “They were very fit and healthy and their life expectancy was beyond 90. They had huge love and affection from the whole family.”He said there was a lot of British concern with Air India among the Indian diaspora in Britain at “the way they treat passengers like luggage”. “The queue management is pathetic and people in the Indian community say the Air India fleet is the most horrible one. The ex-Etihad Airways Boeing 777-300ER aircraft are pathetic – the ones running from Heathrow. Seats falling apart is the default – whether 787 or 777-300ER, these Boeing fleets are horrible. For any journey, life is more important. They have to have a policy of care. Half the infotainment systems don’t work and the food tables are even broken at times,” he added.","Tushar Jogi and his family were shell-shocked on Thursday when the news came through that the flight their relatives were on had crashed.
