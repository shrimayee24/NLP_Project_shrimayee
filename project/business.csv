"Delhi CM distributes Rs 25.25 crore scholarships to 1,709 students",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-cm-distributes-rs-25-25-crore-scholarships-to-1709-students/articleshow/126497171.cms,"PTI photo

Coinciding with the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta on Monday distributed scholarships worth Rs 25.25 crore to 1,709 meritorious students from economically weaker sections under the Delhi Higher and Technical Education Assistance Scheme.Addressing the scholarship distribution programme at Thyagaraj Stadium, Gupta said providing financial assistance to students was the Delhi government's investment in their future and a step towards strengthening the city's youth.The event was attended by Education Minister Ashish Sood, senior officials of the Education Department, vice chancellors of various universities, educationists and a large number of students, according to a statement.The chief minister said that scholarship amounts for the academic years 2023-24 and 2024-25 had been transferred directly to the bank accounts of eligible students studying in universities across Delhi. She also informed that a pending scholarship amount of Rs 19 crore from the previous government's tenure had been released by the present government, asserting that no funds earmarked for students' education would remain pending in future.Marking National Youth Day, Gupta urged students to draw inspiration from the thoughts and philosophy of Swami Vivekananda and to pursue their goals with dedication and discipline.She said the progress of the nation depended on the advancement of its youth and highlighted the role of young people in achieving the goal of a developed India by 2047.The chief minister also said that national development was not possible through government policies alone and required the collective responsibility and active participation of citizens.Speaking on the occasion, Sood said the government was committed to improving the education sector and ensuring that students from disadvantaged backgrounds received adequate support.He said the government's approach was guided by the principle of Antyodaya, aimed at ensuring that benefits reached those at the lowest rung of society. He said the Narela Education City project, which had remained stalled for several years, was now being implemented.He added that the project's budget had been increased from Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,300 crore and would include shared university campuses, auditoriums, libraries, digital libraries and ICT laboratories spread across 160 acres.The Education Minister said the objective of the government was to address challenges in the education sector through policy measures and effective implementation, adding that education would play a key role in shaping leadership for the future.Meritorious students from economically weaker sections who have passed Class XII from Delhi schools with at least 75 per cent marks and meet the prescribed income criteria are eligible for financial assistance under the Delhi Higher and Technical Education Assistance Scheme, it said.The scholarship amount is transferred directly to beneficiaries' bank accounts through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system, it added.","Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta distributed scholarships worth Rs 25.25 crore to 1,709 meritorious students from economically weaker sections.

Ex-Admiral Prakash submits eligibility documents; set to be included in Goa’s final roll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-admiral-prakash-submits-eligibility-documents-set-to-be-included-in-goas-final-roll/articleshow/126497027.cms,".

New Delhi: Former Indian Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash (retired) on Monday reportedly submitted all the necessary documents linking him to the electoral roll from last special intensive revision (SIR), paving the way for early resolution of the matter relating to the system-driven notice issued to him after all the fields in his enumeration form (EF) pertaining to linkage with the last SIR roll, were left blank.""The documents were collected by the competent field officer on Monday and the matter will be settled, perhaps by Tuesday, making the retired Admiral and his wife eligible for inclusion in the final electoral roll of Cortalim assembly constituency (AC) in Goa,"" an officer aware of the proceedings told TOI on Monday.Similarly, a hearing due on Jan 16 on the notice served to Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, an elector in Bolpur AC of West Bengal, after the age of his mother, with whom he was mapped in the EF filled and submitted by his relative, was reportedly found to be less than Sen's, is expected to sort out the anomaly. A hearing will be held at Sen's registered address at Shanti Niketan, and the relative will have the opportunity to correctly map Sen to the SIR from the last roll, said an officer.In a clarification issued in Admiral Prakash's case on Monday, the Cortalim ERO explained that his EF was categorised as “unmapped” after it was observed that the said EF did not contain the mandatory particulars relating to the previous SIR, including the name of the elector, EPIC number, name of the relative, name and number of the AC, part number, and serial number in the electoral roll.""In the absence of these essential identification details, the BLO application was unable to establish an automatic linkage between the submitted EF and the existing electoral roll database,” the ERO said.Underlining that the BLO application is designed to automatically map EFs only when the prescribed identification particulars are duly filled in, the Cortalim ERO said the blank fields in Prakash’s EF triggered the system to categorise his EF as “unmapped"", mandating an auto-generated notice for further verification through a hearing mechanism.""As per the standard, system-driven procedure, a hearing notice was automatically generated and issued to enable verification of the elector's details and ensure due opportunity for confirmation of eligibility,"" shared the ERO.The officer said any elector can notice blank fields in the EF and cross-check with the BLO, before signing the form. Unlike SIR Phase 1, no eligibility documents are to be submitted with EF in Phase 2; however, the fields regarding linkage to last SIR must mandatorily be filled to avoid a notice after the draft roll is published.","Former Indian Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash (retired) on Monday reportedly submitted all the necessary documents linking him to the electoral roll from last special intensive revision.

Gen-Z protests in 3 Asian nations must be examined: Manish Tewari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gen-z-protests-in-3-asian-nations-must-be-examined-manish-tewari/articleshow/126496536.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress MP Manish Tewari said there should be a deep study of the Gen-Z protests that brought down govts in three South Asian countries in the last three years to check if they were organic movements arising out of grievances.Tewari said these movements should be examined for the critical difference between autonomous agitations over grievances, and agitations driven by narratives where grievances may have been weaponised. Though he did not point at any country which could have virtually carried out coups in Asia in the name of youth protests, his remark suggested that suspicions could not be simply brushed off. Starting with Sri Lanka, protests brought down elected govts in Nepal and Bangladesh — all in the Indian neighbourhood.The note of caution came as Tewari spoke about the turbulent contemporary world, from Venezuela to Bangladesh to Greenland to Ukrainian invasion, at the launch of his new book “A World Adrift”. The book was released by former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha at IIC, and the gathering included P Chidambaram, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Vivek Tankha, Mukul Wasnik, and a host of foreign delegates, among others.As he spoke on raging geopolitical issues, Tewari dismissed the belief that “India has lost Bangladesh” after protests toppled the Sheikh Hasina govt that set in motion developments which have increased the friction between India and Bangladesh.He said India invested blood and treasure in creating Bangladesh under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, and “that reality is not lost on the people of Bangladesh”. He said the present transition govt in Dhaka is belligerent towards India for inexplicable reasons, but there is an “emotive connect” between the neighbours, and Bangladesh will be back in India’s eminent domain in coming time.Interestingly, Tewari sought more focus on India’s policy making with the neighbours. He reprised a question he had asked in Parliament – “India has a neighbourhood-first policy, but do any of the neighbours have India-first policy?”Exuding optimism in the wake of turbulence stoked by US President Donald Trump’s policies ranging from Venezuela to Greenland, and the threat to the world order, Tewari said nobody believed the world could survive the Covid pandemic but it did. “We will survive the coming three years,” he laughed.","Congress MP Manish Tewari said there should be a deep study of the Gen-Z protests that brought down govts in three South Asian countries in the last three years.

Retail inflation inches up to 3-month high of 1.3% in December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/retail-inflation-inches-up-to-3-month-high-of-1-3-in-december/articleshow/126495039.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Retail inflation inched up to a three-month high in Dec, led by narrowing deflation in some food prices and fading favourable base effect, but remained below the Reserve Bank of India ’s (RBI) tolerance level for the fourth month in a row.Data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on Monday showed retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 1.3%, higher than the 0.7% in Nov and below the 5.2% in Dec 2024.Food inflation contracted 2.7% in Dec and there is an increase of 120 basis points compared to Nov. Rural inflation was at 0.8% while urban was at 2% during Dec.Core inflation, which excludes food and fuel, soared to a 28-month high of 4.8% during the month, up from 4.4% in Nov, led by a sharp spike in gold and silver prices, which surged 69% and 97% year-onyear, respectively. Excluding these metals, core inflation moderated to 2.3% in Dec.The increase in overall inflation and food inflation during Dec was largely attributed to increase in inflation of personal care and effects, vegetables, meat and fish, egg, spices and pulses and products. Personal care and effects, which includes gold and silver, rose 28.1% in Dec.“Looking ahead, headline inflation is expected to edge higher but remain below the RBI’s 4% target for the rest of FY26.For FY26 and FY27, CPI inflation is projected to average around 2.1% and 4% respectively, based on the current CPI basket. The rollout of the new CPI series with a 2024 base year next month will be an important development to watch,” said Rajani Sinha, chief economist at ratings agency CareEdge.“From a monetary policy standpoint, the recent uptick in inflation is unlikely to trouble the RBI. While inflation projections leave room for a further 25 basis points rate cut, we expect the monetary policy committee (MPC) to pause and conserve policy space, opting to ease only if growth conditions deteriorate,” said Sinha.","Food inflation contracted 2.7% in Dec and there is an increase of 120 basis points compared to Nov.

Putin's Powerful Ally China BACKS Iran As Trump Threatens US Military Action Over Khamenei Crisis

How Will 25% Additional Tariffs Impact India?



In a fresh round of global tariffs, US President Donald Trump has announced that countries doing trade with Iran will attract a 25% tariff from the world’s largest economy. The move is seen as a pressure tactic on Iran over its response to nationwide protests that have reportedly claimed nearly 600 lives.Trump has repeatedly warned that his administration could consider military action if it determines that the Iranian government is using lethal force against demonstrators. Trump described this as a threshold Iran is ‘beginning to cross,’ prompting discussions within his national security team on what he called ‘very strong options’.The tariff decision was announced by Trump in a social media post on Monday, where he said that measures would take effect immediately. Several major economies, including China, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, and India maintain trade ties with Iran.“Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America. This Order is final and conclusive. Thank you for your attention to this matter!,” Trump posted on Truth Social.India already faces 50% tariffs on its exports to the US. While 25% of this figure are ‘reciprocal’ tariffs’, the remaining 25% are a penal duty for India’s crude oil imports from Russia.India and Iran share an important trading relationship, with India consistently ranking among Iran’s top five trading partners in recent years, according to the Ministry of External Affairs.India’s key exports to Iran span a range of products, including rice (especially basmati), tea, sugar, pharmaceutical goods, man-made staple fibres, electrical equipment, and imitation jewellery. In return, India mainly imports items such as dry fruits, inorganic and organic chemicals, and glassware from Iran.Also read: 'Seize and hold the cities'; 5 takeaways from Reza Pahlavi's declaration amid Iran protests

Iran is a crucial market for Indian basmati rice, typically purchasing more than one million tonnes each year, according to reports. Iran has traditionally been among the biggest overseas markets for Indian basmati rice. Reports suggest that Iran purchases close to 12 lakh tonnes each year, with the trade estimated at around Rs 12,000 crore.However, Iran is not among its top 5 trading partners in terms of both imports and exports. India’s top exporting destinations are currently the United States of America, United Arab Emirates, Netherlands, China, United Kingdom - accounting for 41% of India’s exports according to the Ministry of Commerce dashboard.From a trade and strategy perspective, India also has a major stake in Iran’s Chabahar port. Last year, the US extended its sanctions waiver for Iran’s Chabahar port by an additional six months to April this year. The waiver had earlier been withdrawn in September 2025 when the US State Department cancelled the exemption first issued in 2018, which had allowed India to develop the port as a gateway to Afghanistan and Central Asia while avoiding routes through Pakistan, as part of efforts to increase pressure on Tehran.If the exemption were to lapse, entities involved in operating the port or engaging in related activities could be exposed to US penalties under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act.Chabahar has gained strategic relevance for India’s outreach to Afghanistan, especially as engagement with the Taliban administration in Kabul has been gradually improving.","India and Iran share an important trading relationship, with India consistently ranking among Iran’s top five trading partners in recent years.

Third Stage Trouble Strikes Again: Inside ISRO’s PSLV-C62 Deviation And What The Failure Means Ahead

SRIHARIKOTA: The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) on Monday said that the PSLV-C62 mission encountered an anomaly during end of the PS3 stage and a detailed analysis has been initiated.""Today we have attempted the PSLV C62 / EOS - N1 Mission. The PSLV vehicle is a four stage vehicle with two solid stages and two liquid stages,"" Isro chief V. Narayanan said.""The performance of the vehicle close to the end of third stage was as expected. Close to the end of third stage we are seeing more disturbance in the vehicle. Subsequently, there is a deviation in the vehicle observed in the flight path. We are analysing the data and will come shall come back at the earliest,"" he added.Isro launched EOS-N1, along with 14 co-passenger satellites and a capsule into a re-entry trajectory in a marathon mission, marking the space agency’s first mission of 2026.The flight comes months after a rare setback, when PSLV-C61, launched on May 18, 2025, failed to place the EOS-09 earth observation satellite into orbit due to a third-stage anomaly.The 44.4-metre-tall Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C62) lifted off from the First Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, in a commercial mission for NewSpace India Limited (NSIL).The launch marked the 64th flight of PSLV and the fifth mission of the PSLV-DL variant.The mission carried a diverse suite of technology demonstration satellites from India and overseas, covering applications such as AI processing in orbit, store-and-forward communication systems, IoT services, radiation measurement, and agricultural data collection.The primary payload, EOS-N1 (Anvesha), is a hyperspectral earth observation satellite designed for advanced surveillance and strategic monitoring.Among the notable secondary payloads was AayulSAT, developed by Bengaluru-based startup OrbitAID Aerospace, which serves as India’s first on-orbit satellite refuelling demonstrator. The mission aims to test technologies for propellant transfer and satellite servicing in low Earth orbit, a capability seen as critical for extending satellite lifetimes and enabling sustainable space operations.Another key payload, the KID re-entry capsule, a European technology demonstrator developed with a Spanish startup, was expected to be separated from the PSLV’s fourth stage and was designed to splash down in the South Pacific Ocean, validating controlled atmospheric re-entry technologies.The flight also included a mix of CubeSats and small satellites from universities and startups, including missions from Dhruva Space (CGUSAT), and international partners, supporting research and commercial applications in communication, IoT and Earth observation.The 2026 PSLV-C62 mission follows Isro’s detailed review of the PSLV-C61 failure, one of only a handful of setbacks in PSLV’s three-decade operational history. Isro had constituted a failure analysis committee after the May 2025 mission and implemented corrective measures before returning the launcher to flight.","Isro launched EOS-N1, along with 14 co-passenger satellites and a capsule into a re-entry trajectory in a marathon mission.

Between the numbers

The evolving battle

Late-night meetings in Delhi rarely make for calm politics, and the one that unfolded late evening last week between Union home minister Amit Shah and AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami, or EPS, was no exception.In optics, it was another routine round of(alliance) discussions ahead of the 2026 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. In substance, it revealed how the push for(control) was unsettling the alliance, exposing the deepest fault lines yet in the National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) attempt to present a credible, unified challenge to the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( DMK ) government led by chief minister MK Stalin.At the heart of the tension lies a demand that goes beyond the usual arithmetic of seat-sharing. The BJP reportedly wants a formal power-sharing assurance from the AIADMK, including at least three cabinet berths if an AIADMK-led NDA were to form the next government.For Tamil Nadu’s political culture, shaped by decades of Dravidian assertion and a strong emphasis on regional autonomy, such an explicit pre-election claim has few precedents.The reaction within the AIADMK has been wary, if not outright resistant, as the BJP’s clout in the South remains lean.The pre-poll power-sharing deal, however, is only one strand in a much larger and more byzantine political development. With just months to go before the 2026 polls, Tamil Nadu’s political field is unusually crowded and unsettled.The NDA is trying to stitch together a fragmented anti-DMK vote; the DMK is defending its record amid murmurs of alliance unease with the Congress, while actor-turned-politician Vijay has injected a new variable through his fledgling but closely watched Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK). The result is a state on the cusp of a multi-cornered contest, where perception may matter as much as numbers.For the BJP, Tamil Nadu remains the most challenging large state on the electoral map. Despite steady organisational work over the past decade and a growing vote share, the party has not yet translated presence into power.Its alliance with the AIADMK has therefore always been more than tactical and is seen in Delhi as the primary vehicle for relevance in the southern state. However, the current BJP strategy, curated mainly by Amit Shah, reflects this urgency.BJP has consistently maintained that merely contesting a limited number of seats as a junior partner no longer serves the long-term interests of the party. The proposal that the BJP and its own allies together contest around 56 of the state’s 234 assembly seats is part of this thinking.More striking, however, is the reported insistence on cabinet representation, a move intended to signal to cadres and voters alike that the BJP is not just supporting an AIADMK government but would be a stakeholder in governance.This push has coincided with a renewed effort by Shah and the central leadership to rebuild a broader NDA in the state. Former allies and breakaway factions are being courted again, including leaders who left the alliance last year. The BJP believes that consolidating these forces is essential to prevent vote-splitting that could once again hand the DMK an advantage.Yet, this centralised approach has also revived old anxieties. In Tamil Nadu, where electoral narratives are often framed around resistance to “Delhi control”, any perception that the BJP is dictating terms risks becoming a political liability rather than an asset for the AIADMK.For the AIADMK, the alliance question is as much about survival as it is about strategy. Since the death of J Jayalalithaa, oras she was popularly known, the party has struggled to regain the dominance it once enjoyed.In the 2016 elections, the AIADMK under Jayalalithaa had emerged victorious with 136 seats.The AIADMK-led alliance, in the 2021 state polls, which were fought in the absence of, won 75 seats, of which the AIADMK itself secured 66, while the DMK-led front swept to power with 159 seats. The verdict underlined both the AIADMK’s residual strength and the scale of the challenge ahead.After the 2021 assembly defeat, EPS moved decisively to consolidate control over the AIADMK, marginalising rivals and asserting himself as the party’s sole authority. This process effectively pushed out O Panneerselvam (OPS), once a key face of the party and a former chief minister. The EPS–OPS split was not just a leadership clash but a symptom of the AIADMK’s post-Jayalalithaa identity crisis.Palaniswami argued that a single centre of authority was essential for electoral recovery, while Panneerselvam continued to claim legitimacy through loyalty to Jayalalithaa’s legacy and sympathy among sections of the cadre. EPS emerged stronger within the party, but the split narrowed the AIADMK’s social and political reach at a time when it could least afford division.For the BJP, this internal fracture has been an enduring source of discomfort. The party has viewed Panneerselvam as more approachable and politically expendable, someone who could be accommodated without threatening the alliance’s structure. Palaniswami, by contrast, has been guarded and transactional, keen to keep both the BJP and expelled leaders at arm’s length to protect his authority and the party’s regional identity.This has left the BJP caught between competing compulsions: it cannot ignore EPS without risking the alliance, but it also hesitates to shut the door on OPS, whose limited yet specific influence could matter in a tight contest. The result has been an uneasy balancing act, one that reflects the BJP’s broader struggle to manage Tamil Nadu politics without appearing overbearing.Against this backdrop, Palaniswami’s reluctance to commit publicly to power-sharing with the BJP is rooted in political instinct.The AIADMK is also cautious about re-inducting expelled leaders and rival factions like the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK).The AMMK did not win seats but polled enough votes in several regions to dent the AIADMK’s prospects, particularly in the southern and delta districts.This residual vote base, drawn mainly from sections of the Thevar community and AIADMK loyalists disillusioned with the current leadership, makes the AMMK less a kingmaker and more a potential spoiler. For the BJP, bringing Dhinakaran back into the NDA is about preventing further fragmentation of the anti-DMK vote rather than expecting direct seat gains.While the BJP sees figures like O Panneerselvam and TTV Dhinakaran’s AMMK as assets who can consolidate specific caste and regional vote banks, Palaniswami views their return as a threat to internal cohesion and his own authority.The re-entry of the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) into the NDA has given the alliance a symbolic boost, but not without complications. Anbumani Ramadoss’s decision to align with the AIADMK-BJP front was meant to strengthen the NDA’s presence in northern Tamil Nadu, where the PMK traditionally draws support from the Vanniyar community. Though this adds social breadth to the coalition at a time when consolidation is critical, the PMK is far from united.The sharp and public rift between Anbumani and his father, party founder S Ramadoss, has fractured the cadre and weakened the party’s ability to transfer votes as a bloc. Rival claims over leadership and legitimacy have created confusion at the grassroots, blunting what was once the PMK’s core electoral strength.For the NDA, the PMK’s return improves optics but not certainty. Without internal cohesion, the party risks becoming an unreliable ally rather than a decisive force against the DMK in 2026.For the DMK, the turbulence within the NDA offers both opportunity and warning. The party’s sweeping victory in 2021, when it returned to power after a decade in opposition, was built on a broad coalition that included the Congress and several regional players.Since then, the government has focused on welfare schemes, social justice narratives, Tamil identity and language. However, incumbency carries its own risks. There are murmurs of unease within the DMK-led alliance, particularly the Congress seeking greater seat shares or a more visible role post the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.While these strains are far from a rupture, they are being closely watched by rivals eager to exploit any cracks. The DMK leadership, which is slowly transitioning from MK Stalin to Udhayanidhi Stalin , is also conscious that a fragmented opposition could paradoxically complicate its task.A three- or four-cornered contest may lower the winning threshold in individual constituencies, but it also introduces unpredictability. The party’s messaging has therefore doubled down on stability, contrasting its governance record with what it portrays as an unstable and opportunistic opposition camp.Perhaps the most intriguing element in the current churn is the emergence of Vijay as a political actor. His TVK has yet to contest a major election, but its entry has already altered calculations across the spectrum.Vijay’s appeal cuts across age groups, with particular resonance among younger voters and sections disillusioned with established parties.His carefully calibrated stance, critical of both the BJP and the DMK, positions the TVK as an alternative rather than an adjunct. This has attracted exploratory overtures from leaders sidelined within traditional formations, adding to the sense of flux.At the same time, the TVK’s strengths remain largely potential rather than proven.Organisational depth, booth-level machinery, and the ability to translate popular enthusiasm into votes are tests that only an election can provide. For now, Vijay’s presence serves as a wildcard, expectedly capable of influencing outcomes even if it falls short of forming a government.Tamil Nadu’s recent electoral history offers important context. In 2016, the AIADMK won 136 seats with around 41 per cent of the vote, while the DMK secured 98 seats with just under 40 per cent. The narrow margin reflected how small shifts in alliances and turnout can have outsized effects.Five years later, in 2021, the pendulum swung decisively. The DMK-led alliance polled close to 46 per cent and won 159 seats, while the AIADMK alliance’s vote share dipped to around 39 per cent, translating into 75 seats. The BJP, contesting as an ally, won four seats and improved its vote share, but remained dependent on the larger Dravidian partner.These figures highlight two enduring truths. First, alliances matter enormously in Tamil Nadu’s first-past-the-post system. Second, no single party, outside of peak DMK or AIADMK waves, can easily dominate without a broad coalition.As the state heads towards the 2026 elections, the political picture remains fluid. The BJP is betting that a reconstituted NDA, bolstered by returning allies and clearer power-sharing signals, can present itself as a viable alternative.The AIADMK is trying to balance that partnership with its need to project independence and reassure its core electorate. The DMK is defending its turf while watching for signs of opposition consolidation. And Vijay’s TVK is carving out space in a crowded field, its final impact yet to be measured.What is clear is that Tamil Nadu’s politics is entering a phase where old certainties no longer apply automatically. The familiar binary of DMK versus AIADMK is giving way to a more layered contest, shaped by national ambitions, regional identities, and the aspirations of a new generation of voters.Whether the NDA’s current troubles are a prelude to a stronger, more coherent front, or a symptom of deeper contradictions, will become evident only as alliances crystallise and campaigns take shape.

PMO likely to move to Sewa Teerth complex in next one week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pmo-likely-to-move-to-sewa-teerth-complex-in-next-one-week/articleshow/126491874.cms,".

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is likely to move to his new office at the newly built Sewa Teerth complex near Vayu Bhawan in the next one week. This will be the first time since independence when the PMO moves out of the seat of power at South Block built by British architect Herbert Baker.Officials said the office housing the PMO is fully ready. They added that the new PMO will be operational any time between Jan 14 (Makar Sankranti) and Jan 23 (Subhas Chandra Bose Jayanti). “Kharmas, considered inauspicious in Vedic astrology to avoid new ventures, is ending with Makar Sankranti on Wednesday. So, the shifting of PMO to the new building can happen anytime from Wednesday onwards. All preparations have been completed in the past two weeks,” said an official.South Block and North Block situated in the Raisina Hills were built in 1931. The history of PMO traces from a small PM’s Secretariat (PMS) in 1947 to provide basic administrative help to the PM. The first major structural change happened in 1964 after Lal Bahadur Shastri became PM when PMS got statutory status via Allocation of Business Rules. The authority of the office increased significantly during Indira Gandhi’s tenure and in 1977 this was officially renamed the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) during the Morarji Desai administration.The Cabinet Secretariat has shifted from Rashtrapati Bhawan to ‘Seva Teerth-2’ in September and ‘Seva Teerth-3’ is designated for the National Security Adviser’s (NSA) office. The NSA is likely to shift to the new complex in the next one week as well.The PMO and subsequently defence ministry moving out of South Block in the next few weeks will mean the country's power centre completely shifting out of Raisina Hills, which officials said is another example of govt’s thrust on getting rid of the colonial past and “mentality of slavery”. The North Block has been vacated completely with ministries moving out of the iconic building to new Bhawans that have come up along Kartavya Path.",PM Narendra Modi is likely to move to his new office at the newly built Sewa Teerth complex near Vayu Bhawan. This will be the first time since independence when the PMO moves out of the seat of power at South Block built by British architect Herbert Baker.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126491873,imgsize-576679,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-6.jpg"

MUMBAI: In a setback to the Mahayuti government, which was planning to transfer a double instalment of Rs 3,000 under its Ladki Bahin scheme to underprivileged women by Jan 14 - shortly before the Jan 15 elections to 29 municipal corporations, including BMC - state election commissioner Dinesh Waghmare has barred the advance payment for the month of Jan while allowing the pending payment for Dec 2025.Hence, the state will only be allowed to dispense the sum of Rs 1,500 for Dec to around 2.5 crore eligible women in the state by Jan 14.""The regular benefits of the scheme can be given while the model code of conduct is in force. But benefits cannot be given in advance. And new beneficiaries are also not allowed to be selected,"" Waghmare said in his order.In doing so, Waghmare went beyond the report of state chief secretary Rajesh Aggarwal which had only said that ""development work and schemes that were actually started before the announcement of the elections are allowed to continue during the code of conduct period.""In a post on X on Jan 7, rural development minister Girish Mahajan of BJP said that eligible beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahin scheme will receive a combined transfer of Rs 3,000 for Dec and Jan in their bank accounts before Makar Sankranti, which falls on Jan 14, terming it a ""special gift"" from chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.The flagship scheme of govt was credited with powering a landslide victory for the Mahayuti in the assembly polls last year.Congress filed a complaint to SEC and questioned the timing of the announcement, alleging it was a violation of the model code of conduct and aimed at influencing voters ahead of the corporation elections. SEC in turn had asked the chief secretary to send a report on the issue. Waghmare's order came after the report was sent.Meanwhile, on the issue of around 70 of 2,869 posts in the state's municipal corporations set for unopposed elections in favour of Mahayuti candidates, Waghmaresaid that the count was just 2.4% of the total seats.""This cannot be considered a threat to democracy.

PSLV fails for 2nd time in 9 months; 3rd-stage glitch costs 16 satellites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pslv-fails-for-2nd-time-in-9-months-3rd-stage-glitch-costs-16-satellites/articleshow/126492197.cms,".

Things started going wrong 8 min after launch, says Isro chairman

SRIHARIKOTA/BENGALURU: India's first space mission of 2026 failed on Monday after Isro's workhorse PSLV suffered a glitch in its solid-propellant third stage (PS3), costing 16 satellites and an ambitious project of strategic, diplomatic and commercial importance.The PSLV-C62 failure comes nine months after a glitch in the same third stage of PSLV-C61 prevented EOS-09, another strategic satellite, from reaching orbit on May 18, 2025. This is also the first time PSLV has failed consecutively. The main satellite was EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a DRDO satellite designed to give India's military sharper eyes in space through a hyperspectral imaging payload.Towards the end of the third stage we saw a little more disturbance in the vehicle roll rates and subsequently there was a deviation in the flight path. We are analysing the data,” Isro chairman V Narayanan said. Isro is yet to make public the failure analysis report of the PSLV-C61 mission. All appeared good on Monday when the 44.4-m PSLV, flying its fifth mission in dual strapon configuration, lifted off from SDSC’s first launch pad at 10.18 am, about 1.30 minutes after the scheduled time.About 8 minutes and 40 seconds later, between the thirdstage shut-off and fourthstage (PS4) ignition, something went wrong.Soon, Narayanan announced the mission had failed. It also carried a satellite (Munal) for Nepal and a technology demonstrator (AyulSat) from start-up OrbitAID aimed at cracking on-orbit refuelling, along with 13 other payloads.AyulSAT, which was to demonstrate fuel transfer internally and later act as a target satellite for OrbitAID’s chaser satellite planned about six months later, would have put India a step closer to testing on-orbit refuelling. China is the only country which now has on-orbit refuelling technology. OrbitAID founder and CEO Sakthikumar R told TOI on Monday: “We are now forced to launch both the target and chaser satellites together. We hope to do that later this year.”The rocket also carried satellites from the UK, Brazil, Thailand and Spain, apart from payloads developed by Indian startups demonstrating several technologies, including AI processing in orbit, store-andforward communication systems, IoT services, radiation measurement, agricultural data collection, and a re-entry capsule to be deployed after re-start and deorbit of the PS4 stage. This failure is the third launch setback for Isro since Jan 2025 — GSLV-F15, which carried the NVS-02 navigation satellite, failed to place the satellite in geostationary orbit due to a propulsion system malfunction.","India's first space mission of 2026 failed on Monday after Isro's workhorse PSLV suffered a glitch in its solid-propellant third stage.

Why the German Type-214NG was selected



Make in India at the core



Pakistan, Karachi and the logic of sea denial



China’s expanding undersea footprint



Strategic timing of Merz’s visit



French-origin Scorpene follow-on plan put on hold as Project-75I gained priority



Long-term impact on India’s naval posture



NEW DELHI: More than five decades after Indian naval strikes crippled Karachi during the 1971 war, undersea power is once again at the heart of New Delhi’s strategic thinking. As German Chancellor Friedrich Merz began his visit to India on Monday amid a more volatile regional and global security environment, discussions around Project-75I have acquired fresh urgency.The Indian Navy’s plan to induct six next-generation conventional submarines equipped with air-independent propulsion reflects a convergence of hard lessons from history, renewed friction with Pakistan following recent crises, and China’s expanding undersea presence in the Indian Ocean. Together, these factors are pushing India towards one of its most consequential naval procurement decisions in years, one that blends deterrence, indigenisation and long-term strategic signalling.Project-75I is the Indian Navy’s flagship programme to build six modern diesel-electric submarines equipped with fuel-cell-based air-independent propulsion, advanced sensors, torpedoes and missile systems. The Ministry of Defence issued the Request for Proposal for the project in July 2021 under the Strategic Partnership Model, describing it as a key pillar of the government’s Make in India push, according to a PIB statement.The project envisages indigenous construction, long-term technology transfer and the creation of a domestic submarine-building ecosystem. The estimated cost was over Rs 40,000 crore at the RFP stage, with current assessments placing the final contract value closer to $8 billion, or about Rs 72,000 crore, based on configuration and lifecycle support.For the Indian Navy, the programme addresses a critical gap. Its conventional submarine fleet is ageing even as undersea activity by China and Pakistan increases in the Indian Ocean and along India’s maritime approaches.The Indian Navy has selected the German Type-214 Next Generation submarine, edging out Spain’s S-80 Plus offered by Navantia, defence sources said. The decision was driven primarily by the maturity of the German fuel-cell-based AIP system, acoustic stealth and lower lifecycle risk.AIP allows submarines to remain submerged for weeks without surfacing or snorkeling, reducing detection risk. In contested waters, endurance and silence are decisive. The Type-214’s AIP technology is widely regarded as operationally proven, while competing systems are still undergoing validation.In undersea warfare, reliability and survivability often outweigh novelty. That calculus appears to have guided the Navy’s choice.Under the proposed framework, all six submarines will be built in India at MDL, with TKMS providing design authority, engineering expertise and technical consultancy. Indigenous content is expected to start at around 45 percent and rise to nearly 60 percent by the final boat, aligning with Atmanirbhar Bharat goals.TKMS and MDL signed a memorandum of understanding in June last year to jointly pursue the project, laying the groundwork for the partnership. MDL’s prior experience building Scorpène-class submarines under the earlier Project-75 strengthened its case as the Indian strategic partner.The ministry of defence has repeatedly stressed that Project-75I is not only about acquiring platforms but about absorbing complex submarine design and construction technologies, as outlined in the 2021 PIB release.India’s emphasis on undersea capability is rooted in history. During the 1971 war, the Indian Navy’s attacks on Karachi port crippled Pakistan’s maritime logistics and fuel supply, accelerating Islamabad’s defeat. That episode stressed how control of the seas can shape outcomes on land.The relevance of that lesson resurfaced during Operation Sindoor in May 2025, when tensions with Pakistan escalated following a major terror provocation. Between May 8 and May 11, India placed its naval forces on heightened readiness, with Karachi again emerging as Pakistan’s most critical vulnerability.Karachi handles the bulk of Pakistan’s maritime trade and energy imports. India’s ability to credibly threaten that hub, even without firing a shot, highlighted the deterrent value of naval and undersea power. New submarines with extended underwater endurance would sharpen that leverage.Beyond Pakistan, China looms large in India’s maritime threat assessment. The People’s Liberation Army Navy operates a rapidly expanding submarine fleet, including nuclear-powered platforms that have increasingly deployed into the Indian Ocean.Chinese submarines have docked at regional ports and conducted patrols close to Indian waters, while Pakistan, with Chinese assistance, is also upgrading its submarine arm. For Indian planners, this twin challenge has made restoring conventional submarine strength an urgent priority.Project-75I is designed to plug that gap by giving India a survivable, persistent undersea capability suited to monitoring choke points, tracking adversary submarines and conducting sea-denial operations.Chancellor Merz’s visit from January 12–13 comes amid a broader effort by Germany to expand its strategic footprint in the Indo-Pacific. Berlin and New Delhi are also working toward an EU-India free trade agreement, as noted by AFP.For India, the potential submarine deal fits into a wider diversification of defence partnerships beyond legacy suppliers such as Russia. For Germany, it represents an opportunity to anchor a long-term industrial and security relationship with the world’s largest democracy.According to informed defence sources cited by idrw.org, the final contract is not expected to be signed during Merz’s visit but could be concluded within the next three months, with the high-level engagement expected to provide political momentum.In October 2025, India put on hold plans to build three additional French-origin Scorpene submarines at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited, even as it moved decisively to push ahead with Project-75I, which envisages the construction of six new-generation German-origin diesel-electric submarines at the same shipyard, The Times of India reported.Top government sources told TOI that the proposal for the three additional Scorpenes, estimated to cost around Rs 36,000 crore, “was not being pursued” at the time, although a formal decision to scrap it had not been recorded. While cost negotiations for the Scorpene follow-on order had concluded in the previous fiscal, final clearance from the Prime Minister-led Cabinet Committee on Security remained on hold.Officials told TOI that the German submarines under Project-75I were considered “a generation ahead” in terms of technology and capability. Concerns also existed about MDL’s ability to simultaneously execute two complex submarine construction programmes. The six original Kalvari-class submarines had already been built at MDL under the earlier Project-75 contract signed in October 2005, with the first boat INS Kalvari commissioned in December 2017 and the sixth, INS Vagsheer, inducted in January 2025.All six Kalvari-class submarines were slated to be retrofitted with the DRDO-developed air-independent propulsion system to improve underwater endurance. AIP allows a diesel-electric submarine to remain submerged for nearly two weeks, compared to boats without the system that must surface or snorkel every few days to recharge batteries.In contrast, the submarines planned under Project-75I, to be built in partnership with Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, were designed to incorporate AIP from the outset, along with land-attack cruise missiles and other next-generation technologies, TOI reported.Sources told TOI that the decision to proceed with final techno-commercial negotiations for the six German submarines, with an option for three more at a later stage, followed extensive deliberations involving the defence ministry, the Navy and the National Security Council Secretariat. Formal contract negotiations began in September 2025.“These new-generation boats under P-75I will come with design ToT (transfer of technology) and a greater indigenisation level of around 60%. The project will serve as a bridge to the future P-76, under which conventional submarines will be constructed based on totally indigenous design,” a source told TOI.Despite the pause on the Scorpene extension, officials indicated that France’s broader strategic partnership with India remained strong. Negotiations progressed on additional Rafale fighters for the Indian Air Force’s proposed 114 multi-role fighter aircraft programme, as well as a collaboration to co-develop a powerful jet engine with French major Safran for India’s fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft was nearly finalised.At the time, the Navy’s conventional submarine strength stood at six Scorpenes, six ageing Russian Kilo-class boats and four German HDW submarines, alongside two nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. China, by comparison, operated more than 50 diesel-electric and around 10 nuclear submarines and was in the process of supplying eight Yuan-class AIP-equipped submarines to Pakistan, a development seen as a major capability boost for Islamabad, TOI reported.Once inducted, the six Type-214NG submarines will significantly enhance the Indian Navy’s capacity for covert surveillance, sea denial and precision strike missions. Their sensors, weapons and endurance will form a key layer of India’s maritime deterrence architecture.Equally important is the industrial legacy. By absorbing advanced submarine technologies, India positions itself for future indigenous designs and follow-on projects. MDL’s role would be strengthened, and a specialised domestic supply chain would be deepened.Project-75I marks one of the most consequential naval procurement decisions India has taken in years. It addresses hard lessons from 1971, recent operational realities with Pakistan, and the growing challenge posed by China’s undersea expansion.As Germany’s chancellor arrives in India, the submarine negotiations underscore how defence industrial cooperation has become central to New Delhi’s foreign policy. From Karachi’s burning docks in 1971 to the silent depths of the Indian Ocean today, India’s maritime strategy is being reshaped through capability, indigenisation and strategic foresight.",Project-75I is the Indian Navy’s flagship programme to build six modern diesel- electric submarines. The Indian Navy has selected the German Type-214 Next Generation submarine. The decision was driven primarily by the maturity of the German fuel-cell-based AIP system.

NEW DELHI: Lauding India's Gen Z, PM Narendra Modi on Monday said it is full of creativity as he emphasised that his govt's reforms have opened countless opportunities for them in contrast with the stifling rules of the previous UPA govt that caught them in a web of compliances and curbed their entrepreneur spirit.Speaking at Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue to commemorate Swami Vivekananda 's birth anniversary, he said no country can develop without self-confidence and told the largely young audience that it is their responsibility to end the ""slave mindset"" that afflicted a generation of Indians due to the education policy of Thomas Macaulay.His laudatory words for Gen Z, which has ruled global headlines for a while largely due to a string of anti-govt protests it has spearheaded in different countries, including in neighbouring Bangladesh, have come against the backdrop of a few opposition leaders referring to their agitations outside and seeking to coopt them in their agitation against the PM Modi govt. The Rahul Gandhi-led Congress campaign against alleged ""vote chori"" reached out to the young generation in its bid to ""save"" democracy.PM Modi said that India's youth with its innovative ideas, energy and purpose is at the forefront of nation-building. Ruing the ""slavery mindset"", he said imported products were seen as a ""guarantee"" of quality, while Indian goods and traditions were looked at with an inferiority complex, urging the young generation to follow Vivekananda who was open to best practices from abroad but took on the misconception spread about India's heritage.Turning to the rich legacy of Indian storytelling, including epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata, he suggested that the new crop of entrepreneurs in the gaming sector can develop mythological stories into games and take them global. ""Our Hanuman ji can dominate gaming in the world,"" he said, adding that it will export Indian culture in a modern way.He contrasted the opening of a string of sectors ranging from space to nuclear power and defence and easing of regulations and taxes ushered by his govt with the UPA era, which, he said, was accused of policy paralysis and its inability to implement things on ground.So many rules and restrictions existed at the time that youth had few choices, and even applying for a job or a loan from banks demanded a web of compliances, he added.He said, ""As a CM and now as PM, I have put a lot of trust in the young generation, your capability and talent."" Sectors restricted to the govt have been opened to private players, PM Modi added.He praised their presentation on different themes and said, ""It shows the mood of Gen Z in India. India's Gen Z is full of creativity.""Noting the participation of a huge number of youngsters in the dialogue, he said the popular term of ""think tank"" can't capture their immense size and deep research.","PM Narendra Modi said that India's youth with its innovative ideas, energy and purpose is at the forefront of nation-building.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

BENGALURU: When OrbitAid's 25-kg Ayulsat lifts off aboard Isro's PSLV-C62 Monday, the mission's success will bring India a step closer to becoming the second country in the world to demonstrate on-orbit satellite refuelling, a capability so far claimed only by China, reports Chethan Kumar.Last year, China carried out a similar demonstration, but details remain limited and official disclosures sparse. No other spacefaring nation, including the US, has publicly demonstrated the technology in orbit. However, US firm Astroscale is developing a refuelling technology but is yet to launch.Ayulsat won't demonstrate a full on-orbit re-fuelling. It is designed as a target satellite to validate fuel transfer in the space environment. Unlike more complex servicing missions involving two spacecraft, OrbitAid's first step focuses on internal refuelling within a single satellite, allowing engineers to study how fluids behave in microgravity under real orbital conditions. OrbitAid founder and CEO Sakthikumar R told TOI the first refuelling is expected to take place within four hours of launch.",OrbitAid's 25-kg Ayulsat lifts off aboard Isro's PSLV-C62 Monday.

Deal St: Cognizant inks over $1bn contract with Novartis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deal-st-cognizant-inks-over-1bn-contract-with-novartis/articleshow/126473146.cms,".

BENGALURU: Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis as part of a consolidation contract that includes renewals as well as new scope spanning application services, infrastructure, data and AI-led offerings, sources told TOI.This marks the second consecutive billion-dollar deal for Cognizant in less than a year, after it won a large contract from UnitedHealth Group last year. UnitedHealth ranks among Cognizant’s biggest customers, supported by a partnership spanning nearly two decades.When TOI reached out, a Cognizant spokesperson said the company is currently in a silent period and had no comment. An email sent to Novartis did not elicit a response until the time of going to press.Sources said Cognizant’s EMEA and APAC teams played a key role in clinching the deal under the leadership of Gagan Syal, head of life sciences for EMEA and APAC at Cognizant.Phil Fersht, CEO of USIT advisory HfS Research, said the rise in half-billion-dollar and larger IT services deals reflects a structural reset in how enterprises buy technology, rather than a surge in discretionary spending. “CIOs are aggressively consolidating vendors, bundling what were once multiple mid-sized contracts into fewer, broader and longer-term engagements with clearer accountability.These deals now typically span seven to ten years and combine transformation, run, cloud, data and AI under a single commercial construct, making the headline value appear larger even though annual spend is often comparable to legacy budgets,” he said. Fersht added that AI-led modernisation has become non-deferrable, as enterprises cannot pause core system renewal, cloud migration, cybersecurity or data platform investments, pushing deal sizes higher as “change plus continuity” are brought together.Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of US-based Everest Group, said Cognizant has been the most aggressive among Indian-based providers in combining a strong vision for AI transformation with very competitive pricing. “This has positioned them to take share in a hyper-competitive market. The vendor consolidation trend, of which the Novartis transaction is a leading example, is ripe for this approach. We are aware of other large transactions where Cognizant is in the lead,” he said.Healthcare contributes around 30% to Cognizant’s revenue. Early in its growth journey, the company rapidly expanded its healthcare footprint, counting nine of the top 10 payers—including United, Anthem, Cigna and Aetna—as customers, along with nearly 30 major pharma companies such as Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly.Novartis operates three state-of-the-art centres in India across two cities—Hyderabad, where it has facilities at the Novartis Corporate Center (NOCC) and Genome Valley, and Mumbai. The company employs around 8,500 people in the country.India serves as a key hub in Novartis’s global operations, supporting the development of breakthrough medicines across therapy areas including cardiovascular, oncology, immunology, neurology and global health. The India centres support a wide range of global functions such as global clinical operations, technical R&D, patient safety and pharmacovigilance, regulatory affairs and advanced quantitative sciences, among others.","Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has agreed to test the constitutional validity of a law giving lifelong immunity to the Chief Election Commissioner and election commissioners from civil and criminal prosecution after a PIL alleged it would make the Election Commission a law unto itself, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.After hearing arguments from S N Shukla for NGO 'Lok Prahari', a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi issued notices to the Union govt and EC, and sought their responses. ""We will examine whether it is constitutionally permissible to give CEC and ECs (election commissioners) such immunity from prosecution,"" the bench said Monday.NGO ‘Lok Prahari’ challenged Section 16 of CEC and Other ECs (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023, which provided that “...no court shall entertain or continue any civil or criminal proceedings against any person who is or was a chief election commissioner or an election commissioner for any act, thing or word, committed, done or spoken by him when, or in the course of acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty or function”.The NGO’s S N Shukla said Supreme Court in the M S Gill case, while giving Election Commission independence and autonomy to conduct elections, had ruled that it should not make EC a law unto itself.The present provision would enable the CEC and election commissioners to act in an unaccountable manner and could jeopardise free and fair elections, which is the basic requirement of a democracy. The NGO alleged that Section 16 was not part of the original bill tabled in Parliament in Aug, 2023 and was surreptitiously introduced “as an afterthought in the last-minute amendment to the bill at the time of debate on the bill in Dec, 2023 without giving any valid reason and adequate justification in support of it”.Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, had recently targeted the CEC and election commissioners by saying if Congress and its allies came to office at Centre, it would disband this immunity and change the law retrospectively to hold them accountable for any past wrongdoings in the conduct of elections.The NGO said Section 16 is against the settled law that no one is above the law, and pointed out govt gave no reason for hurried inclusion of immunity clause for CEC and election commissioners. The petitioner claimed that such immunity is not available to the President, governors or judges. The NGO alleged the offending clause was not discussed during the debate on the bill and that “the amendment was put to vote in a rushed hush hush manner”. The petitioner said, “Evidently, the approval of the House on the said amendment was obtained and given without application of mind.” It said, “The blanket permanent immunity from all civil or criminal proceedings against any present or former CEC or election commissioners is not only against the constitutional scheme and the intentions of the framers of the Constitution.”","NGO 'Lok Prahari' challenged Section 16 of CEC and Other ECs (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023. Section 16 says no court shall entertain or continue any civil or criminal proceedings against any person who is or was a chief election commissioner or an election commissioner.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126492153,imgsize-1017455,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-14.jpg"
Vaping case: Birla hints at action if charge established,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vaping-case-birla-hints-at-action-if-charge-established/articleshow/126494641.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Action is mandated if an MP violates Parliament's dignity, Speaker Om Birla asserted on Monday, hinting at proceedings against a Trinamool member accused of vaping inside Lok Sabha, in case the charge is established.Birla recalled that parliamentarians have been even stripped of their membership for misconduct, though insisting that it is for LS, and not him, to make the decision after a parliamentary committee recommends action. The probe into BJP MP Anurag Thakur's complaint against the opposition MP, who was not named, for e-smoking during proceedings in the last session is nearing completion, he added.Birla confirmed finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her ninth Budget on Feb 1. Though govt had indicated that it will stick to the convention of presenting the Budget on Feb 1, Birla's is the first official voice to declare the same. Parliamentarians are meant to work all the time and should not be seen as employees, the Speaker added.On Conference of Speakers and Presiding Officers of the Commonwealth (CSPOC), which India will host after 16 years, he said Pakistan will not be a part of it, nor will Bangladesh, as the latter has had no Speaker since dissolution of its parliament by the interim govt, which has announced a fresh election.India will be hosting the biggest edition of CSPOC, with 42 of 56 member nations, including UK, Australia and Canada, having confirmed their participation.Asked if Lok Sabha has followed the rules in constituting an inquiry committee to probe the charge of corruption against Justice Yashwant Varma, Birla said it has put forth its views in Supreme Court, which has reserved its decision on the Allahabad HC judge's legal challenge.Varma has argued that since a notice for his removal was submitted in RS on the same day as in LS, both Houses should have been part of the consultation process and the speaker should not have announced the committee unilaterally. RS has told SC that it had never admitted the opposition-sponsored notice as it was ""defective"" on many counts.","Birla confirms finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her ninth Budget on Feb 1.

Visa-free transit announced for Indians travelling to and from UK via Germany,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/visa-free-transit-announced-for-indians-travelling-to-and-from-uk-via-germany/articleshow/126494637.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indians will soon be able to travel to & from the UK via Germany, in a significant development for Lufthansa, Air India and desi globetrotters. Germany has announced visa-free transit for Indians during Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s official visit to India. Travel agents and airlines are now awaiting the date from this will be implemented.Once effective, desi travellers will be able to travel between India and the UK via Germany on Lufthansa. Also, Air India will be able to code share with Lufthansa to & from the UK and increase passenger numbers on its German flights.“ Announcement of visa free transit for Indian passport holders for transiting through Germany,” govt said in a statement on the 27 outcomes of the Chancellor’s India visit. Once implemented, this move will partially undo the impact on Indian (and many other foreign) travellers caused by Brexit six years ago.At the time of Brexit to “hurt” each others’ airlines, the UK and EU mandated a transit visa will be required for travelling to one via the other. Which means, an Indian going from Delhi to London via Frankfurt will require a transit Schengen visa to get on the connecting flight. Similarly, an Indian travelling from Mumbai to Munich via London will require a transit UK visa to take the connecting flight.The UK is a huge market for Lufthansa and Air India. Once implemented, this development will again enable Lufthansa to fly travellers (both flying it and code share ones on Air India) from India via its hubs in Germany to the UK. There are also some other visa-free destinations also which Indians can now travel to & from by transiting from Germany, like those in the Caribbean.Transit visa requirements must be kept in mind while booking tickets. There have been numerous cases when people booked via some unscrupulous agents or online travel agencies (OTAs) by just seeing the lowest price. For instance, travelling from India to Canada on an American carrier (for just transiting via the US) means the passengers must have a US visa.Similarly, going from India to the US via Canada means a transit visa for the latter is required. Ditto for those travelling from India to the UK via Schengen states and the Schengen States via the UK. Soon Germany will be an exception for the UK.","Germany has announced visa-free transit for Indians during Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s official visit to India.

Gen Z protests in 3 South Asian nations must be studied: Tewari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gen-z-protests-in-3-south-asian-nations-must-be-studied-tewari/articleshow/126494593.cms,",

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Manish Tewari said that there should be a deep study of Gen Z protests that brought down govts in three South Asian countries in last three years to check if they were organic movements arising out of grievances.Tewari said these movements should be examined for critical difference between autonomous agitations over grievances, and agitations driven by narratives where grievances may have been weaponised. Though he did not point at any country which could have virtually carried out coups in Asia in the name of youth protests, his remark suggested that suspicions could not be simply brushed off. Starting with Sri Lanka, protests brought down elected govts in Nepal and Bangladesh - all in the Indian neighbourhood.The note of caution came as Tewari spoke about the turbulent contemporary world, from Venezuela to Bangladesh to Greenland to Ukrainian invasion, at the launch of his new book, 'A World Adrift'. The book was released by former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha at IIC, and the gathering included P Chidambaram, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Vivek Tankha, Mukul Wasnik, and a host of foreign delegates, among others.Tewari dismissed the belief that ""India has lost Bangladesh"" after protests toppled the Sheikh Hasina govt that set in motion developments which have increased the friction between India and Bangladesh. He said India invested blood and treasure in creating Bangladesh under Indira Gandhi, and ""that reality is not lost on people of Bangladesh"". He said the present transition govt in Dhaka is belligerent towards India for inexplicable reasons, but there is an ""emotive connect"" between the neighbours, and Bangladesh will be back in India's eminent domain in coming time.","Congress MP Manish Tewari said there should be a deep study of Gen Z protests that brought down govts in three South Asian countries in last three years.

NEW DELHI: The Defence Research and Development Organisation ’s Defence Research & Development Laboratory has successfully conducted a flight-test of the third-generation fire-and-forget man-portable anti-tank guided missile (MPATGM) with top attack capability against a moving target in the KK Ranges of Ahilya Nagar in Maharashtra. The test was conducted on Sunday.The anti-tank guided missile can be launched from a tripod or military vehicle launcher and its warhead is capable of defeating modern main battle tanks.Defence minister Rajnath Singh has lauded DRDO , development-cum-production partners (DcPP) and the industry for the successful test and called it an important step towards ‘ Aatmanirbhar Bharat ’.DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat said the trial target was successfully conducted, thereby leading the weapon system for induction into the Indian Army .The indigenously-developed MPATGM consists of state-of-the-art indigenous technologies like imaging infrared (IIR) homing seeker, all electric control actuation system, fire control system, tandem warhead, propulsion system and high-performance sighting system, which have been developed by DRDO's sister laboratories — Research Centre Imarat, Hyderabad, Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory, Chandigarh, High Energy Materials Research Laboratory, Pune and Instruments Research & Development Establishment, Dehradun.The thermal target system was developed by the defence laboratory, Jodhpur, to simulate the target tank. The IIR seeker is well accomplished with day and night combat operation capability. Bharat Dynamics Ltd and Bharat Electronics Ltd are the DcPP for the weapon system.","The anti-tank guided missile can be launched from a tripod or military vehicle launcher.

"PSLV-C62 rocket fails to reach orbit, loses DRDO’s ‘super-eye’, 15 sats with disruptive technologies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pslv-c62-rocket-fails-to-reach-orbit-loses-drdos-super-eye-15-sats-with-disruptive-technologies/articleshow/126494578.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Isro 's PSLV-C62 rocket’s “deviating from its planned flight path” during the launch on Monday is a big setback for not only security agencies that lost crucial defence satellite EOS-N1 (Anvesha) but also several Indian and foreign institutions, startups and companies that lost 15 satellites possessing disruptive technologies that would have brought revolutionary changes in the space sector if they had reached their sun-synchronous orbit home at an altitude of 512 km.“We attempted the PSLV-C62 EOS-N1 mission. The PSLV is a four-stage vehicle - the first stage is a solid motor with two strap-ons, the second stage is liquid, the third stage is solid, and the fourth stage is liquid. The performance of the vehicle close to the third stage was as expected and as predicted,” Isro chairman V Narayanan said after the botched launch at the Sriharikota spaceport.“However, near the end of the third stage, we observed some disturbance in the vehicle, and there was a deviation in its flight path. As a result, the mission could not proceed as expected. We are now analysing the data from all ground stations, and once the analysis is complete, we will come back to you,” he said.DRDO's EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a strategic super-eye, was a hyperspectral imaging satellite capable of “seeing” in hundreds of wavelengths to identify materials on the ground—making it a high-priority asset for national security and surveillance.Had it been placed in orbit, it would have helped India secure its borders through its advanced remote sensing capabilities and would have also seen civilian application in areas such as agriculture, urban mapping and environmental observation.Last year too, India lost a crucial defence satellite, EOS-09, in space when the PSLV-C61 mission failed on May 18, 2025, due to an anomaly in the third stage, like this time. EOS-09 was an advanced Indian radar imaging satellite designed for all-weather, day-and-night surveillance, crucial for border monitoring, disaster response and resource management.The PSLV-C62 mission was also carrying KID or Kestrel Initial Technology Demonstrator from a Spanish startup. It was a small-scale prototype of a re-entry vehicle developed by the startup. KID was scheduled to be the last co-passenger to be injected, after which it was slated to re-enter the earth’s atmosphere towards splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean.Bengaluru-based space startup OrbitAID Aerospace was poised to make history with AayulSAT, India’s first on-orbit satellite refuelling payload. AayulSAT was aimed at extending satellite lifespans by enabling refuelling and servicing in orbit, addressing space debris and sustainability challenges.Hyderabad startups TakeMe2Space and Eon Space Labs were launching India's first orbital AI lab. It featured the MIRA telescope and a disruptive model to slash space data costs. Satellite MOI-1 would have taken photos from an altitude of 500 km and also processed them there itself.Other secondary payloads were cubesats developed by students of several universities and Indian startups, including CV Raman Global University's CGUSAT-1, Dhruva Space’s DA-1, Space Kidz India’s SR-2, Assam Don Bosco University’s Lachit-1, Akshath Aerospace’s Solaras-S4 and Dayanand Sagar University’s DSAT-1. All satellites are now lost in space.","Isro's PSLV-C62 rocket’s “deviating from its planned flight path” during the launch on Monday is a big setback for security agencies.

Wife’s qualification no ground to deny maintenance: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wifes-qualification-no-ground-to-deny-maintenance-hc/articleshow/126494553.cms,".

PRAYAGRAJ: A wife cannot be denied maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC merely because she is highly qualified or possesses vocational skills, Allahabad HC has ruled, setting aside a Bulandshahr family court’s order. In its Jan 8 order, a bench of Justice Garima Prashad said it was misplaced for a husband to rely solely on his wife’s qualifications to evade his legal obligation to maintain her.The bench observed that a wife’s statutory right to maintenance cannot be infringed by claiming she has the capacity to earn, noting that mere potential to earn is distinct from actual gainful employment. The court said it is difficult for a woman to rejoin the workforce after years of domestic and childcare duties. The hard reality is that women are expected to fulfill these obligations, often at the cost of their education or career. But when marital discord arises, the very “sacrifice” is often portrayed as a ploy to extract money from the husband, HC said.“Such sweeping assumptions are not only unfair, but deeply insensitive to the social and emotional realities that women face,” HC added. The high court remanded the matter to the family court, directing it to determine maintenance for the petitioner wife and son on the basis of the husband’s gross income and the principles of social justice embedded in Section 125 CrPC, within a month.The additional principal judge of Bulandshahr court had rejected the wife’s application on the grounds that she concealed her professional education, was living separately without sufficient cause, and refused to return to her matrimonial home despite proceedings under Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act.","Allahabad HC sets aside a Bulandshahr family court’s order.

NEW DELHI: While sympathising with a young man from UP who will lose his govt job because of its adverse order over his not declaring a pending criminal case against him at the time of recruitment, Supreme Court on Monday emphasised that sympathy cannot supplant the law as such disclosure is not a simple procedural formality but a basic requirement for public service.""There is a maxim in law to the effect that ' dura lex, sed lex', which means the law may be harsh, but the law is law,"" a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh said while quashing the order of Allahabad HC which had held that the non-disclosure was of ""trivial nature"" and his appointment could not be set aside on that ground.""It is also a settled position in law that sympathy cannot supplant law. As such, while we acknowledge that loss of a govt job is not an easy loss to come to terms with, at the same time awareness of consequences is a necessary component of actions,"" the bench said.""Proper and complete disclosure in applications for govt employment is not a simple procedural formality, but a basic requirement rooted in fairness, integrity and public trust. Govt posts attract hundreds, and often thousands, of applicants for a single vacancy, each competing under the same stated conditions; scrupulous vetting of every candidate becomes imperative and essential to ensure a level playing field and to protect the credibility of the selection process.When an applicant withholds information about criminal antecedents, it undermines this process by depriving the appointing authority of the opportunity to make a fully informed assessment of suitability,"" the bench said.While the law recognises that non-disclosure, depending on the nature of the offence and accompanying circumstances, may not invariably be fatal to a candidature, it nevertheless remains a serious lapse. ""The gravity is significantly compounded when the non-disclosure is repeated, as it ceases to be accidental or inadvertent and instead reflects deliberate concealment. Such strikes at the core of trust reposed in candidates for public service, where honesty and transparency are indispensable attributes, and justify a far stricter view by the authorities,"" it said.In the case before it, the person was appointed as Sahayak Samiksha Adhikari, but his services were terminated after it was found there were two pending criminal cases against him, which were not disclosed by him in the form. He approached Allahabad HC, whose single as well as division bench quashed his termination, following which state govt moved SC.",A young man from UP will lose his govt job because of its adverse order over his not declaring a pending criminal case against him at the time of recruitment.

Isro sees warning in two consecutive PSLV failures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-sees-warning-in-two-consecutive-pslv-failures/articleshow/126494434.cms,".

BENGALURU: Any space agency will tell you that every rocket launch comes with anxious moments, no matter what the record is. Yet, India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) failing twice in consecutive attempts won't be easy for Isro to digest given its workhorse's record.PSLV has had 64 missions, of which four, including Monday's PSLV-C62, failed to put the spacecraft in orbit, and one in 1997 placed the payload on a lower orbit than the intended one. When a launcher is seen as proven, scrutiny can soften. But back-to-back failures need to be treated as a structural warning - not bad luck - as they suggest deeper issues, whether with quality control, supply chains, testing protocols, or configuration management.When PSLV-C61 failed last year, it brought down the rocket's success rate from 95.2% to 93.7%. Now, it has slipped further. Isro told TOI on Monday that the failures have affected the collective morale of the team. ""It would have been different if any other launcher failed, but a PSLV failure worries us,"" said a scientist.An analysis of setbacks shows that PSLV-C62's failure could have been caused by unresolved issues from the failed PSLV-C61 on May 18, 2025.In both cases, PS3, or the third stage - a solid motor that provides a high-energy boost after the second stage burnout - suffered a glitch.While Isro has not made the previous failure analysis committee (FAC) report public, TOI has learnt there was a fall in chamber pressure of the motor case. The PSLV-C62 will now be analysed by another FAC. Isro said there was disturbance in the ""roll rate"" during the final stages of PS3 burning on Monday, and that caused a deviation.Failures before 2025 all point to different glitches. The first setback was on Sept 20, 1993 when PSLV-D1, the rocket's first mission, failed due to a guidance system error during the separation of PS2 (a liquid stage).Isro launched again on Oct 15, 1994, and thereon PSLV showed no glitch until Sept 29, 1997, when PSLV-C1 mission became a ""partial success"". Here, the pressure regulator on PS4 (which uses twin liquid engines) failed, resulting in the satellite being placed in a lower-than-intended orbit.The 1997 glitch has not repeated. The next failure came 20 years later, in Aug 2017, when the PSLV-C39 mission failed. In this case, the problem was with the heat shield, which has since been rectified. After the PSLV-C39 mission, the launch vehicle had 21 successful flights before the failure last year, followed by Monday's.","PSLV has had 64 missions, of which four failed to put the spacecraft in orbit.

‘Attack On My Life’: Suvendu Adhikari Targets Mamata Banerjee, Levels Serious Allegation

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday asked Election Commission to respond within a week to TMC MP Dola Sen's plea accusing the poll panel of arbitrarily deleting more than 58 lakh names from West Bengal's draft voters' list by refusing to accept valid and permissible documents from people during the SIR exercise.Appearing for Sen, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said, ""What is this happening? EC is sending instructions to various election officers through WhatsApp messages or through video conferencing. This is impermissible as all such instructions must be in writing to ensure transparency in the process of preparation of voters' list.""A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi asked EC counsel Eklavya Dwivedi to respond to Sen's petition by Saturday, and posted the matter for Jan 19.Sen has sought extension of Jan 15 deadline for submission of claims and objections to draft voters' list. Calling EC 'WhatsApp commission"" for issuing instructions to election officers through the messaging platform and not through written orders, the MP said EC must be directed to accept permanent residence certificates, panchayat residence certificates and family registers as valid documents for inclusion in voters' list.The draft electoral roll for Bengal was published on Dec 16, and 58,20,898 names were deleted, which the Rajya Sabha MP alleged was without any notice or personal hearing. She said there has been a precipitous decline from 7,66,37,529 voters after the Special Summary Revision of 2025 to 7,08,16,616 voters on the draft electoral roll.She said contrary to the SOP for SIR, in several assembly constituencies, deletion decisions with respect to voters categorised as absentee, shifted, dead and duplicate (ASDD) are being processed centrally and marked en masse as 'Disposed - Form 7' on the Electoral Registration Officer Net Portal. ""Alarmingly, this appears to be occurring without physical verification, individual hearing or meaningful involvement of the EROs concerned,"" she alleged.Sen said, ""A majority of affected electors are women voters, whose surnames have changed post-marriage, leading to misclassification by algorithm used by EC; over 90% of the cases are mismatch in names attributable largely to failure of algorithm; minorities are largely affected by misclassification of algorithm.""As the final roll, scheduled to be published on Feb 14 (after closure of notice and hearing phase on Feb 7), Sen apprehended that the Bengal assembly elections will be immediately declared thereafter, and requested SC to direct EC to correct its voters' list revision process and attempt to include all eligible voters.",Supreme Court asks Election Commission to respond within a week to TMC MP Dola Sen's plea.

""Many of you have asked me for an update on the ongoing trade deal negotiations. Both sides continue to actively engage. In fact, the next call on trade will occur tomorrow,” he said after assuming charge.“India is the world's largest nation. So it's not an easy task to get this across the finish line, but we are determined to get there and while trade is very important for our relationship, we will continue to work closely together on other very important areas such as security, counter-terrorism, energy, technology, education, and health,” he added.“No partner is more essential than India. In the months and years ahead, it is my goal as ambassador to pursue a very ambitious agenda. We will do this as true strategic partners, each bringing strength, respect, and leadership to the table,” he said.India currently faces 50% tariffs on its exports to the US, 25% of which are penal tariffs for its crude oil imports from Russia. Both sides have been engaged in discussions for the first tranche of the trade deal to be finalised but a breakthrough is still elusive.In the meantime, US President Donald Trump has threatened higher tariffs on India if it doesn’t stop buying Russian crude and a new bill that proposes 500% tariffs on countries buying Russian oil has received his nod and will be up for vote in the Senate soon.Talking about the bond between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gor said, “.I've travelled all over the world with President Trump, and I can attest that his friendship with Prime Minister Modi is real. The United States and India are bound not just by shared interest, but by a relationship anchored at the highest levels. Real friends can disagree, but always resolve their differences in the end.”""I spoke with President Trump just yesterday, and I bring his warm wishes to all the people of India, especially his dear friend, the incredible Prime Minister Modi.""... It is great to be here as the United States' Ambassador. I come to this remarkable nation with profound respect and a clear mission: to take the partnership between our two nations to the next level. This is the intersection between the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy... During my last dinner with him, President Trump recounted his last visit to India and also his great friendship with the great Prime Minister of India. I hope the President will be visiting us soon, hopefully in the next year or two,” he added.","'Real Friends Can Disagree, But...': US Envoy Sergio Gor On India-US Ties, Comments On Trade Deal.

Gold price prediction today: What is the gold & silver price outlook in the near-term?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-january-13-2026-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-silver-prices/articleshow/126496127.cms,"While gold may rise further to $4706/$4803, we note that the Fed's concerns may dissipate to some extent. (AI image)

Gold price prediction

today:

Gold prices may trend upwards, but instead of chasing the rally, investors should look to buy on dips, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Here’s his outlook on gold prices:

Gold Performance:

Spot gold, following its monstrous rally of 4.61% to $4510 in the week ending January 9, advanced further to a fresh record high of $4630 on Monday due to escalating geopolitical risks and growing threats to the Fed's independence.

The yellow metal at the time of writing this article was trading at $4622, up 2.48% for the day. The MCX February gold contract at Rs 142,306 was up 2.51%.

Geopolitics watch:

The US President Trump, viewing Greenland of immense strategic security significance for the US, is not ruling out use of force to bring the Island into the folds of the US. His stance has rattled the European nations; thus, creating friction in the US-led NATO alliance that has been in place since the second World War.

Germany and the UK, to restrain the US manoeuvres over Greenland, are discussing plans for a military presence in Greenland. Germany will propose setting up a joint NATO mission to protect the Arctic region as the UK urges allies to beef up their security presence in the High North.

It is to be noted that the majority of Greenlanders support independence from Denmark and strongly oppose US control.

The US President Trump said Sunday that although his administration was in talks with Tehran to set up a meeting, he may act before then due to mounting death tolls and the Iranian government arresting protestors. As per the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency, at least 572 people, including 69 members of security forces, have been killed in the ongoing protests.

Threat to the Fed's independence:

On January 9, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) launched a grand jury investigation threatening a criminal indictment as the DoJ served the central Bank with subpoenas over the Fed Chair Powell's testimony about the Fed's building renovations that incurred around $2.50 billion expenses. The subpoenas are related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June 2025.

Pushing back against the US Administration’s action to indict the Fed, Powell in a video statement released Sunday, called the threat of criminal indictment as pretexts to undermine the Fed's independence in setting monetary policy.

The fresh episode of Trump escalating battle with the Fed is yet another attack on the Central Bank’s independence for not kowtowing to the Administration to cut rates swiftly.

However, the Trump Administration's latest attempt to corner the Fed is facing bipartisan pushback as Senator Tillis, a key Republican on the Banking Committee, blasting the justice probe, vowed to oppose any Trump nominees to the Fed until the matter is resolved.

Democrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer condemned the probe saying Trump is abusing law to control the central Bank.

Data roundup:

US nonfarm payrolls data released Friday showed a stabilizing but a weak US job market as nonfarm payrolls rose 50K in January Vs the forecast of 70K. Although the unemployment rate unexpectedly edged lower to 4.4% from 4.5% in November Vs the estimate of 4.5%, it could be because of shrinking job pool as fewer people looked for jobs. Two-month payroll net revision stood at -76K jobs. Nonfarm payrolls 3-month average was noted to be -22K.

US Dollar Index and yields:

On Monday, the US Dollar Index fell 0.4% to 98.76 on mounting risks to the Fed's independence.

Two-year US yields rose by around 1 bps to 3.54%, while ten-year yields at 4.18% were up 1.50 bps.

US equities recovered most of the intra-day losses and were only slightly lower.

ETF holdings:

Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 98.95 MOz as of January 9, 0.003 MOz lower YTD.

Upcoming data:

Focus will be on the US CPI data to be released on January 13. University of Michigan Sentiment and inflation expectations (January 9), PPI (January 14) and retail sales (January 14) will also be in focus.

Gold Price Outlook:

While gold may rise further to $4706/$4803, we note that the Fed's concerns may dissipate to some extent on bipartisan opposition to the Trump Administration’s stance. Geopolitical risks may provide more sustainable support to the metal, though.

Buying the dips is preferred over chasing the rallies. Immediate resistance is at $4655, while support kicks in at $4550/$4500/$4400.

It is worth noting that despite elevated geopolitical risks to the Fed’s authority, risk appetite remains healthy. Sharp rallies in metals have become highly correlated with the risk assets though with a relatively higher beta. Moves in yields have been muted despite risk to the Fed.

Silver: Up over 5%

Spot silver prices caught strong bids right from the overnight COMEX session opening and the metal remained buoyant throughout the day. It rose to a fresh record high of $86.21.

At the time of writing, spot silver was changing hands at $85.28, up 7.57% for the day. The MCX March silver contract at Rs 270,423 was up 7% for the day.

Earlier, the grey metal surged 9.67% to $79.85 in the week ending January 9.

ETF:

Total known global ETF silver ETF holdings stood at 853.04 MOz as of January 9, down by around 10.50 MOz YTD.

Lease rates:

One-month LBMA lease rate stood at 3.36%, elevated on a historical basis, but down from 7%+ rates seen a few days ago.

Silver Price Outlook:

Silver is expected to maintain its positive momentum but is quite extended at the current level.

Moves in precious metals are in tandem with moves in risk assets and industrial metal copper, therefore, momentum buying is also visible in these parabolic moves.

Lease rates and ETF inflows have eased, which is not so supportive for the metal.

Nonetheless, spot silver can extend its rally to $87.30/$89.33 unless derailed by much hotter than expected US CPI data. Support is at $83.75/$80.

Buying the dips with a suitable stoploss is preferable over rally chasing trading.

Overall, we maintain a constructive outlook on the metal, though sharp intermittent corrections are likely to punctuate the rallies, which would be deemed as healthy corrections.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

“Her family warned her”: Gisele Bündchen’s family reportedly never stopped preferring Tom Brady over Joaquim Valente,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/her-family-warned-her-gisele-bndchens-family-reportedly-never-stopped-preferring-tom-brady-over-joaquim-valente/articleshow/126452615.cms,"Gisele Bündchen’s family is reportedly uneasy about her marriage to Joaquim Valente, with Tom Brady still serving as a point of comparison. Sources claim relatives worry about financial imbalance and potential prenup loopholes, despite the couple’s happiness and growing family. While Bündchen appears confident in her choice, those closest to her remain cautious about long term security.

Gisele Bündchen’s family still compares Joaquim Valente to Tom Brady

With Gisele Bundchen moving into married life with Joaquim Valente, the family seems to have no genuine move out of the shadow of her former marriage with Tom Brady. Although the supermodel appears to be happy and unafraid of her new life, the people close to her were reportedly more cautious about it.Sources suggest the concern has little to do with love and more to do with long term security. Gisele Bündchen built a global empire through decades of modeling and business ventures. For her family, financial independence has always mattered, and comparisons to Brady remain unavoidable given his wealth and stature during their 13 year marriage.According to a source speaking to Page Six, Gisele Bündchen’s family fears her new marriage could create complications down the line despite legal safeguards. The source said, “Her family warned her that marrying a penniless guy when she is worth millions is a mistake. Her family told her to just live with him.”The source added, “But between Valente's pressure and her being a traditionalist, she felt since they have a child, they might as well marry. There is a prenup, but with some loopholes that mean if they divorce there will be a financial settlement for him.”That unease contrasts sharply with how Bündchen’s relationship with Brady once appeared.Brady earned his own fortune through football and endorsements, which removed financial imbalance from the equation. With Valente, the dynamic is different, even if the emotional bond appears strong.Bündchen and Valente met through her children’s jiu jitsu training and moved quickly after her 2022 divorce. In less than three years, they built a family and formalized their commitment. Publicly, there are no cracks. Privately, family members remain watchful.For now, Gisele Bündchen seems unfazed by outside noise. She has chosen stability, love, and tradition on her own terms. Whether her family’s worries prove valid will only be answered with time, but the comparison to Brady still lingers where it matters most behind closed doors.Also Read: Tom Brady’s suicide hotline reference fuels worries about his mental state after Gisele Bündchen split and Alix Earle dating rumors","Gisele Bündchen’s family is reportedly uneasy about her marriage to Joaquim Valente, with Tom Brady still serving as a point of comparison.

Beginning in 2026, the world faces economic insecurity, record inflation, and a cost-of-living crisis. But for the affluent few, it all appears far less significant than their bank accounts. Today, the total fortune of the world's 14 richest men exceeds $3 trillion in technology, luxury, fashion, AI, and investments. Elon Musk leads the league for the fifth year in a row, with a staggering $717.9 billion wealth that has nearly doubled in the last several years. In contrast, newcomers have joined this league as a result of AI and semiconductor storms, as well as anticipated investments. The symbolic wealth levels of this important few contrast with the growing disparity between the issues of the globe and the super-rich.As of 2026, the world’s wealthiest men continue to amass staggering fortunes despite global economic challenges. According to Forbes, the top 10 richest men, led by Elon Musk, now hold combined wealth exceeding $3 trillion, dominating sectors from technology and AI to luxury, fashion, and global investments, reshaping markets, influencing policy, driving innovation, and redefining modern economic power.Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.The value of Musk's net worth escalated from 2021’s $300 billion to 2026's $717.9 billion because of the phenomenal performance of electric cars, space exploration, and social media reach. Musk's entry and eventual support or endorsement of Donald Trump in politics made news but made no tangible contribution to or subtraction from his net worth. Tesla is leading in global electric cars, while SpaceX is working towards making rocket technology reusable. Musk's projects also cover energy storage, AI, and neural tech, providing him with multiple income streams. Musk's increases in net worth despite controversies, disagreements with authorities, or unpleasant encounters with influential persons in social media like Twitter make him the richest person in planet Earth.Co-founder of Google, Larry Page, has leaped to the second position in the worldwide list. There has been a remarkable increase in his wealth from 133.1 billion to 258.3 billion dollars in one year alone. Though Larry has kept himself away from the limelight, he has been pursuing long-term ventures such as the “moonshot” projects of Alphabet, which comprises self-driving automobiles and AI-based health care. Though he is no longer actively involved with Google, his impact on the company’s planning has ensured an increase in his wealth. He is the epitome of success for innovators who firmly believe that innovations related to the tech infrastructure of data enterprises will result in massive returns.Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who holds 98% ownership of Lāna‘i in Hawaii, has moved up to the third position for 2026. This follows his net worth rising from $199.5 billion. He has also served as a technology advisor for Artificial Intelligence policy and strategy with expertise gleaned from his years at Oracle. He has diversified his portfolio, including involvement with ‘real estate, sailing, and life sciences. Ellison has demonstrated his capacity to engage with entrepreneurship and diversify his reach globally, keeping him relevant as one of the most significant stakeholders among the wealthy across the world.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has slipped to the fourth position, down from $248.1 billion last year. Bezos is a visibly successful person due to his dominance in online e-commerce, cloud computing through AWS, and media ventures like Prime Video. Bezos has had enormous success due to decades of expansion, acquisitions, and reach, but he still invests in space technology through Blue Origin, along with philanthropic work in climate change and healthcare.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, is at number five with a net worth of $238.4 billion. The position is an improvement from last year, when he ranked fifth with a net worth of $155.4 billion. Sergey Brin's net worth has been strengthened by Alphabet’s success in AI, cloud computing technology, and autonomous driving technology. Sergey Brin is still engaged in innovation and is a major beneficiary of Alphabet's long-term initiatives.Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has also minutely slid out from the top five richest people, with a wealth ranking of $223 billion from the previous year’s assessment of $219.9 billion. Mark Zuckerberg keeps pushing the initiatives for the “metaverse,” AI, and social networking. Zuckerberg’s presence in shaping technology policies and trends around the world has not changed, even though there are certain fluctuations.France's luxury leader, Bernard Arnault, has fallen to the sixth spot from the first position in 2024, but the value of his net worth, which is sourced from the success of LVMH as well as brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora, is still a remarkable $192.4 billion, slightly lower from the previous year's $195.1 billion, thus symbolizing the timeless use value of exclusive luxury products.A Taiwanese national, Nvidia's co-founder, Jensen Huang, has experienced tremendous growth because of the AI and silicon revolution. His net worth increased from 128.4 billion to 163.9 billion dollars. Huang's vision to develop chips for the gaming, AI, and data center markets has made him one of the leading tech billionaires globally.The 95-year-old investment guru and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has an estimated net worth of $146.8 billion, a marginal improvement from $143.4 billion. The key to Mr. Buffett’s achievement is his long period of value investing and his knack for investing in businesses during favorable times and diversifying his investment portfolios across various sectors.Amancio Ortega, the Spanish fashion tycoon behind Zara, is still a giant in the industry with an estimated wealth of 145 billion dollars. His success in the fast-fashion industry has been fueled by expansion and supply chain management. Amancio Ortega proves that the success in the affordable fashion industry translates to the accumulation of unimaginable wealth.","Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.

What defines airline and airport punctuality





On-time performance has always been one of the key factors appreciated by air travel, impacting the lives of millions of air travellers every day. In Cirium's 2025 On-Time Performance Review, more than 1.8 million flights were considered to rank airlines and airports. An airline is said to be punctual if its flight arrives or departs within a time frame of 15 minutes, denoting the landing's benefit and support. This year, worldwide leaders like Qatar Airways, Aeromexico, and Delta Air Lines were at the top, and in the Asia-Pacific leaderboard, IndiGo, from India, secured a position in the top 10. Yet, with certain operational issues in Dec. 2025, the airline recorded a considerable 78.12% rate for arriving flights in a reduced total of 802,418 flights.The 2025 Cirium On-Time Performance Review shows that global and regional leaders maintain schedules despite operational challenges. While Qatar Airways, Aeromexico, and Delta dominate globally, IndiGo demonstrates that Indian carriers can compete on punctuality in the Asia-Pacific region. Travellers seeking reliable journeys in 2026 can now consider these rankings as a guide for selecting airlines and airports that prioritise efficiency, timeliness, and consistent operational excellence.Cirium uses on-time performance measured through arrivals within 15 minutes of schedule and departures within 15 minutes to assess efficiency. Airports are carefully evaluated on operational difficulty, potential disruption impact on passengers, and overall effectiveness in handling high volumes of passenger traffic. These rigorous criteria, combined with factors such as weather challenges, air traffic complexity, and infrastructure quality, have set a reliable global standard for airline and airport rankings, helping travellers and industry professionals better understand overall performance and operational excellence.","The 2025 Cirium On-Time Performance Review shows that global and regional leaders maintain schedules despite operational challenges.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has revealed he has no plans to step down from his position at the company anytime soon. He noted that he will remain in charge for now. During a question-and-answer session at CES, 62-year-old Huang said this in response to shareholders' questions about his future at the chipmaker. Huang has led Nvidia since he started the company in 1993. He said he currently has no plans to leave his role, while the company has yet to announce who may replace him in the coming days.Huang attributed his long tenure to his continued interest in the company’s operations and his ability to meet performance expectations. He said,Huang said that there is ain being Nvidia's CEO. He noted that the AI chipmaker's performance will not just affect the tech industry but will also impact the entire market.he explained.Huang and Nvidia will have a lot of work to do in the coming years. At CES, Huang announced Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin superchip, which will begin shipping later this year. The company also announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to develop self-driving technology that will compete with Tesla's Autopilot.The Vera Rubin platform, which is named after American astronomer Vera Rubin, who changed how scientists understand galaxy motion, was one of the biggest highlights. It promises to train AI 10 times more efficiently than its previous version, Blackwell. According to Huang, a 10 trillion-parameter model can now be trained in one month using one-quarter of the chips.Huang noted.Huang has been Nvidia's CEO since 1993. He took the company from a stock price of just pennies per share between 1999 and 2016 to more than $187 today, making it the most valuable company in the world.His tenure has been much longer than that of most other tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook (14 years), Meta's Mark Zuckerberg (22 years), and Tesla's Elon Musk (who founded SpaceX in 2002).Born in Taipei in 1963, Huang moved to the US at age nine after his parents sent him to study there. Due to a mistake, he ended up at a tough school in rural Kentucky, where he did chores like cleaning toilets and helped his roommate learn to read.He finished high school at 16, studied electrical engineering, and worked night shifts at a diner to support himself. In 1993, Huang co-founded Nvidia at a Denny’s restaurant.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ However, he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

This move allows for direct-to-cell services and speeds up to 1 Gbps. The FCC also eased coverage overlap rules, aiming for more reliable service and increased competition.

Putin's 'Starlink-KILLER' Spooks NATO; New Intel Claims Russia Exploring Anti-Satellite Zone Weapon

What FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said about the SpaceX approval

“This FCC authorisation is a game-changer for enabling next-generation services. By authorising 15,000 new and advanced satellites, the FCC has given SpaceX the green light to deliver unprecedented

satellite broadband capabilities

, strengthen competition, and help ensure that no community is left behind.”

“We find that authorisation for additional satellites is in the public interest, even as the Gen2

Starlink

Upgrade satellites remain untested on orbit. We defer authorisation of the remaining 14,988 proposed Gen2 Starlink satellites, including satellites proposed for operations above 600 km,”





The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has authorised SpaceX to expand its satellite network to enhance global internet and mobile connectivity. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the US government agency recently approved a request from the rocket company to deploy 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites. This authorisation will increase the total permitted number of satellites to 15,000 and will allow the company to operate across five different frequencies to increase network capacity and coverage.The expanded satellite constellation is also intended to support direct-to-cell connectivity and provide internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, the Reuters report claims. According to the FCC, the additional hardware will facilitate mobile services outside the US while providing supplemental coverage within the country. As per the report, the agency relaxed earlier regulations that limited overlapping coverage, enabling more reliable service.In a statement to Reuters, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said,The Reuters report noted that SpaceX had applied for permission to deploy close to 30,000 satellites, but the FCC said it is currently approving only 15,000 of them.the FCC noted.The FCC has even ordered SpaceX to launch 50% of its approved Gen2 satellites, put them in their assigned orbits, and operate them by December 1, 2028.SpaceX must launch the remaining satellites by December 2031. It must also complete the deployment of all 7,500 first-generation satellites into orbit by late November 2027.Last week, Starlink said it would start moving its satellites to lower orbits in 2026. The satellites currently orbiting at around 550 km (342 miles) will be lowered to 480 km. This move is meant to improve space safety.In December, Starlink said one of its satellites had a problem in space that created a small amount of debris. The company lost communication with the spacecraft, which was orbiting at 418 km. This kind of accident is rare for the satellite internet company.SpaceX has become the world's largest satellite operator through Starlink, a network of about 9,400 satellites that provide broadband internet to consumers, governments, and businesses.The FCC's former head, Jessica Rosenworcel, demanded more competition for SpaceX's Starlink in 2024. She pointed out that at the time, Starlink was in charge of almost two-thirds of all operational satellites.","The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has authorised SpaceX to expand its satellite network to enhance global internet and mobile connectivity.
