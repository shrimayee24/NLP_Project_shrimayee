India may raise Zakir Naik issue again during PM’s Malaysia visit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-may-raise-zakir-naik-issue-again-during-pms-malaysia-visit/articleshow/127961906.cms,"Fugitive Zakir Naik

While India and Malaysia will look to ramp up trade and defence ties during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Kuala Lumpur over the weekend, the issue of fugitive Zakir Naik’s extradition is also likely to be raised by the Indian side. The visit is likely to see signing of several MoUs, including one for cooperation with Malaysia’s thriving semiconductor industry.“We have had opportunities to discuss the issue in past visits also at various levels. And, we will probably continue to take up the issue until all technical procedures are completed, and we hope to get the outcome that we desire,” said MEA secretary (east) P Kumaran, responding to a question about Naik.India and Malaysia have an extradition treaty, but the case, as Malaysia maintains, will be resolved based on judicial consideration. The official said that Modi and his counterpart Anwar Ibrahim will review progress under the India-Malaysia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, especially in priority areas of cooperation such as trade, investments, defence, security, semiconductors, digital technologies, renewable energy, education, healthcare, and people-to-people exchanges.Kumaran also underlined the potential for defence cooperation between the two countries, saying that India is looking at sale of Dornier aircraft to Malaysia. “Malaysia also has Scorpene submarines. We are looking at opportunities to try and collaborate, especially in terms of mid-life upgrades, retrofitting etc,” said the official.","India and Malaysia have an extradition treaty, but the case, as Malaysia maintains, will be resolved based on judicial consideration.

"Migration ban on medics invalid, Delhi HC asks NMC to frame policy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/migration-ban-on-medics-invalid-delhi-hc-asks-nmc-to-frame-policy/articleshow/127961842.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has held as invalid prohibition on transfer or migration of a medical student from one college to another, and has directed National Medical Commission to formulate a “proper policy” to permit migration.A division bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia zeroed in on Regulation 18 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulation, 2023, and termed it “unreasonable and arbitrary”, and violating the Constitution.The bench was dealing with a petition by a medical student with 40% visual impairment who sought migration from Govt Medical College, Barmer to a college in Delhi. The court directed NMC to take a decision within three weeks on the petitioner’s transfer request.“What we find is that in the name of maintaining uniformity, standard and integrity in the matter of medical education across the institutions, total prohibition on transfer or migration of a student, need of which may occur in various situations, including the one which arose in this case, cannot be said to be reasonable; rather, in our opinion, such prohibition is manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary,” the high couty said in its order on Feb 4.The bench observed NMC’s stand that migration was prone to misuse could not be sustained, as the possibility of abuse could not be used to deny legitimate rights to a citizen.The court noted that the medical condition and capabilities of the petitioner were worsening on account of the harsh climate in Barmer, and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act mandated public bodies to ensure that persons with disabilities (PWDs) were provided “reasonable accommodation” and an “appropriate environment”. Provisions enacted by Parliament, the court said, cannot remain only a decorative and admirable piece of literature kept on a bookshelf.The judges further observed that NMC’s stand that the petitioner was aware of the weather conditions in Barmer before joining a college there was “nothing short of rubbing salt into the wounds”.","The Delhi high court has held as invalid prohibition on transfer or migration of a medical student from one college to another.

IAF’s Rafale-Led Flypast Caps Republic Day With A Global Showcase Of India’s Military Strength

NEW DELHI: Rubbishing speculation of possible delays in the delivery of the first batch of indigenous LCA Mk1A fighter jets to IAF, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Thursday said that “five LCA Mk1A aircraft are fully ready for delivery, incorporating major contracted capabilities in accordance with the agreed specifications”.HAL also said that “an additional nine aircraft have already been built and flown. Upon receipt of engines from General Electric (US company), these aircraft will be made ready for delivery”. “All design and development issues identified are being addressed in an expedited manner. HAL is in active discussions with IAF to deliver the aircraft at the earliest,” it said in a statement.HAL has received five engines from GE as on date. The supply position from GE is positive, and the future delivery outlook aligns with HAL’s delivery plans, the company said. HAL assured that it will meet the guidance projected for the current financial year.Besides LCA Mk1A aircraft, the company said it is simultaneously advancing multiple strategic programmes, including Indian Multi Role Helicopter (IMRH), Tejas LCA Mk2 and Combat Air Teaming System (CATS), all of which are expected to enter production after 2032.HAL had received the first contract from IAF for 83 LCA Mk1A jets (73 fighters and 10 trainers) in Feb 2021, and later, a follow-on contract in Sept 2025 for 97 additional LCA Mk1A aircraft (68 fighters and 29 twin-seaters) at a cost of over Rs 62,370 crore.The delivery of these aircraft would commence during 2027-28 and be completed over a period of six years.The aircraft would have an indigenous content of over 64%, with 67 additional items incorporated. In all, IAF had ordered 180 of these aircraft in two tranches.Some of the planes were supposed to be delivered last year, but IAF insisted that HAL provide the aircraft in a fully operational configuration. On Oct 17 last year, the company conducted the first flight of the first Tejas Mk1A prototype from its Nashik facility. At present, HAL’s fighter aircraft production capacity stands at 24 aircraft per year. At this rate, fulfilling the 180 aircraft Tejas Mk1A order would take over seven years, with IAF expected to receive the complete fleet no earlier than around 2033.Beyond the 180 Mk1A jets, IAF had previously acquired 40 LCA Mk1 (IOC/FOC variants), making a total of 220 LCA-type aircraft contracted or ordered across all variants.","HAL has received five engines from GE as on date.

But he called the MP a traitor, because he is a Sikh. This was an insult to the Sikhs, an insult to the Gurus.

PM slams Cong for eroding global trust

NEW DELHI: PM Modi Thursday celebrated the signing of the trade deals with the EU and the US, saying the pacts augur well for world’s “stability and pace of progress” and were evidence of the international community regarding India as trusted trading partner.“When the trade deal with the EU took place, the world became more confident of stability. After the deal with the US, the world has more confidence in not just stability but also pace of progress... It is a good sign for the world... The biggest beneficiaries (from the deals) will be the youth of the country,” he said.Modi’s remarks in Rajya Sabha, during the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address, came even as the treaty with the US is yet to be formally signed. It’s being seen as an indication that the two sides may have resolved their differences. The formal announcement of the deal is likely next week.Modi slammed the party for its failure to secure similar trade pacts during its tenure and said it’ll have to one day respond to what it had done to India that other countries weren’t willing to do trade deals.The 97-minute fiery speech that started amid sloganeering from a protesting opposition, saw PM hitting out at Congress for the erosion of trust of foreign partners in India’s capacity to deliver and saying that a lot of his energy was spent on rectifying the mistakes of past Congress-led govts to instill confidence globally.Modi also highlighted investments in emerging sectors such as AI, quantum computing, critical minerals, space technology and deep-sea exploration, describing them as pillars of India’s growth strategy. He called for a push towards quality manufacturing, innovation and research.He said Congress was more focused on “vote bank politics” and did not prioritise economic issues. “Neither did they have a vision or will. That is the reason that the country had to suffer so much,” the PM said.“I can see very clearly that the second quarter of the 21st century is going to be critical for India’s progress at a rapid pace towards achieving the goal of ‘Viksit Bharat’. Therefore, we have to only keep moving forward and not look back,” said Modi.The opposition protest at the beginning of Modi’s speech came as Congress and others alleged that Leader of the Opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge wanted to speak but was denied permission by chairman C P Radhakrishnan. While Modi kept speaking undeterred initially amid the protest, he paused and took a dig at Kharge, suggesting that he can keep raising slogans while sitting. The opposition later walked out of the House.Continuing with his speech, the PM said, “India is signing future-ready trade deals with several nations. In the last few days, we have signed trade deals with nine big nations, including the ‘mother of all deals’ with the 27-nation EU bloc.”Reflecting on the changing global population profile — where the world’s most developed countries are witnessing a fast-aging population — Modi said India is uniquely placed due to its youth population. “Having a large youth population is in itself a big attest. We have a very precious ‘youth talent pool’ that has dreams, resolve and capability to achieve their dreams,” Modi said.",PM Modi celebrated the signing of the trade deals with the EU and the US.

NEW DELHI: Even as new roads, hospitals and schools are promised for the Northeast, more than Rs 3,200 crore meant for infrastructure projects in the region is still lying unspent — a reality check that surfaced in the Parliament on Thursday.Replying to a question in Rajya Sabha, minister of state for development of north eastern region Sukanta Majumdar said ongoing projects under the North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS) carry an outstanding central liability of Rs 3,206.18 crore as of Dec 31, 2025. There are over 160 projects still under implementation.State-wise figures show Assam topping the list with Rs 1,012.87 crore pending across 35 projects, followed by Manipur (Rs 441.38 crore), Nagaland (Rs 406.09 crore) and Arunachal Pradesh (Rs 395.37 crore). Other states with large unpaid amounts include Tripura (Rs 308.71 crore), Mizoram (Rs 275.81 crore), Meghalaya (Rs 258.05 crore) and Sikkim (Rs 107.90 crore).Sector-wise, roads and bridges account for the biggest backlog of Rs 1,402.11 crore across 53 projects. Education projects have pending dues of Rs 774.55 crore, while Rs 317.87 crore is yet to be spent on health infrastructure. Power, water supply, sports, tourism, digital connectivity and civil aviation together make up the rest of the outstanding amount.The govt also told the House that 30 projects — three under NESIDS (Roads) and 27 under NESIDS (Other Than Roads Infrastructure) — were sanctioned more than two years ago but still have over 50% of their approved cost unspent. Officials attributed the delays to tough terrain, land issues, statutory clearances and financial closures, saying timelines often depend on local conditions.NESIDS was launched in 2017–18 and later split into two components — roads and other infrastructure — to support projects ranging from highways and bridges to schools, hospitals, water supply and solid waste management. States select projects based on local priorities, while fund allocation is guided by factors such as population, area, road density, hospital beds and access to drinking water.","More than Rs 3,200 crore meant for infrastructure projects in the region is still lying unspent.

IndiGo’s 5% Flight Cut Explained: Causes, Impact on Routes, and the Ripple Effects on Passengers

CHENNAI: When IndiGo’s flight operations went topsy-turvy in December last year, there were videos and photos of hapless and tired passengers confronting ground staff. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has now put a number to their faces.The directorate’s monthly traffic data for Dec 2025 says 16.2 lakh domestic flyers were stranded at airports across the country due to the non-availability of either IndiGo aircraft or their crew members. The number of people affected due to total cancellation of flights was 9.8 lakh, while those stranded at the airports due to delays beyond two hours were 6.4 lakh.Simultaneously, 43,278 flyers who had booked flights on Air India and Air India Express were affected due to cancellation of flights. The number of passengers affected due to delays beyond two hours was almost 1.2 lakh.DGCA prepared the traffic report based on information received from the respective domestic airlines. IndiGo spent about Rs 22.7 crore on refunds, alternate flights and other facilitation in the same month, it said. The airline, however, said it cannot share details about the number of passengers eligible for compensation and the number compensated so farAt a Jan 29 meeting to review IndiGo’s operations, the airline assured that it would be good to fly without any disruption, even with the removal of exemptions to Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) regulations from Feb 10 onwards, as they now have sufficient pilots on the roster.Civil aviation expert Captain M Ranganathan said the problem is yet far from over. “For each domestic flight, an airline should have six pairs of pilots and co-pilots, and for long-haul flights there should be 11 pairs. The pilot availability they submitted is based on DGCA’s civil aviation requirements (CAR) regulations 2022. For their present fleet, there will still be a deficiency of pilots under new regulations. There is another storm brewing if the problem is not addressed,” he said.Several pilots told TOI the biggest problem was poor pay. “Pilots’ salary is very low in India compared to other countries, and pilots are among the highest taxpayers,” said a pilot.","16.2 lakh domestic flyers were stranded at airports across the country. 43,278 flyers who had booked flights on Air India and Air India Express were affected.

NEW DELHI: As Tamil Nadu gears up for assembly elections in a couple months, the BJP is looking to consolidate opposition forces. With an anti-DMK alliance, the BJP, it seems is also trying to ""do a Bihar"" in a state it has struggled to make a mark in till now.As the party takes winning lessons from recent Bihar assembly victory, it is forming a social alliance that represents every major caste segment in the state.Earlier in Bihar assembly election, BJP had a fool-proof plan. The party, along with its NDA partners, built a social coalition that represented the major castes, isolating the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan with its Muslim-Yadav voter base.The five NDA partners represented almost all segments of society. LJP and HAM had Dalit faces like Union minister Chirag Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi. EBC and non-Yadav OBC castes were represented by JD(U) and the Rashtriya Lok Morcha. Meanwhile, the BJP had its vote banks among the upper castes and the Baniya community.This fine-tuned caste coalition brought an overwhelming majority for the NDA. The alliance won 202 seats in the 243-member Bihar Assembly.Dominated by Dravidian politics, alliances also play a huge role in Tamil Nadu. Apart from a peak DMK or AIADMK , no single party can dominate the Assembly without a broad coalition.To prevent vote-splitting, which could favour the DMK, the BJP is trying to inculcate as many parties as it can to rebuild a broader NDA. Former alliance partners and breakaway factions are being approached, including leaders who had earlier left.Two years after the split, the BJP and AIADMK came together in 2025 and announced that the NDA will contest the upcoming assembly polls under the leadership of former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS).The BJP’s alliance with the AIADMK has been more than tactical and is seen in Delhi as the primary vehicle for relevance in the southern state. However, the current BJP strategy, curated mainly by Amit Shah, reflects this urgency.Additionally, the AIADMK also has a voter base among Dalit communities. This voter base constitutes almost 20 per cent of the state’s population.Meanwhile, AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam (OPS) also declared that he was “ready” for reunification with Edappadi K Palaniswami’s (EPS) AIADMK faction ahead of Tamil Nadu’s 2026 assembly polls.At a press meet in Madurai, OPS threw a pointed challenge at both EPS and AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran, asking whether they were prepared to take the leap. “I am ready for that. Are they ready?” he said, invoking the possibility of rival factions closing ranks under the NDA umbrella.The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) also entered the NDA, giving it a symbolic boost. However, this did not come without complications. Anbumani Ramadoss’s decision to align with the AIADMK-BJP front was meant to strengthen the NDA’s presence in northern Tamil Nadu, where the PMK traditionally draws support from the Vanniyar community. Though this adds social breadth to the coalition at a time when consolidation is critical, the PMK is far from united.Meanwhile, the BJP has also reportedly approached TVK’s Vijay to join the NDA after he positioned his party as an alternative political force in Tamil Nadu.Vijay hails from a Christian community that constitutes about 6 per cent of the population in the state. Additionally, Vijay commands huge popularity among youngsters. Unlike the parties of other film stars, Vijay’s supporters are organised and politically active.According to poll analysts, caste equations have always played a role in Tamil Nadu. However, they believe the BJP’s efforts to bring different castes on one stage have not gained much traction.Speaking to The Times of India, political analyst Kannan R said that the saffron party does have a number of leaders from the backward classes but so far, the party seems to rally Hindus as a monolithic unit.“Caste and cash remain two important factors in TN’s electoral politics and will continue to play a crucial role. I don’t think the BJP is trying to bring different castes on the stage, or if it is, it hasn’t gained traction so far,” Kannan said.“It does have a number of leaders from the backward classes, but so far the party seems to rally Hindus as a monolithic unit, which has so far been a no-go in this state,” he added.Another analyst, Shyam Shanmugaa, said that elections cannot be won purely on caste equations in Tamil Nadu.“Caste equations are always at play in rural Tamil Nadu. But in urban areas, it does not matter. Tamil Nadu is a heavily urbanised state. Hence, elections cannot be won purely on caste equations. If one caste is mobilised in a particular rural constituency, counter-mobilisation takes place,” Shanmugaa told TOI.“Therefore, winning chances are there for candidates who are caste-neutral and appeal to all castes. The BJP is mostly seen as a Brahmin upper-caste party. It is unable to mobilise one particular OBC caste. Even when TN BJP leaders from particular dominant communities were made state presidents, the BJP could not win,” he added.Dalits constitute around 19% to 21% of the state’s population. They are spread across the state, with their population higher in districts such as Cuddalore, Villupuram, Tiruvallur and Madurai.The larger Dravidian political movement, which has evolved over the past two centuries and given rise to parties such as the Dravida Kazhagam, the DMK and the AIADMK, has historically reached out to Dalits.Concentrated mainly in southern Tamil Nadu districts such as Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram, the Thevars are a politically influential community and fall under the MBC category. Several prominent Thevar leaders are part of the AIADMK.Former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s close aide V K Sasikala and rebel leader O Panneerselvam both belong to the community.The Thevar population is estimated at around 10% to 12%.Vanniyars, largely based in northern Tamil Nadu, are among the biggest and most politically active Most Backward Classes (MBCs) in the state. Tamil Nadu categorises OBCs into BC and MBC groups. The Vanniyars are primarily an agrarian community and have largely retained land ownership despite industrialisation. Members of the community are frequently named in connection with anti-Dalit violence in the state.Politically, Vanniyars are represented by the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), which is currently part of the BJP-led NDA. Founded and led by S Ramadoss, the party has wielded influence due to the community’s numerical strength, organisational structure and sustained political mobilisation. Ramadoss began organising Vanniyars in the 1980s and is credited with improving educational outcomes within the community from the 1990s onwards.Vanniyars are estimated to make up about 12% to 15% of Tamil Nadu’s population, with a strong presence in Villupuram, Cuddalore, Thiruvannamalai and parts of Vellore, and smaller concentrations in Salem and Dindigul.Nadars are a trading community with a strong footprint in commerce and politics. Their leaders cut across party lines and have successfully translated economic strength into political influence.The most prominent Nadar leader in Tamil Nadu’s political history is K Kamaraj, a senior Congress leader and former chief minister. Alongside Hindu Nadars, Christian Nadars also hold a significant presence in institutions and power structures.The community’s population is estimated at around 4% to 6%, with a concentration in southern Tamil Nadu districts such as Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Virudhunagar.Gounders fall under the Backward Classes category and account for roughly 5% to 7% of Tamil Nadu’s population. They are largely concentrated in western Tamil Nadu, or the Kongu Nadu region, which includes districts such as Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode, Namakkal, Karur and Salem.Primarily dependent on agriculture and allied sectors, the community is also known for its entrepreneurial presence and influence in regional industries. Prominent figures include industrialist and philanthropist N Mahalingam, who was involved in several educational initiatives.After J Jayalalithaa’s death, Edappadi K Palaniswami, a Gounder, assumed control of the AIADMK, sidelining the Sasikala family and O Panneerselvam, and assigning key Cabinet portfolios to leaders from the community.The Election Commission is expected to announce the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu in April–May this year. In the 2021 assembly elections, the DMK won 133 seats, while the Congress won 18 seats. Meanwhile, the AIADMK secured 66 seats with 33.5% of the vote; the PMK secured five seats with a 3.8% vote share, while the VCK won four seats with a 1% vote share.","The BJP is forming a social alliance that represents every major caste segment in the state. The party is trying to inculcate as many parties as it can to rebuild a broader NDA. The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) also entered the NDA, giving it a symbolic boost.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127938561,imgsize-1130802,width-400,resizemode-4/127938561.jpg"

Explained: Why India-EU 'Mother Of All Deals' Matters As Trade Talks Enter Final High Stakes Phase

NEW DELHI: Amid opposition allegations over the India-US trade deal, Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday said that the agreement fully safeguards India’s agricultural interests, particularly those of the farm and dairy sectors.Underlining that India’s staple grains, fruits, major crops, millets and dairy products remain completely secure and face no threat whatsoever, Chouhan emphasised that the interests of small and large farmers alike have been fully protected and that the agreement will create fresh opportunities rather than risks for Indian agriculture.Highlighting the export potential unlocked by the agreement, Chouhan, while addressing the media on the issue, noted that India already exports rice to many countries, including the US, and has recently recorded exports worth around Rs 63,000 crore.He said that reduced tariffs will directly benefit India’s rice, spices and textile exports, and that growth in textile exports will help millions of cotton-growing farmers.On certain concerns over an adverse impact of the deal on small farmers, the minister stressed that no sudden or disruptive entry of foreign products into the Indian market will take place.On the confusion triggered by a recent social media post by the US treasury secretary about increased access for American farm products, Chouhan said commerce minister Piyush Goyal has already clarified the facts in Parliament. He reiterated that India has not opened its markets in any way that puts pressure on domestic farmers & that the protections for key agricultural commodities remain intact.“Farmers are our ‘Annadata’, the providers of life. Their welfare is nation’s welfare, and their interests are absolutely secure,” he added.","Shivraj Singh Chouhan: India's staple grains, fruits, major crops, millets and dairy products remain completely secure and face no threat whatsoever.

to Rs 75,368 crore

NEW DELHI: Railways has estimated its earnings from passenger movement at Rs 87,300 crore in 2026-27, little over 9% more than the revised estimate (RE) of current financial year as it continues to introduce more new-age Vande Bharat chair car and sleeper trains, and Amrit Bharat trains, in addition to to adding of other conventional trains.However, it has lowered the revenue from passenger transport for this year than the Budget Estimate (BE) of Rs 92,800 crore, due to nearly 10.6% fall in kms that people travelled or will travel by March 2026.Similarly, in the freight segment, the ministry has estimated earning of around Rs 1.88 lakh crore in FY 27, same that osf BE of FY26 and 6% higher than the RE of current fiscal year. Data also show that railways is likely to end up generating around Rs 1.78 lakh crore by March, around 5.5% less than the target it had set for the current year.Significantly, the revenue from goods transport is set to fall short of target despite railways not lowering the freight loading target of 1,700 million for this year. Data indicates that the revenue fall is due to a reduction of around 1% fall in the distance of goods transported by railways, meaning there may be a shorter distance than what railways had initially estimated.Responding to a question on the earnings of the national transporter, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Monday it has continued to increase revenue both from passenger and freight movement. He added that the revenue from passenger movement has increased from Rs 70,693 crore in FY 24in 2024-25 and the RE for FY 26 is Rs 80,000 crore. Similarly, in the freight segment, revenue has increased from Rs 1.68 lakh crore in FY 24 to Rs 1.71 lakh crore in 2024-25 and it has been pegged at Rs 1.78 lakh crore in the RE of this fiscal year.On why the railways is unlikely to meet the BE target, Vaishnaw said govt always sets an “aspirational” target so that everyone works hard to perform better than earlier. He added that railways has continued registering net revenue for the past three years, which shows how well the national transporter is running its day-to-day operations.As per the Budget document, with higher income, railways estimates to improve its operating ratio (OR) from 98.82% in the current fiscal year to 98.4% in FY 27. OR indicates the money spent for earning every Rs 100. The railways aims to close the next fiscal with Rs 3,000 crore net revenue, around 35% higher than Rs 1,957 crore estimates for FY 26.","Railways has estimated its earnings from passenger movement at Rs 87,300 crore in 2026-27.

MUMBAI: For years, teacher and artist Rouble Nagi has used walls in slums for creation of murals to teach children who seldom make it to classrooms. On Thursday, that work was recognised on a global stage when she won the $1 million Global Teacher Prize 2026 — world’s largest award for educators.It was presented at World Governments Summit in Dubai, an annual gathering of leaders and policymakers. Now in its tenth year, the prize — an initiative of Varkey Foundation along with Unesco — honours teachers whose work reshaped learning outcomes and communities.Nagi, who has developed pedagogy around art, began her work in the slums of Mumbai about a decade ago. Accepting the award, she said recognition of work rooted in “education, compassion, consistency and service” had strengthened her resolve to continue working with children on the margins.Through the Rouble Nagi Art Foundation, she has established over 800 learning centres in India, reaching children who have never attended school as well as those enrolled but struggling to keep pace. The focus is foundational literacy, numeracy and basic conceptual understanding in communities where formal schooling often fails to hold.Nagi is perhaps best known for her murals, which use colour, symbols and stories to impart lessons.Neglected spaces in settlements turn into open-air classrooms which teach language, science, mathematics and history. Art is central to her as a tool to instil confidence, heal and allow self expression.Starting out with a small, hands-on effort among families living in fragile conditions, Nagi Art Foundation has expanded to villages and various urban centres. The underlying belief, she said, is that inequality is not destiny, and that education delivered with dignity can bridge the gap between exclusion and opportunity. An educator who is inspired by the legacy of Savitribai Phule, Nagi said she has remained committed to education without discrimination.Under her Misaal India initiative, Nagi has also set up skill centres for women, helping them achieve financial independence and emerge as entrepreneurs.Sunny Varkey, founder of Global Teacher Prize and GEMS Education, said Nagi represented “the very best of what teaching can be — courage, creativity and compassion”. Francis Joseph, CEO of GEMS Education, said Nagi’s influence extended beyond conventional classrooms. Stefania Giannini, Unesco’s assistant director-general for education, said the award reaffirmed a “simple truth: teachers matter”.","Nagi is perhaps best known for her murals, which use colour, symbols and stories to impart lessons.

NCLT recalls order awarding Alchemist to ‘sister concern’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nclt-recalls-order-awarding-alchemist-to-sister-concern/articleshow/127960106.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a rare decision, National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Feb 3 withdrew its corporate resolution order awarding a bankrupt company — Alchemist Ltd, promoted by former Trinamool Congress MP KD Singh — to a company that turned out to be a related group entity. The bench observed the “insolvency proceedings were vitiated by fraud, collusion and malicious intent”.The withdrawal of the corporate resolution order by NCLT, a rare occurrence, happened after Enforcement Directorate approached the Delhi bench with evidence of money laundering by the group and how the promoters had allegedly created a front entity with “proceeds of crime”, making it a financial creditor with 97% voting rights to grab the firm under insolvency proceedings.Singh and his Alchemist group entities are accused of laundering an amount of Rs 1,840 crore collected from small investors, promising them high returns or allotment of plots and villas. Neither were plots or villas allotted, nor were the investors refunded their money. Interestingly, ED’s money laundering probe is based on an FIR filed by investors in Kolkata, West Bengal, the state Singh represented in the Rajya Sabha.Two of Singh’s hospitals in Panchkula — Alchemist Hospital and Ojas Hospital — are among assets worth Rs 490 crore attached by ED over the past few years.After withdrawal of the NCLT order, ED said its investigation had revealed how Alchemist Ltd was dragged to insolvency by Technology Parks Ltd which dominated the committee of creditors (CoC) with 97% voting rights and later turned out to be an entity of Singh’s group.Insolvency was just a facade and was used merely as a “device to reclaim attached assets and invoke immunity under Section 32A of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)”, ED said. The agency further said an ex-employee of Alchemist group, Gaurav Misra, was appointed resolution professional, raising serious concerns regarding the independence and fairness of the entire process.“The dominant CoC members were group entities accused of money laundering and beneficiaries of proceeds of crime, including Technology Parks Ltd (with 97% voting share), Alchemist Township India Ltd (voting share 1.7%) and Alchemist Realty Ltd (voting share 0.6%)”. It was also highlighted that the aforementioned companies have been arraigned as accused in the prosecution complaint (chargesheet) filed by ED in the case.Accepting the submissions of ED, NCLT said, “An insolvency resolution dominated by accused group entities fundamentally erodes the independence and commercial wisdom of the CoC. Permitting such an insolvency would result in legitimisation of proceeds of crime, dilution of PMLA attachments and abuse of insolvency immunity.”","NCLT on Feb 3 withdrew its corporate resolution order awarding a bankrupt company to a company that turned out to be a related group entity.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has said that air pollution and pollution of the Yamuna river are ""legacy problems"" caused by years of neglect and short-term policymaking by the previous AAP government, asserting that her administration is pursuing a comprehensive, long-term strategy to address both challenges.Speaking in an exclusive interview with ANI, Gupta rejected the criticism that measures such as GRAP, Odd-Even, artificial rain and anti-smog guns have failed to deliver results, saying these steps were never meant to be permanent solutions.""Pollution is a legacy problem resulting from the negligence of previous governments. If we look at pollution only from the perspective that the air should be clean, we will not get results. You have to work on dust, air and water together, with a holistic vision,"" she said.Taking a swipe at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Gupta said previous administrations relied heavily on temporary relief measures and publicity, while ignoring structural reforms.""Sprinklers, anti-smog guns and mist can give only short-term relief. The real work should have been done on dust mitigation, public transport and long-term planning,"" she said.The Chief Minister identified vehicular emissions, road dust and waste mismanagement as key contributors to Delhi's air pollution, which often remains in the 'severe' category even during winter months. ""Vehicular emission is said to be a major cause of pollution, but public transport was never taken to the extent it should have been,"" she said.Gupta said her government has drawn up a phased plan to move Delhi's public transport system towards zero emissions. ""When we came, we planned that public transport should be 100 per cent electric and on clean fuel. Today, there are around 3,600 buses in Delhi. We added 1,700 buses after coming to power, and by December 2026, this will reach 7,700. Our requirement is 11,000 buses, which we will complete by 2028,"" she said.She added that funding has been sanctioned for Metro expansion, last-mile connectivity through EV autos, e-bikes and cycles near Metro stations, and stricter enforcement against unfit and polluting vehicles. ""The government has to make a 360-degree movement. Work has to be done on every single aspect,"" she said.Gupta also pointed to reforms in road construction and maintenance to reduce dust pollution. ""Earlier, one department would build a road, and another would dig it again. This was the work culture of Delhi. We are changing that by enforcing ducting and accountability,"" she said, adding that engineers from PWD and MCD were brought together to standardise practices.Linking garbage mountains directly to air pollution, Gupta said a visible reduction in landfills is the result of policy-driven, time-bound action. ""Delhi generates about 11,000 metric tonnes of garbage daily. Earlier, it was never processed, and that is why mountains of garbage were formed,"" she said, attacking the Opposition for merely shifting waste from one site to another.She said the government is confident of clearing legacy waste at the Okhla and Bhalswa landfill sites by 2026, while work at Ghazipur may take longer. ""These results are not without policy and dedication,"" she said.On the Yamuna river, Gupta said untreated sewage, cattle dung and industrial waste flowing directly into drains had severely polluted the river. ""Friends, drains were falling straight into Yamuna ji. Sewage treatment plants were not upgraded. These conditions were spoiled over years,"" she said.The Chief Minister said her government has upgraded 37 old sewage treatment plants and initiated large-scale de-silting of drains across the city. ""As soon as we came, we started de-silting work. New machines from Finland are being used at places like Najafgarh, Barapullah and Sunheri Pullah,"" she said.She also highlighted steps to process cattle dung through biogas plants. ""For so many years, did anyone think of setting up biogas plants? Thousands of tonnes of dung went into drains and then into Yamuna ji. We have started the first plant to process 600 tonnes, with more plants in the pipeline,"" she said.Addressing opposition criticism on the pace of cleaning the Yamuna, Gupta said results cannot be instantaneous. ""People ask, 'When will Yamuna be clean?' I tell them, these are conditions spoiled over the years. The steps we have taken are time-bound, and their results will be visible with time,"" she said.Reiterating her government's approach, Gupta said, ""The government will do its bit, the public will also have to do its bit. Together, we will be able to get better air and cleaner water for Delhi.""","Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta says pollution is a legacy problem.

MHA will fund the territorial authority and extend all possible help,” Shah said.The home minister also said that the ministry of home affairs played a key role in resolving differences. “Home ministry officials worked hard for a long time and bridged the gap between the government of Nagaland and ENPO. Now this conflict is nearing its end. I want to thank CM Nephiu Rio and the entire team for taking this negotiation to a logical end.The central government will bear the responsibility of ensuring development in Eastern Nagaland,” he said.The agreement provides for the creation of the Frontier Nagaland Territorial Authority, which will focus on the development and governance of Eastern Nagaland.The ENPO had been demanding the creation of a separate Frontier Nagaland Territory for more than a decade, raising concerns over development and representation in the region.The new authority will receive funding and support from the ministry of home affairs. The move is expected to help improve development, governance and delivery of welfare schemes in Eastern Nagaland.The Nagaland Cabinet had earlier reviewed the issue and expressed hope that discussions with the Centre would lead to a resolution. The Cabinet also formed a sub-committee led by chief minister Neiphiu Rio to pursue talks with the Centre and address related political matters.The signing of the agreement is seen as a step towards resolving a long-pending demand.","The agreement was signed in Delhi in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah and Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio.

Shashi Tharoor Claims India 'Surrendered' To US Pressure By Stopping Chabahar Port Fund in Budget

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has criticised The Washington Post’s decision to lay off his son, foreign affairs columnist Ishaan Tharoor, describing it as a “perverse act of self-immolation”.Reacting on X, Tharoor wrote: “The bizarre thing about this so-called ‘business decision’ by The Washington Post is that @ishaantharoor’s column flourished on the Internet,” adding that Ishaan Tharoor had “500,000 (half a million plus!) individual subscribers” for his WorldView newsletter. He said he had met foreign ministers, diplomats and scholars around the world who read the newsletter daily, and argued that the newspaper could have tried monetising that reach instead of abolishing it.Ishaan Tharoor was among those laid off as part of a major restructuring at The Washington Post that affected around 300 employees and significantly reduced the newspaper’s international coverage. Several international correspondents and editors also announced their exits on social media.In a post on X, Ishaan Tharoor said he had been laid off along with much of the international staff, adding that he was “heartbroken” for the newsroom and colleagues he had worked with over nearly 12 years. In a separate post, he called it “a bad day” and shared an image of an empty newsroom. He also wrote about launching WorldView in 2017 and thanked the newsletter’s roughly half-a-million subscribers.The Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos . The Washington Post Guild, which represents staff, issued a statement urging continued investment in the newspaper’s journalism.The layoffs at The Washington Post are part of a wider restructuring that has seen the paper sharply scale back its global and national reporting operations. Around 300 employees were affected across departments, with the international desk among the hardest hit.As part of the overhaul, the Post has reduced its foreign bureaus and eliminated several international reporting roles, effectively shrinking its on-the-ground presence in regions including the Middle East, Europe, Asia and Latin America. Multiple senior correspondents and editors confirmed their exits publicly, some noting that entire regional teams had been disbanded.The restructuring has also led to the winding down or closure of several editorial initiatives, including podcasts and specialist sections, as management seeks to cut costs and refocus resources amid sustained financial pressure on US legacy newsrooms.The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has faced declining digital subscriptions and advertising revenue in recent years, prompting repeated rounds of cost-cutting. The newspaper’s union has warned that continued reductions to reporting staff risk undermining its journalistic mission, particularly its ability to cover international affairs comprehensively.The current round of layoffs marks one of the most significant contractions of the Post’s global reporting footprint in its modern history, signalling a strategic retreat from expansive international coverage at a time of heightened geopolitical instability.","Ishaan Tharoor was among those laid off as part of a major restructuring at The Washington Post.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday accused the BJP-led central government of denying funds to the state, and said her government had still ensured in the budget that welfare and development programmes continued.Speaking at a press conference a day after the state budget was announced, Banerjee said, “Despite the state being financially deprived by the Centre, we have brought in a pro-people budget.”The chief minister also criticised the Union Budget and compared it with the state’s budget, saying, “Our budget is pro-people, not directionless and rudderless like the Union Budget.”A day earlier, the West Bengal Assembly presented an interim budget of Rs 4.06 lakh crore for the 2026-27 financial year.

Why the GCC Unified Visa matters



Seamless multi-country travel: Visit multiple member states without applying for separate visas, a huge boon for global travellers.

Biometric and border control integration across all six nations. Common digital application and data-sharing platforms. Security and immigration protocols to ensure regional safety and streamlined entry.





The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) comprising of Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region. This initiative, often described as a “Schengen-style visa” for the Gulf, aims to let visitors enter all six member states on a single travel permit, eliminating the need to apply for separate visas for each country.Officials sometimes refer to this new permit as the GCC Grand Tours Visa or Unified GCC Tourist Visa. Travel and tourism authorities have repeatedly emphasised that this is not just a travel document but a key step in deeper regional economic integration and tourism growth.Although the unified visa was originally expected to start as early as late 2025, plans have been pushed to 2026 due to the complexity of aligning immigration systems, security protocols and data-sharing across six sovereign states. According to travel industry reporting, the rollout will unfold in stages:No exact day or month has been publicly confirmed yet as authorities have only reiterated that the visa will go live in 2026 (at latest early 2027 according to some officials).The unified GCC visa will be designed primarily for non-citizen visitors (tourists, business travellers, conference attendees and multiple-destination holidaymakers) who want to explore the Gulf without the hassle of applying for individual visas for each country. Key predicted eligibility criteria include:Authorities are expected to launch an online application portal where travellers can submit their details digitally and receive the visa electronically, similar to e-visa systems in other regions.Official fee structures have not yet been confirmed by GCC authorities, but industry sources and draft proposals indicate that the unified visa could cost in the range of US $100–$150 (approx. AED 367–550). This price range would make the unified GCC visa competitive with other regional multi-country visas, and far simpler than paying for six separate tourist visas for each member state.The digital process and single-application design are expected to reduce administrative overheads and processing delays, helping travellers plan trips without multiple embassy visits.While final rules are still pending official publication, proposals for the unified visa include several options:The exact structure (single entry vs multi-entry, extension rules, etc.) will be published when the official visa framework and application system launch, but authorities have emphasized flexibility to accommodate both short holidays and longer multi-destination itineraries.The GCC Unified Visa is considered a game-changer for travel and tourism in the Middle East Officials have drawn inspiration from the European Schengen visa model, though the GCC’s version will be adapted to regional needs and security standards. Before the visa becomes fully operational, GCC member states need to finalise:If pilot testing in late 2026 goes smoothly, widespread availability could follow in early 2027 though authorities remain optimistic about a 2026 launch for general applications.The GCC Unified Visa 2026 promises a major shift in how travellers explore the Gulf. It's launch is expected in 2026 (pilot late-year, full rollout to follow), eligibility includes tourists and other visitors with valid travel credentials, fees is estimated at US $100–$150 range with validity of likely 30–90 days, with single or multiple entries. This unified system could be a milestone for regional travel and a boost for the Gulf’s tourism, business and investment landscape.","The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region.

Planning to visit a bank in February? It’s smart to check the holiday schedule first, as an unexpected closure can turn a quick errand into a wasted trip. In India, banks observe both national and state-specific holidays, so closure dates may differ from one region to another. In India, bank holidays include both national and state-specific observances, so closure dates can vary across different regions.Banks will remain closed in Sikkim on account of the Losar festival.Banks will be closed in Maharashtra for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti.Banks will not operate in Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh in observance of State Day/Statehood Day.Apart from these, banks will also remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month, according to RBI.Being aware of bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute hassles. While branches may remain closed on these days, it does not prevent customers from carrying out routine transactions. Digital banking services, including online banking, ATMs, mobile apps, and UPI, remain fully operational for fund transfers, bill payments, and other regular activities.However, services that require a physical visit such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances, or issuing demand drafts will not be available.

New labour code changes and why companies are making one-time provisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-labour-code-changes-and-why-companies-are-making-one-time-provisions/articleshow/127929310.cms,"1.

MUMBAI: Most companies reporting their financial results for Q3FY26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits attributing it to the new labour code. TOI takes a look at what brought about these changes and how does it affect stakeholders.The change relates mainly to gratuity payments under the Code on Social Security, 2020. The new rules redefine “wages” for calculating gratuity and expand eligibility for fixed-term employees.Under the revised rules, wages used to calculate gratuity must form at least 50% of an employee’s total cost-to-company (CTC). If allowances exceed 50% of CTC, the excess must be added back to wages for gratuity calculation. This increases the base on which gratuity is calculated.The law also allows fixed-term employees to become eligible for gratuity after completing one year of service instead of the earlier five-year requirement. Because of these changes, companies must account for higher future gratuity payouts, forcing them to create one-time provisions in their financial statements.The government introduced the change through the Code on Social Security, 2020, which forms part of four consolidated labour codes replacing 29 older labour laws.The codes were passed by Parliament in 2020, but detailed implementation rules were notified later.The reform aimed to simplify labour laws, improve social security coverage and reflect modern employment practices. A key concern was that many companies structured salaries with a low basic pay and high allowances to reduce statutory payouts such as provident fund and gratuity. The new definition of wages reduces this flexibility.Another trigger was the growing use of fixed-term employment across industries. The government sought to extend social security benefits to such workers, especially in sectors with high attrition and contractual hiring.The new labour codes, including the Social Security Code, came into force on November 21, 2025. While the central framework became effective from that date, states continue to finalise detailed implementation rules.Employees benefit mainly through higher gratuity payouts and wider eligibility. Because gratuity calculations now use a broader wage base, many employees will receive higher retirement or exit benefits.Fixed-term employees, who earlier did not qualify unless they completed five years of service, can now receive gratuity after one year. This benefits workers in sectors with short-term or project-based employment.The changes also aim to bring more transparency to salary structures and expand social security coverage.The financial impact varies depending on salary structure and workforce composition.Manufacturing and heavy industries: These sectors rely heavily on contract and fixed-term workers. The new rules increase gratuity liabilities and could push companies to review workforce models.Technology and IT services: These companies often use allowance-heavy salary structures. They may need to restructure compensation to meet the wage definition norms.Banking and financial services: The sector may see higher statutory benefit costs and increased liabilities for outsourced and contractual staff.Construction: The sector employs a large informal workforce. The new rules increase compliance requirements and settlement obligations.Retail and e-commerce: Companies with seasonal hiring and gig-based employment may face higher employee benefit costs and classification challenges.Healthcare: Round-the-clock operations and contract staffing could raise wage and benefit compliance costs.Manufacturing and heavy industries are expected to make the largest one-time provisions. These sectors typically have a large contract workforce, lower basic salary structures and higher dependence on fixed-term employment, which significantly increases gratuity liabilities.Technology and financial services companies are also likely to see sizeable increases due to changes in salary structure norms, though typically less than manufacturing.","Most companies reporting their financial results for Q3FY26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits.

Ramadan 2026 working hours in the UAE explained: Penalties and rules for private sector and government employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ramadan-2026-working-hours-in-the-uae-explained-penalties-and-rules-for-private-sector-and-government-employees/articleshow/127923197.cms,"Ramadan 2026 in UAE: How Will Working Hours Change for You?

Why working hours change during Ramadan in the UAE



UAE Ramadan 2026: Reduced Working Hours for Private and Government Sectors

Private sector during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE: Mandatory two-hour reduction



How it works:



If a regular workday was 8 hours, it becomes 6 hours during Ramadan.

Employers may offer additional flexibility, such as remote work or staggered schedules, provided the reduced hours rule is followed.

This rule is not optional as companies that do not implement the reduction can face legal consequences, including labour complaints and possible penalties if inspected by MoHRE.

Tip for employees:

Government/public sector during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE: Set reduced hours and flexibility



Typical government hours during Ramadan 2026



Monday to Thursday: 9:00 am to 2:30 pm

9:00 am to 2:30 pm Friday: 9:00 am to 12:00 pm (shorter to allow for Jummah prayer and family time)

Flexible arrangements



School hours and broader work-life adjustments during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE



UAE Employers Face Penalties for Ignoring Ramadan Working Hour Laws

Legal backing and employer responsibilities during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE



Employers should:



Apply the two-hour reduction for private sector workers.

Ensure government department staff adhere to the FAHR-issued Ramadan hours.

Offer reasonable flexibility when operationally possible to support employee well-being.

Failure to comply with mandated Ramadan working hours may expose employers to labour disputes, inspections or penalties — especially in the private sector where these reductions are legally binding.

What this means for UAE workers during Ramadan 2026



Shorter workdays with at least two hours reduced for private workers.

Government hours typically from 9 am to 2:30 pm (Mon–Thu) and 9 am to 12 pm (Fri).

Flexibility options such as remote work where feasible.

School schedule adjustments and broader lifestyle shifts in line with Ramadan culture.





As the holy month of Ramadan 2026 approaches (expected to begin around February 18–19, 2026 after the crescent moon sighting), residents and workers across the United Arab Emirates are preparing for annual adjustments to daily routines including reduced working hours in both the private and government sectors. These changes are designed to help employees balance work responsibilities with fasting, prayer and family time during the sacred month.The working-hour adjustments are not just tradition or goodwill, they are formally recognised within UAE labour regulations and official government circulars.Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, during which many Muslims fast from dawn until dusk, engage in prayer, reflection and community gatherings. In recognition of the physical and spiritual demands of fasting, authorities in the UAE modify work schedules to allow workers time to maintain energy, attend religious activities and manage family life.According to the UAE’s labour law (Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021), working hours during Ramadan are specifically determined by executive regulations, requiring shorter daily schedules for employees unless otherwise authorised.For most private sector employees in the UAE, daily working hours are reduced by two hours throughout Ramadan. This reduction applies to all employees under the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE), regardless of their religion or fasting status.Any private sector employer who keeps standard hours throughout Ramadan is not complying with UAE labour regulations and can be reported to authorities.For federal government employees, the Federal Authority for Government Human Resources (FAHR) issues specific working schedules to balance productivity and observance.These hours represent a reduction of about 3.5 hours on weekdays and 1.5 hours on Fridays compared with normal schedules.Government entities are also encouraged to introduce flexible work options, including remote work on Fridays for up to 70% of staff where operationally feasible, without affecting service delivery.In addition to workplace changes, school hours are usually shortened during Ramadan to accommodate fasting students and teachers, with many institutions operating on adjusted timetables.At the same time, routine city services such as public parking, tolls and other community functions also adapt their timings to reflect the daily rhythm of Ramadan life.Under UAE law, the obligation to reduce working hours in Ramadan is grounded in Article 17 of the Labour Law and its executive regulations, which explicitly empower authorities to set specific working hours during Ramadan.For 2026’s Ramadan season, likely starting mid-February, both private and public sector employees in the UAE should expect:These changes offer a practical blend of cultural respect and workplace productivity, helping employees maintain spiritual practices without sacrificing essential functions of daily life in the UAE during the holy month.","Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, during which many Muslims fast from dawn until dusk.

The 2024 US presidential election brought a political shake-up with former President Donald Trump returning to office, backed by a Republican wave that swept through key states and congressional races. This election has not only reshaped America’s leadership but also impacted diverse industries, global relations, and various communities within the US.Here’s a look at some of the notable winners and losers from the 2024 election results.Donald Trump scored a ""magnificent victory for the American people,"" reclaiming the White House in a fiercely contested election against Democratic rival Kamala Harris “This truly will be the golden age of America,” Trump said in his victory speech at a celebration in West Palm Beach, Florida. He was joined on stage by his wife Melania, other family members, vice-president elect JD Vance and some high-profile supporters.His victory marks a remarkable political comeback, underscoring the enduring influence he holds within the Republican Party and among conservative voters. Trump’s return signifies a shift back to the “America First” policies that defined his first term, which included strict immigration policies, a robust stance on trade, and a pronounced nationalism that resonated with his voter base.The election saw a surge of Trump support in battleground states, allowing Republicans to win a majority in the Senate. This “Red Wave” also facilitated a Republican majority in Congress, giving Trump and his administration a unique opportunity to implement their agenda with fewer legislative obstacles.He boosted his support across suburban counties, rural areas, and even some major cities that have traditionally been Democratic strongholds; in both high-income and low-income counties; as well as in regions with historically high unemployment and areas now experiencing record-low jobless rates.Analysts predict that this control will allow for significant changes to fiscal policy, likely including tax cuts and regulatory reforms, echoing Trump’s first term.“We have a new star. A star is born: Elon,” said Trump in his victory speech. The world's wealthiest person had gone all out to support Trump. The Tesla CEO watched the US presidential results at Mar-a-Lago with Trump.The 53-year-old owner of X (previously Twitter) has dedicated his wealth, time and substantial influence to support Trump following his endorsement in July.Trump has reportedly contributed a minimum of $118 million to his political action committee(PAC). His PAC was giving $1 million-a-day to voters to register in swing states. His involvement also included appearing alongside Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign event and conducting several town halls independently in this crucial swing in run up to the US presidential elections.Trump has already signaled his intention to appoint Elon Musk to lead a proposed Department of Government Efficiency. This new position would grant Musk sweeping authority to assess federal agencies and propose reductions in government spending. Although the role could potentially streamline government functions, it would also give Musk significant control over the regulators who oversee his own companies—a setup that could lead to substantial conflicts of interest. Concerns arise over Musk possibly leveraging his role to shape policies that could favor his business ventures.Musk has suggested trimming at least $2 trillion from the federal budget, with a focus on reducing government expenditure. At a Trump rally in New York’s Madison Square Garden, Musk openly criticized current fiscal practices, declaring, “Your money is being wasted. We’re going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook.”As a rising figure within the Republican Party, Indian-American entrepreneur and political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy was a standout figure during the election season. Known for his outspoken stances on corporate wokeness and free-market capitalism, Ramaswamy’s influence has grown as he aligned himself with Trump’s economic agenda. Ramaswamy’s “anti-woke” messaging resonated with a subset of Trump supporters and gave him national prominence as a future Republican leader.While Ramaswamy was not on the ticket, his presence in Trump’s orbit and his alignment with pro-business policies have solidified his role as an influencer within the GOP.At occasions, Trump has hinted that Ramaswamy could take on an advisory role or even be considered for a cabinet position in the new administration, which would enable him to continue pushing for deregulation and limited government in economic affairs.Indian-American representation in the House of Representatives has grown to six members, up from five in the previous Congress. Making history, Suhas Subramanyam became the first Indian-American representative elected from Virginia and the East Coast region. Currently serving as a Virginia State Senator, Subramanyam secured victory against Republican candidate Mike Clancy. The Indian-American presence in the House could potentially rise to seven members, as Dr Amish Shah maintains a narrow lead over the Republican incumbent in Arizona's first Congressional District.While Kamala Harris, the first Indian-American to serve as Vice President, lost the presidential race, the overall influence of Indian-Americans in US politics has only grown.Bitcoin surged to an all-time high on Wednesday following Republican Donald Trump's win against Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections. The cryptocurrency climbed as much as 8.63% to reach a record $75,120.Trump has pledged to transform the United States into the world's leading cryptocurrency hub, establish a national reserve of Bitcoin and select regulatory officials who are enthusiastic about digital currencies.""The price of bitcoin has closely followed Trump's position in the polls and on betting markets,"" Russ Mould, an analyst at AJ Bell, told AFP.Investors are ""potentially taking the view that a Republican victory would lead to a surge in demand for the digital currency"", he added.The Trump victory has set the US dollar on track for its largest one-day gain since March 2020. Analysts suggest that a unified Republican control of both Congress and the White House could drive up the dollar and Treasury yields due to Trump’s tax-cutting agenda and proposed import tariffs.""A potential unified government under President Trump would have the greatest degree of freedom for fiscal policy and would likely be the most dollar bullish outcome,"" Deutsche Bank analysts noted. They added that, “even without control of Congress, a Trump victory would be decidedly dollar bullish via the impact of tariffs and the dollar should especially outperform against high-beta currencies,such as the Mexican peso and Australian dollar.Economist Peter Esho, founder of Esho Capital, observed, ""The markets are scrambling to figure out what happens next, but for the time being, the market is pricing in a higher growth and higher inflation outlook.""Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate and incumbent Vice President, suffered a significant defeat. Despite her historic role and appeal among certain demographics, she was unable to rally enough support to overcome Trump’s resurgence. Harris’ campaign struggled to energize key voter bases, including moderate Democrats and independents, and she faced significant challenges with the progressive wing of her party. The election outcome represents a setback for her political career and has left Democrats searching for new leadership and a clearer, more unified message.The Democratic Party as a whole finds itself among the losers following the 2024 election. Losing the White House and Senate has weakened the party’s standing and signaled a need for reevaluation. The Democrats’ defeat has also exposed internal divisions, with calls for new strategies to reconnect with working-class voters and to address issues related to the economy, immigration, and international relations.This election showed the limitations of a platform that some critics argue focused too heavily on social issues rather than economic concerns. The party’s path forward may involve a generational shift and a rethinking of policy positions, especially as it contends with a Republican majority in Congress.Republican lawmakers who had previously voted to impeach Trump now find themselves isolated within their party. As Trump reclaims the presidency, loyalty to his administration is paramount, and GOP members who opposed him during his last term face political consequences. These lawmakers risk marginalization and may find it challenging to secure leadership roles or committee assignments.The wave of Trump-aligned candidates who have gained congressional seats also means that the GOP is moving further to the right, with less tolerance for dissent. For Republicans who opposed Trump, political futures are uncertain as the party seeks to consolidate support for Trump’s agenda.China stands as one of the notable international losers following Trump’s victory. During his campaign, Trump made it clear he would pursue a tough stance on China, focusing on trade tariffs, restrictions on technology, and strengthening alliances in the Indo-Pacific. China’s economy, already under pressure from global economic shifts, could face further strain under a new round of tariffs and restrictions.Trump’s return to office could also mean a more assertive US military presence in the Pacific, as well as strengthened ties with allies in the region who share concerns about Chinese influence. With a pro-business administration favoring US companies and protecting intellectual property, China could see increased economic and diplomatic pressure.The 2024 election marks a pivotal moment for US politics, ushering in a new phase of Trump’s influence over the country. For Republicans, this victory offers a chance to pursue a robust agenda on deregulation, tax cuts, and a “tough on China” trade policy. However, it also risks deepening the country’s political divisions, as Trump’s administration has faced consistent criticism for fostering partisanship.On the Democratic side, leaders must address the divisions within their ranks and recalibrate their approach to connect with a broader base. The coming years will be a test of whether the party can unify around a cohesive vision.As the dust settles, the key winners and losers from the 2024 election highlight shifting priorities, both domestically and internationally. The real impact of Trump’s policies will unfold in the months ahead as markets, communities, and foreign governments adapt to the new political landscape.","The 2024 US presidential election brought a political shake-up with former President Donald Trump returning to office.

Why Amazon is shutting down Amazon Go and Fresh stores

Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain. The decision of the company to shut down the Amazon Fresh stores will lead to thousands of job cuts across the US. Last week, the e-commerce major announced that it will close around 60 Fresh stores which will put an end to the effort of six-years. As reported by Business Insider, the WARN notices filed in various states confirm the sale of layoffs. As aper the filling, in California only the company will shut down 20 Fresh stores which will affect around 3,900 workers. Most Fresh locations closed to the public on February 1, though California stores will remain open until mid-March due to state law.As Amazon is shutting down the Fresh stores, it has outlined two main options for the affected employees. The company is giving a choice to the employees in which they can either choose the severance pay or can take transfer within the company. The workers will continue to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after the closure announcement, or until April 28. The compensation offered by the company will be based on either the minimum pay for their employee class of their average hours worked over the past 60 days whichever is higher.The report further adds that employees who do not secure another role within the company by late April will then receive severance packages, calculated as one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of four weeks’ pay, with the possibility of up to 20 weeks depending on tenure.For those seeking to remain within Amazon, the company is encouraging Fresh workers to apply for similar positions at Whole Foods Stores or Amazon grocery warehouse via its internal A to Z portal. An Amazon spokesperson said: “All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we’re providing career transition services to help them explore options.”Amazon Fresh associates typically earned between $16 and $20 per hour, according to data from job site Indeed. Their responsibilities ranged from picking delivery orders to handling checkout operations.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model. On the other hand, Whole Food Market acquired in 2017 by Amazon say strong growth with sales rising more than 40% in recent years. Also, Amazon’s online grocery business also witnessed a surge with perishable grocery sales through Same-Day Delivery growing 40x since January 2025, making fresh groceries one of the most-ordered categories on its platform.",Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain.

Despite a significant selloff in software stocks triggered by Anthropic's legal AI tools, they argue AI will enhance, not replace, existing software, enabling greater productivity and innovation.

Nvidia's Huang chimes in with Pichai, calls selloff 'most illogical thing in the world'

What exactly triggered the selloff

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Why the fear runs deeper than one plugin

Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't buying the panic. During the company's earnings call, Pichai pushed back against the market hysteria triggered by Anthropic's new AI plugins, calling it overblown. AI is ""an enabling tool,"" he said, just as it has been for Google 's own products—Search, YouTube and others. Companies ""seizing the moment"" will find the same opportunity ahead, he added.His comments come as software stocks worldwide nurse heavy losses. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins, wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single session. Analysts dubbed it a 'SaaSpocalypse'. Pichai's view? The scramble is overdone.Pichai isn't alone in questioning the market reaction. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was even more direct at a Cisco event, calling the selloff ""the most illogical thing in the world."" His take: AI will use existing software tools, not reinvent them. ""Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?"" he asked. Huang added that Nvidia itself has adopted such tools extensively, freeing up employees to focus on designing chips and computer systems.Software company executives have also pushed back, arguing they do far more than just build code. Their offerings include data management and purpose-built solutions that are difficult to replicate, especially for enterprises outside the tech world like retail and oil and gas.Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its agentic AI assistant for non-technical professionals. Most covered standard enterprise functions—sales, marketing, finance, customer support. But the legal plugin rattled nerves. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings.Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan called it ""a sign of intensifying competition"" that could hurt big players in the legal space. The fallout was swift. Thomson Reuters and RELX both closed down around 15%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. Indian IT stocks weren't spared—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5%, Wipro fell nearly 5%.The concern isn't just about legal workflows. There's a dawning realisation that AI tools can now do far more than most non-techies realise. With relatively simple prompts, they can take over a user's computer, write software, analyse stock market data, manage emails and countless other tasks. People have taken to social media describing how they built their first software program without ever learning to code. Shopify's CEO built software that could interpret his recent MRI.Meta's CFO Susan Li told investors last week that the company has seen a 30% year-over-year increase in output per engineer driven by AI coding tools. Power users have seen an 80% boost.Anthropic's numbers back up the concern. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, months after launch. The company is reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation. Jefferies noted that OpenAI is losing corporate ground to Claude, with enterprises now making up 80% of Anthropic's business.Pichai and Huang are betting the panic subsides. Wall Street isn't so sure yet.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismiss market panic over AI plugins, calling it overblown.

Bharat Taxi 2-month pilot in Delhi-NCR



Bharat Taxi, a cooperative-led ride-hailing platform, has officially been launched in India -- two months after a successful pilot operation. Launched by home minister Amit Shah on Thursday (February 5), the service has been initially launched in Delhi-NCR and Gujarat, and will be expanded across all states and Union Territories within three years.“In three years, Bharat Taxi will be rolled out across the country, from Kashmir to Kanniyakumari and Dwarka to Kamakhya,” Shah said after launching the platform.Shah also noted that the profits will be shared with drivers associated with Bharat Taxi.“I said that when this cooperative taxi initiative began, we did not realise how big it would become, but in the coming years it will grow across the country and benefit taxi drivers. I clarified that the government is not entering the taxi sector; this is a cooperative initiative, and the taxi drivers themselves are its owners. I emphasised that every driver associated with this cooperative taxi will have ownership, and it will work for their welfare,” he added.Customers can hail cars, three-wheelers and two-wheelers through the platform, and Bharat Taxi will compete with players like Uber, Ola and Rapido.Bharat Taxi operates on a zero-commission and surge-free pricing model with direct profit distribution among drivers, positioning the platform as an indigenous alternative to foreign investment-based ride-hailing platforms.According to the ministry, Bharat Taxi has emerged as the world's first and largest cooperative-based ride-hailing platform, and the world's largest driver-owned mobility platform.According to news agency PTI, over 3 lakh drivers have joined the platform since the launch of its pilot programme, and more than 1 lakh users have registered. Further, more than 10,000 rides have been completed daily in Delhi-NCR and Gujarat.Around Rs 10 crore has been distributed directly to drivers so far. The drivers are called 'Sarathis', and the platform is said to prioritise social security for drivers through health insurance, accident insurance, retirement savings and a dedicated support system. Support centres operate at seven locations in Delhi.","Bharat Taxi, a cooperative-led ride-hailing platform, has officially been launched in India.

RUDRAPUR: Pantnagar airport, spread over 793 acres in the Terai region of Kumaon, is being expanded to upgrade it into a larger aviation facility with modern infrastructure, officials said.At present, the airport has a runway of around 1,340 metres, which restricts operations to small aircraft. Under the expansion project, the existing runway will be replaced with a 3,000-m-long and 45-m-wide runway, enabling operations of larger passenger aircraft, including Boeing and Airbus models. Officials said the upgrade will improve air connectivity between Kumaon and major cities across the country.The first phase of the project includes construction of a new terminal building at an estimated cost of Rs 387 crore. Spread across 8,500 sq m, the terminal is designed to handle 475 passengers at a time and over one million passengers annually. Planned facilities include two aerobridges, escalators, elevators, automated parking, food courts, retail outlets and car rental services.Officials said improved connectivity is expected to support tourism in hill districts such as Nainital, Almora, Pithoragarh and Champawat, while also benefiting industries in SIDCUL, the agricultural university and other industrial units in the Terai region.Cargo services will also be introduced from Pantnagar, a first for the region. This is expected to facilitate faster transport of agricultural produce, industrial goods and local products to major markets across the country. Officials said this could benefit farmers and small entrepreneurs, particularly those engaged in coarse-grain cultivation and other hill produce.The apron capacity at the airport is also being expanded. From the current provision for parking two aircraft at a time, the upgraded facility will be able to accommodate up to five aircraft simultaneously, allowing an increase in flight operations.“Pantnagar airport serves as the main air gateway to Kumaon. Its expansion will improve connectivity and support economic activity in the region,” said Pawan Kumar, director, Pantnagar airport.

"As concrete envelops Bannerghatta forests, Indian Institute of Science recommends 5km eco sensitive zone",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/as-concrete-envelops-bannerghatta-forests-indian-institute-of-science-recommends-5km-eco-sensitive-zone/articleshow/127949922.cms,"Expressway Propylene Gas Crisis, New Labour Codes, Delhi's 807 Gone Missing And More





BENGALURU: Amid an intensifying legal and policy tussle over the extent of the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) on the city's outskirts, ecological scientists from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have recommended a 5km ESZ buffer covering 1,768.4sqkm and over 400 villages around the protected area.The proposal cites sustained forest degradation, rapid urbanisation, and irreversible ecological risks along the park's periphery. The scientists have also called for strict regulation of activities across four categories of ecologically sensitive regions (ESRs) within the proposed ESZ.The recommendations were based on a detailed assessment of land-use and land-cover changes, using temporal remote sensing data, ancillary information from govt agencies, and extensive field investigations conducted in 2015. The IISc team also simulated likely development patterns around BNP up to 2027. While the models indicated relatively minimal land-use changes within the core park area, they revealed alarming transformations in the buffer zones, largely driven by unplanned urban growth.Prof TV Ramachandra, of IISc's Centre for Ecological Sciences, said: ""As per our study, the moist deciduous forest cover in the BNP landscape sharply declined from 50.4% in 1973 to a shocking 29.2% in 2015.Given the present rate of development, this is likely to reduce further because of anthropogenic pressures around BNP. Only in Ragihalli, Manjunatha, Yelavantha, and Bettahalli regions, where protection measures are stronger, disturbance is minimal. "" The study also found that 87 of the 138 plant species recorded in BNP's core and buffer areas were medicinally important, underlining the landscape's ecological significance.Applying the same methodology used to assess the Western Ghats, the IISc team classified the BNP buffer into multiple ESR categories based on biological, geo-climatic, ecological, hydrological, environmental, and social attributes. ""The ESR-1 regions require the highest level of conservation, with no further degradation permitted. About 635.9sqkm covering 69 villages fall under ESR-1,"" Ramachandra explained.He added that ESR-2 zones comprise 78 villages across 264.3sqkm, and even minor unregulated activity in these areas could adversely impact ESR-1 regions. ""Hence, stricter regulation and improvement of forest areas and surroundings through enhanced protection are essential,"" he said, noting that ESR-1, ESR-2, and ESR-3 together form part of the proposed 5km ESZ.The study has recommended a complete ban on quarrying and mining in ESR-1 and ESR-2 regions, with no new licences for sand mining or quarrying. ""Permitted and regulated activities include agriculture, organic farming, animal husbandry, greenhouses, agro-processing industries, IT parks, extraction of medicinal plants, forest improvement through village forest committees, and collection of non-timber forest produce,"" Ramachandra added.Highlighting BNP's ecological importance, the scientists noted that the park lies at the confluence of the Western and Eastern Ghats, and is among the oldest habitats of Asian elephants. ""Bannerghatta supports around 200 resident elephants and nearly 350 migratory elephants from Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary and neighbouring Tamil Nadu,"" the study noted.","Scientists call for 5km eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around Bannerghatta National Park.

CHENNAI: Madras high court on Friday dismissed a plea moved by actor and founder of political party Tamilaga Vetri Kazhagam (TVK) Vijay , challenging a Rs 1.5 crore penalty imposed by the income tax department for allegedly not disclosing his true income during the assessment period 2015-16.Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorty passed the order while rejecting the plea moved by Vijay challenging the demand notice issued by the income tax department.According to Vijay, he declared an income of Rs 35.42 crore for the financial year 2016-17.However, based on documents seized by the department during a raid conducted at his residence in 2015, the department claimed that he did not disclose Rs 15 crore income earned from the movie ‘Puli’.Based on the findings, the department imposed a penalty of Rs 1.5 crore through an order dated June 30, 2022. Challenging the order, Vijay moved the present plea. Admitting the plea, a single judge on Aug 16, 2022, granted an interim stay against the operation of the order passed by the department.Vijay contended that the penalty should have been issued before June 30, 2019. Since the order was passed belatedly, it should be set aside. Opposing the submissions, the department submitted that the penalty imposed on Vijay was valid under the Income Tax Act and, therefore, his petition should be dismissed.Concurring with the submissions of the department, the court dismissed the plea moved by Vijay.",Madras high court on Friday dismissed a plea moved by actor and founder of political party Tamilaga Vetri Kazhagam (TVK) Vijay.

The losses came amid growing concern over heavy spending on artificial intelligence and uncertainty about when those investments will deliver returns.In Hong Kong, HSI was down 304 points or 1.13% as on 10:20 am IST. Kospi also continued to fall for the second day, slipping 2% to 5,057. Meanwhile, Shanghai and Shenzhen rose 0.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei also inched higher, adding 175 points or 0.33%.Losses were not confined to equities. The downturn rippled across asset classes, battering silver once again and pushing bitcoin to levels that erased all gains made since US President Donald Trump’s election victory in the United States.Adding to investor anxiety was an announcement from AI startup Anthropic, known for creating the Claude chatbot. The company revealed a new tool capable of replacing multiple software functions, including applications used in legal services and data marketing. US markets closed lower for a third consecutive session on Thursday. All three major Wall Street indexes recorded significant losses, with the Nasdaq suffering the steepest decline.The index has now logged its worst three-day performance since the tariff-driven market turmoil in April during Trump’s presidency.Economic data from the US added further pressure. Monthly job openings fell to their lowest level since 2020, while companies announced the highest number of job cuts for January since the global financial crisis in 2009, intensifying worries about the broader US economy.Precious metals remained under heavy selling pressure. Silver plunged by around 18 percent at one stage before recovering to trade near $70 an ounce, its lowest level since December. The metal had been trading above $121 just a week earlier. Gold also fell, shedding about two percent to sit just under $4,800, compared with its peak of $5,595 last Thursday.The recent slump in metals followed a surge in the US dollar last weekend after Trump appointed a relatively hawkish figure to lead the Federal Reserve, alongside easing geopolitical tensions.Cryptocurrencies were also caught in the sell-off. Bitcoin fell to its weakest level since October and narrowly avoided slipping below $60,000, wiping out gains linked to expectations of more crypto-friendly policies under Trump. The digital currency has now dropped more than 50 percent from its record high above $126,000 reached in October.In corporate news, Rio Tinto shares declined after the British-Australian miner said it would abandon merger talkswith Switzerland-based Glencore.
