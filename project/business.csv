South Mumbai: Bugle sounded for Sena vs Sena battle for one of country's most prestigious seats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bugle-sounded-for-sena-vs-sena-battle-for-one-of-countrys-most-prestigious-seats/articleshow/109895463.cms,"Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Maharashtra voters puzzled with 'two' much confusion

MUMBAI: Till last week, the South Mumbai Lok Sabha seat was a five-way fight as four candidates, MLA Yamini Jadhav and MP Milind Deora from the Shiv Sena led by Eknath Shinde, Speaker Rahul Narwekar and minister Mangal Prabhat from the BJP were campaigning against Sena's (UBT) sitting two-time MP Arvind Sawant . But with the Shinde-led Sena managing to wrest the seat from BJP with some hard bargaining, the South Mumbai Lok Sabha, one of the country's most prestigious seats, is now a high-stakes Sena versus Sena battle.This is the constituency that is the seat of the state's political establishment and the country's traditional financial nerve centre.It is also home to the country's richest people in Colaba, Cuffe Parade, Malabar Hill, Worli and Prabhadevi as well as middle- and working-class families in Sewri, Byculla, Mazgaon Lower Parel and Mumbai Central.The constituency has a significant Muslim population in Byculla, Mumbadevi and pockets of Christian and Parsi voters too. It also houses some of the country's most iconic institutions such as Mantralaya, Bombay Stock Exchange, Bombay High Court. It is home to several top tourist destinations such as the Gateway of India. Interestingly, it also has very active citizen groups and resident associations.Political observers said while Jadhav is banking on her support base in Byculla and on the BJP in Colaba and Malabar Hill, the Sena (UBT) old face Sawant could have a slight edge because of the Marathi-Muslim combination pattern that is working for MVA in Sewri, Worli, Byculla and Mumbadevi. ""Because of the last-minute declaration of candidates, there is also apathy among elite and upper middle-class voters. The 2024 polls will be a test case to see if the Marathi-Muslim combination and lower-, middle- and upper-class combination works for MVA,"" the observer said.However, being one of the most diverse constituencies in the city its issues also also as diverse and range from heritage conservation, open spaces and pedestrianisation, to affordable housing, upgradation of public health care through state-run and civic hospitals, revamp of tourist attractions, revamp of old bridges and upgrading infrastructure and redevelopment of cessed and tenanted buildings including the BDD Chawls, BIT Chawls and those owned by Mumbai Port Authority are a big issue concerning residents across south Mumbai.While the constituency has seen the launch of mega projects such as the Mumbai-Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) and coastal road, projects such as Metro 3 and Sewri World Connector are still under construction. The plan to reconstruct the Malabar Hill reservoir below Hanging Gardens and the redevelopment of the Mahalaxmi Racecourse are issues that have caused a lot of anger among activists and residents.Political observers said with Sena fielding Jadhav, the onus was now on BJP to help her connect with elite voters and ensure she gets a lead in Colaba and Malabar Hill assembly segments as she would face a tough task of wooing voters in Sena (UBT) strongholds of Sewri and Worli. While Jadhav is a sitting MLA from Byculla, she would also have the task of wooing Muslim voters in Byculla and Mumbadevi.I-T raises demand of ₹143cr from Jadhavs: The I-T department has raised a demand of Rs 143 crore on Shiv Sena legislator Yamini Jadhav and her husband Yashwant Jadhav for a period from 2018 to 2022. Both have moved the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal on April 10 and the appeals are pending.Yamini is the Sena's LS poll candidate from Mumbai South. She is pitted against UBT Shiv Sena's Arvind Sawant. Yamini Jadhav has submitted detailed information on liabilities against her and her spouse before the returning officer, Mumbai South parliamentary constituency as per the rules prescribed by the ECI.","The South Mumbai Lok Sabha seat is now a high-stakes Sena versus Sena battle.

The bench referred to SC's 2010 judgment highlighting abuse of Section 498A by married women in matrimonial disputes and the court's request to the law commission and law ministry for a relook at the provision.Cruelty in matrimonial homes is defined under Section 85 and 86 of BNS, which would come into force from July 1. SC said, ""Secs 85 & 86 are nothing but verbatim reproduction of Section 498A of IPC. The only difference is that the explanation to Section 498A of IPC, is now by way of a separate provision, that is, Section 86 of BNS.""In 2010, in Preeti Gupta case, SC had noted the abuse of Section 498A by women to implicate their husbands and in-laws in police cases and said that most of these cases emanated from trivial matrimonial disputes. It had asked the govt to take a ""serious relook"" at the provision as the tendency of over implication is reflected in a large number of cases.SC said before BNS came into force, ""we request Legislature to look into the issue as highlighted above taking into consideration the realities and consider making necessary changes in Sections 85 and 86 of the BNS.""",Supreme Court has ruled that married women cannot use police machinery to hold husband to ransom.

World Asthma Day-Why asthma cases are on a surge and what we need to do?

Points to be taken care of:

(Author: Dr. Bandana Mishra, Head of Department & Senior Consultant, Department of Pulmonology, SHALBY Sanar International Hospitals, Gurugram)

Asthma is a serious chronic disease that seeks much more awareness and even better management to reduce the myths and stigma associated with it. India has around 34.3 million Asthmatics which accounts for 12.9% of the global population, at the same time approximately 90% of Asthma patients do not get the right medication for Asthma. It is worth knowing Asthma may become chronic but it’s initial symptoms are highly apparent and can develop at any age.Chronic Asthma is manageable but its initial signs can be seen at the age of 5 years. Poor management of Asthma in childhood may lead to a tough adult life. Hence, the right management is the key to have a healthy adult life.⦁ Your child might complain about difficulty in breathing and painful coughing⦁ She/he may show discomfort or cry with tightness in chest⦁ She/he may sweat at times with breathing issue and refuse to wear even slightly tight clothes⦁ She/he may get irritated or angered along with breathlessness⦁ She/he may get tired and refuse to play any outdoor games⦁ You may hear a minute whistle in her/his rhythm of breathing⦁ Your child may develop early under eye darkness⦁ May show physical weakness and inability to cope up with studies and other activities⦁ Repeated episodes of crying with breathlessness even after a small activityThe same symptoms with different reactions may appear among adults if they have Asthma.In asthma treatment , management of asthmatic attack carries huge importance. It is noteworthy to mention that any Asthma attack can be dangerous and we cannot categorise it as per its severity or timing. Every attack requires immediate medical attention. In some serious conditions, one may experience wheezing with severe breathlessness and may not even be able to speak a single word during an attack. Additionally, many people even struggle to stretch their chest muscles forcefully to catch the rhythm of breath. An attack cannot be considered as lesser or more dangerous, each attack comes with a big risk and you may manage every Asthma attack with quick and prompt medical action.There was one interesting case I came across of a 49-year-old male follow up patient. He had issues of uncontrolled severe Asthma and he was planned for Anti IGE Therapy (Monoclonal Antibody Therapy). After proper evaluation, routine Chest X ray was repeated when the patient got admitted, it showed left hilar opacity. CECT Chest showed left lower lobe mass obscuring the bronchus. Bronchoscopy and biopsy were done and it turned out to be carcinoid. Surgery was done, his symptoms disappeared and the patient recovered well. This was an example of how uncontrolled symptoms that persists despite aggressive optimised treatment, needs to be looked for other aetiologies (causes or health issues).Another case, I would like to highlight here is of Samarth, a 9-year-old boy, and a known Asthmatic on treatment. He has a family history of asthma. He is allergic to house dust mites, pollens and grass weeds. He didn’t have allergic rhinitis. He was prescribed maintenance inhalers. When his spirometry test was done, it showed significant positive reversibility. Exacerbations were 1-2 times a year and as it was observed usually viral infections was the trigger. He needed oral steroids to take care of his exacerbations. With treatment he showed signs of improvement in his health and activities in school as well as outdoor events. I believe this shows how with treatment, proper planning and education of the patient, symptom free life can be led.⦁ Keep your inhalers and masks handy⦁ Keep the required stock of your medicines⦁ Always carry your masks, inhalers, medicines in your bag while traveling⦁ Avoid direct exposure of air pollutants⦁ Quit smoking and avoid exposure of any type of smokeLiving with asthma is not tough if managed wisely. Today, we can see a number of celebrities and sportspersons who are suffering from this disease, openly talk about it and manage it with the right treatment. Hence, we must never lose hope, only follow doctors’ instructions and be regular with your medications and appointments.",India has around 34.3 million Asthmatics which accounts for 12.9% of the global population. 90% of Asthma patients do not get the right medication for Asthma.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand continued to grapple with a severe forest fire crisis, with the Forest Survey of India (FSI) on Monday issuing the maximum -- 125-- of the 157 fire alerts issued nationwide, for the Himalayan state. Additional alerts were issued for Madhya Pradesh (eight), UP(six), Himachal Pradesh and Odisha (four each).Monday witnessed 20 fresh fire incidents in Uttarakhand, ravaging approximately 52 hectares of forest land, with Garhwal, particularly Pauri district, bearing maximum brunt.In, Pauri, the fire reached the sports department's Indoor Stadium, a building and documents were damaged. Students and staff at the building were safe.The Indian Air Force dispatched one of its MI-17 V5 choppers to aid firefighting efforts in Pauri Garhwal's Dob village. An IAF officer said that the chopper conducted three sorties, dropping 14,600 litres of water using a Bambi bucket to douse the flames.The wildfires raging across Uttarakhand have not only scorched 1,144 hectares of forest land in six months but also shrouded nearby regions in smoke and haze. The smoke is triggering health issues , even mental health disorders like anxiety and depression among residents, with many people, particularly children and the elderly, complaining of burning sensation in the eyes and respiratory problems . “Instances of people being referred from Champawat to Delhi due to breathing problems had also surfaced,” said Nita Pawar, a resident of Nainital.Charan Negi from Pauri Garhwal described the suffocating conditions, saying, “We are enveloped by a thick layer of smoke, unable to breathe comfortably. Breathing discomfort is particularly evident among the children and the elderly.” Medical professionals said hospitals are experiencing a surge in respiratory and skin ailments among patients. “Community health centres in rural hill areas have observed an increase in respiratory and skin-related cases, and this trend is expected to persist for some time, as recovery in such cases naturally takes time,” a senior doctor from the health department said.Madhavi Daruwala, a resident of Sattal in Nainital, said, “Bhowali was blanketed by haze and smoke for three days. This is disturbing as it is not only forests but also animals and birds living there that are affected. The thought of these living beings, who cannot speak about their pain and suffering, is depressing. Also, there is a constant fear of the fires reaching urban areas.” The looming ecological impact adds to the concerns of locals.Daruwala highlighted the potential increase in landslides due to the loss of vegetation. “We expect landslides to increase this year due to forest fires . Boulders are held in place by soil, trees, bushes, grass, and all these are getting burnt,” she said. Amid the crisis, concerns about timely response have arisen. “Ill-timed discontinuation of disaster management helpline number in Nainital has impacted timely reporting of fire cases,” Pawar added.","The Forest Survey of India (FSI) on Monday issued the maximum -- 125 -- of the 157 fire alerts issued nationwide, for the Himalayan state. Additional alerts were issued for Madhya Pradesh (eight), UP(six), Himachal Pradesh and Odisha (four each) Monday witnessed 20 fresh fire incidents in Uttarakhand, ravaging approximately 52 hectares of forest land.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109900910,imgsize-597739,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109900910.jpg"

HYDERABAD: It is not just the physical pain that a minor rape survivor must live with. She must also overcome enormous psychological trauma, especially when she has been assaulted by her father.In January 2023, she complained of severe stomach pain and the doctors confirmed that she was pregnant. A few months later, she delivered a male child.Even as a police case was registered, her medical tests were on, investigators were asking questions and other legal issues were being dealt with, she went back to school.She was temporarily put up in a rescue home and her child was also kept away, without her knowing any details. All this left the girl with very little time to prepare for the exams. “She might have spent a month on preparations just before the exams,” her maternal uncle told TOI.Despite strong evidence in the form of a DNA report confirming that her father was the biological father of her child, he claimed in court that he had been falsely implicated in the case. But evidence given by cops nailed his guilt. The court sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for the remainder of his life and also awarded Rs 15 lakh compensation to the girl. “Speak out and call out anybody who is troubling you, else you will be blamed,” says the girl.The 17-year-old was raped by her uncle and the case was first reported in 2022. “After we got the accused arrested, the entire family and relatives turned against us. We were ostracised. I wonder if we will go through such a situation again in my entire lifetime,” the girl told TOI. However, the moment the results were declared and she scored 9.3 GPA, she was flooded with calls from the same people who had ostracised the family, she says.This success has given both girls a boost to pursue higher studies. Both say they have now realised the importance of education.“In addition to education, we need to have the courage to speak out about any violence and call out the accused,” said the 17-year-old. We have seen how cops handled our cases and it inspired us to aim to become police officers. We want to help others like us and get them justice.”The girls also thanked the then Meerpet SHO M Mahender Reddy for being a strong pillar of support for them during the investigation. “I am happy that the girls cleared SSC despite so many struggles and also that one case ended in conviction. We are hoping for a strict punishment in the second case as well,” the officer told TOI. The 17-year-old’s case is pending trial.","The 17-year-old was raped by her uncle and the case was first reported in 2022.

Her right arm had to be amputated and the left one was left only about 20% functional. She was bedridden for over 50 days and underwent extreme trauma.Eventually, she recovered and picked up the pieces of her life.On Monday, to the joy and surprise of everyone, she scored 92% (best of five subjects) in her Class 10 exams. She was also the top scorer in Hindi in her school with 98% marks.As news of the CISCE results arrived, City International School in Mumbai's Andheri, where Anamta studies, broke into celebrations.She was always a bright student but with what she had gone through, anyone could have slid into severe depression. Despite her bodily pain, it was her positivity that pulled her through, said principal Mansi Deepak Gupta.A visibly elated Anamta told TOI: ""Doctors had suggested to my parents that I should take a break for a year or two from studies but I was not willing to do so as I didn't want to sit at home, and the school also motivated and inspired me to move on.""Speaking about the challenge of preparing for the exams, she said, ""The first thing that came to my mind after coming back from the hospital was to make my left arm fully functional. I was recommended some exercises by doctors and I also watched social media clips. However, the bigger challenge was to write with my left hand as I was not used to it. It took me a few months and I was able to manage it but my teachers insisted I should have a writer and not compromise on the speed during exams. So, a writer was provided to me.""She further said, ""I had to come out of the trauma as I'm an only child, and had made up my mind to not allow this tragedy to overpower me. In hospital, I saw terrible burn injury cases and I consider myself lucky that I am alive... After coming home, I pasted a note on my door: 'Caution - No sympathy'.""Her father, Aqeel Ahmed, an ad film maker, said: ""Anamta is my life and no one can imagine what I went through, watching my only child writhing in pain on a hospital bed where doctors gave up hope of recovery.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
FAA to investigate after Boeing says workers in South Carolina falsified 787 inspection records,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/faa-to-investigate-after-boeing-says-workers-in-south-carolina-falsified-787-inspection-records/articleshow/109899517.cms,"SEATTLE: The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it has opened an investigation into Boeing after the beleaguered company reported that workers at a South Carolina plant falsified inspection records on certain 787 planes. Boeing said its engineers have determined that misconduct did not create ""an immediate safety of flight issue "". In an email to Boeing's South Carolina employees on April 29, Scott Stocker , who leads the 787 program, said a worker observed an ""irregularity"" in a required test of the wing-to-body join and reported it to his manager.""After receiving the report, we quickly reviewed the matter and learned that several people had been violating Company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed,"" Stocker wrote.Boeing notified the FAA and is taking ""swift and serious corrective action with multiple teammates,"" Stocker said.No planes have been taken out of service, but having to perform the test out of order on planes will slow the delivery of jets still being built at the final assembly plant in North Charleston, South Carolina.Boeing must also create a plan to address planes that are already flying, the FAA said.The 787 is a two-aisle plane that debuted in 2011 and is used mostly for long international flights.""The company voluntarily informed us in April that it may not have completed required inspections to confirm adequate bonding and grounding where the wings join the fuselage on certain 787 Dreamliner airplanes,"" the agency said in a written statement. ""The FAA is investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records.""The company has been under intense pressure since a door plug blew out of a Boeing 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, leaving a gaping hole in the plane. The accident halted progress that Boeing seemed to be making while recovering from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019.Those crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which killed 346 people, are back in the spotlight, too. The families of some of the victims have pushed the Justice Department to revive a criminal fraud charge against the company by determining that Boeing's continued lapses violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement.In April, a Boeing whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, testified at a congressional hearing that the company had taken manufacturing shortcuts to turn out 787s as quickly as possible; his allegations were not directly related to those the company disclosed to the FAA last month. The company rejected Salehpour's claims.In his email, Stocker praised the worker who came forward to report what he saw: ""I wanted to personally thank and commend that teammate for doing the right thing. It's critical that every one of us speak up when we see something that may not look right, or that needs attention.""","Boeing says misconduct did not create ""an immediate safety of flight issue"" The FAA is investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections.

Boeing capsule heads to ISS today in 1st crewed flight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boeing-capsule-heads-to-iss-today-in-1st-crewed-flight/articleshow/109897200.cms,"CAPE CANAVERAL: Boeing Co's new Starliner astronaut capsule is poised for launch of its long-delayed inaugural crewed test flight to the International Space Station , two years after its first voyage without humans to the orbital laboratory.The gumdrop-shaped CST-100 Starliner with two astronauts aboard was due for liftoff at 10.34pm (8.04am IST Tuesday) from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, carried atop an Atlas V rocket furnished by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).Riding aboard the Starliner, designed to carry up to seven crew members, are veteran Nasa astronauts Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore, 61, a retired US navy captain, and Sunita ""Sunni"" Williams, 58, a former navy aviator and test pilot. They have logged a combined 500 days in space over the course of two missions each to the space station. Wilmore is the designated commander for flight, with Williams in the pilot seat.Although Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary, and the test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually.If all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at the space station after a flight of about 26 hours and dock with ISS early Wednesday. Wilmore and Williams are expected to remain at the space station for about a week before riding the Starliner back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the US - a first for crewed Nasa missions. The Starliner will give Nasa its first alternative to sending astronauts to low-Earth orbit from US soil since Elon Musk's SpaceX began doing so in 2020.",Boeing Co's new Starliner astronaut capsule is poised for launch of its long- delayed inaugural crewed test flight to the International Space Station.

A solemn and shy adolescent, he had learned that ordinary activities - riding a bike, going outside on a cold day, playing soccer - could bring on episodes of searing pain. ""Sickle cell always steals my dreams and interrupts all the things I want to do,"" he said. Now he feels as if he has a chance for a normal life.Near the end of last year, the FDA gave two companies authorisation to sell gene therapy to people with sickle cell disease - a genetic disorder of red blood cells that causes debilitating pain and other medical problems. People are born with the disease when they inherit the mutated gene for the condition from each parent.The treatment helped patients in clinical trials, but Kendric is the first commercial patient for Bluebird Bio , a Somerville, Mass., company. Another other company, Vertex Therapeutics of Boston, declined to say if it had started treatment for any patients with its approved CRISPR gene-editing-based remedy.Kendric began his treatment at Children's National Hospital in Washington. Wednesday's treatment was only the first step. Doctors removed his bone marrow stem cells, which Bluebird will then genetically modify in a specialised lab for his treatment. That will take months. But before it begins, Bluebird needs hundreds of millions of stem cells from Kendric, and if the first collection - taking six to eight hours - is not sufficient, the company will try once or twice more. If it still doesn't have enough, Kendric will have to spend another month in preparation for another stem cell extraction. nyt","Kendric Cromer, 12, is the first person in the world with sickle cell disease to begin a commercially approved gene therapy that may cure the condition.

However, there seems to be an element of hesitancy within the government to engage fully in the investigation, the report noted.A source within the PML-N revealed Nawaz Sharif 's insistence on robust action against the perpetrators, regardless of their political influence. However, there's a noticeable lack of enthusiasm from the current government to involve bodies such as the NAB or FIA in the investigation, despite suggestions, according to Dawn.Information Minister Attaullah Tarar's dismissal of engaging the NAB or FIA raises eyebrows, especially given the magnitude of the alleged scam, which surpasses PKR 500 million, warranting their involvement according to new laws. The government's cautious approach, attributed to the involvement of the former caretaker government, reflects a reluctance to tread on contentious ground.Reports suggesting substantial wheat imports under Shehbaz Sharif's administration post-elections have added another layer to the controversy, the report noted. Denials from government officials contradict the allegations, further complicating the situation. Blame for the wheat crisis is shifted to the caretaker government, distancing the current administration from any culpability.Adding to the confusion are reports of the summoning of former caretaker officials by the fact-finding committee, which were swiftly denied by its head, Kamran Ali Afzal.Tensions continue to escalate within the PML-N, with Hanif Abbasi confronting former caretaker premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar over the wheat scandal. Kakar's veiled threats hint at underlying political manoeuvring, adding intrigue to the unfolding drama. The PTI seized the opportunity to push for a judicial commission, capitalising on the discord within the opposition camp.Amidst the chaos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strived to reassure farmers of his unwavering support.His formation of a committee to address farmers' grievances demonstrates a proactive stance, aiming to alleviate concerns regarding wheat procurement, Dawn reported.","The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive.

From spring offensive to charm offensive: The Taliban are working to woo tourists to Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/from-spring-offensive-to-charm-offensive-the-taliban-are-working-to-woo-tourists-to-afghanistan/articleshow/109713887.cms,"KABUL: Around 30 men are crammed into a Kabul classroom, part of the debut student cohort at a Taliban-run institute training tourism and hospitality professionals.It's a motley crew. One student is a model. Another is 17 and has no job history.The students vary in age, education level and professional experience. They're all men - Afghan women are banned from studying beyond sixth grade - and they don't know anything about tourism or hospitality.But they are all eager to promote a different side of Afghanistan . And the Taliban are happy to help.Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife.And yet, foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence, increased flight connections with hubs like Dubai, and the bragging rights that come with vacationing in an unusual destination. The numbers aren't huge - they never were - but there's a buzz around Afghan tourism.In 2021, there were 691 foreign tourists . In 2022, that figure rose to 2,300. Last year, there were 7,000.Mohammad Saeed, the head of the Tourism Directorate in Kabul, said the biggest foreign visitor market is China because of its proximity and large population. Afghanistan also has advantages over some of its neighbors.""They've told me they don't want to go to Pakistan because it's dangerous and they get attacked. The Japanese have said this to me also,"" Saeed said. ""This is good for us.""But there are disadvantages, too.Visas are difficult and expensive to access. Many countries severed ties with Afghanistan after the Taliban returned to power, and no country recognizes them as the legitimate rulers of the country.Afghan embassies either closed or suspended their operations. There's an ongoing power struggle between Afghanistan's embassies and consulates staffed by people from the former Western-backed administration, and those under the Taliban administration's full control.Saeed concedes there are obstacles for Afghan tourism to develop but said he was working with ministries to overcome them.His ultimate aim is to have a visa on arrival for tourists, but that could be years away. There are problems with the road network, which is half-paved or non-existent in some parts of the country, and airlines largely avoid Afghan airspace.The capital Kabul has the most international flights, but no Afghan airport has direct routes with major tourist markets like China, Europe, or India.Despite the challenges, Saeed wants Afghanistan to become a tourism powerhouse, an ambition that appears to be backed by the Taliban's top leaders.""I have been sent to this department on the instructions of the elders (ministers). They must trust me because they've sent me to this important place.""The students also have aspirations. The model, Ahmed Massoud Talash, wants to learn about Afghanistan's picturesque spots for Instagram posts and its history for media appearances.Business school graduate Samir Ahmadzai wants to open a hotel but thinks he should know more about tourism and hospitality first.""They hear that Afghanistan is backwards, poverty and all about war,"" said Ahmadzai. ""We have 5,000 years of history. There should be a new page of Afghanistan.""Classes include Afghan handicrafts and anthropology basics.An unofficial subject is how to interact with foreign women and how their behavior or habits could clash with local customs and edicts. Examples might be women smoking or eating in public, to mixing freely with men who are not related to them by blood or marriage.The Taliban have imposed a dress code for women and requirements for them to have a male guardian, or mahram, when they travel. Dining alone, traveling alone, and socializing with other women in public have become harder. With gyms closed to women and beauty salons banned, there are fewer places where they can meet outside the home.In a sign that the country is preparing for more overseas visitors, the country's only five-star hotel, the Serena, has reopened its women's spa and salon for foreign females after a monthslong closure.Foreigners must show their passport to access services. Women with ""born in Afghanistan"" on their ID are barred.The restrictions on Afghan women and girls weigh on overseas travel companies, who say they try to focus on the positive aspect of cultural interactions by making donations, supporting local projects or only visiting family-run businesses.Shane Horan, the founder of Rocky Road Travel, said visiting Afghanistan should not be seen as an endorsement of any particular government or political regime.""Ultimately, the goal should be to support responsible tourism practices that contribute positively to the local economy and foster mutual respect and understanding, while also remaining cognizant of the broader political context in Afghanistan.""He said there was no input from authorities about what tour groups saw or did, and that the company worked closely with a women's rights organization in Afghanistan. A percentage of the tour cost went into supporting this organization's programs, Horan added.There are no women at the Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management. The students don't mention it. But an official at the Tourism Directorate does.""It's a heartbreaking situation,"" said the official, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. ""Even female family members ask if they can study here. But there was a change in policy with the change in government. The women who were studying before (the takeover) never came back. They never graduated.""","Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls.

Leading this push is former home secretary Suella Braverman, who delivered a scathing critique in 'The Daily Telegraph,' urging Sunak to transition away from ""managerialism"" and demonstrate resolute leadership.""Let me cut to the chase so no one wastes time over-analysing this: we must not change our leader. Changing leader now won't work: the time to do so came and went. The hole to dig us out is the PM's, and it's time for him to start shovelling,"" expressed the sacked Indian-origin ex-minister, who is at the forefront of the backbench rebellion.""Either we start fighting to win now, or we'll have no one else to blame when this week's political earthquake is made to look like a mere tremor come the general election night,"" she said.Others have joined in to urge Sunak to ""wake up and smell the coffee,"" pointing to the local election results indicating that the Labour Party is poised for success in an upcoming general election, anticipated later this year.Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer has celebrated his party's ""phenomenal result,"" highlighted by Labour's Sadiq Khan securing a historic third term as London Mayor on Friday.However, Starmer also reached out to voters who expressed discontent over the party's perceived inadequacy in addressing the Israel-Gaza conflict. Analysis revealed that Labour faced setbacks in areas with significant Islamic populations, where voters opted for independents and the anti-war Worker's Party of Britain.""I have heard you. I have listened. And I am determined to meet your concerns and to gain your respect and trust again in the future,"" said Starmer.Overall, the Labour camp will be rejoicing this weekend as it virtually dominated the mayoral elections across England, securing victories in Liverpool, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and Greater Manchester.With the majority of results now tallied from Thursday's local council elections, Labour appears poised to claim over 1,100 seats.

However, it is unlikely that any senior members of the royal family will be present at the event.Kate Middleton , Harry's sister-in-law, is currently receiving cancer treatment away from the public eye, while Harry and his older brother, Prince William , remain estranged.According to reports, the brothers have not spoken for over a year following the release of Harry's controversial memoir, ""Spare.""It remains uncertain whether Harry will have the opportunity to meet with his father, King Charles , who is also undergoing cancer treatment. In February, when Charles was diagnosed, Harry flew from California to see him but was only granted a brief 30-minute meeting. Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on any private meetings.Despite the strained relationships, Charles is expected to invite Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle , along with their children Archie and Lilibet, to Balmoral Castle in Scotland this summer. On the day of Harry's event, Charles has a busy schedule, including his weekly audience with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and attending the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season, pending medical advice, according to the Telegraph.Harry and Markle are set to travel to Nigeria later this month for a tour related to the Invictus Games.

"UK's new climate action plan unlawful, London's high court rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uks-new-climate-action-plan-unlawful-londons-high-court-rules/articleshow/109816782.cms,"LONDON: Britain's latest climate action plan is unlawful , London's high court ruled on Friday in a legal challenge by three environmental campaign groups over emissions targets.Friends of the Earth, ClientEarth and the Good Law Project took legal action last year over carbon budgets set by the government in 2023 to meet Britain's target of net zero by 2050.Those emissions targets were set after a 2022 ruling that Britain had breached legislation designed to help reach the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of containing temperatures within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels.The three groups argued that the new plan was also unlawful, citing as one example the fact that the then energy minister Grant Shapps was not told of the risk that policies to reduce emissions could not be delivered.Judge Clive Sheldon upheld four out of five grounds of their legal challenge in a written ruling on Friday.Friends of the Earth's lawyer David Wolfe said Britain's Climate Change Committee warned last year there were credible policies in place for less than 20% of the reductions required to meet the carbon budget for the period 2033-2037.But, the group said, Shapps ""proceeded on the assumption that the reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases from all of the proposals and policies.. would all be delivered in full"".Lawyers representing the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said Shapps did not assume emission reductions would be delivered in full.But the high court ruled that Shapps was wrongly told by officials that ""each of the individual proposals and policies that form the package of measures would be delivered in full"", rendering the carbon budget delivery plan unlawful.",London's high court rules Britain's latest climate action plan is unlawful.

"China is buying gold like there's no tomorrow, jacking up prices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-is-buying-gold-like-theres-no-tomorrow-jacking-up-prices/articleshow/109866107.cms,"Often considered a safe investment during times of geopolitical and economic turmoil, gold has soared in price in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the war in Gaza But gold's climb to record highs above $2,400 per ounce has proved more resilient, and lasted longer, because of China. Chinese consumers have flocked to gold as their confidence in investments like real estate or stocks has faltered.At the same time, the country's central bank has steadily added to its gold reserves, while whittling away at its holdings of US debt. And throwing fuel on the fire are Chinese speculators betting there is still room for appreciation.China already held considerable sway in gold markets. But the country's influence has become more pronounced during this latest bull run - a nearly 50% increase in the global price since late 2022. It continued to scale new heights despite factors that traditionally make gold a comparatively less appealing investment: higher interest rates and a strong US dollar. Last month, gold prices vaulted higher even after the US Federal Reserve signalled that it would keep higher interest rates for longer. And it has continued to appreciate even as the dollar has risen against almost every major currency in the world this year.Prices have pulled back to around $2,300 per ounce, but there is a growing sentiment that the gold market is governed no longer by economic factors but by the whims of Chinese buyers and investors. ""China is unquestionably driving the price of gold,"" said Ross Norman, CEO of MetalsDaily, a precious-metals information platform based in London. Gold consumption in the country rose 6% in the first quarter from a year earlier, as per China Gold Association. It came on the heels of a 9% rise last year.Gold investing became more alluring as traditional investments turned lackluster. China's real estate sector remains in crisis. With few better alternatives, money flowed into Chinese funds that traded in gold, and many young people took to collecting beans in tiny quantities as an affordable investment. Another major buyer of gold in China is the country's central bank. In March, the People's Bank of China added to its gold reserves for a 17th straight month. Last year, the bank bought more gold than any other central bank in the world, adding more to its reserves than it had in nearly 50 years. Beijing is buying up gold to diversify its reserve funds and reduce its dependence on USD. China has been reducing its US treasury holdings for more than a decade. As of March, China had about $775 billion worth of US debt, down from about $1.1 trillion in 2021.When China increased its gold holdings in the past, it bought domestically using yuan, said Guan Tao, global chief economist at BOC International in Beijing. But this time, he said, the bank is using foreign currencies to buy gold - effectively reducing its exposure to the USD and other currencies. Many central banks, including China, started acquiring gold after the US took the rare step of freezing Russia's dollar holdings under sanctions imposed on Moscow. Other US allies have imposed similar curbs.Although Beijing has been buying up gold, the metal accounts for only 4.6% of China's foreign exchange reserves. In percentage terms, India holds nearly twice as much of its reserves in gold.","Gold has soared in price in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the war in Gaza.

Poll reveals majority of Americans view TikTok as a tool of Chinese influence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/poll-reveals-majority-of-americans-view-tiktok-as-a-tool-of-chinese-influence/articleshow/109782105.cms,"NEW DELHI: A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has highlighted a growing perception among Americans that TikTok is being used by China to manipulate US public opinion. According to the poll, 58% of respondents believe that the Chinese government uses the popular short-video app to influence American views , while only 13% disagreed with this assertion.Amid these concerns, the US government is moving closer to possibly banning TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance.The debate intensified last week when President Joe Biden signed a law mandating ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations within 270 days or face a prohibition. This legislation reflects bipartisan apprehension about the app's potential as a vehicle for foreign influence and data security threats.""TikTok has spent more than $1.5 billion on data security efforts and would not share data on its 170 million US users with the Chinese government,"" the company said, denying any promotion or removal of content at Beijing's request. TikTok further declared its intention to challenge any ban as a breach of free speech rights under the US Constitution, noting past legal successes where a judge in Montana blocked a state-level ban on the app citing free speech concerns.Despite TikTok's assurances, the poll indicates that half of the American adults surveyed support a ban, while 32% are opposed, and the remainder are undecided. The support for a ban is stronger among Americans aged 40 and older, with about 60% in favor, compared to roughly 40% of younger adults aged between 18 and 39.Moreover, 46% of respondents also concurred with the view that China uses TikTok for espionage activities on ordinary Americans, a claim repeatedly denied by Beijing.The app's pervasive influence in America is evident, with even Biden's re-election campaign utilizing it as a strategic tool to engage voters for the upcoming presidential election. The issue has created a split among political figures, including former President Donald Trump, who criticized the potential ban despite owning a competing platform, Truth Social.As the January 19 deadline for TikTok’s sale approaches—one day before Biden's term could end—the future of the app in the US remains uncertain, with potential legal and political battles ahead.",A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has highlighted a growing perception among Americans that TikTok is being used by China to manipulate US public opinion. 58% of respondents believe that the Chinese government uses the popular short-video app to influence American views.

Why many Chinese are upset about Labor Day holiday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/why-many-chinese-are-upset-about-labor-day-holiday/articleshow/109753504.cms,"NEW DELHI: As millions in China brace for the Labor Day holiday , the enthusiasm that typically accompanies the break is notably absent this year. Hao Zeyu, an algorithm engineer, encapsulates the general sentiment as he faces a compressed holiday schedule—out of the five days off, only one counts as a genuine break due to the adjustment of working days around weekends.As per a CNN report, the practice known as ""tiaoxiu"" or adjusted rest, although designed to boost consumption during holidays since its introduction in 1999, is now under scrutiny.This year, the economic backdrop is starkly different; with a post-Covid economic slump gripping the nation, workers are more concerned about job security than holiday spending. The adjustment of workdays has sparked substantial online debate and dissatisfaction, as seen in social media uproar, with hashtags criticizing the tiaoxiu policy amassing over 560 million views.The discontent stems from heightened work demands and economic pressures—issues like a lingering property crisis, faltering foreign investment, and tepid consumer spending are exacerbating the strain on workers. This has transformed the Labor Day holiday from a time of relaxation to a source of stress, with many feeling that the restructured break offers little respite from the relentless work schedule, the CNN report said.Christian Yao, a senior lecturer, notes that these are ""very bumpy years"" for China as it transitions from a manufacturing-focused to a knowledge-based economy . Workers fear job loss and doubt whether alternative employment could offer better compensation, making them reluctant to complain or take additional leave, the CNN report said.Meanwhile, companies like Yum China offer a glimpse of flexibility, not requiring employees to work during designated ""special working days."" In contrast, other companies, especially in the tech sector known for the grueling ""996"" work culture, are seeing a pushback against overwork.","The practice known as ""tiaoxiu"" or adjusted rest, although designed to boost consumption during holidays, is now under scrutiny.

NEW DELHI: The Maldivian tourism minister , Ibrahim Faisal, has appealed to Indian tourists to continue visiting the archipelago nation, emphasising the historical ties between the two countries.In an interview with PTI Videos, Faisal stated, ""We have a history. Our newly elected government also wants to work together (with India). We always promote peace and a friendly environment.Our people and the government will give a warm welcome to Indian arrivals. As the Tourism Minister, I want to tell Indians to please be a part of Maldives' tourism. Our economy depends on tourism.""The minister's plea comes amidst a significant decline in Indian tourist arrivals following derogatory remarks made by three Maldivian officials against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media.The backlash led to numerous cancellations and a drop in India's position from the top visitor country to the sixth position after January. According to a report by sun.mv, tourist arrivals from India declined by 42 per cent in the first four months of this year compared to the same period last year.The strained relations between India and the Maldives have been attributed to the new administration led by President Mohamed Muizzu, who is widely seen as a pro-China leader.Since assuming office in November last year, Muizzu has maintained his election promise of evicting Indian military personnel from the Maldives, forcing the withdrawal of 88 Indian military personnel manning three aviation platforms gifted by India. Muizzu has previously accused India of meddling in the affairs of the Maldives and won the presidential elections in September last year with an ""India Out"" campaign.Despite the current challenges, the Maldives remains a key maritime neighbour for India in the Indian Ocean Region and holds a special place in India's initiatives like 'SAGAR' and the 'Neighbourhood First Policy' of the Modi government. The Maldivian tourism minister's appeal highlights the importance of maintaining strong bilateral ties and the significance of Indian tourists for the Maldivian economy.",Maldivian tourism minister Ibrahim Faisal has appealed to Indian tourists to continue visiting the archipelago nation.
