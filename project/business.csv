‘Country will be free of Naxalism by 2026,’ Amit Shah, calls on Maoists to give up arms

NEW DELHI: CPI general secretary D Raja on Tuesday questioned the government's push for a ""Naxal mukt Bharat"" and urged it to accept the proposal made by Naxal groups for talks.His comments have drawn sharp criticism from the BJP, which accused the Congress and its allies of backing Maoist violence.While addressing an event in Delhi, Raja questioned the intent behind anti-naxal operations, alluding it was bound to fail according to him as was BJP’s said agenda of “Congress mukt Bharat”.He said, “What is this Naxal Mukt Bharat? Already, they spoke about the Congress Mukt Bharat. What happened to Congress Mukt Bharat? Tomorrow they will say Communist Mukt Bharat,” Raja said during a press conference, as per news agency ANI.The CPI veteran added, “If the BJP and RSS, combined, continue to be in power, the future of India will be imperial. If we want to save India, save the constitution, we should remove the BJP RSS from power.”The remarks come in the backdrop of the ongoing anti-Naxal operation, dubbed Operation Black Forest, under which the number of most-affected Naxal districts has reportedly come down to six.Reacting to Raja’s statement, BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari accused the Congress and CPI of “supporting violent Naxals and Maoists,” and “opposing India’s fight against Red Terror.”In a post on X, Bhandari wrote, “What is this Naxal Mukt Bharat’ says CPI Gen Secretary D Raja! Rahul Gandhi's alliance partner CPI gives support to violent Naxals and Maoists! Congress CPI opposes India's fight against Red Terror.”He further alleged that the CPI and Congress are “Pro Naxals, Pro Red Terror”, and accused them of compromising internal security and “ideologically patronising” left-wing extremism. “Congress CPI are ‘Political Tukde Tukde Gang’,” he wrote.The CPI is part of the INDIA alliance, which includes the Congress and other opposition parties gearing up for the upcoming assembly and general elections including Kerala where CPI shares power.","CPI general secretary D Raja questioned the government's push for a ""Naxal mukt Bharat"" Raja urged it to accept the proposal made by Naxal groups for talks.

India’s Bold UN Stand: Delhi Backs Palestine’s Two-State Solution, Testing Ties With 'Friend' Israel

NEW DELHI: India’s developmental assistance of close to $80 million for Palestine in the past 11 years is almost double that of the amount that was given in the preceding 65 years, according to Indian authorities. India has continued to extend humanitarian assistance to the people of Palestine both bilaterally and through UNRWA, despite the ban imposed on the agency by Israel. It contributes annually $5 million to UNRWA and has provided $27.5 million to the agency since 2020-21.“India’s developmental assistance, given to Palestine since 2014 is almost double of what was given in the preceding 65 years (around $42 million) and projects worth $40 million are in the pipeline,” said a diplomatic sourceWhile govt has faced some criticism for its flip-flop over the Gaza issue, like its decision in June this year to abstain from voting on a UNGA resolution for lasting and unconditional ceasefire, it believes India’s overall position, including its long-standing commitment to a 2-state solution, has remain unchanged.Indian authorities also see as significant that the govt hasn’t voted against any of the 175 resolutions on Israel-Palestine issues in the UN during past 10 years, suggesting India’s voting pattern at UN has remained unchanged. India was among the 142 countries that voted recently in favour of a UNGA resolution endorsing the New York Declaration that outlined tangible, irreversible and timebound steps for a 2-state solution.Since the Gaza conflict erupted in 2023, India has had to do a tough balancing act between its increasingly important relationship with Israel and its traditional support for the Palestinian cause. It has strongly condemned the Oct 7, 2023, terrorist strikes by Hamas, defending Israel’s right to defend itself from acts of terrorism, but equally condemned the loss of civilian lives in the Israel-Hamas war and sought respect for international humanitarian law.While the recent visit by Israeli hardliner Bezalel Smotrich raised eyebrows, govt sees it as a visit purely in his capacity as Israel’s finance minister to sign a bilateral investment agreement. The deal was under discussion for the past six years, before it was finalised last month. According to Indian authorities, the visit was meant to ramp up India’s economic and financial ties with Israel.“India remains concerned at the security situation and has called for a ceasefire, release of all hostages and peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.At the same time, India has emphasized the need for safe, timely and sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Palestine,” said a source, citing Palestinian ambassador Abdullah Shawesh’s recent remark that he is satisfied with India’s position. India has also been calling for efforts to bring Israel and Palestine closer for early resumption of direct peace negotiations.","India’s developmental assistance of close to $80 million for Palestine in the past 11 years is almost double that of the amount that was given in the preceding 65 years.

Bridging gap

NEW DELHI: In a significant step to fast-track land acquisition and construction of the first-ever rail link between India and Bhutan — a project of major strategic importance — the railways has designated the proposed 69-km Kokrajhar-Gelephu rail line as a Special Railway Project (SRP).The Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) issued the notification this week under the Railways Act, 1989. Officials said the national transporter has put the project priority list as a part of the government’s Act East policy.In March 2024, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bhutan, both countries agreed to establish two rail links between India and Bhutan: Kokrajhar-Gelephu and Banarhat-Samtse. The 16-km Banarhat-Samtse stretch will connect West Bengal with Bhutan.These lines will give Bhutan its first-ever railway connectivity.Senior railway officials said that SRPs are important as they have strategic importance, strengthen national security and boost socio-economic growth through improved connectivity. “This is a strategic project as it will improve cross-border connectivity and strengthen bilateral ties. In this year’s budget, funds were allocated for preliminary engineering-cum-traffic survey and final location survey for the new line,” said an official.This classification helps in prioritising resource allocation for projects and funds for their timely completion.The NFR has completed the final location survey and the detailed project report which would cost around Rs 3,500 crore. The project includes construction of six new stations — Balajan, Garubhasa, Runikhata, Shantipur, Dadgiri and Gelephu. The corridor will have two important bridges, 29 major bridges, 65 minor bridges, one Road Over Bridge and 39 Road Under Bridges. Two viaducts, each 11 metres long, will be constructed for safe and efficient train travel across various terrains.","The proposed 69-km Kokrajhar-Gelephu rail line has been designated as a Special Railway Project (SRP) The Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) issued the notification this week under the Railways Act, 1989.

India Pushes Forward Trade Agenda As Goyal Addresses Tariff Pressures And Global FTA Plans

Poll Should India prioritize expanding its ties with the EU over its relationship with Russia? Yes, focus on the EU No, maintain ties with Russia

The 13th round of India-EU negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) this month was a missed opportunity, but the EU remains committed to concluding a “meaningful package” by the end of this year, EU ambassador to India Herve Delphin has said. India and the EU will hold another round of FTA talks in Brussels on October 6, hoping to close several chapters that both sides could not in the last round here.Delphin’s remarks confirm that there are lingering issues that both sides need to address to be able to meet the year-end deadline. EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, who visited India this month, had said that he expected more progress in the last round.Separately, Germany’s ambassador to India Philipp Ackermann told TOI last week the 13th round was good but not good enough, while expressing confidence that India and the EU will get down to closing more chapters in the next round. Before the 13th round, only 12 of the 24 chapters, including SMEs, transparency, dispute settlement and customs and trade facilitation - had been closed.“The 13th round earlier in September was a bit of a missed opportunity to make some breakthrough. The EU was and is still ready to conclude on a meaningful package. We look forward to India engaging in earnest and moving, like the EU has shown readiness to do, towards a mutually beneficial deal,” said Delphin, addressing an event that explored the way forward in India-EU relations against the backdrop of global disorder.Delphin said that the EU and India offer each other important strategic options to “de-risk the economic turmoil and the security uncertainties, to tap into our complementarities and combine respective strengths and scale to serve each other’s interests”.The EU push towards strategic autonomy and India’s own, as Delphin said, strategic conundrum in the form of challenges posed by the US, China and Russia have forced both sides to diversify their partnerships. However, India’s energy ties with Russia, as EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said this month, remains an impediment to progress in India-EU ties. On its part, India wants EU to shun “double standards” on the issue of Russian oil, with the MEA reminding the EU last week of President Donald Trump’s remarks urging Europe to not purchase Russian energy.Delphin said it is for India to consider how it can square its position on Russia, a strategic partner, with its support for peace and its desire to enhance ties with the EU. Apart from its energy ties with Russia, India’s participation in the Russia-Belarus military exercise Zapad-2025 has also been met with disapproval in Europe.“We also have to be clear-eyed about those issues on which we are not aligned...there is a Russia question - specifically linked to its war of aggression against Ukraine and its hostile attitude towards as seen in past weeks and days and the violation of European air space by Russian drones,” said Delphin.“India has pronounced itself for peace. Russia is a strategic partner for India. And India wants to deepen its ties with the EU. This will require further consideration in Delhi on how to square those terms,” he added.","The 13th round of India-EU negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) this month was a missed opportunity, EU ambassador to India Herve Delphin has said.

NEW DELHI: Going for a consensus with key opposition parties, Congress has decided to boycott the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on three bills that prescribe automatic dismissal of CMs and ministers who are in jail for 30 days.While it comes on the back of boycott announced by TMC Samajwadi Party , AAP and Sena UBT, the decision of the lead opposition player implies the participation of remaining INDIA bloc parties like DMK , NCP, Left is also doubtful — raising the possibility of an entire opposition no-show in the crucial panel that will vet the bills including the 130th constitutional amendment that was tabled by Union home minister Amit Shah in the monsoon session of the Parliament.Congress sources said the decision on staying away from the JPC has been taken and a communication will be sent to the govt/Speaker soon.The stance shows that Congress has gone with key allies who decided to boycott early on, even as it was inclined to join the panel arguing that the govt could not be given a free reign in the committee. The concern about opposition unity was high since the four parties went ahead with their decision of boycott.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal had hinted as much when he told TOI that Congress will seek a consensus with the INDIA bloc and take a collective decision.Tabled in Lok Sabha on Aug 30, the bills triggered a bedlam in the House. The Parliament has not been able to announce JPC despite a passage of nearly a month since a decision to refer the three bills to the panel was announced.","Congress has decided to boycott the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on three bills that prescribe automatic dismissal of CMs and ministers who are in jail for 30 days.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has penned a foreword for his Italian counterpart Georgia Meloni's Indian edition autobiography, describing it has her ""Mann ki Baat.""""It is not just an autobiography; it is her Mann ki Baat,"" he said in the foreword of the book titled""I am delighted that Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is penning her autobiography, I Am Giorgia. Over the last 11 years, I have had the privilege of engaging with many world leaders, each with a different life journey. At times, their journeys transcend personal stories and speak to something larger. They remind us of ideals that have endured across cultures and centuries. Prime Minister Meloni has several such instances in her accomplished life, making this book very special,"" the foreword said, according to ANI.Highlighting the connection between Meloni's journey and ""the concept of Nari Shakti,"" PM Modi wrote, ""There are various ways to understand as well as appreciate Prime Minister Meloni's rise and leadership. Among those, I can see a strong connection between her story and the concept of Nari Shakti, the divine feminine energy that has been venerated in Indic traditions for thousands of years in many forms.""""She has held firm to her roots while leading her nation with confidence on the global stage.That is why her journey resonates so deeply with us in India,"" the foreword said.Terming it the ""bedrock"" of his ""own personal friendship"" with Meloni, PM Modi said in the book, ""We are bound by shared civilizational instincts like the defence of heritage, the strength of community and the celebration of womanhood as a guiding force.

BENGALURU: Social media platform X said on Monday it was “deeply concerned” by a Karnataka HC order that empowers “millions of police officers” to issue arbitrary content takedown notices through a new portal called Sahyog.The Elon Musk-owned X said it will appeal the Sept 24 order as part of its broader effort to defend free expression in India but did not indicate whether it would be filed before HC or Supreme Court.The firm said it respects and complies with Indian law, but argued that the court’s decision fails to address key constitutional concerns it raised in its challenge. It drew attention to a recent Bombay HC ruling striking down a similar framework as unconstitutional.The platform rejected the view that its foreign incorporation prevented it from taking such positions, stressing it contributes significantly to public discourse in India and places user voices at the centre of its operations. A post from its Global Govt Affairs handle reads: “This new regime (takedown notices through portal) has no basis in the law, circumvents Section 69A of IT Act, violates Supreme Court rulings, and infringes Indian citizens’ constitutional rights to freedom of speech and expression.The company said the framework would allow content removal based solely on allegations of illegality without judicial review or due process for speakers, while threatening platforms with criminal liability for non-compliance.The post followed a HC ruling last Wednesday dismissing X Corp’s petition against govt takedown directions. Justice M Nagaprasanna held that American free speech standards cannot be transplanted into Indian constitutional thought and no global platform can bypass Indian law. HC had described social media as “a modern amphitheatre of ideas” that cannot be left to “anarchic freedom”. “Unregulated speech, under the guise of liberty, becomes a licence to lawlessness,” the order stated.","Elon Musk-owned X said it will appeal the Sept 24 order as part of its broader effort to defend free expression in India.

NEW DELHI: SC has ordered sending an additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM) and a sessions judge in Delhi for training to the judicial academy after finding fault in orders passed by the judicial officers. Bail was granted by ACMM to a habitual offender couple and the same was upheld by sessions judge.A bench of Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and S V N Bhatti made it clear that it was not “whittling down pro-liberty principles” but the conduct of accused was such that they should not have been given bail and referred how the accused couple had earlier taken Delhi high court for a ride for four years, a fact which was not taken into consideration by lower courts and the HC also while granting them relief in a cheating case.The couple, facing criminal proceedings in six similar cases, had allegedly cheated Rs 1.9 crore on the pretext of selling a piece of land which was already sold and they refused to refund the money and an FIR was lodged against them subsequently. They then managed to get anticipatory bail from Delhi HC in 2018 after assuring the court to pay back the amount and they enjoyed liberty for almost five years. But they resiled from their statement and failed to pay the amount, compelling HC to cancel their bail in 2023 and by that time chargesheet in the case had been filed.Contending that chargesheet had already been filed, the couple had approached trial court for regular bail which was granted by trial judge and it was upheld by sessions judge and Delhi HC. The apex court also objected to HC order upholding the bail despite it having passed strong observations against them in earlier round of litigation.“In this backdrop, the ACMM, despite being made aware of HC’s order dated Feb 1, 2023 and even noting the same, proceeded on the simplistic premise that since the chargesheet had been submitted, no useful purpose would be served by taking the accused into custody, particularly as the stand taken by the Investigating Officer was that custodial interrogation was not required. Such reasoning, in our view, is untenable, inasmuch as the same glossed over the private respondents’ conduct, including undertakings made before a higher court viz. HC,” the bench said.“Before parting, we would be failing in our duty if we turned a blind eye to the manner in which the ACMM granted bail to the accused and the sessions judge refused to interfere with such grant of bail. In the facts herein, we deem it appropriate that the judicial officers who passed the orders shall undergo special judicial training for a period of at least seven days. The learned CJ of Delhi HC is requested to make appropriate arrangements for such training at Delhi Judicial Academy, with particular focus on sensitising the judicial officers on how to conduct judicial proceedings, particularly in matters where decisions of superior courts are involved and the level of weightage to be accorded thereto,” it said.",Bail was granted by ACMM to a habitual offender couple and the same was upheld by sessions judge.

US pharma tariffs to have limited impact in India: Govt to panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-pharma-tariffs-to-have-limited-impact-in-india-govt-to-panel/articleshow/124220399.cms,"Representative image

Amid Trump Tariffs, EAM Jaishankar Warns Of ‘Tariff Volatility, Market Uncertainty’ In UNGA

NEW DELHI: The Union commerce ministry told a key parliamentary panel Monday that US tariffs on India’s pharma exports will have a limited impact because India largely exports “generic drugs” instead of “patented drugs” that will bear the brunt of the US decision.At a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee, a top commerce ministry official, who has been engaged with the US on trade deal negotiations, is learnt to have said that fresh US pharma tariffs are applicable to all exporters worldwide with the exception of the European Union (EU), and India’s principal rival China is also subject to the same tariff regime.“It neutralises any relative disadvantage for India,” he reportedly said.Though the agenda for the meeting was a discussion on the performance audit of “export promotion capital goods”, PAC chairman KC Venugopal and some MPs like Jagdambika Pal are said to have asked the official several questions on the US tariffs and the future scenario.The official said that while engaging with the US to work out a balanced bilateral trade agreement, India has the objective of buffering domestic sectors like agriculture and sensitive industries, and expanding exports.He highlighted that continued high tariffs are bad for the economy as they erode competitiveness and bring down export growth.Marine exports like fish face a challenging scenario as they are burdened with 50% tariffs in the United States, placing India at a relative disadvantage when compared with competitors like Ecuador, which face lower tariffs. Indian exporters will thus lose ground in the absence of a bilateral trade deal prescribing lower tariffs, he added.Stating that India is also seeking to diversify its export markets to reduce dependence on the US, he listed the FTAs signed recently, like with the European Free Trade Association, comprising Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein — which will help marine exports on account of low tariffs.He said that the FTA with the UK will be activated next year, removing 8-12% duty on marine exports to the UK.",The Union commerce ministry told a key parliamentary panel Monday that US tariffs on India’s pharma exports will have a limited impact.

Rajnath Singh Hails India’s New Stealth Frigates, Calls Them ‘F-35 On Water’ In Naval Power Push

NEW DELHI: Stressing that warfare is now measured in hours and seconds, with satellites, drones and sensors redefining the nature of conflict, defence minister Rajnath Singh Monday directed the Coast Guard to develop a futuristic road map that anticipates new challenges, adapts new strategies and integrates cutting-edge technologies.“Preparedness, adaptability and rapid response must be the cornerstones of Coast Guard’s vision,” Singh said while addressing top commanders of the maritime force.Warning that maritime threats are increasingly becoming technology-driven and multi-dimensional while cyber and electronic warfare are present-day realities, Singh said India needs to integrate AI, machine learning-based surveillance, drones, cyber defence etc into its maritime security framework to stay ahead of terrorists, criminals, pirates and adversaries.“A nation may attempt to paralyse our systems, not with missiles, but through hacking, cyber attacks and electronic jamming. Automated surveillance networks and AI-enabled systems are essential to reduce response times to seconds and ensure readiness at all times,” Singh said.Urging Coast Guard to maintain not just routine surveillance but also keep a close track on geopolitical events for readiness to respond swiftly to external developments, he said “instability” in neighbouring countries like Myanmar and Bangladesh often spills into the maritime domain, especially in the Bay of Bengal, through refugee influx, illegal migration and irregular maritime activities.Singh said any disruption in sea trade can have “cascading effects” on the security and economy alike. “We must treat national security and economic security as one and the same,” the minister said.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh Monday directed the Coast Guard to develop a futuristic road map. “Preparedness, adaptability and rapid response must be the cornerstones of Coast Guard’s vision,” Singh said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124220465,imgsize-155820,width-400,resizemode-4/rajnath-singh-holds-indian-coast-guard-commanders39-meeting.jpg"

CHANDIGARH: Pension must be treated as income while calculating compensation in motor accident cases, Punjab and Haryana HC ruled, calling it a “deferred fruit of hard work”.Justice Varinder Aggarwal raised the compensation for Manjit Kaur and her son from Rs 7.9 lakh to Rs 31 lakh, noting the tribunal wrongly ignored her late husband Dharam Singh’s two pensions totalling Rs 32,754 a month.Singh, 57, a retired Army serviceman later employed with Defence Security Corps, died in April 2018 after a car hit his bicycle in Jalandhar.“To disregard the pension while determining compensation would be to ignore both its economic reality and its social purpose,” the HC said, adding that pension is “often the sole means of sustenance and livelihood” and cannot be excluded when computing loss of dependency.","Pension must be treated as income while calculating compensation in motor accident cases, Punjab and Haryana HC ruled.

NEW DELHI: India’s cheetah reintroduction programme will notch a historic first on Monday when Mukhi, a female cub born at Kuno National Park, becomes the country’s first India-born cheetah to reach adulthood- a crucial milestone in creating a self-sustaining population.“Mukhi, a female cub born to Namibian cheetah Jwala on March 29, 2023, will reach adulthood, as it will turn 915 days or 30 months old, on Monday, ready to contribute to increasing the cheetah population in India,” Project Cheetah director Uttam Kumar Sharma told PTI.Her survival is notable. “Of the four cubs Jwala delivered, three died due to extreme heat, but Mukhi survived and has grown well. Today our efforts have yielded encouraging results,” Sharma said.Project Cheetah began on September 17, 2022, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the release of eight Namibian cheetahs into a designated enclosure at Kuno—the world’s first inter-continental relocation of a large wild carnivore. Another 12 cheetahs arrived from South Africa in February 2023.India now hosts 27 cheetahs, of which 16 were born in the country. At Kuno, 26 cubs have been born since the project began, but 19 cheetahs—nine imported adults and 10 India-born cubs—have died so far, leaving 24 animals at Kuno and three at Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary.Amid those losses, India today has seven more cheetahs than were initially imported, and Kuno’s cub survival rate stands above 61 per cent, exceeding the global average of 40 per cent.Officials call the progress a “big success” and are negotiating with African nations, including Botswana and Namibia, to bring in 8–10 more cheetahs by December to strengthen the gene pool.","Mukhi, a female cub born at Kuno National Park, will become the country’s first India-born cheetah to reach adulthood.

GURGAON: A young couple working as software engineers was found dead in their rented apartment at The Millennia in Sector 37 on Sunday evening, with police suspecting that the husband may have strangled the woman before killing himself. Ajay Kumar , originally from Prayagraj in UP and employed with an IT firm in Cyber City, and his wife Sweety Sharma — from West Bengal — got married after years of courtship in 2023.Despite their initial happiness, the relationship soon became strained, prompting the couple to live apart for a year before deciding to reunite and give their marriage another chance.According to their families, even after moving back in together, the two continued to have frequent arguments over various issues.On Sunday, Ajay sent a video message to a group of friends, declaring his intention to end his life. Alarmed, his friends quickly alerted Ajay's relatives in UP, who then contacted other family members in Delhi.The relatives rushed to the couple's Gurgaon flat, but found the door locked from inside.Police were called to the scene and the main door was broken to enter the flat. Inside, the cops discovered Sweety and Ajay's bodies in the same room.Citing preliminary investigation, the cops said Ajay may have killed Sweety by throttling her with a cloth.""In one part of the video that Ajay Kumar shared with his friends, he can be heard saying that he killed Sweety. He then reveals his plans to end his life too,"" a police official said.Sweety's mother recounted her last conversation with her daughter around Sunday noon. She said Sweety mentioned that Ajay was fixing a bookshelf and she had advised him to consult the flat owner before drilling into the wall. The call ended with Sweety promising to dial back, but she never called back.""I kept calling her — almost thirty times — but her phone was switched off. I tried Ajay as well, but he did not answer. I sensed something was wrong,"" Sweety's mother said.According to her, Ajay and Sweety had worked at the same company before marriage, but their ties had turned testy from early on. ""We took our daughter back with us when things got ugly. After a year apart, they decided to try again, but the quarrels continued even after they started working at different companies. I am certain Ajay killed my daughter,"" she alleged.Ajay's father is an electrician in Prayagraj, while Sweety's father runs a furniture business in Bengal. Deepak Gupta, Ajay's maternal cousin from Delhi, said the video message shared by Ajay mentioned his hopes for a happy family and plans for children, but also his decision to take the extreme step of killing himself.""By the time we got the call and reached the flat with police, it was too late. Ajay was always studious and an introvert. His father worked hard for his education and was proud of his achievements,"" Deepak said.The bodies were sent for an autopsy as police initiated an investigation into the circumstances leading to the deaths. The cops also recorded statements from both families but are awaiting a formal complaint from Sweety's family before proceeding further.

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus has reported another emergency call outage. This is the second time in 10 days that Optus suffered a major outage.

The report also revealed that the Australian government is looking for answers about the disruption.As per the Reuters report, Optus revealed that a faulty mobile tower site interrupted services which included access to emergency numbers. The telecom service providers has confirmed that the issue has been resolved and that “all callers who attempted to contact emergency services are OK.”""Singtel takes this matter seriously and will extend full co-operation to the Australian government and authorities to address the Optus issue,” the spokesperson told Reuters.""Optus continues to investigate the cause ... the issue has been restored,"" a spokesperson said by email.The outage comes during the growing scrutiny of Optus, Australia’s second-largest telecom operator, owned by Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel).Following the earlier 13-hour disruption on September 18, which cut off emergency services in two states and the Northern Territory, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the failures “completely unacceptable.”Singtel Group CEO Yuen Kuan Moon is scheduled to meet with Australia’s Communications Minister Anika Wells this week, alongside Optus Chairman John Arthur and CEO Stephen Rue, to address the crisis.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation.

Accenture: Building an AI workforce







Accenture has laid off more than 11,000 employees across the globe in the past three months. The company said that it is laying off employees that cannot be trained in AI, as Accenture looks to reshape its workforce for the AI era. The company confirmed that it has fired more than 11,000 employees in the past three months, even as it plans to expand headcount in the coming fiscal year.As reported by Business Insider, during the earnings call Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said that the company has been ""exiting"" employees it can't retrain with artificial intelligence skills, while simultaneously planning to expand head count in the next fiscal year. “We are exiting on a compressed timeline, people where reskilling, based on our experience, is not a viable path for the skills we need,” Accenture CEO told analysts.At the end of August, Accenture’s global headcount stood at 779,000, down from 791,000 three months earlier. The round of layoffs at Accenture began earlier this year and are expected to go on till November 2025. The restructuring at the company majorly covers severance costs and is said to save more than $1 billion for the company.Accenture CFO Angie Park said that the company will also divest two acquisitions as part of what the company calls “rapid talent rotation. ” “These actions will result in cost savings which will be reinvested in our people and our business,” Park said.While trimming roles that don’t align with its future needs, Accenture is said to be aggressively expanding its AI capabilities. The company has revealed that it has doubled down on its AI and data specialists to 77,000 since 2023 and has also trained more than 550,000 employees in generative AI. “Advanced AI is becoming a part of everything we do,” Sweet said, adding that the company views AI not as “deflationary” but “expansionary. ”Despite the layoffs, Accenture reported a 7% year‑on‑year revenue increase to $17.6 billion in the June–August quarter of fiscal 2025, beating estimates. Sweet said the results demonstrate Accenture’s “unique ability to deliver for clients as they seek our help to reinvent and lead with AI.”It is quite clear that Accenture’s restructuring mirrors the trend across companies. Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft and others have also cut down on traditional job roles along with ramping the AI hiring process. For white-collar professionals, the message is clear: adapt to AI or risk obsolescence.","Accenture has laid off more than 11,000 employees across the globe in the past three months.

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet downplayed concerns about the Trump administration's new $100,000 H-1B visa fee, stating the policy change poses minimal threat to the global consulting giant's operations. ""This is really a non-issue because we only have about 5% of our people in the US on H-1B visas, and they're for really specialised experience and skills for our clients,"" Sweet said during the company's earnings call Thursday following its fourth-quarter results announcement.The Dublin-based company's limited reliance on H-1B visas contrasts sharply with many Indian IT firms that depend heavily on the program to staff US projects with skilled workers from abroad.

A statue of Mahatma Gandhi in central London was vandalised on Monday, just days before Gandhi Jayanti celebrations.The incident took place at the monument in Tavistock Square, which depicts the Father of the Nation in a meditative seated pose. It was found defaced with disturbing graffiti.Officials from the Indian mission rushed to the site and informed local authorities. Efforts are already underway to restore the statue to its original state.The Indian High Commission in London condemned the act.“The High Commission of India in London is deeply saddened and strongly condemns the shameful act of vandalism of the statue of Mahatma Gandhi at Tavistock Square in London,” the mission said in a statement on X. It added, “This is not just vandalism, but a violent attack on the idea of non-violence, three days before the International Day of Non-Violence, and on the legacy of the Mahatma. We have taken this up strongly with local authorities for immediate action, and our team is already on site, coordinating with authorities to restore the statue to its original dignity. ”The statue was unveiled in 1968 with support from the India League. It has long been a focal point for Gandhi Jayanti commemorations in the UK. Each year on October 2, floral tributes are placed at the site, accompanied by Gandhiji’s favourite bhajans. The day also marks the International Day of Non-Violence as recognised by the United Nations.The Metropolitan Police and Camden Council said they are looking into the incident.

Argentina deal: Donald Trump admin's chat leaked,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/argentina-deal-donald-trump-admins-chat-leaked-heres-what-it-reads/articleshow/124223404.cms,"



Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accidentally leaked a sensitive national security text during last week’s United Nations General Assembly.A photograph taken by the AP’s Angelina Katsanis during last Tuesday’s United Nations General Assembly shows Bessent reading a message from someone with initials matching those of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, Daily Beast reported.The message flagged that Argentina had sold soybeans to China—despite a US trade deal requiring Buenos Aires to restrict agricultural exports to Beijing.“We bailed out Argentina yesterday (Bessent) and in return, the Argentine’s removed their export tariffs on grains, reducing their price, and sold a bunch of soybeans to China, at a time when we would normally be selling to China. Soy prices dropping further because of it. This gives China more leverage on us,” Rollins wrote.Along with Rollins’ message was a link to grain trader Ben Scholl’s criticism of Bessent for pledging that “we stand ready to do what is needed to support Argentine and the Argentine people.”“China is up to 20 cargoes of Argentine soybeans while we are busy bailing out Argentina,” Scholl wrote. “They think you are stupid.” Rollins’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the Treasury Department.Despite campaigning under the slogan “America First,” US President Donald Trump is set to provide Argentina, whose right-wing president has overseen a struggling economy, with a $20 billion lifeline. Shortly after this development last week, Argentina suspended its 26 per cent export tax to facilitate soybean sales—but to China.These actions, combined with Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports, have led China to seek soybeans elsewhere, adversely affecting many U. farmers. The American Soybean Association (ASA) has called on Trump to negotiate a deal with China on soybeans because “the farm economy is suffering.”“The U.S. has made zero sales to China in this new crop marketing year due to 20% retaliatory tariffs imposed by China in response to U.S. tariffs,” ASA President Caleb Ragland stated last week.“This has allowed other exporters, Brazil and now Argentina, to capture our market at the direct expense of U.S. farmers. The frustration is overwhelming.US soybean prices are falling, harvest is underway, and farmers read headlines not about securing a trade agreement with China, but that the U.S. government is extending $20 billion in economic support to Argentina while that country drops its soybean export taxes to sell 20 shiploads of Argentine soybeans to China in just two days.”Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican, echoed this sentiment without mentioning Trump by name. “Farmers VERY upset abt Argentina selling soybeans to China right after USA bail out … farmers need markets 2 boost farm economy,” he wrote on X last Thursday. “Why would USA help bail out Argentina while they take American soybean producers’ biggest market??? We shld use leverage at every turn to help hurting farm economy. Family farmers should be top of mind in negotiations by representatives of USA,” Grassley added in a follow-up.",Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accidentally leaked a sensitive national security text during last week’s United Nations General Assembly.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Yunus discusses SAARC revival with US envoy Gor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/yunus-discusses-saarc-revival-with-us-ambassador-designate-to-india-sergio-gor/articleshow/124078736.cms,"File photos





While it’s well known that Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived, he has now raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia.Yunus met Gor on the margins of the ongoing UNGA session in New York. According to Dhaka, the chief advisor noted that the interim government has intensified efforts to revive SAARC, which has not held a summit in over a decade.SAARC summits are held biennially but the process has remained stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. The Uri terrorist attack in 2016 put paid to the summit that Pakistan was scheduled to host that year and India has since maintained Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism has made unfeasible the SAARC dialogue, including summits and important meetings.However, India has continued to support SAARC activities in diverse sectors for closer cooperation and blamed Pakistan for blocking trade and connectivity initiatives in the region. While it hasn’t withdrawn from the Association, India has sought to strengthen regional cooperation through the BIMSTEC grouping in which Pakistan is not a member.The US readout said regional cooperation was discussed but didn’t specifically mention SAARC.Bangladesh didn’t say what Gor’s response was to Yunus’ remarks on SAARC but India will be wary of any external pressure to resume the summit process. The idea of Pakistan hosting even a virtual summit has been rendered a non-starter because of the Pahalgam terrorist attack that led to a dramatic military clash between India and Pakistan.India sees the appointment of Gor as ambassador by the Trump administration as a welcome development but will guard against any US attempt to intrude into South Asian affairs through Gor’s dual role, particularly if it has any security fallout for the region. India is already worried about security challenges that Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan might entail. It has shown little interest so far in Yunus’ efforts to, as he said earlier, revive the spirit of SAARC.While countries like Bangladesh and Nepal seek a resumption of the summit process, India maintains that there has been no material change in the situation since the 19th summit that Pakistan had to host was postponed and that there’s no consensus among members on the meeting.India closely followed a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral meeting at Kunming, taking note of reports that this was an effort to create a new bloc in the region, However, Dhaka later denied this was an effort to forge an alliance against any country.Yunus also discussed with Gor the Rohingya crisis, and the “proliferation of disinformation targeting Dhaka”. Yunus has in the past described as fake news some of the reports in Indian media about targeting of Hindus in Bangladesh .According to Dhaka, Yunus also expressed Bangladesh’s interest in joining ASEAN, stating that integration with Southeast Asian economies could significantly accelerate the country’s development. He told Gor Dhaka ismaking “comprehensive preparations” to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful general election in the first half of February.","Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived.

As the first light of Mahalaya dawns, Chelmsford, UK, gears up for its annual Durga Puja , brought to life by Sankalpo — a community organisation founded in 2020 with a pledge to celebrate Indian culture in Essex.Kicking off with a grand ‘Food Mela and Bazaar’ on Mahalaya, this year over 1,200 attendees are expected to converge at various events from Oct 3 to 5, creating a lively tapestry of cultural exchange, community spirit and well-being.“What sets our Durga Puja apart is its unwavering spirit of inclusivity. Every year, we champion a powerful cause that is current and meaningful, making our Puja a celebration with both heart and purpose,” said Arita Barua, a healthcare worker.A standout highlight this year is the innovative fashion show called “Sindoor: Threads of Resistance”, inspired by Operation Sindoor , where glamour meets purpose. Women will grace the runway in traditional Indian attire, radiant in every conceivable shade of red, embodying a new kind of bride --- one who is strong, resilient and unbowed by adversity.By their side, men will wear striking ensembles in bold black and pure white, symbolising grooms of dignity and men of honour.Together, these contrasting colours will weave a narrative of unwavering strength, solidarity and a united stand against evil be it violence, bloodshed or tyranny.In the ‘Food Mela and Bazaar’, Sankalpo aimed to spotlight local businesses and foster cross-cultural understanding. Visitors indulged in authentic Indian cuisine, shop for handcrafted goods, and engage with vendors representing diverse backgrounds, all under one roof.The three-day celebration will also feature a dedicated health and well-being hub. Attendees can avail themselves of free health checkups.“In the heart of Chelmsford, we don't just celebrate Durga Puja; we rebuild a piece of Kolkata. The familiar ache of nostalgia for our childhoods spent pandal-hopping and feasting on the streets of Bengal melts away as we see our own children find their roots in the rhythm of the dhak and the warmth of a shared bhog,” said Meghdut 'Bobby' Biswas, an entrepreneur and a core member of Sankalpo.","Chelmsford, UK, gears up for its annual Durga Puja.

UK to mandate digital IDs for workers to curb illegal migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-to-mandate-digital-ids-for-workers-to-curb-illegal-migration/articleshow/124169674.cms,"(This is a Reuters story)





LONDON: Britain on Friday said it would introduce a mandatory digital ID scheme for British citizens and residents starting a new job as a measure to deter illegal immigration.""It will make it tougher to work illegally, making our borders more secure,"" PM Keir Starmer said in a statement announcing the move, which had been previously reported. Polling shows immigration is top of voters' concerns in Britain, with Starmer under intense pressure to stop migrants entering the country illegally. The plans, which govt had previously said it was considering, drew criticism from opponents who say it would not deter migrants and could infringe on civil liberties.""It's laughable that those already breaking immigration law will suddenly comply, or digital IDs will have any impact on illegal work, which thrives on cash-in-hand payments,"" said a spokesperson for Nigel Farage's Reform UK Party, which leads opinion polls ahead of an election not due until 2029. Govt said the ID would be held on people's mobile phones and would become a mandatory part of checks that employers already have to make when hiring a worker by end of current parliament in 2029. It would, in time, also be used to provide access to other services.","Britain to introduce a mandatory digital ID scheme for British citizens and residents starting a new job.

What’s next?







UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents, aiming to curb illegal immigration and simplify access to government services, according to an official statement. .The government said the new digital ID, which will be stored on users’ smartphones, will streamline applications for services such as driving licences, childcare, welfare, and tax records. While individuals will not be required to carry or present the ID routinely, it will be “mandatory as a means of proving your right to work,” the statement added.Starmer explained the move will help prevent those without legal status from securing employment, thereby cutting off a key incentive for illegal migration. “This will stop those with no right to be here from being able to find work, curbing their prospect of earning money, one of the key 'pull factors' for people who come to the UK illegally,” the government said.Here is what you need to know about the government’s digital ID initiative:The new digital ID will be an app or digital credential stored on individuals’ smartphones. It will serve as a secure, government-backed proof of identity to access a range of services - from applying for driving licences and childcare benefits to accessing welfare and tax records.While the ID will not be compulsory to carry or show routinely, it will be mandatory to prove the right to work in the UK. This aims to prevent employers from hiring workers who lack legal permission to work, thereby reducing illegal employment.Starmer described the digital ID as an “enormous opportunity for the UK” and said it will provide “countless benefits” to ordinary citizens while helping the government enforce immigration laws more effectively.The digital ID will be available to all UK nationals and legal residents, including foreign nationals living in the country. The government emphasised inclusivity, pledging that the system will accommodate those without smartphones, such as the elderly or homeless.Details on the application process will be shaped by a forthcoming public consultation planned for later this year. The government has promised to engage with groups who might face challenges using digital services, ensuring the system is user-friendly and accessible to all.The UK has traditionally resisted introducing national ID cards, with the Conservative government scrapping a previous voluntary identity card system in 2011 established under Tony Blair’s administration. However, the current government views digital ID as a modern solution to immigration and public service access challenges.Illegal immigration remains a politically sensitive issue, and Starmer faces pressure from within his own Labour Party to address it effectively ahead of the party’s annual conference.Opposition voices have been critical. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said on social media that her party would “oppose any push… to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens,” stressing that British people should not be forced into such a system.The Liberal Democrats also rejected the plan, arguing they ""cannot support a mandatory digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives.""Nigel Farage, leader of the hard-right Reform UK party - which polls predict could play a key role in the next government - voiced strong opposition, saying, ""I do not see a single benefit to the government having digital ID other than them controlling what we do, what we spend and where we go.""At present, UK citizens rely on passports, driving licences, and utility bills as forms of identification, depending on the situation. The digital ID aims to unify these disparate proofs into a single, streamlined digital identity.The government will soon launch a public consultation to gather feedback on the digital ID service, including from digitally excluded groups. Officials highlighted that lessons will be drawn from other countries with similar systems to ensure accessibility and privacy protections.(With inputs from agencies)","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents.

TOI Correspondent from London:





Indian biker from Navi Mumbai Yogesh Alekari, whose Adventure motorbike was stolen in Nottingham while he was on a solo round-the-world trip, can now resume his global expedition after a UK motorbike dealer donated a 2020 KTM 790 Adventure to him.“It’s a more powerful bike. It’s overwhelming. British bikers have helped me beyond my imagination. I really appreciate that. This is the actual bikers’ brotherhood,” he said. But he is not sure if he will be able to take the new bike into India as he will have to pay 100% tariff on it. “I wouldn’t have needed to pay this if on then original bike. I request the Indian govt to waive the customs duty. When I reach Kenya I will decide what to do. ”Alekari (33), who runs a small travel company and is a part-time vlogger, was on his second round-the-world trip, covering 50 countries from India to Africa, and had crossed 17 countries on his KTM 390 Adventure motorbike when he was stranded in Britain on Aug 28. The bike and all his belongings were worth £15,000.He found his MacBook as it was thrown out and handed to police.“I was expecting things to go wrong in Africa, but it turned out to be in UK.London and the UK are not secure. I got tremendous support from the British people but still you can’t leave a bike 10 mins away in the UK. I met so many people who said their car had been stolen. UK is the best land for the biker community but police is not that active for theft scenario (sic),” he told TOI.After news of the theft was widely circulated, motorbike dealership The Off Road Centre in Mansfield gifted him an upgraded model not available in India and worth £5,000. It had one previous owner.Alekari said: “Police are cooperating with me now but it has been one month and they still have not recovered the bike. If this had happened in India, Mumbai police would have got it back within 24 hours.”Other businesses have also donated items to him, including camping gear, a Mosko Moto tank bag and tail bag, and a Leatt jacket and boots.The puja of the new motorbike took place at Bhagwati Shakti Peeth temple in Nottingham.He is now back in Mumbai getting new visas for his blank passport – which the Indian high commission in London issued – and a new international driving licence and new debit and credit cards. Then he will return to the UK to resume his journey to Ireland, Europe and Africa. He has 30 countries and 35,000 km to go.An 18-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle in Doncaster on Sept 8. He has since been released on police bail and no further arrests have taken place.Benjamin Ledwidge, managing director of Off Road Centre, said: “We have gifted the bike to him as his main worry was that it was a loan as there were quite a few countries he couldn’t cross if the bike was not in his name. This happened on our doorstep so we wanted to show him there was also good here and make him want to come back.”",Yogesh Alekari's Adventure motorbike was stolen in Nottingham while he was on a solo round-the-world trip.

US H-1B order: UK mulls free visas; Starmer explores 'global talent' reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/us-h-1b-order-uk-mulls-free-visas-starmer-explores-global-talent-reforms/articleshow/124043948.cms,"US hikes H-1B fee while UK considers to make visa 'zero cost' for global talent

Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive'

Global talent visa



MAGA chief’s $100,000 hike shakes H-1B dream







Britain is weighing plans to scrap visa fees for the world’s best scientists, academics and digital experts, reports Financial Times.The move is aimed at boosting growth and positioning the UK as a magnet for global talent.The debate comes just as the United States under Donald Trump has raised the fee for an H-1B visa to $100,000.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has set up a “global talent task force” to explore reforms, with officials in Number 10, the PM's office at Downing Street, and the Treasury discussing options to make it easier and cheaper for high-level professionals to settle in the country. One proposal is to abolish visa charges for people with exceptional achievements.“We’re talking about the sort of people who have attended the world’s top five universities or have won prestigious prizes,” one official was quoted as saying to the Financial Times. “We’re kicking around the idea of cutting costs to zero,"" they added.The task force is chaired by Starmer’s business adviser Varun Chandra and science minister Lord Patrick Vallance. The Home Office is not yet formally engaged in the talks, but officials said all immigration routes are kept under review.A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our global talent routes attract and retain high-skilled talent, particularly in science, research and technology, to maintain the UK’s status as a leading international hub for emerging talent and innovation.”The global talent visa was introduced in 2020, and costs £766 per applicant, with partners and children charged the same fee. An annual health surcharge of £1,035 applies to each person. The visa is aimed at people recognised as leaders or future leaders in science, engineering, medicine, humanities, digital technology, or arts and culture. In the year ending June 2023, the number of visas granted rose by 76 per cent to 3,901, reports Financial Times.Chancellor Rachel Reeves is also looking at the tax system to spot barriers that might stop highly skilled people from moving to Britain. Her recent changes to the non-dom tax regime (The non-dom tax system refers to the special tax status in UK for people who live in Britain but are officially considered “non-domiciled”) raised fears that many wealthy individuals would leave. She is now reviewing inheritance tax rules for non-doms before the autumn Budget.Universities have welcomed the review but urged more support. Jamie Arrowsmith, director of Universities UK International, said the government’s £50 million Global Talent Fund was “relatively modest” and added: “Ultimately to attract global talent we need to be able to offer funding and autonomy and make the transition as smooth as possible.”US President Donald Trump shocked the tech industry on Friday when he announced a massive rise in the cost of H-1B visas, hiking the fee to $100,000. The H-1B programme has long been the main route for skilled foreign workers, especially Indians, to take up jobs in America’s technology, research, and healthcare sectors. Indians make up more than 70% of H-1B holders, many of them working in Silicon Valley companies, hospitals, and universities.Immigration policy analyst Gil Guerra said the change is more likely to cause medium- and long-term labour shortages in the US. David Bier of the Cato Institute warned it would deal a “devastating blow” to American innovation and competitiveness.","UK PM Sir Keir Starmer has set up a ‘global talent task force’ to explore reforms.
