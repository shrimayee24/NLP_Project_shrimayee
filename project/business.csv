Yes – They drive accountability and productivity No – They increase pressure and reduce flexibility





BENGALURU: TCS's updated associate deployment policy mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually, restricting their bench time to a maximum of 35 business days each year. The policy aims to foster a proactive approach towards associate allocation, ensuring both organisational and individual goals are met.""At any given point in time, associates must be allocated for a minimum period of 225 business days in the last 12 months,"" the document reviewed by TOI showed. ""Long periods of remaining unallocated shall adversely impact associate compensation, career growth, avenues of overseas deployment in future, and continuity of employment with the organisation,"" it said. The new policy, which came into effect on June 12, was laid out by Chandrasekaran Ramkumar, global head of The Resource Management Group (RMG).RMG at TCS oversees workforce deployment, ensuring the right talent with the right skills is assigned to projects. This team focuses on maximising organisational utilisation by making sure every associate is optimally engaged and allocated to projects at all times.""In the event an associate is unallocated, it is the primary responsibility of the associate to proactively engage with the Unit / Regional RMG for seeking allocation and take initiative towards pursuing suitable opportunities provided by the organisation,"" the policy said.All associates who are released to RMG, available for the next assignment, and reporting to RMG are unallocated resources.TCS provides opportunities through platforms like iEvolve, Fresco Play, VLS, and LinkedIn. While unallocated, associates are expected to spend 4-6 hours daily on relevant learning via iEvolve, complete all mandatory and prioritised training, attend in-person sessions as recommended by RMG, and actively upskill to stay interview-ready. They should also use the Gen AI interview coach, review and address feedback from past interviews, and complete all training programmes on time with full attendance.To facilitate swift deployment, TCS has called out that physical presence in the office is mandatory. As a result, WFO exceptions and flexible work arrangements are generally not applicable. ""However, associates may request short-term flexible work options for personal emergencies in exceptional circumstances, subject to organisational policies and prior approval from the RMG.""TCS has stated that frequent short-term allocations to multiple projects are discouraged and may lead to HR investigations and appropriate disciplinary measures. An email sent to TCS on the policy didn't elicit a response till the time of going to the press.","TCS's updated associate deployment policy mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually.

Ahmedabad Plane Crash: Lucky seven who never boarded the ill-fated Air India Flight 171,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-plane-crash-gut-feeling-gridlock-a-moms-plea-how-fate-stopped-7-from-taking-ai-171/articleshow/121854778.cms,"Air India Crash Probe Focuses On Engine, Flaps And Gear As Boeing 787 Fleet Faces Safety Checks





AHMEDABAD: Sometimes, destiny doesn't announce its warnings aloud. It just intervenes through mundane ways: a mother's emotional plea, traffic that refuses to clear or just a gut feeling that something isn't quite right.For seven passengers meant to board Air India Flight 171 on June 12, these subtle interventions became the difference between life and death.Yaman Vyas had his return journey to London all planned. The warehouse worker, who holds a UK work permit, was wrapping up a visit to his family in Vadodara after two years abroad. His bags were packed, documents ready and he was not expecting to return to India for at least another year.But as he prepared to seek his parents' blessings before departure, his mother was overcome with emotion. The thought of another lengthy separation seemed unbearable. ""Thhoda divas rokai jaa ne, beta (Just stay back for a few more days, son),"" she pleaded, her voice heavy with affection.His father supported her request. Overwhelmed by his mother's plea, he simply cancelled his flight, no questions asked. ""Later that afternoon, when messages about the crash started flooding my mobile, I realised how my mother's instinct had saved my life.""For Jaimin Patel, 29, and Priya Patel, 25, from Chandlodia in Ahmedabad, the journey to London was meant to be a happy reunion. Their friend Rohit Yadav had invited them for holidays, and they arrived at the airport with visitor visas, all excited about the trip.At the check-in counter, however, their plans hit a hurdle. The Air India staff informed them that queries had been raised regarding their documentation, which required resolution before boarding passes could be issued.Jaimin and Priya Patel told the staff that it was impossible to resolve the matter at such short notice and begged to be allowed on the flight. But the staff remained firm, saying they cannot violate the protocol.After waiting at the airport for an hour in mounting frustration, Jaimin and Priya returned home disappointed. ""About an hour later, one of my friends called and just said, ‘Switch on the TV right now!' When I saw the news, I was shocked,"" Jaimin said. ""The flight had crashed. I have never been so grateful to God. I thank the Air India staff for putting their foot down and not letting us board the plane.""Sometimes the heart knows what the mind cannot comprehend. That is exactly what Savji Timbadia, a Nikol resident, experienced. Everything had been arranged for his trip to London, where his son lives and works. He had seat 1-A reserved on AI 171. But early on Thursday morning, Timbadia made an unexpected call to his son, which puzzled both.""I told my son I did not feel like flying and would postpone my departure until Monday. When he asked about the sudden change of plan, I could only describe a feeling of mental unease. It was not something I could explain.""That afternoon, a friend sent him a message asking him to watch the news on TV. ""I got the answer to what made me feel uneasy,"" he said. ""Lord Swaminarayan saved my life.""Another passenger, who had a similarly lucky escape, was Bhoomi Chauhan. She had every reason to curse Ahmedabad's notorious traffic congestion enroute to the airport. The Bharuch native was to return to her husband in London after her vacation. Taking detours and navigating through traffic jams, when she reached the airport at 12.20pm, she was told that the boarding gates had closed at 12.10pm.""I pleaded with the staff to let me board the flight, but to no avail,"" she said. Angry and disappointed, she was returning to Bharuch when she learned about the crash. ""I was shocked and also grateful to the divine for saving me,"" she said. ""I was leaving my son in India. This was nothing but Ganpati Bappa's miracle.""Jayesh Thakkar from Vadodara has business obligations to thank for saving his life. The organizer of one of the biggest garba events in Vadodara, Thakkar was scheduled to be on that ill-fated flight but got delayed in Kolkata due to work.""I was delayed in Kolkata due to work and realized I would not make it to Ahmedabad in time for the flight. That is when I decided to change my itinerary,"" Thakkar said.Similarly, Ravji Patel decided against flying that day with his son-in-law Arjun Patoliya as he had work to be completed. Arjun was going back to his daughters in London after the post-death rituals of his wife, Bharti, whom he lost to cancer in May.""He insisted that I go with him and meet my granddaughters, aged 8 and 4. But I had some work to do and told him that I will fly down after a fortnight. He agreed to book the tickets for me,"" Ravji Patel said, still reeling under the shock of losing two loved ones in 20 days.","Yaman Vyas had his return journey to London all planned.

NEW DELHI: PM Modi strongly raised the issue of terrorism in his G7 outreach session address, describing the Pahalgam attack as an assault on all humanity and slamming double standards in the fight against terror. Without naming Pakistan, he said India's neighbourhood had become a breeding ground for terrorism.Modi raised several questions about the international approach to terrorism, saying that while sanctions were being imposed based on personal preferences, nations that openly supported terrorism continued to be rewarded.""Are we truly serious about addressing terrorism? Will we understand the true meaning of terrorism only when it knocks on our own doors? Can those who spread terror and those who suffer from it be weighed on the same scale? Are our global institutions at risk of losing their credibility?"" he asked, while also talking about the impact of ongoing conflicts on the Global South.The PM said turning a blind eye towards terrorism for the sake of vested interests, or extending support to terror or terrorists, was a betrayal of all humanity.If we don't take decisive action today against this terrorism that stands against humanity, history will never forgive us,"" the PM said.Modi also said the terrorist attack that took place on April 22 was not just an assault on Pahalgam but a direct attack on the soul, identity and dignity of every Indian.It was an assault on all humanity, he said.""Terrorism is the enemy of humanity. It stands in opposition to all nations that uphold democratic values. Unity in fight against terrorism is imperative. Unfortunately, our own neighbourhood has become a breeding ground for terrorism. For the sake of global peace, our thinking and our policies must be extremely clear - any country that supports terrorism must be held accountable and made to pay the price,"" the PM said.Modi also said the countries of the Global South were having to bear the maximum impact of uncertainty and conflicts. No matter where the tension was in the world, he said, these countries were the first to be affected by food, fuel, fertiliser and financial crises.""India considers it its responsibility to bring the priorities and concerns of the Global South to the world stage. We believe as long as double standards persist in any form, sustainable and inclusive development of humanity shall remain out of reach,"" Modi said.","PM Modi slams double standards in the fight against terror.

Canada's British Columbia premier David Eby said that he will request Prime Minister Mark Carney to declare the Lawrence Bishnoi gang a ""terrorist organisation"" in the country, adding that it had been linked to many crimes.On Tuesday, the premier said he will write to Carney about it ""to enable police to be able to use the necessary tools to investigate.""He alleged that the gang had been linked to extortion and other crimes against South Asian community members in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario.Canada's police had earlier reported that South Asian community members are being extorted under threat of violence or death.

""We don't make this recommendation lightly, but this activity strikes at public confidence in the justice system, in our democracy.""As Eby stressed his demand, Balpreet Singh from World Sikh Organisation said he supports his request.""Extortions are at an all-time high here in Canada. That members of the Sikh community and now others as well are being extorted for money, and their houses are being shot up, and there are threats against their lives,"" said Singh.Meanwhile, Elenore Sturko, B C Opposition public safety critic, opposed Eby's demand, saying that other issues need addressing.Sturko asserted that she is unaware that police ""definitively"" linked Bishnoi gang to extortion cases, further questioning the timing of Eby's comment.""The police haven't come out and told my community that this gang is responsible for these incidents,"" she said. ""This is a very dramatic and headline-grabbing thing that the premier's done today, but I hope it doesn't distract from the fact that there are other issues at play here that need addressing,"" she added.This comes amid PM Modi's visit to Canada after a period of friction between New Delhi and Ottawa. The tension between the two countries escalated after Canada alleged that Indian agents were involved in the killing of NIA-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside a gurdwara in Canada in 2023.Earlier on Tuesday, PM Modi arrived at the Pomeroy Kananaskis Mountain Lodge in Canada, where he received a warm welcome from Canadian PM Mark Carney.He later held a bilateral meeting with Carney on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Kananaskis, Canada.

Delete WhatsApp from your smartphones ..., so goes the new advisory from the Iran government to people across the country. According to a report by news agency AP, Iranian State television has urged people to remove WhatsApp from their smartphones. The advisory claims that the Meta-owned messaging app gathers user information to send to Israel. Iran had blocked access to various social media platforms over the years. However, many people in the country use proxies and virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access them. Iran banned WhatsApp and Google Play in 2022 during mass protests against the government over the death of a woman held by the country’s morality police.Iran lifted the ban on WhatsApp in 2024 only. Over the years, WhatsApp has been one of Iran’s most popular messaging apps besides Instagram and Telegram.WhatsApp expressed concern over the advisory saying that it is an attempt to ban the app. In a statement, WhatsApp said that it was “concerned these false reports will be an excuse for our services to be blocked at a time when people need them the most.” It further added, “We do not track your precise location, we don’t keep logs of who everyone is messaging and we do not track the personal messages people are sending one another,” it added. “We do not provide bulk information to any government.”It added that WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption, this means that no one other than the sender and recipient can read a message. In layman terms, end-to-end encryption means that messages are scrambled so that only the sender and recipient can see them. If anyone else intercepts the message, all they will see is a garble that can’t be unscrambled without the key.WhatsApp is owned by Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.",Iranian State television has urged people to remove WhatsApp from their smartphones.

Serving as a model for lean, engineering-focused innovation.

In a historic milestone in commercial space travel, SpaceX concluded its 500th mission with the Falcon family of rockets. The occasion was celebrated with the launch of 26 Starlink satellites from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base at 9:54 p.m. EDT on June 12, 2025. The mission not only represents technological excellence and reliability but also accentuates the transformation of a company that started its journey a little over a decade ago in a small garage.While the world witnessed Falcon rocket B1081 mark its 15th flight and come back successfully to a droneship off the coast of Southern California, the space community celebrated not just a launch, it was remembering SpaceX's evolution into a world leader in reusable space technology. With more than 7,600 satellites orbiting Earth and a frenetic mission cadence, SpaceX is redefining the playbook for space access, connectivity, and sustainability.As the aerospace community basked in the glow of the 500th Falcon mission, SpaceX founder Elon Musk commemorated the event with a nostalgic post on X. Posting a photo taken in 2006 of himself amidst early rocket parts in a humble garage, Musk captioned the photo:The photo was originally shot by Hans Koenigsmann, one of the original engineers at SpaceX, who posted:This photo was a powerful reminder of the company's humble roots. From a spare, garage-dwelling group of engineers pursuing the vision of space accessibility at a reasonable price, the company has grown into a company that has launched more space missions per year than any previous company in history.The June 12 launch was one of the regular missions for SpaceX's continuous Starlink program, an international satellite broadband internet initiative to provide high-speed broadband connectivity to remote and underserved communities across the globe. The 26 satellites launched on this mission contributed to the constellation of more than 7,600 satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), further cementing Starlink's status as the largest satellite network ever constructed.Within an hour of the release, SpaceX verified successful deployment of the satellites. A congratulatory tweet from the company's official X (formerly Twitter) handle read:The 500-mission milestone demonstrates not just operational effectiveness, but also the scalability and reliability of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, which are the backbone of SpaceX's fleet.One of the main features of the mission was the utilization of Falcon 9 booster B1081, which flew for the 15th time. Having lofted the satellites to orbit, the booster successfully landed on autonomous droneship Of Course I Still Love You deployed in the Pacific Ocean.This recovery keeps SpaceX's high booster reuse rate trend going. While B1081's 15 flights are impressive, the single Falcon 9 booster flight record is currently 28, a record Musk will break in the near term. The company has consistently demonstrated the viability of its reusable approach, with reused boosters becoming a standard part of almost every launch.To date in 2025, SpaceX has launched 72 Falcon 9s, with 54 aimed at building out Starlink. Numerous satellites contain direct-to-cell functionality, enabling cell phones to get messages and limited internet services even without standard cellular systems.The path to 500 Falcon missions has not been without a few setbacks. SpaceX experienced several launch failures in its early life, including the first three failed Falcon 1 launches between 2006-2008. Success on the fourth Falcon 1 mission preserved the company from financial ruin.SpaceX has changed very quickly since then:With a mix of both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy missions, SpaceX has attained a mission cadence superior to national space agencies and private rivals alike.At the heart of SpaceX's success is its groundbreaking emphasis on reusability. Expendable, single-use rockets were the norm previously, making access to space expensive. By being able to recover and reuse Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy boosters, and fairings, SpaceX has reduced the cost of launch and boosted turnaround speed.The price of a Falcon 9 launch is estimated at less than $30 million much less than in the past launch vendors. This reduced cost facilitates high-frequency missions, deployment flexibility, and increased access to space-based services by governments and corporations.With more than 7,600 active satellites and growing, Starlink is a major player in the international internet scene. It is currently operational in over 70 nations with further rollout planned across the globe in 2025.Notably, new releases have also had direct-to-cell features, enabling certain smartphones to access satellites to provide fundamental services such as text messages and emergency notifications, perfect for far-flung regions and areas struck by disaster. SpaceX has teamed up with carriers in the United States such as T-Mobile, Australia's Optus, and Canada's Rogers for these types of services, essentially making itself a complementary telecom player. This shift could reshape traditional telecom models, especially in underserved rural and remote markets. As coverage expands, Starlink may become a global safety net for connectivity in times of crisis.As the Falcon family sets records, SpaceX is already looking toward the next frontier. The Starship program dedicated to deep space travel, lunar landing, and eventual colonization of Mars is the next chapter in SpaceX's quest.Starship-Super Heavy, the completely reusable system, successfully tested an orbital back in 2025, and the subsequent key test flight should happen later this year. Starship has been chosen by NASA to fly on its Artemis III mission returning humans to the Moon, solidifying SpaceX's position in future human space travel.In the meantime, the Falcon program remains the backbone of global launches, particularly for Starlink growth, commercial payloads, and crew flights to the International Space Station (ISS).SpaceX's 500th Falcon mission marks more than company success. It marks a disruption of the conventional aerospace model, compelling legacy participants such as Arianespace, ULA, and Roscosmos to evolve or be left behind. The company's reach now touches on:","Elon Musk posts throwback to SpaceX’s garage days after the 500th Falcon rocket launch.

Billionaire investor and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has rejected the concept of work-life balance for ambitious professionals, arguing that true success requires round-the-clock dedication and sacrifice.""There is no balance,"" Cuban told Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons during a recent episode of Sports Illustrated's ""The Playbook"" series. ""People are like, 'I need a work-life balance.' If you want to work 9-to-5, you can have work-life balance. If you want to crush the game, whatever game you're in, there's somebody working 24 hours a day to kick your ass.""The former Shark Tank investor, worth $5.7 billion according to Forbes, practiced what he preaches during his early entrepreneurial years. Cuban revealed he ""didn't take a vacation for the next seven years"" after launching his first technology company, MicroSolutions , at age 24.""I was broke as f-ck, where else was I going to go?"" Cuban explained, describing his living situation at the time as sharing a ""nasty"" three-bedroom apartment with five roommates.The intense focus proved profitable. During those seven vacation-free years, MicroSolutions grew to over $30 million in annual sales before Cuban sold the company to H&R Block for $6 million.""If I took the weekend, the whole thing could fall into the sh-tter,"" Cuban said, explaining his decision to work every day without breaks.Cuban's philosophy extends to modern workers, particularly in the AI era. ""If I was 16, 18, 20, 21 starting today, I would spend every waking minute learning about AI,"" he said at SXSW earlier this year. ""Even if I am sleeping, I am listening to podcasts talking about AI.""When Parsons expressed his desire to work ""non-stop,"" Cuban responded supportively: ""That's not a sacrifice. That's doing you. Not doing it would be a sacrifice.""His message remains consistent across platforms, including through his AI chatbot launched with MasterClass: ""Work your ass off, learn everything you can, and stay adaptable.""","Billionaire investor and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has rejected the concept of work-life balance for ambitious professionals.

NEW DELHI: India has recorded its strongest presence yet in the QS World University Rankings 2026, with 54 institutions making it to the list - a significant jump from 46 in 2025 and 45 in 2024. This 390% increase from just 11 ranked universities in 2014 makes India the fastest-growing higher education system among G20 countries and the fourth most represented nation in the rankings, behind only the US, UK, and China.At the top of the Indian pack is Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, which climbed to a joint 123rd position (alongside Georgia Institute of Technology, US) - its best-ever showing. In 2025 and 2024, the institute stood at 150 and 197, respectively. This steady rise is backed by strong scores in Employer Reputation (50th globally), Citations per Faculty (86th), and Academic Reputation (142nd), highlighting its growing stature.While IIT Bombay slipped to 129th this year from its all-time best rank of 118 in 2025, it remains in the global top 130 and continues to score highly on Employer Reputation, ranking 39th in that indicator. IIT Madras recorded one of the most dramatic improvements in 2026 - leaping 47 places to reach the 180th spot.This is the first time it has entered the global top 200.Other top-performing Indian institutions include IIT Kharagpur (215), IISc Bangalore (219), and IIT Kanpur (222). Among non-IITs, Delhi University (328) and Anna University (465) featured in the top 500. The inclusion of eight new Indian universities in the 2026 edition - more than any other country - signals a broader institutional momentum. However, India's rise has been uneven. Despite improvements in research strength and academic reputation, challenges remain in areas critical to internationalisation. The International Students Ratio remains a key concern, with 78% of Indian universities seeing a decline in this indicator. No Indian institution ranks in the top 500 for attracting international students, which affects diversity and global exposure on campuses.Similarly, the Faculty-Student Ratio presents a structural bottleneck. OP Jindal Global University is the only Indian university in the global top 350 for this metric.Moreover, as against 12 Indian universities in top 500 in 2025, there's one less in the latest rankings.Globally, Massachusetts Institute of Technology topped the rankings for the 14th straight year, followed by Imperial College London (2nd), Stanford University (3rd), University of Oxford (4th), & Harvard University (5th).",India has recorded its strongest presence yet in the QS World University Rankings 2026. 54 institutions made it to the list - a significant jump from 46 in 2025 and 45 in 2024.

MUMBAI: Captain Sumeet Sabharwal's mortal remains arrived at his residence in Powai's Jal Vayu Vihar at 8:45 on Tuesday morning. A hush fell over the housing complex, with Air India crew, fellow aviators, and family and friends filing in quietly.Residents of the locality gathered in clusters—some in grief, others in disbelief—outside the building where Capt Sabharwal (56) lived, the compound echoing with stories of the man they called ""a thorough gentleman."" From pilots who flew beside him to the crew that flew with him, neighbours who knew him simply as the kind man with a calm smile, all stood still in the moment.""I can't tell you what a thorough gentleman he was,"" said Usha Talawdekar, a resident of Powai Park. A retired Air India cabin crew member who served 37 years in the skies, she paused to compose herself outside the gates of Jal Vayu Vihar. ""I've flown with him. Every request he made came suffixed with, ‘whenever you get the time'. No ego. Never demanded respect. We all just loved him. And he was an ace pilot."" Her eyes welled up again. ""Too early for him to go,"" she said, wiping her tears away. ""Air India pilots are the best. They always know what they're doing.""On June 12, Captain Sumeet Sabharwal's final flight—AI171 from Ahmedabad to London—crashed seconds into the take-off. As the coffin was brought into Jal Vayu Vihar, his 92-year-old father, a former DGCA official, Pushkaraj Sabharwal—a widower—stood silently, flanked by his daughter, her sons, other family members, neighbours, and several pilots and cabin crew. Residents carried the coffin to the building's temple and offered their final prayers.Savitri Budhania, an elderly resident, said, ""It was just Saturday,"" she said, pointing to the path where he last walked. ""He took prasad from my hands right there."" Her voice broke. ""I told him, ‘Your father is too old to be alone.' And he said, ‘Just one or two more flights… then I'm going to just be with Papa.'"" She added softly, ""Who knew this was going to be it. Whenever he wasn't flying, you'd find him walking hand in hand with his father in the evenings. They would smile at everyone, just wonderful quiet people."" The Sabharwals lived in Jal Vayu Vihar for 22 years.Those from the aviation sector hoped that the details of what caused the crash are released soon. ""We hope the report is accurate and acted upon so that no such tragedy takes place again. We have lost too many lives,"" said retired Captain S Krishnamurthy of the Indian Air Force, who lived three floors above Sabharwal.Meanwhile in Goregaon, the remains of senior cabin officer Aparna Mahadik arrived at Oberoi Esquire apartment around 9pm. Senior NCP leader Sunil Tatkare and his daughter Aditi, close relatives of the Mahadiks, led the mourners.Over in Navi Mumbai, air hostess Maithili Patil (23) was cremated in Nhava village. Her parents performed the rituals without opening the coffin given that her remains were charred. Her younger sister was inconsolable and sobbed as she embraced her coffin.

AHMEDABAD: A doctor's emotional plea for time to vacate the crash-damaged quarters near BJ Medical College struck a chord online early Saturday. The video showed Anil Panwar, a cardiac anaesthetist at UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre (UNMICRC), describing the difficulty of relocating while tending to an unwell child.Even as the appeal garnered widespread concern and sympathy, Dr Panwar posted a second video, clarifying that his earlier remarks were made in a moment of stress and that his family had, in fact, been provided accommodation. BJMC authorities, meanwhile, confirmed that all junior doctors and faculty members who were displaced have been allotted new accommodation.The initial video, filmed on Friday night near the residential quarters, showed Dr Panwar standing among packed belongings, his voice trembling as he spoke of the urgency and pressure to vacate. He said the administration had asked them to vacate the quarters immediately as they planned to demolish parts of the buildings as part of the relief and rescue work.""Are we not humans? Can't you give us 2-3 days? We need some basic goods to run the house. Several of our doctors are admitted (to the hospital for treatment). We are troubled... Understand that it is not easy to clear a house overnight,"" said Dr Panwar, who was covered in soot from attempting to shift his belongings.He was on duty when the tragedy took place.""I pray to you with folded hands that give us 2-3 days' time. My child is admitted, and I should be with her. Instead, I am here (at the site, clearing belongings). Convey my message to the higher-ups as I am helpless. I am not from Gujarat, and I need some time to shift,"" he said. His wife, Dr Chanchal Bhandari, also a cardiac anaesthetist, had grabbed attention a day ago when news broke out of how her heroism and her nanny's presence of mind helped them save her two-year-old daughter's life after the ill-fated plane crashed onto the hostel buildings.The appeal, shared widely across social media platforms, drew empathy and concern from citizens and medical professionals alike, many of whom highlighted the psychological and physical toll the crash had taken on healthcare workers already coping with long shifts and trauma.However, by Saturday afternoon, Dr Panwar issued a second statement. In a video message, he said that the earlier remarks were made in a moment of stress and confusion, and that he had not been aware that his wife — also a doctor — had already been allotted temporary housing by hospital authorities ""I was mentally disturbed and didn't know what I was saying,"" he said. ""Volunteers helped us shift our belongings. I again thank the hospital and government authorities,"" he said in the video.The clarification came as the BJ Medical College administration announced that a total of 159 accommodations had been arranged for residents from the damaged hostels and staff quarters.Dr Minakshi Parikh, dean of BJMC, said that 100 students from Atulyam 2 and 3 had been moved to the GCRI Old Block and Digvijaya Lions Hostel. Another 38 residents from Atulyam 1 were relocated to PG Hostel wings ON MediCity campus, the Mithila quarters, and the UN Mehta hostel. Twenty-one residents from Atulyam 4 were shifted to the Dental College quarters and Mithila 2 quarters. ""All affected students and residents have been shifted to new accommodations as of Saturday,"" she confirmed.Some junior doctors, speaking anonymously, acknowledged that the shifting process was not without hurdles as the relief and rescue work was going on all around. ""Almost all of us were reporting to duty due to the scale of the catastrophe. But one can understand that the authorities are also pressed on multiple fronts. The seniors and staffers also helped us, and almost all have now been shifted to new accommodations,"" said a doctor.

An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner carrying 242 people crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad airport on June 12, killing 241 on board and dozens on the ground. Among the uproar, a tweet from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk has resurfaced, in which he criticized Boeing’s management structure. In his post, Elon Musk said: “Although Boeing got $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX only got $2.6 billion, SpaceX finished 4 years sooner. Note, the crew capsule design of Dragon 2 has almost nothing in common with Dragon 1. Too many non‑technical managers at Boeing.”Musk’s post then highlighted Boeing’s $4.2 billion investment in the Starliner spacecraft, contrasting it with SpaceX’s (owned by Elon Musk) $2.6 billion for the Dragon 2, which completed four years earlier despite a near-complete redesign. His post hinted at inefficiencies in Boeing’s management structure as also reported in a 2023 NASA audit on commercial crew program cost overruns.In the aftermath of the deadly crash, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has directed all Boeing Dreamliner 787/9 fleet of Air India equipped with Genx engines to undergo additional maintenance and safety checks with immediate effect in coordination with the concerned regional DGCA offices.

What Anthropic CEO said on AI

Anthropic on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's statement

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Amodei, in a recent Axios interview, had warned that AI could disrupt half of entry-level office roles and urged policymakers to prepare for economic impacts. Huang countered that while AI will transform jobs, it will also create new opportunities, citing increased productivity as a driver for hiring. “Some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs are going to be created,” he said.In response, an Anthropic spokesperson clarified to Fortune that Amodei has never claimed only Anthropic should build AI. “Dario has advocated for a national transparency standard for AI developers … so the public and policymakers are aware of the models’ capabilities and risks,” the statement read. The spokesperson reaffirmed Amodei’s concerns about AI’s economic impact and his commitment to addressing them.Anthropic, founded in 2021 by Amodei and other ex-OpenAI researchers, prioritizes safety in AI development, a focus rooted in the founders’ reported concerns over OpenAI’s direction. The public clash between Huang and Amodei highlights ongoing debates in the AI industry about its societal and economic implications.","Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris.

Elon Musk’s social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) has filed a lawsuit against the state of New York. The lawsuit filed by X challenges a new state law which mandates social media platforms to implement clearer content moderation policies. X argues that the New York State law infringes upon its First Amendment rights to free speech. The new law requires the social media platforms to disclose how they monitor and moderate misinformation, hate speech and extremism.

LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman to Gen Z graduates: You will become 'enormously attractive' to employers if you ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/linkedin-founder-reid-hoffman-to-gen-z-graduates-you-will-become-enormously-attractive-to-employers-if-you-/articleshow/121843561.cms,"Poll Do you think older professionals will struggle to adapt to AI tools?

Job loss due to AI? What top tech CEOs say

India’s New AC Rule: Cooling Between 20°C–28°C Explained

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised concerns that it could take away jobs, especially entry-level roles. But Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn believes that young people should not fear AI. Instead, they should use it to their advantage while job hunting. In a video he published on his YouTube channel this week, Reid Hoffman said, ""You are generation AI. You are AI native. So bringing the fact that you have AI in your tool set is one of the things that makes you enormously attractive”.Hoffman was responding to questions from college students, many of whom were worried about their job prospects in the AI age. He admitted those fears are valid, but encouraged students to flip the script.“Yes, it’s changing the workplace and creating confusion for employers,” he said. “But it also gives you a chance to show your unique abilities. In teams with older professionals, you might even be the one helping them understand new tools,” Reid Hoffman stated.Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, recently warned that AI could eliminate up to half of all entry-level office jobs in the next five years. He said this could cause unemployment to rise by 10% to 20%, and added, “Most people don’t realize this is about to happen.”But top tech figures like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and investor Mark Cuban strongly disagreed with Amodei’s view. Speaking at VivaTech 2025, Huang said: “I pretty much disagree with almost everything he says. AI will definitely change jobs — it changed mine — but it will also create new ones.”Cuban echoed the same sentiment in a recent social media post, pointing out that even in the past, roles like secretaries and in-office dictation staff were replaced by technology, but new industries and jobs emerged.“AI will lead to new companies and increase total employment,” he wrote in the post.","LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman believes that young people should not fear AI.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Thursday following global cues. While Nifty50 was near 24,800, BSE Sensex was below 81,450. At 9:17 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,803.25, down 9 points or 0.035%. BSE Sensex was at 81,410.63, down 34 points or 0.042%.Market observers anticipate that Thursday's trading will be influenced by international factors, including the Fed's policy decisions and geopolitical developments.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, ""The 24500-25000 range for the Nifty is likely to hold till news from the Israel-Iran conflict change for the better or for the worse. If news of deescalation of tensions break, Nifty will break out of the upper band of the range. If the news is about escalation of tensions, particularly relating to troubles in the strait of Hormuz resulting in sharp spike in crude, it would be difficult for Nifty to hold on to the 24500 support level. So watch out for the developments in West Asia.The Fed decision and commentary have come on expected lines. Jerome Powell’s comment that “ despite heightened uncertainty the economy is in solid position “ is important.However, he has warned that “tariff effects on inflation can be persistent”. Therefore, it would be realistic not to expect rate cuts from the Fed immediately. The dot plot, however, indicates two rate cuts in 2025. With only 1.4% GDP growth expected this year, the US is unlikely to attract a lot of capital flows. This is favourable for India. But since Indian market valuations remain a concern, sustained rally will happen only when we get indications of sustained earnings growth, which is some time away.""US markets showed minimal movement on Wednesday, surrendering earlier gains after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that consumer goods prices are likely to increase during summer months as the impact of President Donald Trump 's tariffs reaches consumers.Asian equity markets declined on Thursday following Powell's comments regarding anticipated meaningful inflation increases in upcoming months.Gold prices increased on Thursday, benefiting from safe-haven interest amid Middle East uncertainties, whilst gains remained limited as investors evaluated the US Federal Reserve's indication of reduced pace for upcoming rate reductions.Oil prices decreased on Thursday as investors remained cautious about new positions following Trump's unclear stance regarding potential involvement in the Israel-Iran situation.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 891 crore net on Wednesday.FIIs' futures market position decreased from Rs 99,483 crore net short on Tuesday to Rs 99,183 crore on Wednesday.","While Nifty50 was near 24,800, BSE Sensex was below 81,450.

Air India crash: Govt tightens aircraft safety rules; structures violating height limit under lens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/air-india-crash-govt-tightens-aircraft-safety-rules-structures-violating-height-limit-under-lens/articleshow/121943374.cms,"Representational Image

NEW DELHI: The ministry of civil aviation on Wednesday released new draft rules to tighten control over structures which pose risk to aircraft safety, in the aftermath of the deadly Air India crash in Ahmedabad.The draft, titled Aircraft (Demolition of Obstructions) Rules, 2025, will come into force once published in the official gazette.The rules aim to empower authorities for prompt action against buildings and trees which exceed height limits in the designated aerodrome zones.Under the draft, structures found in violation of the prescribed height limits could face a notice by the officer-in-charge of an aerodrome.Owners would be required to submit detailed information, including structure dimensions and site plans, within two months of receiving the notice. Failure to comply could result in demolition or height reduction.For physical verification of structures, officers are empowered to enter the premises during daylight hours after informing the owner. In cases of non-cooperation, they may proceed with the action based on available information and refer the matter to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).If there is non-compliance, the lead officer must report the matter to the district collector, who would then be responsible for ensuring the demolition in accordance with the order.To challenge the order, owners can file appeals with an appellate officer. This is to be done in the prescribed form along with supporting documents and a fee of Rs 1,000.However, only those individuals who comply with the orders are eligible to claim compensation - under section 22 of the Bharatiya Vayuyan Adhiniyam, 2024. Also, non-compliant structures built after the notification would not be eligible for compensation.The civil aviation ministry has invited objections or suggestions from the public within twenty days of the notification's publication. Responses may be sent to the DGCA, the civil aviation regulator.On June 12, a London-bound Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed into a hostel complex in the Meghani Nagar area of Ahmedabad shortly after take-off from the city's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport. The tragedy claimed 241 lives out of 242 on board, including former Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani.","The draft, titled Aircraft (Demolition of Obstructions) Rules, 2025, will come into force once published in the official gazette.

Jeff Bezos’ neighbouring lot sells for record $105 million on Indian Creek island

From dream home to $105 million payday: Why Peleg ditched his island plans next to Jeff Bezos

What makes Indian Creek so special

Bezos effect: Indian Creek real estate hits $105 million and rising

Future of ‘billionaire bunker’: More tech, more fortresses

In a record-setting real estate transaction that has sent ripples through Miami’s luxury property market, a vacant 1.84-acre lot on Indian Creek Island has sold for a staggering $105 million, as per Forbes reports. This isn’t just any neighbourhood. Indian Creek, often dubbed the “billionaire bunker,” is a hyper-exclusive, man-made island that’s home to some of the world’s most powerful and wealthy figures, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and NFL legend Tom Brady. With just 41 properties and its private police force, the island offers the kind of privacy, security, and prestige that attracts the elite.The seller, German developer Mikhail Peleg, originally purchased the land for $27.5 million in 2018. The recent all-cash deal marks a near fourfold return on his investment, setting a new price record for the island and raising the bar on what land, let alone a developed mansion, can fetch in one of America’s most secretive enclaves. This high-stakes, high-tech neighbourhood is now squarely on the radar of both real estate watchers and Silicon Valley insiders.The $105 million sale smashes the island’s previous record set just a year ago in May 2024 when Jeff Bezos paid $87 million for his third property on Indian Creek. Peleg’s lot, which faces Biscayne Bay to the west, shares borders with two of Bezos’ neighbouring parcels, which the Amazon founder acquired for $68 million and $79 million, respectively, in 2023.Initially listed for an eye-popping $200 million in late 2024, the plot saw immediate attention from ultra-high-net-worth buyers around the world. By the first day of listing, multiple offers poured in, many hovering close to the $100 million mark, according to listing broker Ilya Reznik.“Strategically, it’s the best piece of land in Miami,” Reznik said. “You’re not just buying dirt. You’re buying access to a world most people don’t even know exists.”Mikhail Peleg had once intended to build a dream home on the lot, but shifted plans after deciding not to move to the US The surging real estate values on Indian Creek were a compelling reason to sell.“He’s a savvy investor. The timing was right,” said Daniel Rudoy, Peleg’s attorney. “When you’re sitting next to Bezos’ compound and demand is this hot, you don’t wait around.”To finance the original purchase, Peleg took out a $20 million mortgage, later refinancing and expanding it to $41 million. Interestingly, the refinancing was tied to a business entity connected to British billionaires David and Simon Reuben, adding another layer of intrigue to the deal among the billionaire community.Indian Creek isn’t just about property, it’s about power, privacy, and presence. The island is patrolled by its police department, surveillance boats circle its shores, and no one gets on or off without notice. Air surveillance adds another layer of protection.“It’s like a fortress,” Rudoy explained. “There’s no place like it in the US, maybe not even the world.”Unlike sprawling estates in Beverly Hills or Manhattan’s penthouses, Indian Creek offers complete isolation with immediate water access, giving its residents the ability to sail in and out without setting foot on public roads. It’s no coincidence that the richest man in the world chose this island for his escape.Indian Creek’s real estate prices have skyrocketed in the past two decades. In the early 2000s, waterfront homes on the island were selling for single-digit millions. By the 2010s, prices were averaging above $30 million. But the arrival of Jeff Bezos, along with a wave of tech executives and hedge fund magnates, has redefined the ceiling.“Bezos changed everything,” said Dina Goldentayer, a luxury real estate agent at Douglas Elliman. “When you see that kind of capital pouring in, suddenly $100 million doesn’t seem outlandish anymore.”With Peleg’s record-setting sale, other property owners on Indian Creek are likely to adjust their expectations and their listing prices accordingly.“Now, anyone with a house is going to say, ‘If the dirt is worth $105 million, what’s my estate worth?’” Goldentayer added.The Indian Creek sale signals a broader trend: the convergence of extreme wealth, technology, and geographic retreat. In a post-pandemic world shaped by security concerns, remote work, and digital empires, high-profile figures are increasingly drawn to controlled environments like Indian Creek.“Buyers call me and say, ‘I want in on Indian Creek. What’s the entry point?’” Goldentayer shared. “Sometimes the price doesn’t even matter; it’s about access.”This trend is mirrored across global elite enclaves from London’s Billionaires’ Row to the Hamptons, but Indian Creek’s complete privatisation and proximity to Latin America’s wealth corridors give it a uniquely strategic edge.","A vacant 1.84-acre lot on Indian Creek Island has sold for a staggering $105 million.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

These include:Air India confirmed it is fully cooperating with investigating authorities including AAIB, DGCA, and MoCA, and reiterated that passenger safety is the highest priority.Amid public concern over widespread cancellations, Air India clarified that not all delays are technical in nature. The disruptions are caused by a mix of operational, regulatory, and environmental challenges, including:A total of 83 international flights have been cancelled over the past six days, the airline confirmed.Recent disruptions across Air India’s global network were attributed to multiple causes, not just technical glitches.

AI spending drives cost-cutting measures

Microsoft is preparing to eliminate thousands of jobs primarily targeting its sales division, with the cuts expected to be announced in early July as the company continues restructuring amid massive AI investments, according to people familiar with the matter.The layoffs will mark the third major workforce reduction this year for the Redmond-based tech giant, following 6,000 cuts in May and over 300 additional eliminations just weeks later. Bloomberg first reported the planned summer layoffs, with sources indicating the timing coincides with the start of Microsoft's new fiscal year beginning in July.Unlike previous rounds that primarily affected software engineers and product developers, the upcoming cuts will disproportionately target customer-facing roles. Microsoft's sales and marketing division employs approximately 45,000 of the company's 228,000 total workforce as of June 2024.The company signaled this shift in April when it announced plans to use third-party firms to handle more software sales to small and mid-sized customers. Sources told Bloomberg the reductions won't exclusively affect sales teams, though they will bear the brunt of the cuts.Microsoft's layoffs reflect the broader challenge facing tech companies balancing AI investments with operational efficiency. The company has allocated roughly $80 billion for data center spending this fiscal year while executives have pledged to Wall Street to control costs in other areas.CEO Satya Nadella recently described earlier cuts as a ""realignment"" rather than performance-based decisions, telling employees at an internal town hall that ""this was not about people failing. It was about repositioning for what comes next.""The timing follows a pattern for Microsoft, which often announces organizational changes near the end of its fiscal year. The company previously eliminated 10,000 positions in January 2023 after pandemic-driven hiring, and made additional cuts to its videogame division following the Activision Blizzard acquisition.Microsoft declined to comment on the planned layoffs, with the final number of cuts still being determined according to sources familiar with the matter.","Microsoft is preparing to eliminate thousands of jobs, with the cuts expected to be announced in early July.

A Global Picture: Wealth Growth Tilted to the Americas

Global private wealth rose by 4.6% in 2024, up from 4.2% in 2023.





Most of the increase came from North America, where stable currencies and strong financial markets drove momentum.





The Americas led with more than 11% of global wealth growth.





In contrast, the Asia-Pacific and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) regions saw sluggish growth: below 3% and 0.5%, respectively.





The United Arab Emirates continued its meteoric rise on the global wealth map in 2024, adding approximately 13,000 new millionaires, according to the, released Wednesday.This fresh wave of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) pushed the UAE’s millionaire count to a striking 240,343, marking a 5.8% year-on-year increase. This growth makes the UAE the second-fastest-growing millionaire market, trailing only Türkiye, which experienced an 8.4% rise. A good number of these newly created millionaire base in the UAE came about from re-locations, as has been the case for four years now.Aaccording to the Swiss bank: “In 2024, Turkey stands out from the crowd thanks to an 8.4% increase in its number of dollar millionaires over 2023, equivalent to a boost of roughly 7,000 people in a single year. The UAE (had) a rise of 5.8% in millionaire numbers, thanks to approximately 13,000 new entrants in this category.”To put it in human terms: According to Worldometers data, the UAE’s population grew by 385,048 last year.While the total population is estimated at around 11 million, adults in their prime working years (25-54) number a substantial 7.28 million. With such a high concentration of wealth, effectively about one in every 30 adults or economically active individuals in the UAE is a millionaire.The country’s HNWIs now collectively control about $785 billion (Dh2.88 trillion) in wealth. Meanwhile, the average wealth per adult in the UAE currently stands at $147,663.According to the report:This concentration of wealth is clearly reflected in the UAE’s property and investment markets. According to Knight Frank, a notable influx of high-net-worth individuals from Saudi Arabia, India, China, and the UK is driving larger, multi-million dollar deals, particularly in premium locations such as Jumeira Bay Island.Paul Donovan, Chief Economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a statement highlighted the broader implications of this capital accumulation:“Wealth is not just an economic measure – it’s a social and political force. As we navigate the fourth industrial revolution and rising public debt, the way wealth is distributed and transferred will shape opportunity, policy, and progress.”One particularly notable trend in the UAE is the coming wave of wealth transfers. UBS estimates that the country will see $19 billion (Dh70 billion) in intra- and inter-generational transfers. That figure represents 1.4% of the UAE’s total private wealth.This includes wealth moving between:Globally, the report expects over $83 trillion to change hands in the next two to three decades, most significantly in the:Regionally, the UAE ranks second in the Middle East for millionaire population:Globally, Switzerland maintained its position as the wealthiest nation by average adult wealth:By contrast, while the UAE’s average per adult ($147,663) trails these top-tier economies, its pace of wealth creation—and wealth attraction, signals an upward trajectory.Not all of the 13,000 new millionaires in the UAE were homegrown. According to, citingdata, the UAE attracted 7,200 millionaires from abroad in 2024, a 53% increase from the previous year.This surge in financial migration brings the total number of resident HNWIs to 130,500, as reported earlier. Industry experts suggest that favorable tax policies, political stability, and high-end infrastructure continue to make the UAE a magnet for mobile global wealth.While the UAE experienced notable domestic gains, the global wealth landscape also saw overall expansion:","In 2024, the UAE gained 13,000 millionaires, bringing the total to 240,000 with $785 billion in wealth. 62% of this wealth is held in financial assets, from equities and bonds to private investments.

Grief Meets Generosity: A Community Stands Up

‘Support Group to Help’





In the quiet hours after disaster, the first residents of the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle Tower, also known as Tiger Tower, have been allowed back into the building to retrieve what little may be left. The high-rise in Dubai Marina was partially gutted by a fire on Friday night. Days later, the reality of what was lost is beginning to sink in.For many, it’s not just belongings, but entire lives turned to soot. Charred walls, soot-covered furniture, and gutted rooms greeted them, turning tearful reunions with their homes into moments of anguish.Salma Sherif Elhouseny, an Egyptian business consultant, had only been in Dubai for a year and a half. Her apartment on the 40th floor had been her safe space in a new country. She returned to it escorted by a Dubai Police officer, stepping carefully over blackened rubble. A video she later shared shows her sobbing uncontrollably as she is led through the ruins by a Dubai Police officer.“My master bedroom… it’s completely gone. I'm devastated, everything's lost. My jewellery, my laptop, my clothes, birth and education certificates, all the money I had, it was all here,” she told, her voice still trembling.“I know others have lost more, but I am alone in this city. This was everything I had.”She had waited several hours just to be allowed in, eventually escorted up through a cargo elevator shortly before midnight.“I was just lucky they let me in,” she said.Authorities have implemented strict controls to manage the entry of displaced tenants. Dubai Police and Civil Defence now require residents to register their names, present Emirates ID and tenancy (Ejari) documents, and wait for their turn. Entry is granted to small escorted groups, each allowed only around 10 minutes inside.Passports, medications, laptops, car keys, these are the urgent items people are prioritising as they step into their damaged homes.“There’s a system in place, and they are trying their best,” one tenant told, acknowledging the structure amid the chaos.But the process hasn’t been smooth for everyone.“Some people are misusing the opportunity by carrying heavy suitcases and staying longer than allowed. It slows everything down and delays those still waiting,” said another resident.Some floors, particularly the lower ones, appear to have escaped major damage. An Indian homeowner who visited his third-floor apartment said he felt fortunate.“Some smoke damage, but nothing serious. I consider myself lucky, given what others are going through.”For many others, especially those living on higher floors, access is still out of reach.Yasemin Fuentes, a Turkish expat who lived on the 47th floor with her husband, daughter, and three pets, has made multiple attempts to retrieve essentials, all unsuccessful.“More than 200 people were waiting, and it was too hot. I was told only those with medical needs or flights were being allowed in briefly,” she said. “We’re still wearing the clothes we fled in. I haven’t been able to get my ID or second phone.”The night of the fire, Yasemin hadn’t even been aware of the danger until a friend from a neighbouring tower called her around 10pm.“There was no alarm. I grabbed my daughter, our two cats, and the dog. By the time we got to the stairwell, it was filled with smoke. That’s when panic really kicked in.”Others, now allowed in, are documenting and sharing their losses through WhatsApp support groups.For residents living in shared accommodations, the experience has been even more constrained.“You’re only allowed into your own room. Police were very strict about that,” said one tenant.“And if you're above the 40th floor, there’s no electricity at all. We were given enough time to collect essentials, though.”Even as residents cope with trauma and uncertainty, community solidarity has begun to fill the gaps left behind by the fire.A WhatsApp group namedhas grown to over 1,000 members. It now functions as a central hub for aid, offering everything from temporary accommodation and clothing to food supplies. Volunteers continue to show up, helping neighbours with what they can.Mental health professionals have stepped in too, offering free counselling to those impacted. Daily virtual sessions featuring laughter therapy and traditional yoga are being held every morning from 6:45am to 7:45am until Friday, providing some emotional relief for those still processing what happened.There are no easy recoveries from events like this, but in the ruins of Marina Pinnacle, the compassion of a city is beginning to rebuild what flames took away.","First residents of Dubai's Tiger Tower have been allowed back into the building to retrieve what little may be left.

UAE legalizes tobacco-free nicotine pouches to help smokers quit cigarettes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-legalizes-tobacco-free-nicotine-pouches-to-help-smokers-quit-cigarettes/articleshow/121910813.cms,"Nicotine pouches offer a smoke-free alternative by delivering nicotine through the mouth, lowering lung damage risks compared to cigarettes./ (File)

Khaleej Times





The UAE will officially allow the sale of tobacco-free nicotine pouches starting July 29, following the enactment of a new Cabinet resolution that sets technical standards for this emerging smoking alternative. The new law aims to provide smokers with additional tools to quit cigarettes.Dr Sanam Mallick, Consultant in Family Medicine at Burjeel Hospital Abu Dhabi, described nicotine pouches as small, smokeless products that contain nicotine but no tobacco. “People place them between their gum and lips to absorb nicotine without smoking or chewing tobacco. They’re popular as a discreet alternative to cigarettes or chewing tobacco. Nicotine pouches contain nicotine, the same chemical that we find in tobacco,” he toldNicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco, is released by these pouches and stimulates dopamine production, the ‘feel-good hormone.’ This process helps reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, thereby assisting smokers in quitting.“Nicotine pouches can be a valuable tool for some people trying to quit smoking, but whether they’re a good option compared to other smoking cessation methods depends on a few factors,” Dr Mallick explained.One major benefit of nicotine pouches is the absence of smoke inhalation, which significantly reduces the risk of lung damage associated with traditional cigarettes. However, Dr Mallick cautioned that, like all nicotine products, pouches can be addictive. “They still contain nicotine, so they don’t remove the addiction, just the smoking behaviour. (Additionally), because they’re relatively new, the long-term health impacts are still being studied. ”Regarding effectiveness, Dr Mallick noted that some smokers have successfully used pouches to gradually reduce or replace cigarette smoking, while others find it challenging due to the continued oral habit. “Others may find the oral fixation or habit harder to break, since pouches still involve placing something in the mouth (similar to chewing tobacco).”Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) such as patches, gum, and lozenges are well-established methods known to increase quit rates by 50 to 70 per cent. “Nicotine pouches might offer similar benefits, but without long-term studies, their effectiveness compared to these therapies is less certain,” Dr Mallick added.Shiraz Khan, Chief Operating Officer at Aster Retail GCC, further explained the difference between nicotine pouches and patches. “Nicotine from pouches is absorbed through the lining of the mouth. In contrast, nicotine patches are transdermal products applied to the skin. They slowly release nicotine into the bloodstream over a period of time, helping to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings,” he said. “The key difference lies in the method of delivery. Pouches work via oral mucosal absorption, while patches deliver nicotine through the skin.”Currently, NRTs such as patches, gum, and lozenges are widely available in UAE pharmacies, often sold over the counter without prescription. However, some higher-dose patches or combination therapies might require healthcare provider supervision, Khan noted.NRTs are popular among smokers aiming to quit due to their discreet usage, absence of smoke, and perceived lower harm compared to traditional tobacco products. “Products like nicotine gums and lozenges have seen rapid growth due to their discreet use, lack of smoke, and perceived lower harm compared to traditional tobacco products,” Khan said.Under UAE regulations, all nicotine products must carry health warnings and age restriction labels, with sales prohibited to anyone under 18 years. Packaging and labelling are required to comply with UAE-specific guidelines, including Arabic labelling. “Only licensed retailers or pharmacies may sell these products,” Khan added.Globally, tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of disease and premature death. According to a guide released last year by the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (Mohap), the global tobacco epidemic claims nearly eight million lives annually, ranking it as one of the world’s most serious public health threats.In the UAE, the National Health Survey of 2018 found that nearly 16 per cent of men and 2.5 per cent of women are smokers.To bolster tobacco cessation efforts, UAE authorities have committed to providing counselling and psychological support to individuals seeking to quit all forms of tobacco, including e-cigarettes.",The UAE will allow the sale of tobacco-free nicotine pouches starting July 29.

UAE activates emergency airport plan to support travellers amid regional airspace closures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-activates-emergency-airport-plan-to-support-travellers-amid-regional-airspace-closures/articleshow/121909642.cms,"Field teams deployed 24/7 at UAE airports to assist stranded travellers amid widespread flight delays and rerouting caused by regional airspace shutdowns.

Field Teams Deployed, Focus on Passenger Welfare



Airspace Closures Trigger Wide-Scale Flight Disruptions



Commitment to Service Quality and Passenger Safety







The United Arab Emirates has activated its comprehensive emergency airport response plan in the wake of escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that have prompted multiple countries to close their airspace. The closures, initiated by Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and Israel, have led to widespread disruption in regional air travel, causing flight rerouting and delays that have affected thousands of passengers.As reported byon Tuesday, June 17, 2025, the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security (ICACP) confirmed that a full-scale business continuity strategy was triggered to maintain the seamless operation of passenger movement across all UAE airports.“Necessary measures have been taken to preserve service quality at the UAE’s airports and manage the impact of recent regional developments,” the authority stated in its official Monday release.As part of the national response, UAE authorities deployed field teams around the clock, comprising trained personnel and supported by advanced technological infrastructure. These teams were stationed across UAE airports to manage passenger flows, expedite immigration procedures, and collaborate closely with airline operators on rescheduling disrupted flights.The ICACP emphasised that “the mechanism for travelers’ entry into UAE airports was aligned with the evolving operational situation,” enabling flexibility in managing sudden disruptions.In addition to ground coordination, the government placed a strong focus on the well-being of affected travellers. Temporary accommodation was arranged for those stranded due to cancelled or rerouted flights. Real-time updates and logistical support were provided directly to passengers, ensuring transparency and reduced anxiety during their wait.Support teams were also positioned to offer one-on-one guidance, helping passengers navigate their onward travel plans amid the uncertainty.The emergency protocol was set in motion following the widespread airspace closures that unfolded earlier in the week. Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and Israel shut down their skies as tensions between Iran and Israel escalated sharply. The closures sent ripple effects across international air corridors, disrupting flight routes and triggering mass cancellations and rerouting operations across the region.Local airports in the UAE, which serve as major global aviation hubs, were particularly impacted by these developments. However, thanks to pre-established emergency measures and real-time inter-agency coordination, operational continuity was largely preserved.According to ICACP, the plan encompassed “a set of regulatory and logistical procedures carried out in partnership with strategic stakeholders across the aviation sector,” helping to absorb the shock of the disruptions without significant breakdowns in service.The ICACP praised the composure and cooperation demonstrated by passengers during the travel disruptions, noting that their patience contributed significantly to the successful implementation of emergency procedures.Authorities reaffirmed the UAE’s commitment to “safety, operational excellence, and proactive crisis management.” They added that the nation’s response was anchored in “authentic Emirati values and international best practices,” ensuring that service quality was upheld with minimal impact on travellers.By deploying well-coordinated field support and leveraging advanced operational protocols, the UAE effectively contained the fallout from regional developments, once again demonstrating its resilience and leadership in global aviation management.","Field teams deployed 24/7 at UAE airports to assist stranded travellers amid widespread flight delays and rerouting caused by regional airspace shutdowns.

Starting Work Without a Legal Visa: A Growing Problem

Personal Stories: Legal Limbo and Financial Loss

Akram (name changed), a sales executive, received a job offer from a lighting and home décor company in Abu Dhabi. He was instructed to return to India as his initial visa was expiring and re-enter the UAE on a new visit visa to begin the employment visa process. Akram spent over Dh2,500 on travel, flew back, and started work the day after arriving on April 22, 2025.



He worked for approximately 40 days, during which the company promised his employment visa would be completed by early June. However, on June 2, Akram was informed that the company would not continue with his hiring. With his visit visa nearing expiry and no legal work permit, Akram faced the prospect of returning home without a job.

With his visit visa nearing expiry and no legal work permit, Akram faced the prospect of returning home without a job. Yasir, 29, a marketing graduate, found a job at an event management firm via a job portal. He received an offer letter and was told his visa application was underway. Yasir started working in January 2025 and stayed nearly two months. Each time he inquired about the visa, he was told it was pending. In early March, citing budget constraints, the company canceled his hiring plan without issuing an official termination letter and paid him only half the promised salary.



With his visit visa expiring, Yasir had no legal status in the UAE and was forced to leave the country on March 6, 2025.





Legal Framework: Work Permits and Residency Visas Are Mandatory

Being asked to pay for jobs or visas





Starting work before receiving a legal employment visa





Receiving only verbal job offers





Changes in job terms mid-process





Emotional and Psychological Impact of False Promises





Many expatriates arriving in the UAE have been found working without formal contracts or employment visas, leaving them vulnerable to legal and financial troubles. Despite receiving job offers or offer letters, these individuals often start working on visit visas, only to be abandoned by employers and forced to leave the country empty-handed.Jobseekers arriving in the UAE are being warned strongly against beginning work while still on visit visas—even if they have received job offers. According to UAE labour laws, it is unlawful to work without a valid employment visa. Yet, several cases have emerged where expats start working based on job offer letters or verbal promises, hoping to secure a permanent employment visa later.Dina Subhi Al Obaidi, a UAE-based recruiter and founder of Chronicle L.L.C FZ, told Khaleej Times that “It’s illegal to hire or allow anyone to work on a visit visa.” She emphasized that “Employers must obtain labour approval and issue valid work permits before an employee begins any job duties.”Al Obaidi pointed out that many candidates, especially those new to the UAE or on visit visas, “often lack clarity on hiring processes” and are sometimes “left unsupported or misled. Awareness is key to protection.”Two individuals’ experiences highlight the risks faced by those working on visit visas without formal contracts.Under UAE law, working on a visit visa is prohibited. Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 and Federal Decree Law No. 29 of 2021 require employees to have a valid work permit and residency visa before beginning any job.Employers who violate these regulations face heavy penalties. According to Article 60(1)(a) of Federal Decree Law No. 9 of 2024, fines range from Dh100,000 to Dh1 million for hiring without proper documentation.Dina Subhi Al Obaidi highlighted common red flags that candidates should watch for, including:“These are unacceptable and unethical practices,” she said.She added that ethical hiring involves “issuing a formal offer letter, completing the visa process before onboarding, and being transparent about salary and responsibilities.” Employers have a responsibility “to support candidates who are new but show potential.”Beyond the legal implications, the human cost of unethical hiring practices is deeply significant. Dr Amir Javaid, a consultant psychiatrist at Burjeel Medical City in Abu Dhabi, highlighted the emotional toll these false job promises take on individuals. He explained that such experiences often lead to “emotional instability, anger, and irritability,” especially for expatriates who find themselves isolated and vulnerable in a foreign country.“Behind every CV is a person who may have left home in search of a future,” Dr Javaid told Khaleej Times. “When their hopes are shattered by broken promises, it causes profound feelings of betrayal and insecurity.” This emotional upheaval can result in long-term psychological consequences, including depression, anxiety, low self-confidence, and even post-traumatic stress disorder. Some affected individuals may require professional psychiatric care to cope and recover.Dr Javaid urged jobseekers to remain vigilant for signs of trauma following such experiences. Symptoms might include mood swings, irritability, sleep disturbances, social withdrawal, and a noticeable lack of motivation.From an employer’s perspective, Dr Javaid emphasized the critical role of responsibility and transparency. “Companies must avoid making false promises, provide clear and timely notice when changes occur, offer alternative roles where possible, and prioritize the psychological safety of their employees.” He further recommended that organisations foster empathetic communication and engage occupational health teams to support employees’ mental well-being.","Many expats arriving in the UAE have been found working without formal contracts or employment visas.
