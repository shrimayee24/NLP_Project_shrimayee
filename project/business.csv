Road ministry for no construction along 15 m on either side of Centre-built Ring roads/bypasses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/road-ministry-for-no-construction-along-15-m-on-either-side-of-centre-built-ring-roads/bypasses/articleshow/122377922.cms,"NEW DELHI: No construction will be allowed along 15 metres on either side of greenfield and access-controlled bypasses and Ring Roads to be built by Union govt across states, as part of a policy the road transport ministry is in the process of finalising. State govts will have to notify these as “No Construction Green zone” under their planning laws, prohibiting any development activity.This will be the major thrust of the ministry’s “access-controlled Ring Roads/bypass” policy for decongesting major cities to ensure such stretches don't face congestion due to ribbon development. Ribbon development refers to linear development along roads, with buildings coming up with direct access to transportation networks.In response to a question on how the ministry is addressing the problem of unregulated ribbon development along ring roads and bypasses at a recent meeting of PPPAC, an inter-ministerial panel for appraisal of projects built in Public Private Partnership mode, it said, “Under the proposed policy, emphasis is on regulated development along proposed bypasses. The policy would require a development control zone of 15m on either side of the NH bypass or ring road being notified by the state govt as a green zone under the planning laws enacted by the state, where development shall be prohibited unless it is for public transport or mobility infrastructure, public utility infrastructure like electricity, water or sewerage pipeline or green zone infrastructure”.The ministry also said that beyond the no-construction green zone, state govts can plan, develop, or regulate the development of residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional infrastructure within a two-km radius on either side of the bypass or ring road. This will facilitate economic activity using the ring road or bypass as the centre of development in a regulated manner.Access to ring roads and bypasses would be only through service roads, which would be constructed at the time of project development, and entry to the main carriageway would be provided only through slip roads or interchanges, the ministry said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked the ministry to come up with a model for development of Ring Roads and bypasses by this month end. He has also instructed the ministry to put in place a permanent mechanism or institutional set-up for proper planning and mapping of such projects by the end of August.","No construction will be allowed along 15 metres on either side of greenfield and access-controlled bypasses and Ring Roads to be built by Union govt across states.

Nationwide strike called by trade unions had little impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nationwide-strike-called-by-trade-unions-had-little-impact/articleshow/122377407.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The nationwide strike called by trade unions on Wednesday had little impact on attendance across sectors with the banking sector seeing the highest level of absenteeism at around 33%.Estimates from 20 major cities across the country that are available with the Centre showed that sectors such as railways, once controlled by unions, had no impact, as was also the case with air transport, including airport, and power.There were of course pockets - such as Kolkata, Asansol and Chennai - where there was an impact on banks and insurance companies.After banks, coal and mines and oil and gas with around 19% absenteeism in both came next, followed by insurance (16%). But it was not significant to affect operations. In any case, with the use of electronic clearing and fund transfer and ATMs, bank strikes are no longer as disruptive for citizens as they were in the past.The numbers in most cities indicate that the unions have lost their appeal among workers. More than 200 unions from industries as diverse as defence and oil and gas to several banks and ports decided against participating in the nationwide strike.The strike was called against the four labour codes enacted by the Centre, which have not yet been implemented as states are still in dialogue.What has hurt the unions attempts to mobilise workers is states moving ahead and amending their labour laws to provide significant relaxations across multiple provisions - from allowing women to work in night shifts to raising the retrenchment threshold without govt approval from 100 to 300 workers.Besides, only a handful of states have not responded on the labour codes, and that too for political reasons, as most of them chase investments, where companies often seek flexibility and lower inspector raj.","The banking sector saw the highest level of absenteeism at around 33%.

"3 plants are killing us, why bring another WTE unit, asks Sannoth",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-plants-are-killing-us-why-bring-another-wte-unit-asks-sannoth/articleshow/122377187.cms,"Villagers say a waste landfill, which has been growing for 12 years, is a major source of pollution

TOI

NEW DELHI: The air in Sannoth, a village next to Bawana industrial area in north Delhi, stings before it suffocates. By the time you walk past a large landfill, which has grown over the past 12 years, cross a stinking sewer that once used to be a clean natural drain towards Munak Canal, your throat itches and your eyes burn. Locals say this is the new normal.Sannoth, once known for health-conscious people and yoga practitioners, now lives with asthma inhalers, skin diseases and dyspnea.The region already has three plants to manage Delhi’s piling solid waste, chunks of which are often set afire, sending smoke into homes. However, villages are now bracing for a new waste-to-energy (WTE) plant recently cleared by the Union environment ministry.he villagers have been protesting against the newly sanctioned M/s Jindal Urban Waste Management (Bawana) Limited since Dec last year. Their concern is existential. “How can they bring another WTE plant when three such waste management facilities are already killing us slowly? We are seeing our loved ones dying, children cough and often struggle to breathe while playing,” Rajpal Saini, 70, a Sannoth resident.People can’t do yoga anymore, can’t sit outside, can’t go for long walks. The monsoon, a season that once would refill the ponds and channels and increase greenery, has become a nightmare as an intense foul odour fills the air,” said Saini, who retired from MCD’s sanitation department and has since dedicated his life to probing and exposing the environmental impact of waste processing in the area.The new plant is to come up between between the Munak Canal, which feeds half of the city with drinking water, and the landfill — a private storage and treatment facility of hazardous waste.A visit byto the area paints a grim picture of environmental degradation and a community grappling with a worsening health crisis. Yet, the plant’s environmental impact assessment (EIA) appears to side-step or downplay these realities — especially the proximity of dense human settlements and the precarious state of the natural stream slicing through the project site.sent queries to the Jindal group to find out how were they going to address the environmental concerns. However, no reply was received despite repeated attempts.Despite sustained local protests, the project secured environmental clearance. However, as the MoEFCC gave environmental clearance to the project on June 18, fears of a spike in contamination echo louder, given the condition of a similar facility in Okhla.“Our elders who died about a decade back were the last ones to die a natural death. Ever since that landfill started to grow taller, garbage being brought to this area in trucks, and a waste-to-energy plant was established, we witnessed diseases engulfing this and neighbouring villages. Swarms of big colourful flies, foul smell and itchy eyes are common. Now that a new WTE plant, a large one, has been proposed, we have no other option but to protest,” said Saini.Munesh, another resident of Sanoth, pointed towards her son, 23-yearold Ayush, who has an intellectual disability, and said that for the past five years he faced difficulty breathing, and the situation worsened every year. “Ever since the issue started, the seizures increased,” said Munesh.Similar concerns were echoed by Parvinder, father of 12-year-old Akshita, who often gets restless and gasps for air.“Some 12 years back, next to a natural pond, they started bringing and dumping waste to set up a private plant. Soon, a natural drain that passed through that site started getting murkier dark water. The air quality of the village worsened. We remember that while playing cricket as children, people would take sips from this channel. Now, we worry for the Munak Canal, which passes right next to the proposed site,” said Chand Narwal, who was joined by a retired Delhi Police constable Balraj, who echoed the same concerns.“My wife died three years back due to lung disease, and I got asthma,” said Brahm Prakash, a villager who retired from DTC.Saini further pointed out that the proposed project site had over 80 trees which villagers numbered, and that the project might impact a population larger than expected. “The EC was granted without proper fieldwork and the impact to human life due to already existing plants was avoided. No one ever visited the villages. They didn’t even consider public views which were sought by the Delhi govt. We even found that about 30 responses in favour of the plant were from JJ cluster, who were not even aware of the plant,” said Saini.When TOI contacted some of the 30 JJ colony residents who signed a handwritten letter in favour of the plant, they claimed that they were misguided. “Two men came to the colony and told that a water plant is being set up and that I will get a job there. So, I signed the letter supporting that factory. Later, we came to know that it’s a plant to burn garbage,” said Tufail Khan, a resident of JJ colony. Md Sahid Alam, another resident, tells a similar story.“The so-called public hearing was a complete farce, a disorganised, harassing charade that shifted venues multiple times, silenced residents, failed to record any objections or minutes, and rushed through before locals could even file their written submissions. To top it off, multiple letters favouring the plant, all in identical handwriting, expose a blatantly duplicitous attempt to manipulate public sentiment. Above that, toxic emissions and ash from the already existing plant and landfill have already led to skyrocketing rates of respiratory, kidney and cancerrelated illnesses among villagers, so approving another incinerator here is nothing short of environmental and health betrayal,” said environmental activist Bhavreen Kandhari.","Sannoth, once known for health-conscious people and yoga practitioners, now lives with asthma inhalers, skin diseases and dyspnea.

NEW DELHI: An expert committee, appointed by central biotech regulator to review biosafety data of transgenic cotton, has submitted a favourable report on genetically modified HTBt cotton, paving way for Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) to take a final call on its commercial cultivation.Though transgenic Bt cotton is being cultivated in the country after getting approved in 2002, the herbicide-tolerant Bt (HTBt) cotton could not get the mandatory GEAC nod despite long-pending demand of cotton farmers. As a result, its illegal variant is reportedly being used without quality check in many cotton-producing states.Sources said the expert committee's report has given an all clear to HTBt cotton but the final decision would be taken by govt after getting regulator GEAC's nod.The demand for legal use of HTBt is expected to be raised again on Friday when Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan visits Coimbatore for a crop-specific meeting on cotton.Since the ministry has invited suggestions from farmers ahead of the meeting amid reports of declining Bt cotton productivity in the country due to a newly emerging disease, tobacco streak virus (TSV), demand for allowing another transgenic variety - HTBt - for commercial cultivation at the earliest is expected to be the key takeaway.","HTBt cotton could not get mandatory GEAC nod despite long-pending demand of cotton farmers.

Mamata Banerjee Slams BJP as Over 300 Bengal Workers Jailed in Rajasthan for Speaking Bengali

NEW DELHI: Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Wednesday, signalling a possible reset in ties between the industrial group and the state.The meeting, the first between Mamata Banerjee and a Tata group chairman since Banerjee became chief minister, comes over 17 years after her agitation led to Tata motors pulling out its Nano project from Singur.In a post on X, the TMC said, ""Mamata Banerjje hosted Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, for a constructive dialogue on Bengal's industrial growth and emerging opportunities. The meeting reflected Bengal's commitment to fostering meaningful public-private partnerships that drive innovation, investment, and inclusive development.""Seventeen years ago, following a protest led by Banerjee against land acquisition for a Tata Motors facility in Singur, the company relocated the plant. At the time, the state was governed by CPM under the late Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.The opposition Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, led by Mamata Banerjee, had led widespread protests after the state government had rejected her demand to return 400 acres land to farmers.In a move that was termed ""sad"" by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Tata announced his exit plan. PM Modi, who was then chief minister of Gujarat, spotted an opportunity and slid into the industrialist's DMs with a 'welcome' text.""When Ratan Tata said in a press conference in Kolkata that they are leaving West Bengal, I sent him a short SMS saying 'welcome'. And now you can see what a Re 1 (worth) SMS can do,"" Modi had said.Production of Nano cars was discontinued in 2018.At the Bengal global business summit (BGBS), held in February this year, Banerjee had said in her speech that the Tata group chairman could not make it to the summit owing to certain exigencies.Banerjee had a detailed discussion with him on the eve of the summit. ""He has assured (me) that they want to invest more and more in Bengal.

Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.W hen Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s comeback to the private sector is not just a career move; it’s an inspiring example of how public service can continue even after leaving office. Unlike many politicians who often retire into comfort, relying on accumulated wealth or government benefits, Sunak is choosing to re-engage professionally in a meaningful way. His decision to take on an advisory role at Goldman Sachs without drawing a salary, and instead donating any earnings to charity, reflects both integrity and a deep sense of responsibility. It sets a strong precedent for how former leaders can remain active contributors to society, not for personal gain, but for a greater public good.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser.

NEW DELHI: While Aadhaar was conceived as an identity proof, and not as proof of citizenship, allowing onboarding without real scrutiny, recent moves have meant that only verified adults can enrol for the unique ID. Besides, the Unique Identification Authority of India UIDAI ) is going to tap the online database for passport, ration cards, and birth and matriculation certificates in the future for enrolment of adults and also for updates to ensure that Aadhaar remains foolproof.While Section 9 of the Aadhaar Act states that it is not evidence of citizenship or domicile, the new tools are seeking to ensure only citizens get the unique number.Over the last 15 years, over 140 crore Aadhaars have been generated, including for those who have died, and there is near adult saturation. With infants also now getting Aadhaar soon after birth, govt has decided to tighten the norms for new adult registrations.To thwart attempts by illegal immigrants to get the unique ID based on forged or fake documents, for the last couple of years, the onus has been on states to verify credentials and that Aadhaar is only issued after rigorous checks through a state portal.In the past, there were concerns over illegal immigrants getting Aadhaar and then using it for other purposes, including other IDs.""It is going to be difficult for any illegal immigrant to now get Aadhaar,"" argued an official, indicating a shift from the relaxed, if existent at all, rules of enrolment.Sources said that even if illegal immigrants use Aadhaar to clear the SIR of electoral rolls, there is little possibility of new ones being able to use that as the launchpad for acquiring documents, and most crucially, citizenship.A new tool developed by UIDAI is also going to put a second layer of check for updates as well as enrolments by tapping into documents available online, such as driving licenses, PAN, MNREGS details, and going forward, things like electricity bill. These documents are also in line with the prescriptions for centralized KYC, and ensure a homogenous identity.","New tools are seeking to ensure only citizens get the unique number.

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday criticised the Emergency and the Gandhis for suspending fundamental rights, in what is seen as another poke at the Congress leadership after defying the party on the Union govt's global outreach on Operation Sindoor and statements lauding PM Narendra Modi The remarks targeting Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi in an article on an English website and a Malayalam daily in Kerala appeared to ruffle feathers in Congress, but the party maintained a silence, even though Lok Sabha whip Manickam Tagore, without naming, dubbed Tharoor a ""BJP parrot"".Tharoor strongly criticised late former PM Indira Gandhi and her son Sanjay. ""Indira Gandhi's harshness led public life into fear. Indira insisted that only an Emergency could bring discipline to the country. Outside world was unaware of the torture in detention and the murders without trial,"" he wrote.He said Sanjay's actions were extremely brutal and facilitated by the then govt, and people expressed their anger by ousting Indira and her party in the elections in 1977. Tharoor said today's India is democratic and has gained more confidence and progress. ""For 21 long months, fundamental rights were suspended, the press was muzzled, and political dissent was brutally suppressed.The world's largest democracy held its breath, as the very essence of its constitutional promise - liberty, equality, fraternity - was severely tested,"" he said.Tharoor's article appeared to stir the pot again, given that he has been publicly at odds with Congress on several issues. Recently, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge slammed him for putting ""Modi first"" as against Congress' policy of putting ""India first"". In retaliation, Tharoor posted on X that a bird did not need the permission to fly in the open skies.What could be provocative for the Congress is that the party recently countered BJP's offensive on the 50th anniversary of Emergency, stating that India has been under an ""undeclared emergency"" since 2014.Manickam, in what was an unnamed reaction to Tharoor, said on X, ""When a colleague starts repeating BJP lines word for word, you begin to wonder - is the bird becoming a parrot? Mimicry is cute in birds, not in politics.""In his article, Tharoor said the judiciary buckled under immense pressure to back the Emergency, with the Supreme Court even upholding the suspension of habeas corpus and citizens' fundamental right to liberty, while journalists, activists and opposition leaders were jailed.","Senior Congress MP Shashi Tharoor criticised the Emergency and the Gandhis for suspending fundamental rights.

Rs 2.9 crore Bengaluru drive to serve strays chicken rice stirs row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-2-9-crore-bengaluru-drive-to-serve-strays-chicken-rice-stirs-row/articleshow/122376570.cms,"Representative image

BENGALURU: Chicken rice, taxpayer money, and street dogs are set to converge in an unprecedented Rs 2.9 crore initiative by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which will soon roll out a daily feeding programme for stray dogs. The aim: to tame dog aggression and enhance public safety - and possibly, urban chaos.Starting with 5,000 strays across the city's eight zones, the municipal corporation will deliver one meal a day of 367 grams - a calorie-calibrated mix designed to meet the nutritional needs of a typical 15kg dog. Each Rs 22.42 meal includes: 150g chicken (protein); 100g rice (carbohydrates); 100g vegetables (minerals); 10g oil (fats). This will provide 465-750 kcal of energy.Bengaluru has an estimated 2.8 lakh stray dogs. A trial run has already been conducted ahead of the launch, BBMP officials said. Around 500 animal-welfare volunteers currently feed around 25,000 dogs across the city.BBMP will now onboard designated vendors to feed selected dogs - 400 to 500 for each zone - at 100 to 125 feeding points in a zone. Cleanliness at feeding sites will be part of the contract, said animal husbandry commissioner Suralkar Vikas Kishore.Voluntary citizen participation is encouraged, with residents invited to contribute financially to the feeding efforts alongside BBMP. ""This is the first time a municipal body in India has taken up scheduled mass feeding of stray animals,"" said a senior BBMP official. ""It's not just a welfare step - it's a safety initiative.""But the move has sharply divided opinion. While animal rights activists have praised the plan, critics question the wisdom of allocating crores in public funds to feed dogs instead of curbing their population through sterilisation. ""My elderly father was chased by stray dogs just last week. Instead of spending crores on chicken rice, BBMP should focus on sterilising and controlling the dog population first. Feeding is not the solution,"" said Sowmya Ramesh, a resident.Kiran Raj from Hulimavu offered a counterpoint: ""Many of us already feed stray dogs with our own money. If BBMP is stepping in to help, it can make a big difference - provided it's done responsibly and without corruption.""","Bengaluru municipal corporation will deliver one meal a day of 367 grams.

NEW DELHI: States should undertake reforms aimed at reducing regulatory overreach and fostering business confidence, Rajeev Gauba, member of govt's policy think tank Niti Aayog , said on Thursday.Gauba also highlighted the potential for collaboration between Niti Aayog and DPIIT (department for promotion of industry and internal trade) to support states in adopting a principle-based approach to decriminalisation. He was speaking at a high-level workshop on ease of doing business and investment promotion where several states participated.During the session on decriminalisation and compliance reform, several states presented their ongoing initiatives arising from Jan Vishwas Act 1.0, highlighting efforts to decriminalise minor business-related offences at state level. The discussion stressed the need to convert minor business offences into civil penalties, while also streamlining compliance mechanisms to reduce the burden on entrepreneurs, said an official statement.States shared examples of removing imprisonment clauses, adopting self-certification regimes, removal of licence renewal and simplifying regulatory touchpoints to encourage ease of compliance and build trust with businesses.Industry representatives also suggested introduction of a trusted taxpayers programme for both direct and indirect taxes, to incentivise compliance and promote a more facilitative regulatory environment.B V R Subrahmanyam, CEO, Niti Aayog, underscored the role of state-level execution in shaping the country's overall investment climate. He emphasised that there is much to learn from within the country, citing diversity of successful models across states. He called for streamlined systems, enhanced accountability, and coordinated efforts between Centre and states to make India the most attractive and dependable destination for global capital.","Rajeev Gauba, member of govt's policy think tank Niti Aayog, said states should undertake reforms aimed at reducing regulatory overreach.

Senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for Congress and other opposition parties, said EC was undertaking a citizenship screening exercise. He said voters in the list were presumed to be citizens of the country and that presumption could not be taken away by the EC.Echoing him, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, for RJD neta Manoj Jha, said there was a procedure under Citizenship Act which had to be followed in deciding citizenship disputes and a person who participated in more than 10 elections since 2003 could not be doubted not to be a citizen without any proof to the contrary.They said the SC ruling and guidelines framed in 1995 in Lal Babu Hussein case were not being followed by EC.

Denied promotions, Varinderjit retired in 2018 at same position he was hired in

PATIALA: A local court here has ordered the attachment of the municipal corporation's office building, the civic commissioner's official car and office assets, including furniture, computers, printers, fans and ACs, for failing to clear Rs 3.2 lakh dues to the family of a deceased Class IV employee. The bailiff is to execute the warrant by July 23.The court set the next hearing for July 27, with an order to the corporation to clear the dues or face further action, including potential auction of the attached properties.The order was passed by the civil judge (junior division), Patiala.Advocate Puneet Sharma, who represented the petitioner, said the deceased employee, Varinderjit Singh, was recruited in 2000 but dismissed in 2001 due to a pending case. After a prolonged legal battle, Punjab and Haryana high court ruled in his favour in 2017 and ordered the civic body to reinstate him and pay him allowances and interest retrospectively for the period he was removed from service.The corporation moved Supreme Court, where its appeal was dismissed, and it had to reinstate Varinderjit. His lawyer contended that Varinderjit was denied promotions and proficiency step-up benefits, forcing him to retire in 2018 at the same position where he was hired.Varinderjit passed away in 2021, leaving his adopted son, Samanjot Singh, to fight for the unpaid dues.Despite repeated orders, the corporation released only a partial payment of Rs 60,485 as principal, leaving over Rs 3.2 lakh, including interest, unpaid. On July 2, the court issued a final warning to the corporation, which went unheeded, leading to Wednesday's order.The court set the next hearing for July 27, with an order to the corporation to clear the dues or face further action, including potential auction of attached properties. ""The court's decision sends a strong message to govt bodies that flouting orders will have serious consequences. If dues remain unpaid, the court may order sale of attached properties,"" said advocate Sharma.Civic commissioner Paramvir Singh said, ""Our legal team is looking into the matter. As per the legal team, the court has issued a warrant of attachment and not attached the property.""In addition to the corporation building and the commissioner's car, the court has ordered the attachment of office assets that include 20 fans, 30 chairs, four coolers, three ACs, 10 almirahs, five tables, four computers, and three printers.","A local court has ordered the attachment of the municipal corporation's office building, the civic commissioner's official car and office assets.

Pantnagar scientists develop long-lasting antibacterial plastic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/pantnagar-scientists-develop-long-lasting-antibacterial-plastic/articleshow/122379130.cms,"



RUDRAPUR: Researchers at GB Pant University of Agriculture and Technology in Pantnagar have developed an antibacterial plastic that resists microbial contamination for up to 72 hours, even when exposed to air and water. This innovation has wide applications in healthcare, food packaging, and daily-use plastics.The decade-long research was led by MGH Zaidi, professor of Chemistry at College of Basic Sciences and Humanities, and Rita Goyal, a retired professor of Microbiology. The project was funded by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Govt of India, with a Rs 36.7 lakh grant under its Nanotechnology Task Force.“People think bottled water is always safe, but once opened, contamination starts. We wanted to create a plastic that naturally resists bacteria,” said Zaidi. Researchers used biodegradable, non-toxic plastics infused with antibacterial nanoparticles via liquid carbon dioxide to create a compound that actively inhibits bacterial growth. Unlike conventional plastics that rely on toxic chemicals, this material is entirely safe for humans and the environment.Now patented, the university is licensing the technology to a manufacturer, with products to be co-branded by Pantnagar University and DBT.","Researchers at GB Pant University of Agriculture and Technology in Pantnagar have developed an antibacterial plastic.

No ‘Make in India’ For Tesla

Elon Musk-led Tesla is set to open its first showroom in India next week. The new showroom for Tesla’s electric cars will open in Mumbai on July 15, according to a Reuters report.With this the Musk-led electric vehicle manufacturer takes a step towards starting operations in India, the world’s third-largest automotive market.Earlier in March, it was reported that Tesla had finalised a lease agreement for its first showroom location in Mumbai, marking its entry into the Indian market.Tesla’s entry into India comes at a time when the EV maker is facing reduced sales in Europe and China.According to a Bloomberg report last month, the first Tesla deliveries to India consist of Model Y rear-wheel drive SUVs, manufactured at the company's Chinese facility. The Model Y currently ranks as the world's most popular electric vehicle.According to the report, Tesla has brought five Model Y vehicles to Mumbai from its Shanghai plant. These vehicles were valued at 2.77 million rupees ($31,988), with an import duty exceeding 2.1 million rupees. This duty corresponds to India's standard 70% tariff, plus additional levies on fully imported vehicles priced below $40,000.A few months ago, the electric vehicle company intensified its recruitment efforts for its Indian operations.Another showroom is expected to open in Delhi-NCR.Last month, Heavy Industries Minister Kumara Swamy confirmed that Tesla has shown no inclination towards setting up electric vehicle production units in India, with their interests limited to establishing showrooms within the country.US President Donald Trump has frequently voiced his opposition to Tesla's possible manufacturing ventures in India, labelling such potential developments as 'very unfair'.Tesla's engagement with India's electric vehicle manufacturing programmes has been minimal.Although Tesla participated in the initial stakeholder meeting about the Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Cars in India, they did not attend the subsequent two consultation sessions.","Elon Musk-led Tesla is set to open its first showroom in India next week.

NEW DELHI: In Pune, Jamaluddin bought over 2 lakh square feet of land for Rs 16 crore through complex agreements that included multiple stakeholders — among them, family members of court staff from the Chief Judicial Magistrate’s office.The deals, investigators say, were just one part of a sprawling operation involving illegal religious conversions and questionable real estate acquisitions across two states.On Saturday, UP’s Anti-Terrorism Squad arrested the 70-year-old — known in Balrampur as Hazrat Baba Jamaluddin ‘Peer Baba’ — along with his wife Nasreen, for allegedly orchestrating a religious conversion network and acquiring property worth over Rs 100 crore using forged or dubious means.In Balrampur alone, the couple is believed to have purchased land worth Rs 1.5 crore and developed it into residential and commercial structures without securing legal land-use conversion.Police say they lived near the Chand Auliya Dargah, where Jamaluddin presented himself as a Sufi spiritual leader and built a loyal following.But Jamaluddin was not always a religious figure.Investigators say he was originally Ghanshyam Rohera, a Mumbai resident who converted to Islam in Dubai in 2015, along with his wife and daughter.The family returned to India soon after, and according to FIRs filed across multiple UP districts, began luring people into Islam through romance, financial inducement or manipulation.“He posed as a spiritual guide but was running a well-structured conversion racket,” said ADG (Law and Order) Amitabh Yash.“People were converted through emotional exploitation, pressure or allurements. We are now uncovering financial and property links as well.”Several FIRs have been lodged against the couple, and authorities suspect a wider network.The ATS is now scrutinising all land deals, especially in Pune, where the names of judicial staff families on agreement papers have raised concern. More arrests are likely as the investigation deepens.","Hazrat Baba Jamaluddin and his wife were arrested on Saturday.

And that is exactly why we counter these statements with facts.In 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine — and with it, a direct assault on Ukrainian culture. As of June 2025, Ukraine’s ministry of culture and information policy reports that more than 1,400 cultural heritage sites have been damaged or destroyed by Russian forces.

The committee called on Russia to refrain from any actions that may damage Ukrainian World Heritage sites — including Saint Sophia Cathedral and Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, and the Historic Centre of Lviv, all now listed as World Heritage in Danger.Additionally, museums have been looted. Schools and churches bombed. Children deported and subjected to forced indoctrination to erase their Ukrainian identity.Since Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, indigenous Crimean Tatars have been targeted with over 110 cultural artifacts being looted and historic landmarks damaged.The Russian Orthodox Church has become a weapon of this cultural war.

HYDERABAD: At least 50 individuals from Telangana who recently migrated to the UAE have gone untraceable after experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms linked to adulterated toddy addiction, activists revealed.These individuals, primarily from Nizamabad and neighbouring regions, are believed to have developed dependencies on chemically-laced toddy back home. Many are unaware that the illicitly spiked drink is addictive and harmful.“Once they reach the UAE, where toddy is unavailable, they begin to suffer from mental health issues and withdrawal complications. Some end up quitting their jobs, while others vanish altogether,” said Mandha Bheem Reddy, vice president of the Telangana government’s NRI Advisory Committee.“There have even been reports of deaths after prolonged withdrawal. Families often contact us for help, but in many cases, the individuals remain missing, and we fear the worst,” he added.Activists warn that what many consider a traditional fermented drink is often adulterated with chemicals. These include alprazolam, chloroform, diazepam, and even substances found in pesticides, all of which have health implications and can cause dependency.“Most toddy drinkers don’t realise that they are consuming a synthetic cocktail. They believe it’s natural, but many shops don’t even source it from trees,” said Chegondi Chandrasekhar, founder of the campaign Dawat Without Daaru (dine without drinks).“Instead, these shops mix harmful substances to boost quantity and profit. It’s time to ban such outlets and raise public awareness,” he said.According to Chandrasekhar, many toddy outlets register as cooperative societies just to gain legal access to toddy trees but later bypass natural extraction.K Venkat Goud, who works with toddy tappers, echoed concerns about the regulatory failure. “There are plenty of toddy trees in Telangana, but there’s no real check on whether the toddy being sold actually comes from them.Paper permissions are often misused, and there’s minimal field-level monitoring,” he said. “The excise department must be more vigilant. Without proper checks, this menace will only grow,” he warned.","Activists warn that what many consider a traditional fermented drink is often adulterated with chemicals.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"Josh Allen abandons Nike and California mansion after marrying Hailee Steinfeld, fans question if these major changes are really his own decisions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/josh-allen-abandons-nike-and-california-mansion-after-marrying-hailee-steinfeld-fans-question-if-these-major-changes-are-really-his-own-decisions/articleshow/122343191.cms,"Josh Allen, the Buffalo Bills quarterback, is making big changes (Image via AP0

Josh Allen lists California home and invests in long-term life in Buffalo

Josh Allen parts ways with Nike and makes a surprise switch to New Balance

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is entering the 2025 NFL season with more than just renewed focus on the gridiron—he’s also making sweeping lifestyle and brand decisions that reflect a deeper transformation both personally and professionally.In a move that marks a turning point, Josh Allen has officially listed his Dana Point, California home for $8.5 million. The sleek $7.2 million property, purchased in 2023, once symbolized a West Coast future, with four bedrooms, three bathrooms, and lush greenery that hinted at dreams of a future family retreat. But those plans appear to have shifted.Instead, Allen is anchoring himself in Orchard Park, New York—just minutes from Highmark Stadium. There, he’s developing a sprawling estate complete with a private lake, sports court, and a full gym. The relocation also aligns with his deepening relationship with actress Hailee Steinfeld , whom he married earlier in 2025. Insiders say Allen is now spending more time at Steinfeld’s Encino estate while building his forever home in Buffalo.Equally surprising is Allen’s quiet yet powerful break from Nike. Known for his collaborations with the sportswear giant since entering the NFL in 2018, Allen was spotted at minicamp sporting silver-metallic New Balance Prodigy cleats—noticeably free of the Swoosh logo. It’s a significant shift that goes beyond fashion.Allen had previously championed Nike exclusives, including retro Deion Sanders editions and high-profile releases like the “Grinch” cleats. His new cleat choice, priced at $170, is more than a stylistic change—it’s a strategic pivot that mirrors his own journey from underestimated prospect to NFL MVP.This brand transition could mark a new chapter for both Allen and New Balance. For Nike, the departure of one of its most prominent NFL faces is notable. Allen’s work with the brand also included philanthropic efforts like directing $100,000 to Oishei Children’s Hospital. Whether such charitable ventures continue under his new brand remains to be seen.Financially, Allen is already a powerhouse. His six-year, $330 million contract—with $250 million guaranteed—cements him as the league’s highest-paid quarterback. But he’s also building a diversified empire, with investments in CorePower Yoga, Skydance Sports, and even pistachio farming—an industry expected to earn him $6.5 million annually.Also Read: Did Hailee Steinfeld distract Josh Allen from football?

Ilya Sorokin trade rumors shut down by agent amid NHL offseason buzz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/ilya-sorokin-trade-rumors-shut-down-by-agent-amid-nhl-offseason-buzz/articleshow/122373406.cms,"USA TODAY Sports

Ilya Sorokin’s agent strongly responds to ongoing trade speculation surrounding the star goaltender

New York Islanders committed to Ilya Sorokin as franchise cornerstone

With the NHL free agency period winding down and news growing scarce, speculation has fueled trade rumors to keep the offseason lively. One of the latest names caught in that swirl is New York Islanders goaltender Ilya Sorokin. However, Sorokin’s agent, Dan Milstein, quickly ended any talk of a potential move, firmly stating that his client is not going anywhere.As rumors picked up suggesting the New York Islanders had considered trading Ilya Sorokin, most notably to the Utah Mammoth for the No. 4 overall draft pick, his agent stepped in to set the record straight. Dan Milstein took to social media platform X to issue a strongly worded denial:“Ilya Sorokin has a full no-trade clause and has never been part of any trade discussions — not at any point. Surprised this needs correcting, but here we are. There’s a difference between reporting facts and creating buzz around yourself.”That statement put an end to speculation that the Islanders were looking to move the 28-year-old star goaltender, who is currently in the second year of an eight-year, $66 million contract signed in July 2023. With a full no-trade clause in place, any deal involving Sorokin would require his explicit approval, something his camp says hasn’t even been discussed.Beyond the contract details, Ilya Sorokin’s performance remains a key reason why the Islanders would be reluctant to move him. Despite a bumpy 2024–25 season for the team, Sorokin still managed a .907 save percentage, a 2.71 goals-against average, and four shutouts across 61 starts. He remains firmly ranked among the NHL’s top goaltenders.Injuries have also made the idea of trading Sorokin illogical. Backup goalie Semyon Varlamov is recovering from lower-body surgery, leaving the Islanders with limited goaltending depth. General manager Mathieu Darche has stressed a focus on stability and development, not roster shake-ups.Ilya Sorokin isn’t going anywhere, and his agent’s comments confirm that the New York Islanders remain committed to their star netminder. As offseason rumors continue to swirl across the NHL, this situation serves as a reminder that not all trade buzz is based in reality, especially when a franchise cornerstone is involved.Also Read: “I can relate”: Jack Eichel reacts to Mitch Marner joining the Vegas Golden Knights","Ilya Sorokin’s agent strongly responds to ongoing trade speculation surrounding the star goaltender.

How companies are reacting to tariffs and what it means for consumer prices

President Donald Trump has sharply expanded a barrage of tariffs since returning to office, aiming to overhaul global trade in favour of the United States. The sweeping measures, which target a broad range of foreign goods and industries, have triggered market fluctuations and strained ties with key American allies.In his latest announcement, Trump said Canada would face a 35% tariff on many goods, citing the country’s alleged role in enabling fentanyl trafficking into the US. The move came just a day after he imposed a sweeping 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil.Trump claimed the Brazil tariff was partly a response to the ongoing trial of his political ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who faces charges related to a failed coup attempt. Reacting strongly, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva vowed retaliation, stating that Brazil ""will not accept being abused by anyone.""Trump also plans to impose a 50% tariff on all copper imports starting August 1, citing national security concerns. The decision could raise costs for US industries reliant on the metal, especially manufacturing and construction.Trump has escalated trade tensions by sending tariff letters to more than 20 countries, warning that higher import duties will take effect from August 1, 2025 if bilateral trade deals are not reached.The move marks a continuation of his aggressive ""reciprocal tariff"" policy first announced in April this year. The letters outline specific tariff rates, some adjusted from earlier levels.Many of the new tariff rates echo those Trump proposed in April, before temporarily suspending them, except for China, to give nations time to negotiate trade deals, according to The New York Times.So far, two countries have managed to reach agreements with the US. A deal with the UK will lower tariffs on cars, steel, and aerospace parts. Another agreement with Vietnam sets a 20% tariff on general imports and a 40% duty on transshipped goods, lower than the initially planned 46%.Meanwhile, representatives from Japan, the EU, Malaysia, South Korea, Indonesia, and others have been meeting US officials to avoid the looming hikes.India is also stepping up talks. A commerce ministry team is expected to visit Washington next week for another round of discussions over the proposed bilateral trade agreement.While exact dates are yet to be confirmed, officials say the focus will be on finalising both interim and phase-one parts of the deal ahead of the tariff deadline, according to sources quoted by PTI.In June, the US doubled tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to 50%. Trump said the move was aimed at countering countries that ""undercut the competitiveness"" of American industries.While intended to protect domestic producers, the higher tariffs are likely to increase costs for US companies that depend on these metals, such as automakers, construction firms, and oil drillers. Consumers may also see higher prices on goods like canned foods.All cars assembled outside the US and all imported auto parts now face a 25% duty. Trump claims the tariffs will boost investment and create jobs in the US, but analysts warn they could significantly raise new car prices and repair costs for consumers.In May, Trump closed the “de minimis” rule, which had allowed retailers to ship goods from abroad—especially China—directly to US buyers without paying tariffs (for packages under $800).The rule helped e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu flourish, but made it hard for US producers to compete. The closure is expected to slow down cheap imports but may also lead to higher prices for online shoppers.He has also issued a warning to the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), threatening an additional 10% tariff on ""any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS.""The European Union is also on Trump’s radar. He claimed the EU was ""formed to screw the US"" and threatened a 50% tariff if trade terms aren’t renegotiated.Trump believes the US trade deficit—when America imports more than it exports—is a sign of economic failure. He sees tariffs as a way to punish countries for ""ripping off"" the US and to bring back jobs and manufacturing.His administration claims that by making imports more expensive, companies will be forced to produce goods domestically, boosting employment and wages.But Trump also uses tariffs as leverage—to push countries into trade deals, extract concessions, or generate revenue that can be used for domestic programs like tax cuts.Experts argue that Trump’s tariff goals are conflicting. While he wants to boost US manufacturing, the higher costs of imported materials like steel and semiconductors can actually hurt American producers by raising their production costs and disrupting supply chains.A tariff is a tax that the government charges on goods brought in from other countries. In the US , these tariffs are paid by American importers—not foreign exporters—and the money collected goes directly to the US Treasury.For example, if Walmart imports shoes worth $100 from Myanmar, which now faces a 40% tariff, the company must pay $40 to the government, The New York Times reported.Walmart’s CEO recently warned that rising tariffs would likely lead to price hikes, prompting former President Trump to publicly urge the company to “eat the tariffs” and avoid raising prices.The ripple effects of tariffs are being felt across supply chains. With the US heavily reliant on Chinese factories for products like toys and Christmas decorations, many businesses have begun pausing holiday orders. Toymaker Mattel has already announced it will raise prices on US toys in response to tariffs on Chinese imports.While tariffs are known to drive up consumer prices, major inflation indicators like the Consumer Price Index have yet to reflect a sharp increase.Economists suggest it's only a matter of time. Many companies stocked up on inventory ahead of tariff hikes, helping delay price increases, but as those supplies run out, consumers may soon see the difference at checkout.","President Donald Trump has sharply expanded a barrage of tariffs since returning to office.
