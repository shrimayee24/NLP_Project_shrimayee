■ Strategic autonomy is the core principle of French diplomacy and it is also the case with India. We have the same view on the Indo-Pacific. My president has always been very clear. We oppose any kind of hegemon in the region.We realise that thanks to this strategic partnership, which celebrated its 25th anniversary two years ago, our common interest is really to work hand in hand in different sectors. That’s why we adopted a new roadmap when PM Modi visited France.Defence and security really is the core of our partnership. We just had good news about the Rafale (M) aircraft. In the coming months and years, you will see more... Make in India is a priority for India and all our big stakeholders in the defence industry want to play the game. That means coming to India, building in India and transfer of technology. That’s the key.What we have done through a new roadmap is to enlarge the relationship. We have three pillars. The first is defence and security. The second is what we call the partnership for the planet... issues like climate change and biodiversity protection. The third pillar is, for me, maybe the most challenging because it’s the key to long-term (ties): people-topeople exchanges. Indian diaspora in France is quite small compared to your diaspora in other countries. And one of the consequences is that the number of students in France is also very small.■ Our president gave us a very ambitious target, to very rapidly have 30,000 Indian students (8,000 registered for 20232024, 10,000 threshold expected to be achieved this year). We have created a mechanism for international classes and signed agreements with 35 universities. And in those universities, we have specific classes only for Indians ( classes internationales ).We haven’t done this for other countries. So, we take Indian students at the end of high school, send them to those classes for one year (where) they will have intensive French learning and, at the same time, start courses for the curriculum they would like to follow. It means that after one year, there is no language problem.French business schools now are among the best in the world. What is very interesting is that since last year Indian students are the top foreign nationality in our business school. For the simple reason that in these schools the curriculum is totally in English. It suggests that Indian students find France attractive. We have a different approach to student mobility. Our intention is not to attract hundreds of thousands of students. We want to attract the best. And we want those students to come back to India because we want our university partnership and student mobility to be part of our strategic partnership.We have about 800 French companies in the country. They are already employing more than 500,000 Indians. So, we tell our Indian students, well, try to learn French but, if not, you go to France anyway to study and after you graduate, you come back to your country because your country needs you and you can help us develop this strategic partnership. We don’t want to facilitate any brain drain.■ Well, I think the new American administration has brought to the international scene more volatility and unpredictability. I would say that more than ever the strategic partnership between France and India is the key. Stability is important. And it’s not a question only for govts, it’s also essential for the private sector. I see an advantage in this new situation... which is that once again partnerships like the one we have with India are going to be very important. We just had a historic visit by the European Commission president during which it was announced that the India-EU FTA will be finalised by the end of this year.■ My answer to that is simple. When it comes to transfer of technology, or rehabilitation of the industrial sector, you won’t be able to find a better offer than that from the French. Judge us from the past and from the present. And what you have seen so far is just the beginning of a long journey. Our Indian partners trust us. They know that our industry is here to stay, to invest, as I said, to produce, to make in India,to do transfer of technology. I’m not sure that other stakeholders would be ready to do the same.■ In Europe, we have rules not to put barriers in our market. As a matter of fact, the European market is the most open in the world.It means huge opportunities for Indian companies. But, at the same time, we have rules which are there for everybody. Like for our own companies… protecting the environment, for example. It’s well known that we have a strong interest in the agri business, in exporting wines, champagne.... For Germany, it will be the automotive sector. India has its own interests. We have to sit around the table and look at all the parameters. I am confident that now there is political will on both sides for that.■ You have to understand there is one aggressor, Russia, and one country that has been invaded — Ukraine. An offer of peace has been put on the table and the US contributed to it. And Ukraine is eager for peace but not Russia.In order to have peace, everybody has to come to the table, including Russia. But that’s not the case. Most EU countries now realise they need to take their future into their own hands as far as security and defence is concerned. I’m sure that in a couple of years, when peace is back in Ukraine, you will see a totally different Europe. Our dream, to some extent, would be to have this strategic autonomy at the European level, which is obviously not the case so far.■ The need for unity and autonomy is clearly shared by all EU members. Ukraine was a real trigger for all of us to understand that we shouldn’t rely on outsiders. Look at Germany. The decisions they have taken are historic. Like the next chancellor’s decision to invest massively in defence. The way Europe sees itself is changing. But obviously it will take some time.■ Having a strategic partnership and very close relations with India means that we talk of everything. On the French journalist issue, a solution was found. Both countries trust each other and that is the core of the relationship.■ When you want to go to France as a tourist, we do our best at the Embassy of France in India to process the visa application in 48 hours after we receive the file. As France is part of Schengen zone, we are also bound by Schengen rules. We really want to welcome more Indian tourists, students, professionals.■ Well, I think it’s essential for these two big giants in the world and in Asia to find a way to fully normalise their relations. What I said about India being a key for finding solutions to challenges like global health, climate change is true also for China. At some point, the two countries will have to find a way to not just resolve the border issue but also find ways to address the big challenges that the world is facing. The 20th century to some extent or the 19th century was the West’s century. Now, all eyes are on Asia. And you have two big players — India and China. We naturally wish they can have normal relations.","French ambassador to India Thierry Mathou tells TOI how his country is looking to widen bilateral ties, expand trade, attract more students and tourists and double down on the defence partnership. India-EU FTA will be finalised by the end of this year, Mathou says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121151342,imgsize-562423,width-400,resizemode-4/un.jpg"
Operation Sindoor: PM Modi has kept women at centre of India's retaliation against Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-pm-modi-has-kept-women-at-centre-of-indias-retaliation-against-pakistan/articleshow/121148779.cms,"Op Sindoor: Hidden Meaning Behind Codename Will Surprise You | India ‘Punishes’ Pak

NEW DELHI: From naming ' Operation Sindoor ' to deploying women officers to present India's perspective to the world and dedicating the success of the Indian armed forces in destroying terror hubs in Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has kept women at the centre of India's retaliation against the hostile neighbour.Calling the Pahalgam terror attack a personal tragedy, PM Modi on Monday had dedicated the bravery and courage of the armed forces involved in 'Operation Sindoor' to every mother, sister and daughter of the nation.PM Modi said the barbarity displayed by terrorists in Pahalgam had shocked the entire country and the world.Stating that more than 100 dreaded terrorists were killed in the strikes by India, PM Modi said not only were the buildings of terrorist organisations destroyed, but their courage was also badly shaken. ""The terrorists had wiped out the sindoor of our sisters, and India responded by destroying their terrorist headquarters,"" he said.Sindoor, or vermilion, is a symbol of marriage in Hindu custom. The word derives from the Sanskrit word Sindura, referring to red, orange-red or maroon cosmetic powder worn by married Hindu women in the parting of their hair. Sources said naming the operation after vermilion was suggested by PM himself, who wanted a strong message to be sent to the terrorists about the consequences of hurting Indian women.Since the operation was launched, several parents have named their newborn baby girls 'Sindoor' in many parts of the country, with such reports emerging from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.Also read: 17 newborns named ‘Sindoor’ in UP’s Kushinagar Details of the retaliatory attacks on Pakistan were given to the world by two women officers - Col Sofia Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh.

The attempt was to both embarrass India and also extract sensitive information about its defence systems, including its missiles, they said.According to Interpol trainer and cyber forensic expert Pendyala Krishna Shastry, the attacks were part of a broader campaign waged by Pakistani actors against Indian digital assets.

No, it compromises security. Yes, as history shows.

NEW DELHI: Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday appealed to the opposition parties to rise above political divisions and support the Narendra Modi-led government’s efforts to explore peaceful means of engagement, particularly in the wake of a recent ceasefire initiative.In a detailed post on X, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said, “The Modi government should not be politically penalised for exploring peaceful means. This is a time for bipartisan statesmanship, not division. The opposition must rise above politics and support genuine efforts for peace and stability.”Calling for a national consensus, Mufti added, “I appeal all the opposition parties to resist the urge for knee-jerk criticism or political point-scoring. Just as the Pahalgam incident united voices from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, there is need to build a national consensus around a peace process that safeguards national interests.”She pointed to examples from the past, noting that, “Leaders like former Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh proved that cross-border engagement is possible even in tense times, without compromising security or sovereignty.”In a strong critique of television news channels, Mufti said, “Those who criticise the ceasefire from the comfort of air-conditioned studios and drawing rooms should spend time with their families on the borders to truly understand the daily reality of death and destruction.”In an earlier post on the platform, Mufti also accused the media of distracting the public from real issues, saying, “While fanatic mobs in our country are vandalising shops, bulldozing mosques and digging up graves to punish the long dead Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, across the border his namesake Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed is training his forces for modern air warfare.”She concluded with a warning about media-fuelled narratives, “High time that India wakes up to the toxic narratives being amplified by television channels that have dangerously distracted the country from its real challenges and priorities.”","Mehbooba Mufti appeals to the opposition parties to support the Narendra Modi- led government’s efforts to explore peaceful means of engagement.

Poll Which aspect of the Akash missile system do you find most impressive? Its cost-effectiveness and indigenous development Its ability to counter drones and missiles effectively

India's AKASH Defence System Outfoxes Pakistan, Nips Drone Attacks In The Bud | 'My Baby Worked'

NEW DELHI: It took 15 years, a thousand scientists and combined effort of several defence labs situated across the country to develop the indigenous Akash missile defence system that successfully passed its first battlefield test along the western borders with Pakistan, said a proud Prahlada Ramarao , the then project director of the totally-indigenous missile shield programme of Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ).The Akash missile defence system proved its mettle when it successfully countered waves of drone and missile attacks from Pakistan during the night of May 8 and 9. Indian military officials have confirmed the effectiveness of India’s missile defence systems like Akash and S400 Triump when IAF DGMO Air Marshal AK Bharti on Monday asserted that India’s defence systems “stood like a wall”, preventing enemy breaches.On Akash clearing its first ‘agni-pariksha’ and boosting India’s ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence production, Ramarao, a Padma Shri recipient, told TOI, “My eyes welled up when my baby worked so well. It is the happiest day of my life. This is bigger than my Padma award.”Ramarao was handpicked by India’s ‘Missile Man’ Dr APJ Abdul Kalam as the youngest project director at the age of 35 to head the Akash programme in early 1990s. Kalam was then head of DRDO’s defence laboratory Defence Research Laboratory (DRL) in Hyderabad, before he became scientific adviser to the defence minister and subsequently the President of India. “A leader brings team spirit and inspires all to work towards a common goal. Kalam was a true leader in that sense. The country now requires 10 Abdul Kalams to grow and develop in various fields like the way the aerospace and defence sectors grew under him,” he said.Though Akash had undergone numerous test trials and later user trials by the Army and IAF, this was the first time the missile defence witnessed a real battlefield condition when Pakistan attacked India with missiles and drones. Both Indian Army and IAF have strategically deployed this missile system alongside the western border as Akash has the capability to neutralise aerial targets like fighter jets, cruise missiles and air-to-surface missiles and even drones. The real time multi-sensor data processing and threat evaluation enables simultaneous engagement of multiple targets from any direction.“We started work on this project in 1994 with an initial budget of Rs 300 crore. When you invent something, you fail several times. We also failed. But we learnt from our mistakes. Developing Rajendra, a complex multi-function electronically scanned phased array radar, was the biggest challenge. But we overcame that challenge after several hits and trials. Later, the project budget was raised to Rs 500 crore,” Ramarao said.“I guarantee you, nowhere in the world a missile defence system could have been invented in just Rs 500 crore. Our Akash is the cheapest but most effective missile shield. It can detect a hostile missile from a distance of 70km and kill it at a 30km range,” the DRDO veteran, now 78 years old, said.After its development in 2009, Akash has since undergone continuous evolution, resulting in the development of several variants, each with enhanced capabilities tailored to address specific operational requirements. These variants include initial Mark-I, upgraded Akash-1S with an indigenous seeker, high-accuracy Akash Prime designed for high-altitude and low-temperature operations, and advanced next-generation Akash-NG, which boasts significantly extended range and sophisticated features.As per an estimate, IAF has inducted a substantial number of Akash systems, with reports indicating the induction of 15 squadrons. Army operates four regiments of Aakash, with plans for further acquisitions to augment its air defence capabilities.Impressed with its efficient working, Armenia became the first country to ink a deal with India in 2022 to procure 15 Akash missile systems worth around Rs 6,000 crore. Last year, India had dispatched the first batch of the missile systems to the central Asian country to protect its borders.",The Akash missile defence system proved its mettle when it successfully countered waves of drone and missile attacks from Pakistan during the night of May 8 and 9.

Gender integration in defence services calibrated to operational needs: Government

NEW DELHI: The Centre has told Supreme Court that men and women are recruited to the Judge Advocate General (JAG or legal) department in the Army through separate service selection boards (SSBs) because women officers are not readied for combat roles, while the men get mandatorily attached to artillery units as part of induction.A woman had challenged separate SSBs and merit lists for male and female officers recruited to the department. The apex court had reserved its verdict on the plea and asked the Centre to file its submissions.Govt said operational readiness determines vacancies in Army, and as a policy, women officers aren't meant for frontline combat deployment where contact with enemies is likely. They aren't deployed for counter-insurgency or counter-terror forces, such as Rashtriya Rifles & Assam Rifles, it cited.Countering the petitioner's argument before a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan that JAG officers do not have combat roles, the Centre said not only do the male officers get attached to artillery units but are also expected to discharge the role of combatants in case of armed conflicts. It cited their deployment in Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka and Kargil operations.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said on behalf of the Centre, ""Due to the prevailing operational scenario, Indian Army has a standing operational deployment unlike modern western armies. India is surrounded by states inimical to our interests along the immediate neighbourhood. This implies that our Army is mandated to maintain operational readiness to undertake conventional operations along northern and Western borders.""Without referring to Operation Sindoor , govt said, ""No one can predict when the next conflict arises, in which or both borders, at what force level, and whether as a full-scale war or limited operations. Depending on the operational need and force strength, combatant personnel deployed in peacetime duties get mobilised irrespective of their arm/service to boost the operational necessities of the regular Army.""Arguing against judicial interference based on gender parity without considering its impact on operational readiness of armed forces , the Centre said, ""Gender integration in the defence services is an evolving process and is calibrated to the operational needs and is subjected to periodic review and studies. The intake policies (for JAG) have evolved progressively from 70:30 ratio to 50:50 from this year.","A woman had challenged separate SSBs and merit lists for male and female officers recruited to the department.

JAIPUR: As border tensions rippled into wildlife zones, conservationists raced to shield newborn Great Indian Bustard babies from warzone - and keep fragile recovery efforts alive. Nine chicks were relocated from a key conservation site in Rajasthan's Jaisalmer district following drone incursions and artillery fire from Pakistan.Sensitive to loud sounds and shockwaves, bustards are particularly vulnerable during early stages of life.Ramdevra Conservation Centre, located just a few km from Indo-Pak border, hosts the country's sole bustard recovery programme. Following shelling on May 10, scientists and forest officials moved nine of the 18 chicks born this year to a safer facility in Arwar village of Ajmer district - nearly 500km east. ""The chicks, aged between five and 28 days, were transported in soft-suspension vehicles fitted with padded compartments and sand bedding to reduce stress during the 10-hour journey,"" said Sutirtha Dutta, senior scientist at Wildlife Institute of India (WII).Several of the chicks were hatched through artificial incubation - an effort to revive one of India's most endangered bird species, with fewer than 130 believed to remain in the wild.""The relocation was carried out successfully.

NEW DELHI: When Justice Sanjiv Khanna became the CJI in November last year, many thought it was poetic justice 50 years after his uncle Justice H R Khanna , through a historic political blunder in 1977, was denied the top post for his courageous dissent in support of fundamental rights during the Emergency even though four of his cowering colleagues caved in to govt's brute power.Justice Khanna's tenure as the CJI was short but eventful and challenging. What brought forth his steely resolve to serve transparency and call a spade a spade was the discovery of a huge amount of cash at Delhi high court judge Yashwant Varma's residence. He uploaded videos and the Delhi HC CJ's reports on the incident on the SC website, leaving little to the imagination and winning kudos from the public for meeting challenges head on.On his last working day in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, CJI Khanna said, "" Public trust in judiciary cannot be commanded. It has to be earned."" With CJI-designate B R Gavai as his colleague on the ceremonial bench, Justice Khanna said, ""The country is getting an excellent CJI who is going to uphold fundamental rights, rule of law and the basic doctrines of the Constitution."" He attributed his upbringing and values to his grandfather Sarav Dayal, who was an advocate and an ardent believer in interaction of children with elders.In an informal meeting with SC reporters, CJI Khanna said he won't accept any post-retirement job but he would not give up law and do something related to law.CJI Khanna is a man who walked alone, without security, both in the judicial arena and Lodhi Garden. He inherited the legacy of fearlessness and fairness from his uncle, Justice H R Khanna who was denied the CJI's post because he stood by fundamental rights during Emergency. But justice was probably served when Justice Sanjiv Khanna became the 51st CJI, nearly 50 years after that historical blunder. However, he shunned both the legacy and publicity.Justice Gavai said, ""For a judge, there is no greater privilege than to preside over a bench and decide cases without fear and favour."" CJI Khanna's basics are deeply entrenched in the ideals of justice. He inherited the great H R Khanna's legacy but emerged from the shadow and painted his own legacy through sheer diligence and hard work. His judgments strengthened constitutional principles and ethos - of liberty and rule of law.Another bench partner for the last 10 months, Justice Sanjay Kumar said CJI Khanna never had a summary of the case before him yet remembered page numbers, paragraphs and the content line by line. Asked about this, CJI Khanna had told TOI, ""It is an acquired trait. After becoming a judge, somehow I started remembering the content of the case files line by line.""Law officers - attorney general R Venkataramani, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitors general S V Raju and Aishwarya Bhat - who mostly faced the brunt of intense questioning from CJI Khanna, were the most eloquent in praising his judicial acumen, integrity and courage. ""Clarity, sense of justice, something to always learn, crisp judgments that were not thesis, a man who honoured the chair and increased its dignity,"" were some of the accolades that came his way.","CJI Khanna is a man who walked alone, without security, both in the judicial arena and Lodhi Garden.

KOLKATA: A 26-year-old air passenger from Imphal was arrested at Kolkata airport on Monday afternoon for allegedly uttering the word ""bomb"" while preparing to board a Mumbai-bound IndiGo flight. The incident triggered a full-scale security alert and delayed flight operations.The flyer, Regal Chongtham, reportedly told an IndiGo security officer at the step ladder point in Hindi, ""Mere paas bomb hai?"" (Do I have a bomb?), moments before boarding IndiGo flight 6E 5227, scheduled to depart for Mumbai at 1.30 pm from Bay 57L.According to officials, Chongtham grew frustrated while interacting with airline staff during the secondary ladder point checking and multiple checks of passengers' baggage as part of enhanced security measures because of the current tension between India and Pakistan.In an apparent act of sarcasm, he remarked, ""Mere paas bomb hai"" to an airline employee. Security personnel, adhering to strict airport safety protocols, immediately apprehended him and initiated emergency procedures.Upon receiving the alert, the Bomb Threat Assessment Committee (BTAC) was activated and classified the situation as ""specific"", leading to the aircraft being moved to an isolation bay in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOP).The airport's Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) and a sniffer dog unit promptly arrived at the scene to inspect Chongtham's belongings.Security protocols were quickly enforced, and all boarding operations were suspended. At the time of the incident, 179 of 186 passengers had already boarded. The remaining passengers and crew were de-boarded, and the aircraft underwent a thorough inspection.Following a thorough examination using explosive vapour detectors (EVDs), authorities declared his luggage safe, and no threats were found. Despite this, security measures were intensified, and relevant agencies were informed.Chongtham, who earlier arrived in Kolkata from Imphal on flight 6E 6716, was taken into custody for questioning. He is a resident of Sega Road Jonjeng Hajailukai in Imphal and was staying at a hostel in Mumbai.Cops said they were probing the motive behind the statement. Preliminary reports suggest the possibility of a prank or poor judgment on the part of the flyer, though officials have not ruled out other possibilities.Flight operations resumed after security agencies cleared the aircraft. No explosive materials were found.Authorities have reiterated the importance of adhering to strict security protocols at airports . They emphasised that making bomb-related remarks, even in jest, can lead to serious legal consequences, including detention or arrest.""We always urge passengers to remain cautious and cooperative during security checks to ensure the safety and smooth functioning of airport operations,"" said a senior airport official.","Regal Chongtham, 26, reportedly told an IndiGo security officer at the step ladder point in Hindi, ""Mere paas bomb hai?""

ISRO Deploys 10 Satellites To Assist Indian Military In Anti-Pakistan Mission; ‘At The Border…’

BENGALURU: Indian armed forces used a wide range of space assets - domestic and international commercial - to carry out Operation Sindoor , multiple sources have confirmed to TOI.“All of our strategic assets were put to use in different ways by our armed forces for Operation Sindoor. Our teams have been working round the clock and we are proud that Isro could help our forces in missions important for the country,” a senior official from Isro told TOI.Another official said that aside from domestic assets directly available with the armed forces (India has 9-11 military satellites ), Isro also facilitated “repeatable” data from a commercial global operator. “While data from our satellites from the Cartosat series and others were also used for planning, images were procured from Maxar ,” the senior official said.Maxar, the US-based satellite imagery provider supplies images to multiple governments and non-government entities across the world, while it remains unclear if Pakistan used its services for any of its operations during the current conflict. It is noteworthy that Pakistan also has access to the extensive military space assets of China.Indian armed forces also have access to other satellite data from Sentinel from Europe and another commercial operator from the US.“Indian satellites provide periodic data - with downloads of specific areas possible about once in 14 days. This data was made use of, while they used commercial data that’s available once a day too,” the official said.The Cartosat family of satellites, with high-resolution imagery and dual-use (image & video) capabilities, has been a key asset in India’s military intelligence toolkit. Launched for the first time in 2005, and progressively upgraded with satellites like the Cartosat-2C (for military), these satellites have provided crucial imagery for operations.Cartosat-2C, for example, delivers images with a resolution of 0.65 metres- an improvement over previous models- and has been vital in reconnaissance and surveillance operations. The high-resolution images from Cartosat can capture areas of interest (AOI) with incredible clarity, enabling commanders to make precise decisions based on intelligence from space. These were used for the 2016 Surgical Strike.Aside from Cartosat, the Risat family of satellites would have provided radar images useful to track movement, while the Gsat family of satellites were used for communications. “In all, a variety of Indian space assets have been useful and efforts are on to increase support to the armed forces in the years to come,” the official said. India’s NavIC combined with other global GPS systems also aided in operations.Indian Space Association (ISpA) director-general Lt Gen (retd) AK Bhat, said: “There would have been extensive use of space assets for imagery, sat-com (satellite communication) and PNT (positioning, navigation and timing). Space technology is an integral part of modern warfare.”Isro chairman V Narayanan, who said Sunday that 10 satellites are working round the clock for the armed forces, did not specifically comment on Operation Sindoor. He, however, told TOI: “We will be launching another important satellite on May 18, the EOS-09 or Risat-1B, which will add teeth to our armed forces.”“The satellite features an advanced C-band synthetic aperture radar system that delivers high-resolution Earth surface imagery in all weather conditions. This capability significantly enhances India’s surveillance capabilities,” he added. Unlike conventional optical satellites limited by cloud cover or darkness, Risat-1B’s radar technology penetrates these obstacles effectively.Earlier this month, Narayanan had said that India would launch 100-150 satellites in the next five years. Among these would be the 52 satellites part of the Space-Based Surveillance-3 (SBS-3) programme. Thirty-one of these will be developed by the private sector.","Indian armed forces used a wide range of space assets - domestic and international commercial - to carry out Operation Sindoor, multiple sources have confirmed to TOI.

Gold Card offers Permanent Residency, Not Citizenship

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given an update on President Donald Trump ’s Gold Card visa program. In a post on Twitter, Elon Musk wrote that the Gold Card Visa programme is quietly being tested to ensure the system works properly. ""We’re doing a quiet trial to make sure the system works properly. Once it is fully tested, it will be rolled out to the public with an announcement by the President,"" Elon Musk wrote in a post on Twitter in response to a tweet from MarioNawfal.A task force under Elon Musk is reportedly working on the new US immigration initiative offering ""Gold Card"" residency visas for $5 million each. Engineers from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are working with the State Department, Department of Homeland Security , and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to create a streamlined application system and website. According to a report in New York Times, the project is led by DOGE engineers Marko Elez and Edward Coristine, who are integrating federal vetting processes into the new system. Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia has joined, initially tasked with digitizing federal retirement systems. Elez resigned in February after controversy over a pseudonymous social media account linked to racist posts and eugenics-based immigration views, but he has since collaborated with federal agencies. Coristine, a 19-year-old known online as “Big Balls,” was previously fired from a 2022 internship at Path due to a data leak.The Gold Card program aims to fast-track residency for high-net-worth individuals, bypassing the lengthy traditional visa process with expedited background checks and interviews, targeting approval within two weeks. Unlike the EB-5 visa program, which offers green cards for $800,000-$1.05 million investments creating 10 U.S. jobs, the Gold Card focuses on revenue generation, replacing the EB-5’s $4 billion annual contribution.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed 1,000 Gold Cards have been sold, granting permanent residency to vetted individuals who pay $5 million and abide by U.S. laws. Musk is reportedly developing the software, with a launch expected soon. Former President Trump, who first proposed the Gold Cards in February as a pathway for “very high-level people,” recently showcased a mock-up featuring his image, the Statue of Liberty, and a bald eagle, projecting a debut within weeks.","Gold Card Visa programme is quietly being tested to ensure the system works properly.

"Nintendo Switch Pre Orders : Nintendo President fears Switch 2 price hike amid tariff wars, as ""people will have less money to spend on game consoles""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/nintendo-president-fears-switch-2-price-hike-amid-tariff-wars-as-people-will-have-less-money-to-spend-on-game-consoles/articleshow/121101516.cms,"Tariffs threaten consumer spending power, says Furukawa

Nintendo balances pricing against adoption goals

Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa expressed concerns that the company may need to increase the price of the upcoming Switch 2 console in the United States due to recently implemented tariffs on Chinese imports. The revelation came during Nintendo's May 8 earnings call, just weeks before the console's scheduled June 5 launch.""If the assumptions regarding tariffs change significantly, we would like to consider what price adjustments we should make and implement them after considering various aspects,"" Furukawa stated, addressing the potential impact on the already premium-priced $449.99 console.Nintendo's forecast assumes tariffs of 10% on products from Japan, Vietnam, and Cambodia, while Chinese imports face a staggering 145% tariff (as of now, US and China are renegotiating the trade terms, which possibly could lower the tariff). The company expects these trade measures to impact profits by ""tens of billions of yen.""Furukawa highlighted broader economic concerns beyond direct manufacturing costs. ""If prices of daily necessities like food increase (because of the tariffs), then people will have less money to spend on game consoles. If we were to adjust the price of the Switch 2, this could decrease demand.""While Nintendo primarily manufactures Switch hardware for North America in Vietnam, certain accessories and amiibo figures come from China, subjecting them to higher tariff rates.Despite these challenges, Nintendo forecasts selling 15 million Switch 2 units in its first year – matching the original Switch's debut performance – though analysts describe this projection as ""conservative"" given the tariff uncertainties.The company faces a delicate balancing act between covering increased costs and maintaining consumer interest. ""Nintendo will carefully consider various factors when changing any pricing, including its acceptability to customers,"" Furukawa emphasized.The Switch 2 isn't alone in facing potential price hikes. Microsoft has already increased Xbox Series S prices by $80 and Series X by $100, while some smaller gaming hardware companies have suspended U.S. shipments entirely due to prohibitive tariff costs.Pre-orders for the Switch 2 opened on April 24 following a brief delay related to tariff concerns, with Nintendo warning that release-day delivery cannot be guaranteed due to overwhelming d","Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa expressed concerns that the company may need to increase the price of the upcoming Switch 2 console.

Driven by Angel's obsession and Sunita's refusal to grant a divorce, they hired contract killers.





NEW DELHI: Angel Gupta , a 26-year-old model, lived a life that blurred the lines between her on-screen roles and reality. An actress in small films and TV soaps-often revolving around love, deceit, and murder-she brought a real-life crime thriller to life, one that ultimately spiralled out of control.A chance encounter, a whispered secret, and a sinister plot unfolded. Around winter of 2016, Angel met Manjeet , 35, at a nightclub in south Delhi. In the discotheque, where strobe lights cast eerie shadows, her meeting with him sparked a fatal attraction.Born to an Indian father and a British mother, Angel inherited her mother's charm. With a dazzling smile and striking looks, she easily captivated those around her. Originally named Shashi Prabha, she was a Delhi girl with big dreams who transformed herself into Angel Gupta on Mumbai's modelling circuit.After spending time in Germany, she claimed to be London-born and returned, boosting her profile. Soon, she was a regular at parties, featured in item songs and magazine covers. With around 20 item numbers and a few small movie cameos to her name, Angel believed she had made it. But fate had other plans.When Mumbai's glamour failed to sustain her, Angel packed her bags and returned to Delhi. Her earlier aspirations faded, replaced by months of uncertainty with no assignments in sight.The Rs 50,000 rent, once effortlessly covered by her stepfather, now became a pressing concern.As the joblessness dragged on, Angel's life became increasingly defined by her fixation on Manjeet. Her failed modelling career and lack of opportunities intensified an unhealthy obsession, turning Manjeet into an all-consuming focus. The more she struggled to revive her career, the more she craved validation through Manjeet, recalled an investigator.By summer 2018, Angel decided she wanted to make the relationship formal. The only obstacle: Manjeet was married to Sunita , 38, a teacher and mother of two.Sunita was aware of her husband's affair. But instead of seeking a divorce, she insisted he end it. A devoted mother, she began documenting the emotional storm in a diary. Her refusal to separate from Manjeet pushed Angel to the edge. No one knew she would stop at nothing to eliminate the obstacle in her path.In desperation, Manjeet and Angel turned to her stepfather, Rajeev. Together, they orchestrated a sinister plan. Rajeev's driver, Deepak, helped them find two contract killers, who were paid Rs 2.5 lakh as advance, with Rs 7.5 lakh promised after the murder.Two weeks before the murder, Manjeet and Angel mapped out Sunita's daily route alongside the hired killers, even staging a rehearsal of the crime. Angel rode a scooter, simulating Sunita's commute to Haryana to ensure every detail was covered. The plan was locked in, with the murder scheduled on the day of Karva Chauth, Oct 25, 2018, which failed.On Oct 29, 2018, when Sunita left for school, Manjeet informed the shooters. Rajeev and Deepak were nearby, in contact with the killers. Sunita was ambushed near the Dariyapur police chowki and shot dead. The assailants fled the scene.A high-stakes investigation followed. Police traced a trail of digital clues-bank transactions, mobile tower locations, call records, and CCTV footage. These cracks began to expose the conspiracy.It was the suspects' shaky alibis and suspicious behaviour that first raised red flags. Forensic experts examined evidence closely. Recovered vehicles and firearms narrowed the circle. But the real turning point came from Sunita's diary, handed over to police by her daughter. Its contents sealed the killers' fate.The investigation culminated with the arrest of Angel, Manjeet, and the shooters.Seven years later, on April 28, a court found the accused guilty, appreciating the meticulous police work. Three days ago, the court sentenced all to life imprisonment . For Sunita's children, the pain of loss remains, but the verdict brought closure.Behind bars, the connection between Manjeet and Angel remains evident. Within the cold, unyielding walls of Tihar Jail, their stolen glances offer fleeting comfort, while expressions are untouched by regret. The burden of their crime appears to rest lightly, if at all, on their conscience, as they serve their life sentences.","Angel Gupta and her lover Manjeet orchestrated the murder of his wife, Sunita, a teacher and mother of two, in Delhi.

"200 years after inception, north India’s oldest church breaks from English-only past with first Hindi service",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/200-years-after-inception-north-indias-oldest-church-breaks-from-english-only-past-with-first-hindi-service/articleshow/121152260.cms,"St John’s Church in Meerut, a historical landmark built by the British, held its first Hindi prayer service, marking a significant shift from its English-only tradition.





MEERUT: Two centuries after it was founded to serve a British military garrison, St John’s Church in Meerut — believed to be the oldest church in North India built by the British — conducted its first-ever Hindi prayer service this week, a quiet but potent shift from its longstanding English-only liturgical tradition. The timing was deliberate: the inaugural service was held on Sunday, a day after the anniversary of the 1857 uprising that began in this very city, and which forever changed the trajectory of British rule in India.Set behind a curtain of tall trees and colonial-era facades, St John’s Church is not just a religious structure but a repository of layered histories. Its weathered plaques commemorate lives lost during the mutiny; its pews and gothic style windows speak to a design language imported from across the sea but rooted in the heat and dust of the Gangetic plains. Completed in 1822 and consecrated two years later by Bishop Reginald Heber — who travelled from Kolkata (then Calcutta) to Meerut over three arduous months, part of it on elephant back — the church was conceived as a spiritual outpost of the empire, designed in the classical Palladian style. Today, that same building, with its high ceilings, marble baptistery, and once-grand pipe organ, witnessed a different kind of milestone.“What better occasion than the anniversary of the 1857 rebellion — which began here in Meerut on May 10—to introduce a service in the language of the people?” said Reverend Rinvi Noel, the church’s presbyter in charge. “It opens the doors of this historic space to Hindi-speaking Christians while continuing our English services as usual.”The decision, however, did not come without deliberation. Long-standing church members, particularly from the old families or hailing from non-Hindi speaking states, were hesitant about altering the church’s English-only tradition. “This church is steeped in history and its English service is part of that heritage,” said a member on condition of anonymity. “Introducing a bilingual service felt like a compromise. So, we opted instead for a separate Hindi service.”Another member remarked, ""Many army officers stationed here come from states where Hindi isn't commonly spoken, so offering services in English is more suitable for them.""For locals like Anuradha Masih, the announcement of service in Hindi came as a relief. “I always wanted to be part of the worship here,” she said, “but language was a barrier. It’s wonderful that a Hindi service is now being offered — we’re looking forward to participating.”Yet for others, the shift marks a long-overdue recognition of the community the church now serves—no longer a garrison town, but a mixed, evolving urban population. Reverend Noel noted that several Christian families stationed temporarily in the Meerut cantonment had already expressed interest in attending the new service. “Now, they are joining,” she said.The symbolism of the moment is inescapable. On the very anniversary of the revolt that challenged colonial dominance, the church that once stood as a monument to that Empire made space for India’s majority language. As Dr K K Sharma, head of the history department at Chaudhary Charan Singh University, put it, “This church has always stood witness to major historical events. Today, it adds another chapter to that legacy. The introduction of Hindi worship marks a symbolic culmination of Indian ownership.”Indeed, the walls of St John’s have held stories far older than this week’s development. The church, built for Rs 56,000, was once attended by the likes of the Marquis of Hastings, then Governor-General of India. Its cemetery holds the remains of British officers and civilians, including Colonel John Finnis — believed to be the first British officer killed in the 1857 uprising. The inscription above the arched entrance reads: “The first house of worship erected by the British in the then Upper Provinces of India. ”","St John’s Church in Meerut is believed to be the oldest church in North India built by the British.

MUMBAI: Despite delays in the arrival of key girders and a penalty imposed on the contractor of Rs 1.80 crore, the BMC remains optimistic about completing the Carnac Bridge reconstruction by June 10, next month.Civic officials said the girders, which were to arrive by April 30, finally arrived over the weekend. While valuable time was lost, the damage is “not irreversible”.When delays came to the notice of the civic body, an engineer was stationed at the manufacturing plant in Daman last week to oversee dispatch and ensure timely delivery.A BMC official said, “When the girders failed to arrive on April 30, we began imposing penalties on the contractor from May 1. For the first two days, the penalty was Rs 10 lakh per day. From the third day onward, up to May 10, the penalty increased to Rs 20 lakh per day, bringing the total to Rs 1.8 crore. The plate girders, which form part of the bridge’s solid approaches, finally arrived on May 10. We are keen on completing the works on the bridge by June 10, as with the arrival of the monsoon thereafter, we may not be able to carry out works. ”As part of this project, the task of moving the 550 metric tonne south-side iron girder on October 19, 2024, and the north-side iron girder from Jan 26 to 30, 2025, into the railway area was already completed.The Carnac Bridge, before its demolition, served as a vital connector between South Mumbai and the eastern suburbs, linking commuters to the Eastern Freeway and the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, which connects to Navi Mumbai.The 150-year-old bridge, first built in 1866-67, was kept off-limits for heavy vehicles in August 2014, as the bridge began to show signs of age.After the pandemic-induced restrictions eased, the bridge was pulled down in 2022, after a structural audit declared the bridge unfit for daily usage. The demolition lasted nearly 18 hours.","Civic officials said the girders, which were to arrive by April 30, finally arrived over the weekend.

What is Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand's religion? Is she Hindu?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/what-is-canadian-foreign-minister-anita-anands-religion-is-she-hindu/articleshow/121151871.cms,"



Anita Anand, the Indian-origin Canadian politician appointed as Canada’s new foreign minister, is a practising Hindu. Her religious identity was once again on quiet yet dignified display as she took her oath of office with her hand on the Bhagavad Gita—a tradition she has maintained since her first Cabinet appointment in 2019.Anand’s appointment is part of a sweeping reshuffle by newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has replaced key Trudeau-era ministers in an attempt to deliver on his promise of a “fresh start.” As foreign minister, Anand now holds one of the most powerful positions in Canada’s federal government—tasked with steering diplomacy at a time of growing tensions with the United States and an increasingly turbulent global order.Born in Kentville, Nova Scotia, in 1967, Anand is the daughter of Indian immigrants—her mother hailing from Punjab and her father from Tamil Nadu. Despite growing up in a predominantly white region of Canada, Anand retained strong cultural and religious ties. Over the years, she has spoken of the values instilled in her by her parents, particularly a commitment to education, integrity, and public service.Her use of the Gita during official ceremonies has become a quiet hallmark of her political journey.It reflects a personal grounding in Hindu philosophy—particularly the principles of dharma (duty) and seva (service)—that have shaped her approach to governance. On Mother’s Day this year, Anand visited the Vaishno Devi Temple in Oakville, posting on X: “It warmed my heart to see so many families across #Oakville coming to celebrate and remember our mothers together. ”Anand first entered Parliament in 2019, winning the Oakville seat for the Liberal Party. She quickly rose through the ranks, earning praise for her role in overseeing Canada’s vaccine procurement strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Later, as defence minister, she was widely respected for her steady leadership during crises, including military reforms and global security challenges.With her return to Cabinet, Anand becomes the first Hindu to serve as Canada’s foreign minister. Her appointment is being viewed as both a recognition of her competence and a reflection of the changing face of Canadian politics. Carney’s new Cabinet, which features 28 ministers and includes secretaries of state, has been praised for balancing experience, gender equality, and ethnic diversity. Half of the Cabinet members are women, and several, like Anand, come from immigrant backgrounds.Political observers say Anand’s legal acumen, international experience, and calm demeanour make her well-suited for the role, especially as Canada prepares to navigate complex trade negotiations and global realignments. Prime Minister Carney has promised a tougher stance against Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies, and Anand is expected to play a central role in articulating Canada’s foreign policy posture.Despite previously signalling that she might step away from politics, the fall of Justin Trudeau’s government and the rise of Carney’s Liberals appear to have brought Anand back into the fold at a critical moment. Her return has been welcomed across party lines, with even political opponents acknowledging her competence and integrity.","Anita Anand, the Indian-origin Canadian politician appointed as Canada’s new foreign minister, is a practising Hindu.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"
