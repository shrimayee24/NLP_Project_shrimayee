Andhra CM N Chandrababu Naidu pitches financial incentives to have more kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/andhra-cm-n-chandrababu-naidu-pitches-financial-incentives-to-have-more-kids/articleshow/121713034.cms,"With current fertility rate, Andhra will face serious problems: CM

VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh, which once amended its laws to bar people with more than two kids from contesting panchayat and municipal elections, now plans to incentivise having larger families as part of a strategy to combat dropping fertility rates and shift focus to what chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu terms “investment in human capital”. “I am looking at giving financial incentives by taking a family as a unit. The bigger families may get higher incentives,” Naidu told TOI ahead of completing a year in office on June 12.“As part of the ‘Zero Poverty ’ initiative, I have already rolled out an interesting model in which wealthier people will adopt poor families. This will not only bridge income disparities, but also ensure welfare of the entire family,” he said.The four-time CM, who has been an advocate of population management, said the current demographics in the southern states require govts to revisit their strategies.Fertility rates in Andhra Pradesh need to increase. At the present rate, AP will face serious problems… That is why I am thinking of bigger families,” CM N Chandrababu Naidu said. He announced recently that female employees could avail of maternity leave any number of times.“It was limited to two times only. We have removed the restrictions,” he said.The state govt also made it mandatory for every organisation to provide childcare centres at workplaces. Naidu announced financial assistance of Rs 15,000 for every schoolchild. “We give this money directly to the mothers of students. Apart from this, the NDA govt in AP is planning to announce financial assistance to couples for having more kids.” The two-child policy previously applicable to prospective candidates for panchayat and municipal polls has been reversed.In 2023, Sikkim announced incentives for indigenous people to have more children. Mizoram, too, has been encouraging tribal couples to have more than two kids. Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin said recently that with the Centre pushing for population-based delimitation of constituencies, there was a need for people in the state to have more children.","Andhra Pradesh once amended its laws to bar people with more than two kids from contesting panchayat and municipal elections.

How former ICICI Bank relationship manager committed fraud: 10 Points

The investigation revealed that Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers and executed multiple illegal transactions.

Investigators found that she had diverted the misappropriated funds into stock market investments, which subsequently resulted in substantial financial losses.

In order to hide the deception, Gupta allegedly substituted the registered mobile numbers of various bank accounts with those of her family members.

The actual account holders were unable to receive transaction notifications and one-time passwords (OTPs) due to this modification, according to police reports.

The investigation revealed multiple fraudulent activities by Gupta, including unauthorised activation of overdraft facilities across 40 accounts.

Further findings showed that she had unlawfully terminated fixed deposits belonging to 31 clients, channeling Rs 1.34 crore to different accounts.

The probe uncovered her unauthorised usage of debit cards, along with their associated PINs and OTPs, to conduct various online and ATM transactions.

Additionally, Gupta was found responsible for processing a fraudulent personal loan amounting to Rs 3.4 lakh.

The investigation also established that she had extensively utilised Insta Kiosk machines and digital banking platforms to execute numerous fraudulent transactions.

The illicit funds were distributed across several Demat accounts, suggesting an attempt to conceal the money trail.

Rs 4.58 crore siphoned off - over 100 accounts of customers accessed - fixed deposits broken: This is not some movie plot - it’s a stunning fraud that a former ICICI Bank relationship manager pulled off! The multi-crore fraud continued for over two years.The accused, Sakshi Gupta, who served at ICICI Bank ’s Shriram Nagar branch in Kota's DCM area from 2020 to 2023, was taken into custody by Udhyog Nagar police on May 31, 2025 after a thorough investigation.According to a TOI report, police records indicate that the fraudulent activities were initially discovered on February 18.Following ICICI Bank's internal probe that identified Sakshi Gupta, who previously worked as a relationship manager at the bank's DCM branch in Kota, as the primary suspect in a significant financial fraud affecting customer accounts, the Kota police have begun their enquiry. The authorities are examining potential accomplices and have asked the bank to furnish pertinent documentation.After identifying irregularities, bank manager Tarun Dadhich registered a complaint, which led to a comprehensive audit and subsequent police investigation.""She systematically transferred funds, sometimes using the account of an elderly woman who had no knowledge of the activity as a pool account,"" said sub-inspector Ibrahim of Udhyog Nagar police station.""By mid-February 2023, over Rs 3 crore had passed through that single account.""Following a one-day police custody, Gupta appeared before the court and was sent to judicial custody. The police continue their enquiries into the matter.A representative from ICICI Bank said, ""The interest of our customers are of paramount importance to us. Immediately upon discovering the fraudulent activity, we filed an FIR with the police. We have a zero-tolerance policy against any fraudulent activity and thus suspended the employee involved. We would like to reassure that genuine claims of impacted customers have been settled.""","Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers.

: The Sukhoi that wasn't hit

Bhuj airbase: Phantom strike on S-400

Adampur again: Faked crater marks on S-400

Supriya Sule Slams Pakistan for Copying India’s Global Mission Against Terror | Operation Sindoor

Naliya airbase: A cloud's shadow, not a bomb

Srinagar airport: A hazy lie

Jammu airport: Digital fakery exposed

NEW DELHI: Since Operation Sindoor , Pakistan has been living with fantasies and pushing hard to make the world believe that it won during the conflict against India. With the use of doctored satellite images, fake visuals, and misinformation campaigns, Islamabad has been claiming that it hit Indian airfields and installations.After the Operation Sindoor, Pakistan portrayed that it hit a Sukhoi-30MKI parked at Adampur air base in Punjab and destroyed an S-400 surface-to-air missile unit at Bhuj airfield in Gujarat. However, these assertions have been systematically dismantled by independent satellite imagery analyst Damien Symon, who has been closely examining these claims over the past month.One of the most prominent claims involved a strike on a Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jet at Punjab's Adampur airbase. The image shared to support this showed a fighter near what was presented as a burn mark.But top imagery analyst Damien Symon revealed the truth: the image pre-dated the conflict, the aircraft was a MiG-29 under routine maintenance, and the so-called damage was engine soot buildup from testing, not a missile hit.Another image claimed Pakistan had taken out an S-400 radar system at Bhuj airfield in Gujarat. A closer look showed dark patches on the ground, supposedly impact marks, which turned out to be oil stains in a vehicle maintenance yard.Worse, the image was captured well before hostilities began.A separate claim involved alleged missile damage to the S-400 battery at Adampur. This time, the satellite image was digitally edited, with black dots added to mimic bomb craters. Comparison with current, unedited satellite images showed no such marks at the site.In one of the most absurd claims, Pakistan used an image of Naliya airbase to suggest a bombing raid had darkened the soil. Symon's analysis showed the ""damage"" was actually just a passing cloud casting a shadow on the runway.A blurry, low-quality image of Srinagar airport's civilian apron was circulated as proof of a Pakistani strike. But high-resolution satellite photos from multiple dates showed no damage whatsoever. The image was either misread or intentionally tampered with.Adding an international twist, Pakistan also released imagery from a Chinese satellite company to ""prove"" another hit on Adampur. The supposed ""damage"" turned out to be a mark that had existed for months, visible in older satellite captures as well.In yet another instance, visuals claiming to show bomb damage at Jammu airport were widely shared. The ""blackened spots"" near the runway were proven false after high-resolution post-strike satellite photos showed a completely intact airbase. The original image had been digitally altered.Across all claims, Pakistan has failed to demonstrate any actual damage to Indian airbases or assets in the wake of its attempted retaliation. In contrast, Indian airstrikes on Pakistani military sites, particularly Jacobabad and Bholari, have been more successful.""Recent imagery from Bholari Airbase, Pakistan indicates that the hangar damaged in the Indian airstrike is now covered with tarpaulin possibly signaling repair activity/restoration is now underway,"" Damien Symon wrote in a post on X.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Adampur airbase shortly after Operation Sindoor only reinforced the absence of any significant damage on Indian soil, a direct counter to the Pakistani narrative.","Pakistan has been using doctored satellite images, fake visuals, and misinformation campaigns.

"India Proverty Rate: Despite World Bank raising threshold, India achieves big dip in extreme poverty",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/despite-world-bank-raising-threshold-india-achieves-big-dip-in-extreme-poverty/articleshow/121700912.cms,"Poll Do you believe that the updated international poverty line will help in addressing poverty more effectively? Yes, it will provide a clearer picture. No, it will complicate measures.

NEW DELHI: India's extreme poverty rate has fallen sharply over the past decade after the World Bank updated its international poverty line definition and included updated data in its June upgrade of the methodology.Based on the update, the latest World Bank data showed that the extreme poverty rate had declined from 27.1% in 2011-12 to 5.3% in 2022-23. The number of people living in extreme poverty also fell sharply during this period from 344.47 million in 2011-12 to 75.24 million in 2022-23. This would mean that nearly 270 million were lifted out of extreme poverty during the same period.In a blog, the World Bank said that the international poverty line for low-income countries has been raised to $3 per person per day from the existing $2.15 per person per day, and for lower middle-income countries it's changed from $3.65 to $4.20 per day and for upper middle-income countries it went up from $6.85 to $8.40.Given India's inflation rate, between 2017 and 2021, a revised extreme poverty line of $3 would constitute a 15% higher threshold than $2.15 expressed in 2021 prices and result in a 5.3% poverty rate in 2022-23. A new LMIC line of $4.20 would imply a 5% lower threshold for poverty than $3.65 adjusted in 2021 prices and yield a poverty rate of 23.9%, according to the World Bank.Using the new poverty line for low middle income countries (LMIC), which is at $4.20 per day per person, India's poverty rate fell to 23.9% in 2022-23 from 57.7% in 2011-12.The number of people in extreme poverty was down from 732.48 million in 2011-12 to 342.32 million in 2022-23, according to the data available on the World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform.Free and subsidised food transfers supported poverty reduction, and the rural-urban poverty gap narrowed. The five most populous states account for 54% of the extremely poor, it had said.According to the poverty and equity brief published by World Bank in April, extreme poverty (living on less than $2.15 per day) fell from 16.2% in 2011- 12 to 2.3% in 2022-23, lifting 171 million people above this line. Rural extreme poverty dropped from 18.4% to 2.8% , and urban from 10.7% to 1.1% , narrowing the rural-urban gap from 7.7 to 1.7 percentage points-a 16% annual decline.The poverty report had also said India has transitioned into the lower-middle-income category. Using the $3.65 per day LMIC poverty line, poverty fell from 61.8% to 28.1%, lifting 378 million people out of poverty. Rural poverty dropped from 69% to 32.5%, and urban poverty from 43.5% to 17.2%, reducing the rural-urban gap from 25 to 15 percentage points with a 7% annual decline, the April report had said.The updated World Bank data is expected to come as a shot in the arm for the govt and bolster its record of handling the economy and pursuing policies to push inclusive growth and lift millions out of poverty.Last year, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subhramanyam had indicated that the poverty level could be less than 5% based on preliminary estimates on the household consumption expenditure (HCES) data released by the statistics office.World Bank has said that in recent years, the scope and quality of information provided by household surveys has improved enormously, particularly in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, offering a clearer view into people's welfare and day-to-day lives.Several research papers have also indicated the reduction in extreme poverty over the last decade thanks to robust growth. A survey released last year estimated poverty to have declined to 8.5% from 21% in 2011-12 and pointed out that chronic poverty has come down but there is a significant proportion of people who can slip back into poverty due to ""accident of life"".World Bank, which introduced the international poverty line (IPL) in 1990, has undertaken several updates to include changing prices and costs, and the latest update was undertaken on June 5.The first update to IPL happened in 2001, with subsequent revisions in 2008, 2015, 2022, and more recently this month. This latest update, which also applies to the poverty lines for middle-income countries, follows the release last year of a new set of PPPs based on prices collected in 2021 by the International Comparison Programme.It also reflects changes in national poverty lines, which is a big reason for the increase, especially for the line that tracks extreme poverty, according to the World Bank.",India's extreme poverty rate has fallen sharply over the past decade. The World Bank has updated its international poverty line definition and included updated data. The number of people living in extreme poverty also fell sharply during this period.

Drug cartel's hawala cash trail ends in washing machine in Goa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/drug-cartels-hawala-cash-trail-ends-in-washing-machine-in-goa/articleshow/121700977.cms,"'Accused laundered over 2 crore of drug proceeds'

HYDERABAD: In a major breakthrough, Telangana Anti Narcotics Bureau's (TGANB) investigation to trace the inter-state hawala cash trail of international drug cartels ended in a washing machine in a Goa flat, from which it seized Rs 50 lakh a few days ago.TGANB director Sandeep Shandilya, said the money, collected over just two days, was moments away from being laundered to Nigeria. ""Had we delayed the raid by an hour, the entire amount would have been transferred. It was neatly stashed inside the washing machine, ready for dispatch,"" he said.Following a month-long surveillance operation in Goa, TGANB --- assisted by Goa police --- zeroed in on hawala transactions being conducted from Sangeetha Mobile Shop in Mapusa and an apartment in Goa's Highland Park.The key accused, Uttam Singh, who runs the mobile shop, was arrested. Investigators revealed he had laundered Rs 2.1 crore of drug proceeds in just one week.""Drug money collected in cash was handed over to Uttam, often by foreign nationals. He then moved the funds to Mumbai through informal channels, and from there, it was transferred to Nigeria,"" Shandilya explained. The investigation into the hawala trail started after Nigerian national Emmanuel Bediako, alias Maxwell, revealed it to TGANB.Between May 26 and June 1, officials tracked 58 hawala transactions involving Rs 2.1 crore. A few days after establishing this link, a raid on Highland Park apartment led to the recovery of Rs 50 lakh in cash. Over the past month, four Nigerian nationals have been arrested during TGANB operations in Goa.Authorities believe Uttam is one of several hawala operators facilitating cross-border drug money transfers. Police officials suspect a wider network of hawala operators is active, working hand-in-glove with international narcotics cartels.","Telangana Anti Narcotics Bureau's investigation to trace the inter-state hawala cash trail of international drug cartels ended in a washing machine in a Goa flat.

NEW DELHI: In a significant ruling that could influence future maintenance disputes, the Supreme Court has directed a man to pay his divorced wife Rs 50,000 per month as permanent alimony, with a 5% increase every two years. The top court also upheld an earlier order requiring him to clear the home loan and transfer the property to his former spouse.The Court noted that the revised amount better reflects the standard of living she enjoyed during her marriage to her former husband, a hotel management professional.The woman, who has remained unmarried and financially dependent since the divorce, was earlier receiving Rs 20,000 per month as alimony, an amount originally granted as interim maintenance. She approached the apex court seeking a revision, arguing that her former husband was now earning substantially more than he was during their separation.A bench led by Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta observed that the woman is entitled to maintain a standard of living consistent with what she had during the marriage. “The quantum of permanent alimony fixed by the High Court requires revision,” the court said, pointing to the man’s career trajectory and income history, which once reflected earnings of over Rs 21 lakh per year.“The wife, who has remained unmarried and is living independently, is entitled to a level of maintenance that reasonably secures her future”, the judgment further said.The man had argued that his current income was lower, that he had since remarried, and had additional responsibilities, including caring for elderly parents. However, the court was not convinced, stating that past and potential earning capacity must be considered in maintenance cases. It also warned against attempts to suppress income to reduce alimony obligations.The court agreed that the couple’s adult son, now 26, is no longer entitled to regular maintenance. ""It is open to the husband to voluntarily assist him with educational or other reasonable expenses,"" the judgment said.However, it clarified that his inheritance rights remain intact and he can pursue any claims under the law.The ruling brings to a close a legal battle that began in 2008, when the man filed for divorce. A trial court initially dismissed the claim, but the High Court granted divorce in 2019, citing cruelty and an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.Legal experts say the ruling strengthens the rights of women seeking dignified maintenance after divorce. Neelam Singh, Advocate-on-Record at Lucknow High Court, was quoted by ET and called it “a benchmark that reinforces the court’s role as a guardian of justice,” while Magnus Legal Services' Nikita Anand added that “maintenance is not charity but a right... calibrated to genuine financial realities.”The Apex Court clarified that income suppression tactics will not help those trying to evade maintenance. The husband’s current earnings were evaluated alongside his career history, revealing a clear ability to meet the revised obligation.","The Supreme Court has directed a man to pay his divorced wife Rs 50,000 per month as permanent alimony, with a 5% increase every two years.

Centre plans stricter law against counterfeit farm inputs including pesticides and seeds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-plans-stricter-law-against-counterfeit-farm-inputs-including-pesticides-and-seeds/articleshow/121709592.cms,"Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan at the ICAR, Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (ICAR-IIHR) campus in Bengaluru

BENGALURU: The Centre will soon introduce a stricter law to address the issue of spurious pesticides, non-genuine seeds, and counterfeit fertilisers, said Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. He was speaking to farmers at the ICAR – Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (ICAR-IIHR) campus on Sunday as part of the ongoing ‘Viksit Krishi Sankalp Abhiyan’. This initiative aims to connect scientists with farmers under the Centre’s ‘lab to land’ programme. It was his first visit to South India during the campaign, which began on May 29.“Those who are involved in selling fake seeds and pesticides will be severely punished,” said Chouhan, referring to several complaints by farmers in many states.The farmers’ concerns were highlighted in a 2015 study by Ficci, which revealed the loss of over 10 million tonnes of food production due to the use of spurious pesticides that year. It also showed that the value of fake pesticides was growing at 20% per year, with states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Haryana, and Karnataka being among the worst affected.Although the sale of fake or substandard seeds, pesticides, and fertilisers is a punishable offence under existing laws, the absence of proper monitoring and accountability does not yield the desired results on the ground.The new law is expected to address these enforcement gaps.During his speech, Chouhan also promised to introduce a scheme to reduce farmers’ transportation costs for tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. This would ensure they receive a fair price for their produce without losing money to middlemen who take a significant cut in delivering the farm produce to the desired destination.Under the scheme, the Centre will collaborate with states to bear the transport costs, involving agencies that procure from farmers and deliver the produce to markets in other states.The minister’s farm visits to rural areas near Bengaluru on Sunday were part of the fortnight-long campaign to connect with farmers and gather first-hand information on their day-to-day farm-related problems.“The central govt will collaborate with states, Agricultural Universities, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), farmers, and scientists to draw a comprehensive roadmap to improve farming operations and achieve the goal of developing India as the world’s food basket,” said Chouhan while addressing the gathering of farmers and farm scientists. He stated that the ‘Abhiyan’ envisions “One Nation, One Agriculture, One Team” to work for the farmers’ interests.In Karnataka, more than 70 interdisciplinary teams comprising scientists and officials from agriculture and allied departments have been visiting farms daily since May 29. These teams are recording feedback directly from farmers to shape need-based, problem-oriented agricultural research programmes.","The Centre will soon introduce a stricter law to address the issue of spurious pesticides, non-genuine seeds, and counterfeit fertilisers, said Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.

Philippines now visa-free for Indian tourists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/philippines-now-visa-free-for-indian-tourists/articleshow/121709046.cms,"Philippines now visa-free for Indian tourists

NEW DELHI: Philippines has joined the increasing ranks of countries that have become visa-free for Indian tourists from Sunday. Post-Covid, several places have gone either visa-free or visa-on-arrival to attract the high-spending desi tourists. These include Thailand, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka (free electronic visa), Seychelles, Maldives, Philippines, Indonesia (visa on arrival) and Hong Kong (online pre-clearance required), according to Travel Agents Federation of India VP Anil Kalsi.“Indian nationals may enter the Philippines without a visa for a non-extendible and non-convertible period of 14 days for tourism purposes, upon presenting a passport valid for at least six months beyond the contemplated stay, confirmed hotel accommodation/ booking, proof of financial capacity, and return or onward ticket to the next country of destination,” according to the website of the embassy of the Philippines in New Delhi. The reason for this change is also stated clearly: “enhancing tourism arrivals from India.”“Indian nationals holding valid and current American, Japanese, Australian, Canadian, Schengen, Singapore or United Kingdom (AJACSSUK) visas or residence permits may enter the Philippines without a visa for a non-extendible period of 30 days for tourism, upon presenting a passport valid for at least six months beyond the contemplated stay, and return or onward ticket to the next country of destination,” it adds.These updated visa-free privileges for Indian nationals can be availed of at any Philippine port of entry, and are not convertible to a visa-based stay or other admission status categories. Indian nationals must also not have any derogatory record with the Bureau of Immigration (BI) in order to be admitted into the country without a visa.“Indian nationals transiting in the Philippines or entering the country for long-term visits and non-tourism activities are required to apply for an appropriate Philippine visa at a Philippine Embassy or Consulate in their country or origin, place of legal residence, or any country that requires entry visas for Indian nationals. Indian nationals who are eligible for e-Visas may also apply through the official Philippine e-Visa website evisa.gov.ph . The DFA reminds that e-Visas may not be extended or converted to other visa-based stay or other admission status categories,” the embassy says.India has seen a spurt in outbound travel post-Covid by its nationals, while foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs) to the country are yet to return to 2019 levels. In 2024, India is provisionally estimated to have received about 97 lakh FTAs, about 1.4% more than the previous year. India had crossed the 1-crore FTA mark for the first time in 2017 and had peaked at 1.1 crore in 2019.On the other hand, more Indians are travelling to foreign shores than they did in pre-Covid times. Barring the West, other countries — especially in Southeast Asia — are going all out to woo the high-spending desi globetrotters by majorly simplifying visas to boost their economies.

Cash haul row: Justice Yashwant Varma left with only one option - how can he avoid impeachment?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cash-haul-row-justice-yashwant-varma-left-with-only-one-option-how-can-he-avoid-impeachment/articleshow/121705668.cms,"File photo: Justice Yashwant Varma (Picture credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: Justice Yashwant Varma of the Allahabad High Court faces the prospect of impeachment in the upcoming Monsoon session of Parliament after being indicted in a high-profile corruption case.According to officials cited by news agency PTI, resignation remains his only option to avoid a Parliamentary motion for removal, which, if passed, would strip him of pension and retirement benefits.Justice Varma came under scrutiny after a fire at his Delhi residence in March led to the discovery of several burnt sacks of unaccounted cash in the outhouse. Though he denied knowledge of the money, a Supreme Court-appointed in-house panel, led by then Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna, found him culpable after recording witness statements and Varma’s own deposition.Based on this report, Justice Khanna urged the President and Prime Minister to initiate his removal, PTI reported.As per Article 217 of the Constitution, a High Court judge may resign by writing to the President.The resignation becomes valid without requiring formal acceptance. If a judge resigns, they retain post-retirement entitlements. However, if removed by Parliament, they lose all such benefits.In Parliament, a motion for removal must be supported by at least 50 Rajya Sabha or 100 Lok Sabha members. Once admitted, the Judges (Inquiry) Act of 1968 mandates a fresh three-member committee, including a Supreme Court judge, a High Court chief justice, and a distinguished jurist, to investigate the charges.However, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju pointed out that the case is “slightly different” because an in-house committee has already concluded its probe. “It cannot be brushed aside,” Rijiju was quoted as saying by PTI, adding that reconciling the existing report with the statutory inquiry process will be a matter for the Speaker or Chairman to decide.Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar, while meeting members of the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association, expressed dismay over the lack of a criminal investigation into the matter. “A very painful incident happened... There was a cash haul, obviously tainted, unaccounted and illegal,” he said.Dhankhar criticised the judiciary’s internal mechanism for shielding its members from FIRs, saying, “Unless permission is accorded by a functionary at the highest level in the judiciary, an FIR can’t be registered.”Justice Varma has since been transferred to the Allahabad High Court, where he has not been allotted any judicial duties. Rijiju has begun consultations with political parties to build consensus on the motion, which could be the first impeachment to be taken up in the new Parliament building.The Monsoon session of Parliament is scheduled from July 21 to August 12.","Justice Yashwant Varma came under scrutiny after a fire at his Delhi residence in March led to the discovery of several burnt sacks of unaccounted cash.

NEW DELHI: After a gap of 17 days, Delhi's maximum temperature surpassed 40 degrees Celsius on Sunday, settling at 42.1C, two notches above normal, at Safdarjung, the city's base station. The Met office has issued a 'yellow' alert for heatwave conditions at isolated places on Monday and Tuesday as the mercury may touch 45C.The heatwave alert for the capital came as scorching temperatures swept Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan. In Haryana, Sirsa recorded the highest maximum temperature at 45.8C while Chandigarh recorded the season's highest maximum so far at 42.1C. In Rajasthan, maximum temperature in several areas remained above 45 degrees, with Sri Ganganagar being the hottest district in the state at 47.4C. The Met office has predicted that the intense heatwave will continue in the coming days.In Delhi, due to regular rain, accompanied by thunderstorms and gusty winds, temperatures have stayed below normal. However, before Sunday, the mercury crossed 40C on May 21, recording 40.7. The 17-day streak broke on Sunday, though the city did not meet the criteria for heatwave conditions. The season's hottest day was May 16, at 42.3C.The relative humidity oscillated between 31% and 70% on Sunday. The heat index or feel-like temperature was 47.2 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature was recorded at 27.6 degrees Celsius. Delhi did not experience a heatwave day in May, although three such days were recorded in April this year.Some areas were hotter than the city’s base station.At 44.1 degrees Celsius, Ayanagar in south-west Delhi was the hottest station on Sunday, followed by 43.6 degrees at Palam. The maximum temperature settled at 42.3 degrees Celsius at Lodhi Road, 42.9 degrees Celsius at Ridge in north Delhi, 40.6 at Rajghat, 41.2 at Pusa, 41.6 at Najafgarh, 40.4 at Mayur Vihar, 41.5 at Gurgaon, 41.4 at Noida, 42.2 at Faridabad, and 39.7 at Ghaziabad.“The maximum temperatures have been recorded between 42-44 degrees Celsius over Delhi with departures of about 2-3 degrees. Though no heatwave condition has been realised over Delhi, it has been recorded in neighbouring Rohtak and Narnaul,” said IMD scientist Krishna Kumar Mishra. “The maximum temperature on June 4 in Delhi was 34.6 degrees Celsius, and it rose to 42.1 degrees Celsius on Sunday. It settled at 47.4 degrees Celsius in Rajasthan’s Gangapur. In just five days, the mercury saw a rise of 6 to 8 degrees Celsius across the region.”“The mercury stayed below normal during the past few days due to moist winds coming from either the Arabian Sea or Bay of Bengal. However, the last thunderstorm activity was on June 4, and since then, dry conditions have prevailed, leading to a rise in temperatures,” he added. IMD has issued a ‘yellow’ alert for hot and humid conditions for Wednesday and Thursday as the mercury may stay between 41 and 43 degrees Celsius. Respite from the sizzling weather is expected from June 13. “Due to the confluence of winds from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, rain and thunderstorms are likely to start from east UP and Uttarakhand from June 11 night,” said Mishra. The met department has predicted rain, thunderstorms, and gusty winds from the night of June 12 to June 14 in Delhi.","Temperatures rise 6-8 degrees in just 5 days in Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan.

Hyderabad: What began as the promise of a joyful new chapter turned into a heart-wrenching tragedy at Secunderabad Railway Station on June 5 morning. A 28-year-old man, Vurugonda Sai, who was on his way to Goa with his wife for their honeymoon, lost his life while trying to board the moving Vasco-Da-Gama Express.Sai, a worker at a gift article manufacturing unit in Warangal, had been married just weeks earlier to Battula Madhuri (23), a nurse. The couple, accompanied by Sai's brother-in-law Vishnu Vardhan and four friends, had planned a celebratory trip to Goa. The group arrived at platform No. 9 around 9.30 am, with reservations in coach S4.According to Secunderabad Railway Police, Sai was seen boarding and deboarding the train multiple times before the incident. Around 10.30 am, he stepped off to buy a bottle of water. As the train began to pull away, his friends, noticing he hadn't returned, pulled the emergency chain to halt it. Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel responded and began questioning one of Sai's friends near the S4 coach.""In the middle of this, Sai attempted to reboard the moving train. Tragically, he lost balance and slipped into the gap between the platform and the train,"" said an RPF official.Sai sustained critical injuries and was immediately rushed to a corporate hospital. Despite the medical team's efforts, he succumbed to his injuries at 12.30 pm.In a cruel twist, Sai's wife and friends—unaware of the tragedy—continued their journey until Kacheguda station. Only upon receiving a call from police did they learn the devastating news and disembarked.Based on a complaint by Madhuri, a case has been registered under section 194 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.

Eminem vs Meta: Unauthorised use of music

What Meta said on the lawsuit

Grammy-winning rapper Eminem has filed a lawsuit of $109 million against Facebook-parent Meta accusing it of copyright infringement. The lawsuit, filed by Eminem’s music publishing company, Eight Mile Style, accuses Meta of the ""unauthorised storage, reproduction, and exploitation"" of 243 of Eminem's songs across its platforms.As per the court documents seen by People, Eight Mile Style alleges that Meta's in-app features, such as ""Original Audio"" and ""Reels Remix,"" have actively encouraged and allowed users to incorporate Eminem's music into their video content without proper licensing or attribution. The lawsuit further claims that this has led to rapper's songs being used in millions of videos and streamed billions of times, resulting in diminished value of the copyrights and lost profits for the publisher.As reported by People, the lawsuit alleges that Meta has allowed its users to store, reproduce and exploit Eminem’s songs through features like Original Audio and Reels Remix, which enable users to incorporate music into their content without proper attribution or licensing.Eight Mile Style is seeking statutory damages of $150,000 per song, per platform (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), which could accumulate to the total sum exceeding $109 million. The publisher has also requested a jury trial and a permanent injunction to prevent Meta from future unauthorised use of Eminem's music.Meta has not yet issued a public comment directly on the lawsuit. However, a companyspokesperson told People that the company has licenses with thousands of partners around the world and the company has also been negotiating with Eight Mile Style. “Meta has licenses with thousands of partners around the world and an extensive global licensing program for music on its platforms. Meta had been negotiating in good faith with Eight Mile Style, but rather than continue those discussions, Eight Mile Style chose to sue,” said Meta spokesperson.","Eminem has filed a lawsuit of $109 million against Facebook-parent Meta.

What’s next for Elon Musk’s pay?

Despite being one of the most influential figures in the tech and automotive industries, Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Musk’s compensation structure has been a subject of debate for years. His 2018 pay package, which was designed to grant him stock options based on Tesla’s performance milestones, was twice struck down in court, leaving him without formal compensation. While Tesla’s valuation has skyrocketed—growing over 2,000% in the past seven years—Musk has not received a paycheck during this period.As mentioned above, Elon Musk’s salary package was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018. As part of the agreement his entire compensation was tied to the company’s overall performance and market capitalisation milestones.Under this structure, Musk was granted stock options that would vest only if Tesla hit specific, escalating targets for market capitalisation, revenue, and adjusted EBITDA. Over the years, as Tesla's valuation soared and it met many of these goals, the package became immensely valuable, potentially making it the largest compensation deal in corporate history.The legal battle over Musk’s $56 billion stock award has prevented Tesla from issuing him compensation. Courts have ruled that the approval process for his pay package was flawed, leading to its rejection despite shareholder support.Musk himself has acknowledged the situation, stating that he has worked without pay for years. However, with Tesla facing market volatility and leadership concerns, some experts argue that it may be time to restructure his compensation to ensure stability and long-term commitment.Tesla’s board is now weighing options for a new compensation plan. Some analysts suggest a performance-based stock package, while others argue Musk should receive a traditional CEO salary to align with industry standards.","Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies.

NEW DELHI: Neelesh's family was joyfully preparing for her wedding just five months away. On the afternoon of May 28, she left her Trilokpuri home, telling her 75-year-old father, Ahivaran Singh, that she was going to the bank to complete KYC formalities and withdraw money for the wedding. She never returned home.Neelesh was living with her family in a rented second-floor flat in Trilokpuri for the past one and a half years. Her kin said she had previously battled a serious kidney ailment and had survived after a long and difficult recovery.On Saturday, her three sisters-in-law gathered in the small one-room home, mourning her death. They claimed that on the day of the crime, when Neelesh didn't return home, the family began searching for her. Her father contacted relatives to see if she had visited them, but no one had seen her. After waiting for some time, he filed a missing person complaint at the local police station.""Her roka (engagement) ceremony was over and she was excited about the upcoming wedding, which was to be held in Etawah, Uttar Pradesh. She often asked about the preparations,"" revealed Sunita, one of her sisters-in-law.Alongside her graduation studies, Neelesh was pursuing a beautician's course.Her three brothers live in east and southeast Delhi.However, the family claimed they had never heard of Neelesh's murderer, Satendra Yadav, who claimed to police he was in a relationship with her. ""Neelesh never spoke about him. We have no idea how they came into contact with each other. He must be a manipulative man. We only learned of his existence after her murder,"" said her sisters-in-law.Yadav lived on the ground floor of a one-room set in West Vinod Nagar in east Delhi. Inside, a mattress lay on the floor near a table fan, with an oil bottle and a few clothes hanging on the back of the door.Jasdeep Singh, the building owner, said Yadav rented the room a month ago, planning to bring his wife from the village after attending a relative's marriage scheduled for the last week of May.""He said he worked at a construction company in Gurgaon and often came home late, so he requested an extra key,"" Singh recounted. ""After the incident, we noticed his room was open, the fan was running and the gate was unlocked. At first, we assumed he had stepped out for food, but when he didn't return, I called him and found his phone switched off.""A few days later, police arrived at the house and informed Singh of the murder. They also seized a rope from the room. ""We never saw any woman with him. He rarely stayed at the rented room and mentioned that he often stayed with friends nearby,"" the house owner added.Most residents said they knew little about Yadav. One tenant of the house recalled, ""I just moved in, and the very next day, police showed up with him in custody.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thrives under pressure and views stress as key to success



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s leadership forged with challenges



Also Read |

Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang leads one of the world’s most valuable tech companies, valued at around $3.4 trillion. However, it is not confidence but a deep fear of failure that fuels his relentless drive. Huang’s anxiety about potential setbacks and fierce competition motivates his intense work ethic and commitment to innovation. This constant pressure pushes him to stay focused and vigilant, ensuring Nvidia remains a leader in the tech industry. His story reveals a leadership style shaped by the delicate balance between remarkable success and the persistent fear that it could all collapse unexpectedly.Jensen Huang's tale defies the conventional leadership story of optimism and self-assurance. His experience illustrates how anxiety and fear, constructively controlled, can be tremendous drivers of innovation and success. Huang's single-minded drive to excellence, fueled by an abiding fear of failure, has enabled Nvidia to transform industries including graphics processing and artificial intelligence.This atypical leadership approach emphasises that vulnerability and emotional nuance can go hand in hand with monumental success in the technology space.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's biographer Stephen Witt, author of The Thinking Machine, who spent considerable time interviewing Huang and his staff, Huang's primary driver is fear, not optimism. Huang openly admits that he lives every day with the nagging fear that Nvidia might ""implode at any moment."" Rather than letting this fear consume him, he employs it as a mighty engine that keeps him on the ball, propelling the company forward with an acute sense of urgency.Witt characterizes Huang's drive as ""his fuel, his gasoline""; the nervous energy that drives him compulsively. This psychological pressure compels Huang to work all the harder and guarantees he never gets complacent, even when the firm is at the height of its success.In contrast to most CEOs who prize confidence and tranquility when the going is good, Huang is at ease with pressure and challenge. According to Witt, Huang gets anxious when everything is going well and that his tension keeps him on his toes anticipating the occurrence of any hurdle. Huang confesses to being a tough boss, and in his opinion, stress and hardship are preconditions for doing something remarkable.Huang has stated that success needs persistence, pressure, and overcoming adversity. His view is that success is not often the result of simple or linear routes but from consistent effort under difficult circumstances.Huang's path hasn't been without challenges. During a 2024 Stanford University speech, he revealed that Nvidia came within a hair's breadth of collapse a mere few years after it was founded in 1993. This near failure had a significant influence on his leadership philosophy.Huang emphasizes that having high expectations of life or business to be always perfect predisposes individuals to failure when things are sure to go awry. Rather, he opines that the ability to endure tough situations and setbacks is vital for long-term success. Such resilience has been a major pillar in Nvidia's culture and Huang's own leadership style.Stephen Witt further discloses that Huang is motivated to a large extent by guilt. Huang has a deep sense of responsibility towards his team, investors, and firm, and this sense of obligation compels him to work even more diligently. Witt clarifies that Huang's motivation is not mere ambition but also a combination of the fear of failure, paranoia among competitors, and the guilt of possibly disappointing others. This generates tremendous internal pressure that Huang leverages as an impetus to remain focused and drive Nvidia to its greatest heights.",Jensen Huang’s biographer reveals ‘his deep fear of failure’ fuels his focus in tech industry.

"As UN Ocean Conference opens in France, a push to turn promises into protection",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/as-un-ocean-conference-opens-in-france-a-push-to-turn-promises-into-protection/articleshow/121717624.cms,"AP image





The third United Nations Ocean Conference opens on Monday as pressure mounts for nations to turn decades of promises into real protection for the sea.The summit comes as just 2.7 per cent of the ocean is effectively protected from destructive extractive activities, according to the nonprofit Marine Conservation Institute. That's far below the target agreed under the ""30x30"" pledge to conserve 30 per cent of land and sea by 2030.Atop this year's agenda is ratification of the High Seas Treaty. Adopted in 2023, the treaty would for the first time allow nations to establish marine protected areas in international waters, which cover nearly two-thirds of the ocean and are largely ungoverned.""It's the wild west out there with countries just fishing anywhere without any sort of regulation, and that needs to change,"" said Mauro Randone, regional projects manager at the World Wildlife Fund's Mediterranean Marine Initiative.""The high seas belong to everyone and no one practically at the same time, and countries are finally committing to establish some rules.""The ocean is critical in stabilizing Earth's climate and sustaining life. It generates 50 per cent of the oxygen we breathe, absorbs around 30 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions and captures more than 90 per cent of the excess heat caused by those emissions. Without a healthy ocean, experts warn, climate goals will remain out of reach.The treaty will only come into force once 60 countries ratify it. As of Monday, just 32 countries had. Advocates hope UNOC can build enough momentum to cross the threshold, which would allow for the first official Oceans Conference of Parties.""Two-thirds of the ocean is areas beyond national jurisdiction - that's half our planet,"" said Minna Epps, director of global ocean policy the International Union for Conservation of Nature. ""We cannot possibly protect 30% of the ocean if it doesn't include the high seas.""South Korea, France and the European Union have championed the treaty, but most large ocean nations have yet to ratify it, including the rest of the G20. Thousands of attendees are expected in Nice - from delegates and heads of state to scientists and industry leaders. The United States has yet to confirm a formal delegation.Moving from protections on paper to something realBeyond new commitments, the conference highlights the growing gap between marine protection declarations and real-world conservation.France, the conference co-host, claims to have surpassed the 30 per cent target for marine protection. But environmental groups say only 3 per cent of French waters are fully protected from harmful activities like bottom trawling and industrial fishing.In 2024 alone, more than 100 bottom-trawling vessels were recorded spending over 17,000 hours fishing within France's six marine nature parks, according to ocean advocacy group Oceana.""The government declares these as protected areas, but this is a lie,"" said Enric Sala, founder of National Geographic Pristine Seas marine reserve project. ""Most of it is political box-ticking. It's all paper parks.""That criticism is echoed across the continent. A new World Wildlife Fund report found that although more than 11 per cent of Europe's marine area is designated for protection, just 2 per cent of EU waters have management plans in place.Fabien Boileau, director of marine protected areas at France's Office for Biodiversity, acknowledged the presence of bottom trawling in French protected areas, but said it was part of a phased strategy.""In France, we made the choice to designate large marine protected areas with relatively low levels of regulation at first, betting that stronger protections would be developed over time through local governance,"" he said.""Today, we're gradually increasing the number of zones with stricter protections within those areas.""While many marine protected areas struggle with enforcement, others show what real protection can achieve. Off the southern coast of France, Port-Cros National Park is one of the oldest marine reserves in the Mediterranean. There, strict anchoring bans have allowed vast seagrass meadows to grow undisturbed.Massive groupers patrol rocky outcrops, brightly coloured nudibranchs munch on algae, and schools of large corbs glide through the shallows, undisturbed by fishing lines.""Thanks to the protections that have been in place since 1963, we can observe species that are much larger than elsewhere in the Mediterranean and at a much higher density than in other areas,"" said Hubert Flavigny, manager of Mio Palmo dive centre in Hyeres, France.Still, such examples remain exceptions.Advocates say industrial fishing lobbies continue to resist stricter protections, despite evidence that well-managed reserves boost long-term fisheries through the ""spillover effect"", whereby marine life flourishes in nearby waters.""Protection is not the problem - overfishing is the problem,"" said Sala. ""The worst enemy of the fishing industry is themselves.""Frustrated by government inaction, environmental groups have taken enforcement into their own hands. In May, Greenpeace dropped 15 limestone boulders into France's Golfe du Lion, aiming to physically block bottom trawling in a marine area that has long been designated for protection.The protected zone was established in 2008 to preserve deep-sea ecosystems, yet 12 trawlers continue to operate there, despite scientific warnings of ecological collapse, according to activist group MedReAct. The Golfe is now one of the most overfished areas in the Mediterranean.The conference will feature 10 panels on topics such as blue finance, sustainable fisheries and plastic pollution. Deep sea mining is expected to feature in broader discussions, while small island states are likely to use the platform to advocate for increased climate adaptation funding.The outcome of these discussions will form the basis of the Nice Ocean Action Plan - a declaration of voluntary commitments to be adopted by consensus and presented at the United Nations in New York this July.""There cannot be a healthy planet without a healthy ocean,"" said Peter Thomson, UN special envoy for the ocean. ""It's urgent business for us all.""","Just 2.7 per cent of the ocean is effectively protected from extractive activities.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Rekha Gupta said on Sunday that the national capital was reaping the benefits of the double-engine govt as the Centre had approved a plan for a 5-km tunnel that is expected to balance traffic between south Delhi and NCR.The tunnel, from Shiv Murti-Mahipalpur (Dwarka expressway) to Nelson Mandela Road (Vasant Kunj), will reduce congestion on multiple routes and create a signal-free corridor.The CM said that after a recent meeting with Union minister Nitin Gadkari, projects worth Rs 24,000 crore that are aimed at streamlining traffic and reducing pollution in Delhi and its adjoining areas, were approved.Among them is the 5-kilometre tunnel, which will be constructed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) at an estimated cost of Rs 3,500 crore.The tunnel will have two underground tubes - one each for up and down traffic. Each tube will have three lanes. The tunnel will also have electro-mechanical systems, ventilation, fire safety, CCTV surveillance, control rooms, emergency exits and cross-passages.She said that the construction of the tunnel will significantly ease traffic congestion on Nelson Mandela Road (Vasant Kunj), Mahipalpur and Rangpuri.It will also reduce the traffic load on Dhaula Kuan, Rao Tula Ram Marg, and National Highway 48 in the Mahipalpur area.South Delhi MP Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said that the tunnel will be a blessing for people in the area as it will offer a direct, signal-free atlernative between south Delhi, Dwarka and Gurgaon. The tunnel is expected to help in eliminating traffic jams on NH-48 during peak hours.This tunnel will be a key connector between central/east Delhi and multiple major expressways and highways, including the Delhi Expressway (NE-5), NH-44, NH-10, Delhi-Jaipur Highway (NH-48), and Delhi-Dehradun Expressway (NH-709B) via the Urban Extension Road (UER) and Dwarka Expressway, Bidhuri said. This will lead to smoother traffic across these routes and a significant reduction in pollution levels, he added.The chief minister said that all technical and formal requirements for the project are in their final stages, and work is expected to start early next year. Calling this project the ""foundation for the Delhi of the future,"" Gupta said that the tunnel will give a new direction to Delhi's infrastructure and bring relief to millions. ""We are committed to making Delhi congestion-free and clean,"" she said.The tunnel project ends at the upcoming intersection at Shiv Murti on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway.Officials said those heading towards Gurgaon can take the left turn to join the expressway, while others can seamlessly get on to the Dwarka Expressway to head towards Manesar or Chandigarh.","5-km tunnel will be constructed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) at an estimated cost of Rs 3,500 crore.

'Kabul’s Water Crisis: An Inflection Point for Action',

Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, could become the first modern city to completely run out of water, warns a recent report. The report titledreleased recently by the NGO Mercy Corps, outlines in detail the city’s worsening water emergency and urges immediate international and domestic attention.The report says that Kabul’s groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year, with the water table having dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade. According to projections by Unicef, cited in the report, the city’s aquifers could run dry by 2030, potentially displacing up to 3 million people. The situation is already critical—nearly half of the boreholes, Kabul residents’ primary source of drinking water, are dry.An aquifer is an underground layer of rock, sand, or soil that holds water. It acts like a natural water tank. People access this water through wells, but if too much is taken out and not enough refills it (like from rain or snow), the aquifer can run dry.The report says, ""Kabul’s water crisis represents a failure of governance, humanitarian coordination, water regulation, and infrastructure planning... Without immediate intervention, the city risks becoming the first modern capital in the world to fully deplete its water reserves.""Kabul’s water largely comes from three main aquifers, recharged by snowmelt from the Hindu Kush mountains. However, due to climate change and recurring droughts, snow and rain have significantly declined. From October 2023 to January 2024, Afghanistan received only 45–60% of its normal winter precipitation. According to the report, ""Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country in the world to impacts of climate change,"" and Kabul is already seeing the effects, with reduced snowfall and shorter winters reducing the volume of meltwater.""Shorter winters also mean less time for snow to accumulate on the Hindu Kush, and thus less meltwater runoff in the spring, even as the city’s demand for water rapidly increases,"" the report says.On the infrastructure side, only 20% of households in Kabul are connected to centralised piped water systems. Most residents rely on water pumped from borewells, many of which are unregulated or drying up. ""90% of Kabul’s residents rely on water pumped from borewells to supply their daily needs,"" the report says.The report also highlights water quality issues. ""As much as 80% of Kabul’s groundwater is contaminated with sewage, toxins, and dangerously high levels of chemicals such as arsenic and nitrates,"" posing major health risks. In interviews conducted for the report, 70% of residents said their well water had issues such as bad taste, odor, or discoloration.Economically, the crisis has forced families to spend 15–30% of their monthly income on water. In some cases, private water companies extract water and sell it back to residents at high prices. ""Weekly water costs for a single household reach 400–500 Afghanis ($6–7), exceeding food expenses for more than half of households,"" the report notes. ""To meet this financial burden, families are forced to borrow more, placing them deeper into debt. 68% of households incur water-related debt, with informal lenders charging 15–20% monthly interest.""The city’s main water sources like the Qargha Reservoir and Shah-wa-Arous Dam are either underperforming or newly operational. Long-planned projects such as the Panjshir River Pipeline and Shah Toot Dam remain delayed due to funding and political issues.Governance challenges are also severe. The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), responsible for water quality monitoring, has lost about 40% of its technical staff, ""largely due to technical staff fleeing the country."" Due to a lack of international recognition and funding cuts, like from USAID, the agency cannot conduct full water testing and lacks access to basic equipment.The report warns that unless urgent changes are made—including better governance, water infrastructure investment, and international cooperation—Kabul could face a humanitarian crisis. ""Without large-scale changes to Kabul’s water management dynamics, the city faces an unprecedented humanitarian disaster within the coming decade, and likely much sooner,"" it concludes.","Kabul's groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year. The water table has dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade. According to projections by Unicef, the city's aquifers could run dry by 2030, potentially displacing up to 3 million people.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121694249,imgsize-1385292,width-400,resizemode-4/121694249.jpg"

Fugitive liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya has told a podcast, in a rare interview, that he told the late former finance minister Arun Jaitley that he was about to fly out of India to London before he left for the airport in March 2016.At the time there was supposed to be a CBI lookout circular (LOC) issued against him.Mallya told “Figuring Out with Raj Shamani” he was not aware of any LOC against him, nor that it had been downgraded by the CBI from detaining him to informing immigration of authorities of his travel plans.He told Shamani that certain TV anchors and the Indian govt want to see him in “jail clothes, eating jail food” in Tihar and spending the rest of his life behind bars. “If that is what is inevitable, what options do I have? It might be inevitable, I’m not an astrologer. I will fight my way in court.”He said: “I told FM Arun Jaitley before leaving for the airport and then I flew from Delhi to London on the way to Geneva for a meeting which was fixed months ago. I told the then finance minister because I went from Parliament to Delhi airport. When this news hit the media, once again, it created a storm.People went running to Mr Jaitley. He denied meeting me. A Congress MP saw us and then said to the media ‘No, I saw them together’. Mr Jaitley had to retract his statement and say ‘Yes, yes I met him but only while walking — it was a fleeting meeting’.”“I never said I went to Mr Jaitley’s office, sat in front of him, had tea with him. All I said is I told the finance minister while leaving, I’m going to London and going to Geneva for a meeting, please tell the banks to sit across the table and settle with me. How long does this once sentencetake? You see the way he denied it, and then when a Congress MP pointed out his mistake that he saw us, he quickly changed.”He also said he had always planned to go back to India but his Indian passport was revoked.In the four-hour podcast Mallya also said he would be prepared to return to India. “If I have the assurance of a fair trial and assurance of dignified existence in India, I will think about returning to India seriously. “ He then reminded Shamani of the judgment in the Sanjay Bhandari case which found “Indian detention conditions a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights)”, which may mean he could not be extradited now.When asked why he had not gone already as he had lost his extradition battle in the courts, the 69-year-old said: “My stay in England is fully legitimate. There is more than the particular case you are referring to. There are ongoing proceedings in this country. It’s one of the legal battles I am fighting,” he said. This suggests he may have applied for asylum.","Vijay Mallya says he told the late former finance minister Arun Jaitley that he was about to fly out of India to London before he left for the airport in March 2016.
