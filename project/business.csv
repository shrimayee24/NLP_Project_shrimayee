Air India plane crash: Pilot's father says AAIB report 'tarnished son's reputation'; seeks 'formal' probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/air-india-plane-crash-pilots-father-says-aaib-report-tarnished-sons-reputation-seeks-formal-probe/articleshow/123944197.cms,"Ahmedabad plane crash.

'I Didn't Do It': Pilot's Last Words Before Air India Crash| Probe Report| Tech Failure or Sabotage?

Poll Do you think the media has played a fair role in reporting on the crash? Yes, they have been unbiased. No, they have sensationalized the story.

NEW DELHI: The father of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, who died in the Air India Ahmedabad crash in June this year, has called for a 'formal investigation' by the central government while criticising the findings of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) as well as the ""selective leaks"" that ""tarnish Captain Sabharwal's reputation"".In the Ahmedabad plane crash, which was one of the worst aircraft accidents in India, 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed. Air India's Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI171 to London Gatwick crashed soon after take off from Ahmedabad on June 12.In a letter to the civil aviation secretary and AAIB Director General, 91-year-old Pushkaraj Sabharwal said that selective leaks about the accident had led to speculation that Sumeet (56) was under tremendous psychological pressure and contemplating suicide, PTI reported.""These innuendos have very adversely affected my health and mental setup and the reputation of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal. They tarnish Captain Sabharwal's reputation, which is a fundamental right guaranteed to a citizen of India under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,"" the letter, dated August 29, said.Pushkaraj has demanded that the central government order a formal enquiry into the accident under Rule 12 of the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017, which empowers the Centre to institute a formal investigation into the circumstances of any accident of an Indian-registered aircraft if it appears expedient to hold such a probe.There were no immediate comments from the civil aviation ministry or the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau on the letter.Amid speculation about the cause of the fatal crash following the release of its preliminary probe report on July 12, the AAIB had asserted it was too early to draw any “definite conclusions” as the investigation was still on and that the final report would identify root causes. The agency also urged everyone to refrain from spreading premature narratives.""The preliminary report on the contrary does not allude to the 'what' happened or the bare facts of the crash, instead resorting to insinuations on the one hand and offering copious clean chits to the manufacturer/s on the other. The report in its present form is deficient, diversionary & discrepant,"" the letter said.It further alleged that selective information from the preliminary investigation — including contents of the cockpit voice recorder — had been put into the public domain.Pushkaraj also refuted speculation about his son’s mental health. Citing reports, he said it was suggested Sumeet was divorced and that caused him anxiety and depression.""It even ignores the fact that Captain Sabharwal was divorced about 15 years ago. The other speculation relating to the cause for Captain Sabharwal being desirous of committing suicide has been his mother's death. His mother died more than three years ago. After that, Captain Sabharwal had operated more than 100 flights without any incident or accident.""It is most pertinent to note that in over 25 years of flying, Captain Sabharwal had not had a single incident or accident-causing fatalities or otherwise,"" the letter said.He had almost 15,638.22 hours of flying experience, of which 8,596 hours were on the 787-8. He was also designated as a Pilot Trainer — a Line Training Captain — and held the DGCA licence for that purpose.Pushkaraj added that the absence of a formal enquiry under Rule 12, coupled with selective information being provided to the media, was very disturbing and detrimental to him and affected his fundamental rights, including the right to the reputation of his deceased son.In the preliminary report, AAIB had said the fuel supply to both engines of the plane was cut off within a gap of one second, causing confusion in the cockpit soon after takeoff. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cut off. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,"" it had said.","The father of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, who died in the Air India Ahmedabad crash in June this year, has called for a 'formal investigation' He criticises the findings of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) as well as the ""selective leaks"" that ""tarnish his reputation"" 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123945567,imgsize-165992,width-400,resizemode-4/ahmedabad-plane-crash.jpg"
Tejashwi Yadav's Bihar Adhikar Yatra: Consolidating Rahul Gandhi's gains or establishing pre-eminence in alliance?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tejashwi-yadavs-bihar-adhikar-yatra-consolidating-rahul-gandhis-gains-or-establishing-pre-eminence-in-alliance/articleshow/123951337.cms,"Tejashwi Yadav launched 'Bihar Adhikar Yatra' to challenge Nitish Kumar's government on unemployment and crime, following the 'Voter Adhikaar Yatra' led by Rahul Gandhi. This solo move, amidst CM face debates and seat-sharing talks, aims to assert RJD's dominance in the Mahagathbandhan.

'No Confusion Regarding CM's Face' Tejashwi Yadav’s Sharp Reply on INDIA Bloc CM Candidate

NEW DELHI: RJD leader and former Bihar deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav on Tuesday launched 'Bihar Adhikar Yatra' from Jehanabad to raise pitch against Nitish Kumar-led NDA government over issues of unemployment and increasing crime incidents among others ahead of the upcoming assembly elections.Interestingly, Tejashwi's solo yatra comes close on the heels of the much-hyped ""Voter Adhikaar Yatra"" which included all Mahagathbandhan leaders and was led by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi . Tejashwi was part of the Voter Adhikaar Yatra, but the limelight was hogged by Rahul - who has been leading a campaign against alleged vote theft across the country accusing the Election Commission of helping the BJP.The RJD, which is going all out to dethrone Nitish Kumar led NDA government in the state, asserted that Tejasjwi's yatra will cover districts which were left out in the 'Voter Adhikaar Yatra'.""After the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', some districts were left out. All our workers and leaders from these districts demanded that these areas should be covered, so Tejashwi ji took the decision to take out this yatra respecting their feelings,"" RJD MP Sanjay Yadav said yesterday when asked about the launch of the yatra.Also read: 'Hydrogen bomb' incoming? Rahul Gandhi to hold special presser on Sept 18; 'vote chori' row set to intensify However, the fact that this new yatra comes amid an ongoing debate over Mahagathbandhan's CM face and also inconclusive seat-sharing talks makes one wonder if the RJD leader has other objectives in mind also.Recently, the RJD leader had surprised all when during a rally in Muzaffarpur he pronounced: “And this time, Tejashwi will contest all 243 seats, whether it is Muzaffarpur, Kanti or Bochahan.”Tejashwi's remarks, more than anything, was perhaps an attempt to stamp his pre-eminence as the leader of the opposition alliance across the state.However, Tejashwi later explained that there is ""no confusion"" regarding the chief ministerial face in the opposition bloc and the name will be announced at the ""right time.""So, the question is why was such an assertion needed in the first place? After all, RJD is the largest party in the alliance and in the last elections had won 75 seats, which was the highest as it was one more than BJP's tally.However, as the opposition alliance gears up for the assembly elections, the Congress has refused to openly endorse Tejashwi as Mahagathbandhan's CM face. During the ""Voter Adhikaar Yatra"", when Rahul Gandhi was pointedly asked why Congress was not endorsing Tejashwi as the CM face, he evaded a direct reply and instead spoke of a good understanding between the partners. This, despite the fact, that Tejashwi had earlier openly announced that Rahul would become the Prime Minister once the opposition won the next Lok Sabha elections.When asked why the Congress was not backing Tejashwi Yadav as the chief ministerial face in Bihar, Rahul Gandhi said: ""A very strong partnership had been forged. All the parties (in the bloc) are working in sync. There's no tension, and there's mutual respect to help each other as we are ideologically and politically aligned. The result will be good. But the vote theft needs to be stopped.""Rahul's reply was clearly a calculated and clever deflection of announcing party's stand on the leadership issue in Bihar. The Congress leader, riding high on his successful ""vote chori"" campaign, was perhaps not willing to lose the bargaining chip so easily.Also read: Bigger, in colour: EC's new norms for EVM ballot papers; first roll-out in Bihar polls

The seat-sharing talks are underway and all parties are posturing for a higher share. In the 2020 assembly elections, the Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested 144 seats and won 75. The Congress had the worst strike rate as it contested 70 seats but won only 19. In fact, the Left parties had performed very well with the CPI-ML winning 12 out of 19, CPM 2 out of 4 and CPI 2 out of 6.This time around more parties have joined the opposition alliance and hence seat-sharing will not be an easy exercise. Already there are reports of pressure on both the RJD and the Congress to reduce their share so that other parties can be accommodated.While the Congress in Bihar is in no position to question his leadership within the alliance, they can pile pressure on the RJD during seat sharing talks. This, perhaps, explains why RJD and its leader Tejashwi have embarked on a campaign to ensure their pre-eminence in the alliance is not questioned.","Tejashwi Yadav launched 'Bihar Adhikar Yatra' to challenge Nitish Kumar's government on unemployment and crime.

MobiKwik loses Rs 40 crore in 48 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mobikwik-loses-rs-40-crore-in-48-hours/articleshow/123933014.cms,"GURGAON: Taking advantage of what is believed to be a glitch that blindsided city-based digital wallet company MobiKwik's systems, around Rs 40 crore were allegedly siphoned off over two days, Sept 11 and 12, from the company's account through a blitz of UPI transactions.The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money. Uncannily, this is the second time this has happened to MobiKwik. In Oct 2017, the company was allegedly similarly defrauded of around Rs 19 crore with the money being moved to thousands of personal bank accounts. This time, the glitch happened after the company updated its software earlier this month, investigators said. It apparently allowed Mobikwik users to send much higher amounts of money than their wallet balances. Transactions, the investigators said, also went through if users entered incorrect PINs.Police said how scamsters came to know about this glitch is under probe. Officials said they suspected insiders' involvement. The fraud was reported on Sept 13 by a MobiKwik employee, citing an audit that had detected suspicious transactions on Sept 11 and 12.According to cops, fraudulent transfers over those two hours amounted to Rs 40.2 crore. ""Nearly 5 lakh transactions took place on Sept 11-12, and so far, 2,500 bank beneficiary accounts have been identified. We have managed to freeze Rs 8 crore out of the total fraud amount. This money was deposited in these bank accounts,"" said a source.Five of the arrested men are from Nuh. The other is from Palwal. The accused have been identified as Rehan, Waqar Yunus, Wasim Akram, Mohd Amir, Mohd Ansar and Mohd Sakil. All six have been sent to judicial custody.Police spokesperson Ashok Kumar said if any company employee is found to be involved in the scam, strict action will be taken against the individual. Nuh police on Tuesday, meanwhile, asked people to report by Sept 23 any unexplained cash transfers they might have received in their accounts.""If anyone received transactions on Sept 11 and 12 due to technical security lapses or other reasons via the Mobikwik app or received unauthorised payments through the app and wishes to return them, or has any complaints related to such transactions, they can visit the office of the SP. People from Palwal district and other Mewat areas can also come."" Nuh police said in a statement. They have been charged under Section 318(4) (cheating) and 314 (dishonest misappropriation of property) of BNS. Cops are also coordinating with banks to recover the money and identify others who benefited from the alleged fraud.""The company is undertaking all possible and necessary efforts to recover the amount. However, since the police investigation and recovery efforts have just started, it's not yet possible to ascertain the impact. Based on the preliminary data, as a risk mitigating measure, the FIR was lodged for an amount of Rs 40 crore, out of which, the company has recovered around Rs 14 crore. Thus, the estimated net impact is Rs 26 crore. The company is taking aggressive collection efforts while pursuing legal course of action to recover the full amount over a period of time,"" a company spokesperson told TOI.","The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money.

Voter list of SIR-2002 and mapping with present constituencies uploaded.”Earlier, as a precursor to ordering a pan-India special revision of electoral rolls, the EC held a meeting with chief electoral officers (CEOs) of all states and UTs to assess their preparedness. The meeting focused on reviewing records of the last intensive revision, the current status of the voter list, and gathering suggestions on state/UT-specific documents that may be accepted to establish eligibility for inclusion in the rolls.The EC is expected to announce a nationwide SIR soon, possibly later this month or early next month. This exercise will replace the annual Special Summary Revision (SSR), with January 1, 2026 as the reference date, as earlier reported by TOI.The Bihar SIR, announced in June, faced sharp criticism from opposition parties, which alleged that crores of eligible citizens risked losing their voting rights due to lack of proper documents. Following this, the Supreme Court directed the EC to ensure that no eligible voter is excluded from the rolls.According to the poll panel, the primary aim of the SIR is to identify and remove “foreign illegal migrants” by verifying place-of-birth details of applicants and existing voters.","After Bihar, stage is set for a special intensive revision of electoral rolls in Delhi.

Anxiety & Anger

KULLU/DEHRADUN: This monsoon, from Kullu to Kalimpong, Kishtwar to Karnaprayag, landslides, flash floods and ground subsidence sharpened the focus on how India's expanding network of highways, tunnels, ropeways and hydropower dams is affecting the fragile Himalayan terrain. While officials insist these were natural calamities, a growing number of residents, scientists and campaigners point to unscientific construction as a key driver.In many towns and villages in India's hills, protests have intensified over cracked homes, vanished springs and roads that collapsed as quickly as they were built.Earlier this week, Supreme Court said the entire Himalayan range was facing an ecological crisis. And that conditions were ""very violent"" this year. Talking about its suo motu examination of environmental issues facing not just Himachal but also Uttarakhand and other states, the top court wondered if there was a link between the spate of rain-related events and the fast-paced construction of roads, hydro schemes, buildings and other big infrastructure projects currently on.Visible scars appeared recently on the 197km Chandigarh-Manali highway, where large sections slumped after cutting by National Highways Authority of India left near-vertical slopes of sand and gravel vulnerable to heavy rain.Carriageways were buried, tunnels flooded, and the Beas was choked with debris.""There used to be hardly any landslides,"" said Kullu environmentalist Guman Singh. ""Then came NHAI with its vertical cuts and created a mess of a road."" Former Geological Survey of India director Om Narain Bhargava called the technique ""a horrible mistake"". Villagers demanded relocation and compensation after their homes developed cracks.Activist Madan Sharma called it ""the most dangerous road ever built,"" while state rural development minister Anirudh Singh launched a 'Justice for Himachal' campaign, saying the highway had created ""more problems than it solved."" A state climate report had already warned that such cutting would ""exacerbate land instability.""Sharp disagreements over the cause of recent calamities have surfaced in Uttarakhand next door. Chief secretary Anand Bardhan told TOI there was ""no technical or scientific study"" linking large infrastructure to natural disasters, citing the flash flood in Dharali, which killed several, as an example of a disaster in a zone without major projects. He added that ropeways to Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib had not yet begun and cautioned against speculation.Campaigners, however, said the impacts were widespread. ""All ecological and local factors have been sidelined,"" said Brijesh Sati of the Char Dham Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat. ""It would not be wrong to say these disasters are man-made. We are not against development, but it must respect ecology."" He said 50,000 pilgrims completed the Char Dham yatra in 1905 without roads and that even in 2000, road broadening was done without felling trees.Expert opinion from the Supreme Court's high-powered committee on the Char Dham project underscored the risks. Environmentalist Ravi Chopra, who chaired the committee, explained that Uttarakhand's Himalayan ranges emerged from three major faults. ""Even though the rock may be strong, the slopes are weak. During field visits we saw them weakened further by deforestation and unscientific road-cutting - slopes of 60 degrees were carved where even 30 degrees is unsafe. "" He added that climate change had increased the frequency of disasters.Evidence of man-made pressures came from across the scientific community. S K Bartarya, former senior hydrogeologist at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, said both human activity and climate change were to blame. ""Drying of water bodies are surfacing across the Himalayas. To understand the impact of projects we need cause-factor analysis to separate man-made pressures from climatic ones.""Lived memory offers its own testimony. Uttarkashi-based campaigner Suresh Bhai said, ""Floods from Kedarnath in 2013 to Joshimath in 2023 show the health of the Himalayas is being spoiled. Development at the cost of ecology requires reassessment.""IPCC author Anjal Prakash called big projects in the mountains ""disaster multipliers"" that destabilise slopes. Shruti Narayan of C40 said infrastructure in fragile zones must be based on scientific evidence ""or risk becoming victims of the very calamities they claim to overcome.""Anxiety has become part of daily life in Sikkim, where a glacial lake outburst flood in Oct 2023 destroyed the Rs 1,200 crore Teesta III dam within minutes, swept away more than a dozen bridges on NH-10, and killed over 90 people. A July 2025 report said many families now kept their bags packed at night, unsure of early warning systems. The Sevoke-Rangpo railway tunnel continued beneath slopes some locals said were still settling. In Pakyong and Namchi, natural springs used for drinking and irrigation had begun drying. A travel magazine recorded complaints that newly widened roads lacked drainage. ""We are not engineers,"" a villager said, ""but we live here. We know when the mountain is being hurt.""In Himachal's Lahaul & Spiti, hundreds marched in May against the proposed Seli and Miyar schemes, alleging that avalanche risks had been ignored and impact assessments withheld.With landslides increasing, extreme rain events rising and traditional water sources vanishing, the future of infrastructure in the Himalayas now hinges on whether engineers and planners can align ambition with the limits of the land.","India's expanding network of highways, tunnels, ropeways and hydropower dams is affecting the fragile Himalayan terrain.

NHAI takes steps to curb 'unathorised' subcontracting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhai-takes-steps-to-curb-unathorised-subcontracting/articleshow/123960255.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move to ensure quality project execution and reduce delays, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has tightened norms to check ""unathorised"" subcontracting of works by main highway builders.

"Trade, security dominate EU’s India agenda; Modi says ready for next level in ties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eu-sets-strategic-agenda-to-boost-india-relations/articleshow/123960134.cms,"'Will open a new chapter in ties'

NEW DELHI: Under pressure from the US to impose tariffs on India for its oil purchase from Russia, the EU Wednesday rolled out a new strategic agenda for boosting bilateral cooperation with India, including through the creation of an EU-India Security and Defence Partnership that would also facilitate defence industrial collaboration, along with technology, maritime security and counterterrorism cooperation.Following the launch of EU’s proposals for a comprehensive strategic agenda that will be adopted at the next India-EU summit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke to PM Narendra Modi to brief him about EU’s vision for ties with India, while also wishing him on his birthday.“Delighted to know about the 'New Strategic EU-India Agenda' adopted today. India is ready to take the India-EU relationship to the next level. It is our shared commitment, shared goal, and shared responsibility. We remain committed to an early and peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict,” said Modi in a post on X, appreciating the agenda.The president said India and the EU will open a new chapter in ties and that she discussed progress in trade talks and how they can work together to effectively support Ukraine’s ""fight for freedom"".Both the EU and India want to upgrade their 2004 strategic partnership with a new comprehensive agenda, as they look for ways to offset likely damages from President Donald Trump’s tariff policy.While the leaders reiterated their commitment to have the free trade agreement (FTA) by the end of this year, there’s still a lot of ground to be covered in the trade negotiations and differences over Russia continue to act as an impediment in ties.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stressed at the launch that India’s oil procurement from Russia remained an issue, saying that “ultimately, our partnership is not only about trade, but also about defending the rules-based international order. On the trade deal, Kallas warned that nothing is agreed till everything is agreed. EU officials, however, have ruled out tariffs or sanctions against India for its crude purchase from Russia.India and the EU held the 13th round of FTA negotiations here last week and another round is expected early next month in Brussels. However, EU’s trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic, who visited India last week, said he had expected more progress in the last round of talks.As India encourages the EU to double down on defence and security cooperation and raise its profile in the Indo-Pacific, the EU also announced that the 2 sides are launching negotiations on a Security of Information Agreement that will facilitate the exchange of classified information and stronger cooperation in areas related to security and defence.“This could also pave the way for India’s participation in EU security and defence initiatives in line with EU Treaty-based frameworks,” said the EU in its joint communication on the agenda.There was also a mention of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in the agenda with the EU calling it a tragic reminder of terrorism’s human cost and committing to further strengthening counterterrorism cooperation to assess global threats, counter extremism and terrorism financing.According to the EU, its increasing strategic engagement in the Indo-Pacific – especially its support for regional partners in comprehensive security areas – aligns closely with India’s role as a key pillar of regional stability and its deepening cooperation with partners including the US, Japan, Australia, and ASEAN member states. “The two sides should improve coordination and exchange views on the links between the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions, particularly the connection between the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean as key interfaces between the two,” it proposed.Apart from defence and security, the EU proposed 4 other pillars for expanding cooperation: prosperity and sustainability, technology and innovation, connectivity and global issues and enablers across pillars.According to Indian authorities, the agenda recognizes India’s rising global profile, economic might, important security role, technological prowess, demographic dividend and its growing influence in world affairs. “It identifies India as a natural strategic partner, focusing on converging interests, complementary strengths and shared political will,” said an official. In their conversation on Wednesday, both leaders welcomed efforts towards further strengthening the India-EU Strategic Partnership for mutual prosperity, as well as for jointly addressing global issues, fostering stability, and promoting a rules-based order.","EU and India want to upgrade their 2004 strategic partnership with a new comprehensive agenda.

In a world where alliances are shifting, Delhi is seeking multiple players for its innovation story. Its new initiative, Bharat Innovates 2026, is designed to showcase Indian deep-tech talent, connect institutions with global capital, and position India as a predictable partner in unpredictable times.The first showcase will take place in Nice, France, from June 17 to 19, 2026, where around 100 ventures will be presented to European investors, policymakers and technology leaders. By making Europe the first testing ground, India is underlining its strategic intent - tying its innovation ambitions to a continent looking to diversify away from global supply chain tensions.Under the aegis of the ministry of education and guided by the principal scientific adviser, with IIT-Bombay as nodal institution, the ventures will span critical domains such as biotechnology, Industry 4.0, smart cities and mobility, AI and quantum computing, space and defence, semiconductors, agri-food technologies, medtech, sustainable energy, advanced materials and rare-earth minerals.The scale and timing of the initiative reflect a broader geopolitical recalibration. With supply chain disruptions, policy volatility in Washington and escalating global trade rivalry, Europe is searching for stable technology partners. For Brussels, India is steadily emerging as a reliable alternative. German economy minister Robert Habeck recently called India ""a key partner of the German economy in the Indo-Pacific,"" while European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in today's ""intense geostrategic competition,"" Europe intends to ""strengthen ties with one of our most reliable allies.

This has been attained five years ahead of the target set under the country’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – climate action commitment – to the Paris Agreement.As of June 30, India’s installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources stood at242.8 GW – with the total installed capacity at484.8 GW. The CREA’s report noted that the country is expected to add another 16–17 GW of solar and wind capacity in the second half of 2025.Referring to the slowdown in India’s CO2 emission growth since 2024, the report said the largest contributor to the phenomenon was the power sector, which was responsible for 60% of the drop in emissions growth rates, when the first half of 2025 is compared to the years 2021-23.“Oil demand growth slowed sharply as well, contributing 20% of the slowdown. The only sectors to keep growing their emissions in the first half of 2025 were steel and cement production,” said the report. It attributed the CO2 emissions growth from steel and cement production, by 7% and 10%, respectively, to the government’s infrastructure spending.The report noted that the reduction in coal use, on the other hand, comes after more than a decade of break-neck growth, starting in the early 2010s and only interrupted by Covid in 2020. “While coal-power generation is expected to flatline, large amounts of new coal-power capacity is still being planned, because of the expected growth in peak electricity demand,” it said.",India's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from its power sector fell by 1% year-on- year in the first half of 2025.

In March last year, the HC had sentenced him to undergo incarceration of 20 years without remission. A fixed term sentence of 20 or 30 years or till the end of natural life of a convict in lieu of death sentence is awarded by constitutional courts as they are increasingly becoming averse to capital punishment, and at the same time, realise that imposition of life sentence would entitle a convict to seek remission of sentence after being lodged in jail for 14 years.Accepting senior advocate R Basant's plea for bail during pendency of his appeal, the CJI-led bench said the relief is being given as Pigarez has already undergone almost 10 years of imprisonment, which is half of the sentence imposed by the HC.Pigarez was convicted for sexually assaulting the class VIII girl several times between 2014 and 2015 at the presbytery. The girl was a parishioner at the church of which Pigarez was vicar then.The girl's mother had lodged a complaint with police on Apr 1, 2015.

State treasury not important than health: PM

On Sept 17, his 75th birthday, PM Narendra Modi launched India's largest-ever health outreach programme for women and children, called the Swastha Nari Sashakt Parivar health initiative, and exhorted women to actively participate in the initiative.Under the initiative, the govt is going to organise more than 10 lakh health camps between Sept 17 and Oct 2 across all its health facilities, from Ayushman Arogya Mandirs to tertiary hospitals, to screen women for common health issues like anaemia, hypertension, diabetes and cancer. Some private hospitals have also volunteered to conduct camps to screen women for common health problems.""Today, I have come here to demand something from my mothers and sisters.

""If a mother is healthy, the whole family stays healthy. A mother's health impacts the whole family. Therefore, this campaign is dedicated to mothers and sisters and for their healthy future,"" he added.Noting that sickle cell anaemia is a pertinent issue in the tribal regions of the country, the PM particularly appealed to tribal women to take advantage of the benefits available during the campaign period.He also stated that all tests and medicines in the health centres will be free of cost. ""Our resolve is that no mother or daughter should be left behind. Those who require further treatment can avail themselves of the protective cover (suraksha kavach) provided by the Ayushman cards,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also launched the Adi Karmyogi Abhiyan on the occasion. The Adi Karmyogi Abhiyan initiative will include a series of service-oriented activities in tribal regions focusing on health, education, nutrition and skill development.The government runs multiple programmes targeted towards improving women's health.

Turning Olympic wins into major endorsement deals

Building businesses beyond the track and stadiums

From small-town boy to the fastest sprinter

Facing financial challenges and staying determined

Enjoying family life away from the spotlight

The fastest man alive is still setting the pace off the track. Even years after retiring, Usain Bolt has transformed his Olympic glory into a $90 million fortune through smart endorsements, and thriving businesses . From breaking world records to building a lasting legacy, Bolt proves that speed can create influence far beyond the finish line.Bolt’s wealth has been fueled largely by endorsements. Puma reportedly paid him $9 million annually, while deals with Visa, Gatorade, and Nissan added millions more. Even after retiring, these partnerships continue to generate income. Appearance fees, brand collaborations, and public speaking engagements further bolster his net worth, showing that his global appeal remains unmatched.Post-retirement, Bolt expanded into entrepreneurship. He co-founded Bolt Mobility, an electric scooter company, and grew his restaurant chain, Tracks & Records, internationally. These ventures diversify his income while keeping him connected to his roots. Through business, Bolt has proven that athletic talent can evolve into long-term financial success.Born in 1986 in Sherwood Content, Jamaica, Bolt’s speed set him apart from an early age.Over his career, he became the first sprinter to hold world records in the 100m (9.58s), 200m (19.19s), and 4x100m relay (36.84s) simultaneously. Winning eight Olympic gold medals across three Games, he retired in 2017, leaving a trail of records and unforgettable moments. His signature “lightning bolt” celebration became a global symbol of excellence and joy.Not all of Bolt’s post-retirement journey has been smooth. In 2023, $12.7 million disappeared from his account at a Jamaican investment firm due to alleged fraud. While the case prompted investigations, Bolt remained focused on growth and protecting his business interests.Away from the public eye, Bolt enjoys a grounded life in Kingston with his partner Kasi Bennett and their three children. He spends time on simple pleasures like assembling Lego sets and watching movies, creating a balance between his high-energy track career and personal fulfillment.Bolt’s journey proves that speed, vision, and resilience can create lasting influence. His $90 million net worth in 2025 reflects a combination of athletic brilliance, business acumen, and global recognition. As the greatest sprinter of all time, Usain Bolt continues to inspire generations, showing that true legacy goes far beyond medals and records.Also Read: The entire controversy between FaZe Rain and Temperr explained","Usain Bolt has transformed his Olympic glory into a $90 million fortune through smart endorsements, and thriving businesses.

Indian IT giants are preparing for a wave of contract renewals worth about $13 billion to December end, offering companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, and Wipro a chance to secure a share of the info tech market.The surge comes as clients push for cost savings and AI-driven efficiency, according to data from research and analyst firms shared with ET. According to industry estimates, deal renewals this year could surpass the $14 billion recorded in 2024.In India’s $283 billion software export industry, large deals usually start at $100 million, while mega deals exceed $500 million. More than 600 contracts are due for renewal in the second half of 2025, with values ranging from $20 million to over $1 billion, and some topping $2 billion, according to US-based Everest Group.Major deals include TCS’s partnerships with Star Alliance and Nielsen, Infosys’ contracts with Daimler AG and GE Appliances, HCLTech’s agreements with Ericsson and UK insurer Chesnara; and Wipro’s deals with German utility E.ON, Finland’s Fortum, and Brazil’s Petrobras.Earlier this month, TCS bagged a $640 million order from Danish insurer Tryg on a seven-year contract, its first major deal since January 2024.Wipro renewed a two-year contract with European food wholesaler Metro, extending a previous four-year partnership, ET reported.ISG, a tech research firm, says over 800 renewals are expected, including many from financial services and manufacturing, with mega deals worth around $1.7 billion. In the first half of 2025, about $1.3 billion in mega deals were in the renewal pipeline, covering roughly 70% of global IT deal activity.“The number of mega awards contracts with annual values of $100 million or more has been rising over the past two years. Large deal activity remains strong in 2025,” Namratha Dharshan, chief business leader at ISG, was quoted as saying by ET.She added, “The combination of strong mega deal renewal profile, along with the current macro environment that supports the creation of new mega awards, suggests that large deal activity will remain strong in 2025. This is because enterprises continue to be focused on reducing costs, and providers are focused on shaping large deals.”Darshan further explained that while big deals are gaining traction, deal sizes in the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector are generally getting smaller.She added that these smaller deals reflect cautious discretionary spending, which has remained subdued over the past 2–3 years due to challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions.Yugal Joshi, partner at Everest Group, said average deal sizes are now slightly under $100 million.“Last year, (in the) same period, there were over 700 deals, and they were typically of larger sizes…We have begun to witness initial signs of irrational deal constructs, especially around task automation due to AI agents in the market, and we are not confident that all providers will meet the intended delivery objectives,” he told ET.Renewals come amid a slowdown in global tech demand triggered by the US-led tariff war, affecting India’s software export sector.Clients are increasingly seeking discounts during renewals and demanding AI-led benefits.Joshi added that AI is now playing a major role in deciding which companies win contracts, unlike before when around 90% of renewals went to incumbents.","Indian IT giants are preparing for a wave of contract renewals worth about $13 billion to December end. The surge comes as clients push for cost savings and AI-driven efficiency. More than 600 contracts are due for renewal in the second half of 2025, with values ranging from $20 million to over $1 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123950802,imgsize-257896,width-400,resizemode-4/this-is-an-ai-generated-image-used-only-for-representative-purpose.jpg"

New US citizenship test with 128 Civics questions to study has been released.

What is the citizenship test?







The USCIS has revealed the new citizenship test that the administration was planning to bring in to assess the applicants better. The 2025 test brings back the 2020 version which was replaced by the Joe Biden government with the 2008 version. The passing score remains the same -- 12 correct answers out of 20 but the applicants will have to study 128 questions instead of 100 questions.Administrators of the test do not have to ask all 20 questions, but they can stop when the applicant answers 12 questions correctly or nine questions incorrectly.“American citizenship is the most sacred citizenship in the world and should only be reserved for aliens who will fully embrace our values and principles as a nation,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said.“By ensuring only those aliens who meet all eligibility requirements, including the ability to read, write, and speak English and understand US government and civics are able to naturalize, the American people can be assured that those joining us as fellow citizens are fully assimilated and will contribute to America’s greatness,” Tragesser said adding that this is one of the many changes.It is an oral exam that an immigrant has to take after they file an application for naturalization. They have to clear the test in two chances. And if they fail twice, their application for citizenship will be denied. In 2024 fiscal year, more than 94% passed the citizenship test.An alien can take the test in a language other than English only in a few circumstances, such as if the alien is 50 years of age or older and has been a lawful permanent resident of the US for at least 20 years.",New US citizenship test with 128 Civics questions to study has been released.

FOMC meet: What does US Fed rate cut mean for Indian stock markets?

(AI image)

What US Federal Reserve Said

How does the US Fed rate cut impact Indian stock markets?

So, will the Fed rate cut fuel a rally in the stock market? Experts say a 25 basis points cut is factored in.





The US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday . The rate cut was on expected lines, and came amidst rising pressure from US President Donald Trump . US is the world's largest economy and any benchmark rate movement by its central bank has global implications.So what will be the impact of the US Fed rate cut on the Indian stock markets? Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, are up over 5% year-to-date, but the stock market is still below its all-time high achieved in September last year.India’s fundamental growth story remains strong, but the stock market volatility has been particularly significant this year. The global trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump has sent jitters, but Indian stock markets have in general underperformed this year, and Foreign Institutional Investors have pulled out billions of dollars. Will the US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates spur a rally or will Nifty50 and BSE Sensex remain range-bound in the coming weeks?Flagging risks of slowing economic growth and job gains, the US Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points, lowering the benchmark range to 4% to 4.25%. The FOMC has also signalled the possibility of two more rate cuts in this year, and one in 2026.""Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated,"" said the US Fed in its statement.""The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen,"" it added.Market experts are of the view that rate cut will be a net positive for the Indian stock markets, despite US stocks becoming attractive.Ankit Mandholia, Head Equity and Derivatives, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services explains, “Lower US yields reduce the relative appeal of American bonds, encouraging foreign investors to channel more funds into emerging markets like India. A softer dollar aids rupee stability, helping curb import inflation and supporting investor sentiment.”“Enhanced global liquidity typically fuels risk-on appetite, benefiting equities and credit markets,” he tells TOI.“While improved prospects for US markets may attract some flows back home, India’s robust growth outlook and earnings visibility ensure it retains a strong relative appeal. Overall, Fed easing enhances liquidity, reduces macro headwinds, and supports Indian stock performance,” he adds.“The rate cut by the US Fed is partially discounted by domestic markets. Having said that, the rate cut by the US Fed augurs well for riskier assets like EM and commodities. Funds may move out of safe haven and may chase better yielding assets. Sentimentally, rate cut also augurs well for domestic IT and Metal companies in the short term,” Sunny Agrawal, Head - Fundamental Research at SBI Securities told TOI.Vijay Singh Gour, Fundamental Analyst at Miare Asset Sharekhan also believes the rate cut is factored in. “A dovish tone and more than two rate cuts in CY2025 could result in a weaker US Dollar, lower global yields, and a somewhat stronger Indian rupee. The scenario could potentially reverse significant Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) outflows observed during FY2025 and FY2026 (so far), which would likely cheer up the Indian stock markets,” he said.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments points out that bond yields have already drifted down.He also notes that recent experience suggests that US Fed rate action has only a temporary and limited impact on the Indian stock market. The rate hikes by the US Fed since March 2022 didn’t impact the Indian stock market negatively, he tells TOI.“The market trend in the medium to long-term will be dictated by GDP growth and corporate earnings. When growth and corporate earnings improve, FIIs will turn buyers in India since India has the best long-term growth story among emerging markets,” he concludes.Santosh Pandey, President & Head, Nuvama Professional Clients group believes that global EMs will be in favour, including India by global investors post US rate cut.“While EMs and US S&P/NASDAQ have moved up substantially in the last 12-18 months, India is the only market where returns are flat to negative. Also in the global markets index, India’s weight has reduced due to other markets having moved up. Hence if the US-India tensions ease, India can be the market of the year for the calendar year 2026 backed by income tax cuts, repo rate being slashed and GST rationalisation,” he tells TOI.To sum up, Indian stock markets have already built in a rate cut, and while the US Federal Reserve’s commentary will be a short-term driver for the markets, the possible news of India-US trade deal being sealed in the coming months is expected to be a bigger sentiment mover.","The US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. Nifty50 and BSE Sensex are up over 5% year-to-date, but the stock market is still below its all-time high achieved in September last year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123953464,imgsize-77878,width-400,resizemode-4/indian-stock-market.jpg"

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Tesla recently proposed a $1 trillion pay package for the company’s CEO Elon Musk . The pay package has drawn fresh criticism, this time from Pope Leo XIV, who warned it reflects dangerous levels of inequality in society. In a media interview, published by Crux last week as part of a new biography by Senior Correspondent Elise Ann Allen, the Pope said such outsized compensation highlights the widening gap between workers and corporate executives.“Yesterday the news that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world. What does that mean and what's that about?” Pope Leo said. “The Chicago-born linked Musk’s pay deal to growing polarization in both society and the Catholic Church. “CEOs that 60 years ago might have been making four to six times more than what the workers are receiving … 600 times more (now),” he said. He warned that if money alone defines value, “then we’re in big trouble.”Musk’s package has been at the center of debate in recent months. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders called it “grossly immoral” and “insane economics,” while Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended it as a reward for “doing things that no one else has done before.”Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas described it as a “good deal” for investors despite the massive number.Musk remains the world’s richest man, though he was briefly overtaken last week by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison after Oracle’s earnings beat expectations.The chairperson of Tesla's board of directors, Robyn Denholm, has defended Musk’s new multibillion-dollar compensation plan. The plan, which could be the largest in corporate history, was unveiled in a regulatory filing last week. In a recent interview with The New York Times, at Tesla’s engineering headquarters in California, Denholm said that Musk's compensation should depend on his ability to achieve ""seemingly impossible goals. "" She stated that Musk is capable of delivering world-changing technology if he is driven by these ambitious targets, even as the company faces a drop in sales and profits.“Putting together any compensation plan, you need to look at what motivates the individual that you’re trying to motivate.

NCAA removes spring transfer option for college football players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/ncaa-removes-spring-transfer-option-for-college-football-players/articleshow/123962881.cms,"NCAA consolidate transfer portals for streamlining process and ensure better roster management (Image via Getty Images)

NCAA introduces a major shift in transfer windows



Concerns and unresolved questions still prevail



How will the decision impact players and the stability of the program?



The college football offseason landscape is experiencing a huge shift. The NCAA has decided to consolidate transfer portals into a single window. It’s a move away from the previous system, which allowed 2 separate transfer periods. The change promises to streamline the process, while offering stability and a fair share of new challenges to the collegiate athletics world, marking a new era within roster management.The spring transfer portal for college football has been officially eliminated by the Division I Administrative Committee. This action will dismantle the previous two-window structure, which granted the athletes a 30-day period in winter and another in spring for entering their names. As reported, the move would establish consolidated offseason transfer periods, quite fundamentally altering roster management annual rhythm for every FCS and FBS program. The goal is the creation of a highly structured environment.The reform is a direct response to all the chaos that often defined December for the coaching staff. The old calendar made teams juggle between transfer recruiting, bowl game preparations, high school signing day and the College Football Playoff, altogether.Now, with the process condensing into one window, the NCAA aims to alleviate immense pressure and offer a highly predictable timeline for all involved parties.While spring window elimination has been finalized, the exact details of the newly established single window are still under debate. The initial proposal suggested the window of January 2-11, but it has not been confirmed yet. Football Oversight Committees have now been tasked with reviewing potential modifications of these dates and the length of the window. The final decision is expected by the Administrative Committee in October 2025.A primary contention here includes teams competing for the national championship. Ryan Day from Ohio State has been vocal, questioning how staff will focus on transfer recruiting while preparing for playoff games simultaneously. Current proposal also offers CFP teams players 5-day period after final game, for entering portal. But this has done little to ease the burden on coaches who are to recruit during the season’s most critical point.The spring window has been a major source of frustration for coaches. Its existence allowed for a wave of some unexpected post-spring practice departures. It left teams with unwanted space in the roster, long after the traditional recruiting had concluded. Scholarship players, over 1100 entered during the period last year. It created a constant state of uncertainty.The change is also intended to curb the growing trend where the spring transfer threat was used as leverage for negotiations for more financial incentives or playing time. The newer structure comes with the aim of bringing in more stability and forcing all such conversations to be held earlier during the offseason. Though this would reduce flexibility for the players who might see their circumstances changing after the single January window closing.","The NCAA has decided to consolidate transfer portals into a single window.

WASHINGTON: The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday and indicated it will steadily lower borrowing costs for the rest of this year, as policymakers responded to concerns about weakness in the job market in a move that won support from most of President Donald Trump’s central bank appointees.Only new governor Stephen Miran, who joined the Fed on Tuesday and is on leave as the head of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, dissented in favor of a half-percentage-point cut. The rate cut, along with projections showing two more quarter-percentagepoint reductions are anticipated at the remaining two policy meets this year, indicate Fed officials have begun to downplay the risk that the administration’s trade policies will stoke persistent inflation, and are now more concerned about weakening growth and the likelihood of rising unemployment.The cut, the first move by the policy-setting federal open market committee since Dec, moves the policy rate to the 4-4.25 per cent range.“The committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen,” the Fed said in its policy statement. “Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up.”New economic projections showed policymakers at the median still see inflation ending this year at 3 per cent, well above the central bank’s 2 per cent target, a projection unchanged from the Fed’s last set of forecasts published in June. The projection for unemployment was also unchanged at 4.5 per cent and economic growth slightly higher at 1.6% versus 1.4 per cent.(REUTERS)","The cut, the first move by the policy-setting federal open market committee since Dec, moves the policy rate to the 4-4.25 per cent range. “The committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen,” the Fed said in its policy statement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123962869,imgsize-1009501,width-400,resizemode-4/jerome-powell-file-photo.jpg"

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in green on Monday on positive global cues following US Federal Reserve rate cut move. While Nifty50 went above 25,400, BSE Sensex was up over 350 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,421.80, up 92 points or 0.36%. BSE Sensex was at83,046.31, up 353 points or 0.43%.Market experts predict continued upward movement, supported by progressive trade negotiations, Fed rate cut effects on global liquidity, and increased buying activity prompted by favourable sector indicators.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The Fed chief Jerome Powell described the 25 bp rate cut as “risk management cut”. The focus of the Fed commentary is the uncertainty surrounding economic activity, unemployment and inflation. Since the labour market is cooling and the GDP growth projection for 2025 is only 1.6%, perhaps two more cuts are possible this year even though the Fed chief categorically stated that “ the policy is not on preset path. ” The softening interest rate scenario is favourable for the market to remain bullish.”“Indian stock market is unlikely to be impacted by the Fed decision. The ongoing rally in the market is driven by expectations of earnings revival and a positive outcome from the India-US trade negotiations. Bank Nifty is resilient and the fair valuations of banking stocks may attract more investment, particularly institutional, into this segment.""The Nasdaq and S&P 500 declined in volatile trading on Wednesday, following the Federal Reserve's anticipated 25 basis point rate reduction and Chair Powell's comments on labour market weakness. The Dow advanced after fluctuating during Powell's address.Oil prices remained stable on Thursday after the anticipated US central bank interest rate reduction. The indication of additional rate cuts by year-end suggested potential demand growth due to reduced borrowing expenses.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 1,124 crore net on Wednesday.

Taj may exit NYC’s Pierre hotel in $2bn deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/taj-may-exit-nycs-pierre-hotel-in-2bn-deal/articleshow/123962517.cms,"File photo





MUMBAI: New York’s The Pierre Hotel, managed by the Taj chain, may see a change in ownership. The Sultan of Brunei, along with Saudi businessman Essam Khashoggi, has expressed interest in buying the iconic Manhattan property for $2 billion.If the deal is sealed, Taj could check out of the Pierre after nearly two decades of management. This will leave Taj with one property in the US — Taj Campton Place in San Francisco. Taj offered no comments to TOI’s questions.According to Taj’s website, it acquired The Pierre in 2005, positioning it as its North American flagship, and four years later, it completed a $100-million renovation of the luxury hotel.Both the New York and San Francisco hotels are under United Overseas Holding (UOH), a 100% subsidiary of the Mumbai-listed Indian Hotels (IHCL), which owns the Taj chain and is part of the $165-billion Tata Group. IHCL made an equity investment of Rs 2,324 crore in UOH in FY25, company reports showed. UOH, however, reported a loss of Rs 82 crore during that period.The Pierre, which houses 189 rooms, restaurants, and luxury apartments, was put up for sale last year after falling into ‘less-than-ideal’ condition. Apartment owners are also shareholders of the property. Notable among them are US commerce secretary and in-charge of president Donald Trump’s trade negotiations Howard Lutnick (who owns a penthouse); Princess Firyal of Jordan; fashion designer Tory Burch; and former Disney chief Michael Eisner.NYT reported that Taj has defended its stewardship of the property and proposed upgrades that would not require residents to move out. The paper also noted that The Pierre’s board is in the final stages of negotiations for the sale.If the transaction goes through, management may pass to luxury chain Dorchester Collection, owned by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, following extensive renovations. Essam Khashoggi, brother of late Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and uncle of slain Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi — who was killed inside a Saudi consulate in Turkey in 2018 — is expected to help fund the deal.The exit would mark a scaling down of Taj’s international footprint. IHCL chairman N Chandrasekaran recently told shareholders that the company has no aggressive overseas expansion plans. “In terms of overseas expansion — we are not looking at every global market. For places like Africa, New Zealand, and South Africa, we will consider city-specific opportunities, but we will not pursue widespread international expansion,” he said at the July AGM. IHCL’s international hotels generated revenue of about Rs 1,512 crore and an operating profit of Rs 202 crore in FY25.","The Sultan of Brunei, along with Saudi businessman Essam Khashoggi, has expressed interest in buying the iconic Manhattan property.

NEW DELHI: Historian Romila Thapar has said Jawaharlal Nehru University and other centres of social sciences have suffered in the last 10 years, and those who were involved in their establishment are appalled by the ""decimation"".Thapar, who was speaking at the third Kapila Vatsyayan Memorial Lecture at India International Centre on Tuesday, said maintaining academic standards at JNU in the last decade has been ""extremely problematic"".""Some of us who were involved in establishing JNU in the 1970s have been appalled by the decimation that it has undergone in the last 10 years. This is not confined to JNU alone, as other strong centres of social sciences have also suffered,"" Thapar said.She said they had succeeded in establishing a university that was highly respected at home and in the world outside.""But in the last decade, maintaining academic standards has been made extremely, to put it politely, problematic. This was done in various ways, through appointing some substandard faculty, non-professionals dictating the curriculum and syllabi, attempts to rescind the earlier appointed professor emeritus, curtailing freedom to research and teach what academics regard as meaningful,"" the historian said.Citing the Jan 2020 incident at the university, in which an armed mob stormed the campus, resulting in injuries to students and faculty, the 93-year-old said the situation ""went beyond academic mechanism"".While mentioning the arrest of Umar Khalid without naming him, Thapar said, ""political control over education silences intellectual creativity"".""There have been arrests of students for criticising authority, and some of those arrested are still in jail without a trial, despite being there for the last six years.""Intellectually purposeful education requires thinking with freedom...or is this control just another demonstration of the prevalent preference for anti-intellectualism. Speech can be silenced, but thought cannot be stilled,"" the historian said.She also criticised the ""current methods of history education"" in India by saying that ""history is an easy prey because of the generally scant knowledge of history in the country"".""The sciences, being more technical, are not fantasised. The social sciences analyse how societies function and are therefore less technical and more vulnerable. And history is an easy prey,"" Thapar said.Speaking about the ""Hindutva version"" of history teaching that upholds colonial theories of superiority of the Aryan race and the Two-Nation Theory, Thapar said it is argued that the rightful future of India lies in its reverting to a Hindu state and asked, ""can a society as diverse as India be reduced to having a single uniform heritage?""""Singular majoritarianism contradicts democracy, as also does acquiescence with the hierarchy of caste. This concerns the basic question of Indian pluralism: will we still be able to nurture a society whose parameters are open to debate and discussion?"" she questioned.Thapar added that history, as taught and read, has to be reliable and accurate, which further requires ensuring that it is not ""being manipulated for political or other reasons"". At this point, education becomes crucial, involving trained and competent teachers who can encourage students to ask questions, she said.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Jerry leaves Ben & Jerry's: Feud with parent Unilever over Gaza; co founder steps down 'in good conscience',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jerry-leaves-ben-jerrys-feud-with-parent-unilever-over-gaza-co-founder-steps-down-in-good-conscience/articleshow/123942925.cms,"



Ben & Jerry's co-founder Jerry Greenfield has stepped down from the ice cream brand, saying he can no longer “in good conscience” remain after 47 years, as the company’s long-running rift with its parent Unilever deepens over its position on Gaza.In an open letter to the Ben & Jerry’s community, shared on X by his partner Ben Cohen on Wednesday, Greenfield said this was “one of the hardest and most painful decisions” he had ever made.“This isn’t because I’ve lost my love for the people at Ben & Jerry’s. Quite the opposite. The folks who show up every day in our factories, scoop shops, and offices are some of the most passionate, caring, and values-driven people you’ll ever meet. They are the soul of Ben & Jerry’s.”Greenfield explained that what made the brand special was its independence to pursue values such as peace, justice and human rights, a freedom that he argued had been eroded by Unilever.He added that this independence was guaranteed in the merger agreement when the British consumer goods company bought it in 2000.“It’s profoundly disappointing to come to the conclusion that that independence, the very basis of our sale to Unilever, is gone,” Jerry wrote.The rift between Ben & Jerry’s and Unilever first burst into the open in 2021, when the company announced it would stop sales in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Since then, the ice cream maker has sued its parent over alleged efforts to silence it, and recently described the Gaza conflict as “genocide” a rare stance for a major US company, Reuters reported.In his letter, Greenfield also linked his resignation to wider political currents in the United States.“It's happening at a time when our country's current administration is attacking civil rights, voting rights, the rights of immigrants, women, and the LGBTQ community. Standing up for the values of justice, equity, and our shared humanity has never been more important, and yet Ben & Jerry's has been silenced, sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power.”He added that the company had always stood for more than ice cream, saying, “It was always about more than just ice cream; it was a way to spread love and invite others into the fight for equity, justice and a better world. Coming to the conclusion that this is no longer possible at Ben & Jerry's means I can no longer remain part of Ben & Jerry's. If I can't carry those values forward inside the company today, then I will carry them forward outside, with all the love and conviction I can. ”A spokesperson for Unilever’s ice cream unit, Magnum, said the company “disagrees with Greenfield’s perspective and has sought to engage both co-founders in a constructive conversation on how to strengthen Ben & Jerry’s powerful values-based position in the world.” The firm further added that Greenfield had resigned as a brand ambassador and was not involved in the lawsuit. Unilever did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Greenfield’s departure comes as Ben & Jerry’s is calling for a spin-off ahead of a planned listing of Magnum Ice Cream in November, after years of clashing with Unilever over its vocal stance on Gaza. Last week, Cohen demanded to “free Ben & Jerry’s” to protect its social mission, a call rejected by new Magnum CEO Peter ter Kulve. Cohen said the brand had attempted to engineer a sale to investors at a fair market value between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion, but the proposal was turned down.Ben & Jerry’s was founded by Cohen and Greenfield in a renovated petrol station in Vermont in 1978, and held on to its socially conscious ethos even after the Unilever takeover.",Ben & Jerry's co-founder Jerry Greenfield has stepped down from the ice cream brand.
