DOSA a dish with a past,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dosa-a-dish-with-a-past/articleshow/110066329.cms,"One of the earliest Tamil references to the word ‘dosa’ can be found in the eighth century dictionary, the Nigandus. The Nigandu ‘Chentham Diwakaram’ categorises dosa under the pancake-like ‘appam’ variety, while the 10th-century ‘Pingala Nigandu’ makes a mention of ‘kanjam’ as another name for dosa. Apart from the Nigandus, the 18th century ‘Virali vidu thoothu’ is an early Tamil work that mentions dosa.Clearly, the dish, a staple, in most homes in Tamil Nadu, has a history that steers back to kitchens hundreds of years ago.When a recent talk show on a private Tamil channel delved into the emotional connection Tamil Nadu has with this crispy delight that graces breakfast tables along with its fluffier more illustrious cousin, the idli, it brought up questions on the origins of the culinary staple. Clues to this lie not just within the annals of Tamil literature but in the halls of temples across the state. In Vishnu temples, food offerings to deities are referred to as ‘amudhu’ and here, dosa appears to take pride of place. There are numerous inscriptions dating to the 16th century that make references to the word ‘dosa’.Inscriptions at Vishnu temples in Tirupathi, Srirangam, and Kanchipuram mention that the service of donating money for the dosa offering was prevalent at the time and called ‘dosapadi’. One of them, at the Kancheepuram Varadaraja Pe rumal temple (1524AD) details a donation given for dosa by the famous Vijayanagar King Krishnadevarayar.It says that he had donated 3,000 panam for the dosapadi service. Land was purchased with this amount and 15 dosa offerings were made to the deity every day. In the same temple, an inscription dating to the reign of Vijayanagar king Achutaraya mentions a dosa offering made during the celebrations of the birth of lord Krishna. It’s unusual as dosa is not identified as among the sacred dishes made for Krishna Jayanthi celebrations today. Seventeenth-century inscriptions at the Parthasarathy temple in Chennai also mention dosa offerings for important temple festivals as do Ramanathapuram copper plates be longing to the same era. This would mean that by the 16th century, the dosa offering had become common in famous Perumal temples of the Tamilspeaking region.Even today, the dosa offering is special in famous Vishnu temples such as Azhagar Kovil, Singaperumal Kovil and Varadharaja Perumal Kovil. Most temple inscriptions mention the ingredient measurements given to make the dosa offering.For example, a Tamil inscription in Tirupathi details the measurements for the offering as three marakkal (around three kilos) of rice, one marakkal and three nazhi (nearly one and a half kilos) of black gram, one nalli and one uri (around two litres) of ghee. Some inscriptions even give recipes for different dosas. A Tirupathi temple mentions that sprinkled on top of the dosa offering. Everyone knows that dosa is prepared with rice and urad dal batter, but few inscripKanchipuram mention a spicy dosa with cumin and pepper added to the batter. Tamil cookbooks of the 19th century such as ‘Nalaveemma bagasasthiram’ also mention the same spicy dosa with cumin and pepper. The cookbook in fact has recipes for every kind of dosa from the spicy one with red chili, fried urad dal and asafoetida to sweet dosa with sugar. ‘Hindu bagasasthiram’, another old cookbook, lists recipes for a variety of dosas such as thengai dosa (coconut), vendhaya dosa (fenugreek), vengaya (onion), vella (white), kodumai maavu dosa (wheat flour), paal dosa (milk), pirandai dosa (made with a traditional herb) and paayatham paruppu dosa.The 2,000-year-old Sangam work ‘Madurai kaanji’ describes a food named ‘adai’ (similar to dosa but a different batter) sold on the streets of Madurai. Fast forward to present day, and the dosa culture shows no signs of waning. A recent report from food delivery service platform Swiggy says 29 million dosas were served up in the past year alone.In March, MTR Foods created a Guinness World Record for the lengthiest dosa at 123ft, the effort of 75 chefs and overcoming 110 previous unsuccessful attempts. It’s nothing new when you think about it as an inscription in Tirupathi, dating to the 16th-century, mentions the ‘pattanam dosa’, a big dosa, which was made in those days. So, the next time you make or order a crispy dosa, large or small, or even read about a batter record, remember, you’re savouring centuries of Tamil culinary legacy.(The writer is a researcher of Tamil culture)","The dish, a staple, in most homes in Tamil Nadu, has a history that steers back to kitchens hundreds of years ago.

How a unique hockey fest gave Coorg Guinness fame,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-a-unique-hockey-fest-gave-coorg-guinness-fame/articleshow/110066319.cms,"The lush hills of Kodagu (or Coorg , as most tourists still call it) are known for their coffee and cuisine. Much like the aroma of coffee or the traditional pandi (pork) curry that greets you in most households of this plantation region, you’ll probably find a hockey stick in every home.For the people of this region, hockey is not just a sport; it is a tradition or rather a legacy that has been passed down generations.While it is home to many gold-winning Olympians and international stars, the tradition of hockey is best summed up by the annual Kodava Hockey Festival — a summertime celebration of the sport that recently made it to the Guinness World Records as the largest field hockey tournament . What makes it truly unique is that every team comprises members of a single family — age and gender no bar.The annual event was started by Pandanda Kuttappa and his brother Kashi Ponnappa in 1997. Inspired by the 1982 Asian Games, Kuttappa wanted to put together a tournament that would keep hockey alive in its heartland. He also saw it as a way of bringing families together. It began with 62 participating families and was conducted on a budget of Rs 20,000. By 2003, the month-long tournament entered the Limca book of records.This year, the tournament, hosted by the Kundyolanda family which concluded a couple of weeks ago, witnessed a record 360 teams and 4,834 players. The budget exceeded Rs 2 crore.“Our family bid to host the tournament in 2017, and we were allotted the 2024 edition,” says Dinesh Cariappa, convener of the recently concluded carnival. “It takes a family about 4-5 years to make preparations for the tournament, so hosts have been finalised until 2028.” On being recognised by Guinness World Records, Cariappa says, “The certification on April 28 is a reflection of our rich sporting culture.”The players range from an Olympian to NRIs and kindergarten children. The oldest participant this year was 91-year-old Annadiyanda Chittiappa, while the youngest was a fiveyear-old — chin high to a hockey stick. Chittiappa speaks of the tournament with child-like enthusiasm. “We are a land of warriors and hockey is in our blood. I’ve played hockey from the time I can remember. When my daughter suggested that I should participate this year, I said why not? It made me feel younger.” The inter-clan contest is restricted to the Kodava community. A mixed gender competition, the women have a choice of playing either for their parental family or the family they are married into.Kodavas employed around the globe take time off to participate. Arun Achandira, a 46-year-old, calls Melbourne home but his heart is still in Kodagu. This year, he made his debut. “Every Kodava wants to play hockey. I didn’t get to play when I was in India as my family couldn’t put a team together and I’ve been living in Australia for 20 years now.”His 14-year-old son’s interest in the event spurred Achandira to take a month’s break and participate. “Four years ago, I introduced my older son Prince Bopanna to hockey at a local club and told him how it is an integral part of our culture,” says Achandira. “He wanted to play this year but couldn’t make it due to the academic cycle. So, my participation was to fulfil my long-cherished dream and that of my son as well. At 46, I played my first tournament!” The tournament has evolved over the years with corporate and govt funding. It is now a carnival with everything from cooking competitions to musical nights and marathons. There is even a match-making event.“The main objective is to maintain unity within the community,” says Pandanda Bopanna, president, Kodava Hockey Academy and son of Kuttappa, founder of the tournament. “We want to ensure people come back to their roots and play in front of their people. This year, 35 national and international players turned up for the tournament and an equal number of Kodavas in the armed forces took leave to play for their families.”The pride with which players take the field is palpable. Nikkin Thimmaiah, whose family Chendanda emerged champions, says it is the reason he started playing hockey. “I was inspired by watching my father play. Much before I dreamt of playing for the country, I wanted to play in the tournament and when I first played more than a decade ago, I was ecstatic,” says the 2016 Rio Olympian. Although there has been a decline in the number of Kodavas turning out for the national team lately, the tournament offers hope as the culture of hockey resides in the hearts and souls of Kodavas.","The Kodava Hockey Festival is the largest field hockey tournament in the world. The annual event was started by Pandanda Kuttappa and his brother Kashi Ponnappa in 1997. This year, the tournament, hosted by the Kundyolanda family, witnessed a record 360 teams and 4,834 players.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110066324,imgsize-4868,width-400,resizemode-4/110066324.jpg"
"'Ifeoma-A treasured thing': Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle acknowledges her Nigerian roots",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ifeoma-a-treasured-thing-duchess-of-sussex-meghan-markle-acknowledges-her-nigerian-roots/articleshow/110048057.cms,"NEW DELHI: Meghan Markle , the Duchess of Sussex , expressed her humility upon discovering her Nigerian heritage through a genealogy test during her visit to Nigeria on Saturday. Alongside Prince Harry, she is in the West African nation to promote mental health initiatives for wounded soldiers and young girls.Acknowledging Nigeria as ""my country,"" Meghan shared her eye-opening experience of learning more about her heritage.She said, ""Never in a million years would I understand it as much as I do now. And what has been echoed so much in the past day is, 'Oh, we are not so surprised when we found out you are Nigerian'.""At an event on women in leadership co-hosted by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a Nigerian economist and head of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Meghan was told that being Nigerian is defined by bravery, resilience, courage, and beauty.In October 2022, the Duchess of Sussex revealed on her podcast that a DNA-based test showed she was ""43 per cent Nigerian."" She shared her excitement with her mother, saying, ""Being African American, part of it is really not knowing so much about your lineage and background ... and it was exciting for both of us.""During the event, the audience suggested Nigerian names for Meghan, such as ""Ifeoma"" from the Igbo tribe, meaning a treasured thing, and ""Omowale"" from the Yoruba tribe, meaning the child has come home.Meghan joined female industry leaders to discuss the importance of mentorship for young women and the career challenges women face in Nigeria, where it is uncommon for women to hold top leadership and political positions. Okonjo-Iweala, the first woman and first African to lead the WTO, expressed mixed feelings about being the first, stating that women should have been there already.Meghan emphasized the importance of mentors ""returning home"" to be closer to young girls, citing Okonjo-Iweala as an example. She said, ""You need to come back home, you need to, at least, be a familiar face for the next generation to say, Oh she looks like me and I can be that'.""Earlier in the day, Meghan watched as Harry and his Invictus Games team lost to the Nigerian military's team in a sitting volleyball game featuring soldiers recovering from injuries sustained in the country's conflicts. After the match, Harry and Meghan were surrounded by players, their families, and a group of women who gifted Meghan a Nigerian fabric, expressing their support for the couple.","Meghan Markle is in Nigeria with Prince Harry to promote mental health initiatives for wounded soldiers and young girls.

Number of tests by 2 private labs at Mohalla clinics sees 80% dip since ACB report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/number-of-tests-by-2-private-labs-at-mohalla-clinics-sees-80-dip-since-acb-report/articleshow/110062106.cms,"NEW DELHI: The number of pathological tests conducted by two private diagnostic laboratories at mohalla clinics has registered a decline of nearly 80% since the anti-corruption branch of Delhi govt submitted its report on a preliminary enquiry into alleged irregularities to CBI in Feb this year.According to a report prepared by the health and family welfare department of Delhi govt, linking Aadhaar with patients’ mobile numbers was made mandatory after an initial inquiry in Dec 2023 indicated the possibility of irregularities and ghost patients, which led to a huge drop in the number of path tests.According to the report, both the number of patients tested and tests conducted at the two laboratories registered a sharp decline. Between Feb 2023 and April 2023, the two laboratories together tested 2,40,850 patients and conducted 7,52,186 tests. However, the number fell to 50,959 patients and 153,902 tests between Feb 2024 and April 2024 (till April 21).AAP govt in Delhi has outsourced the lab investigation services to Agilus Diagnostics and Metropolis Healthcare for mohalla clinics and state-run dispensaries, hospitals and polyclinics. Anti-Corruption Bureau’s preliminary findings suggested a potential scam involving “fake or manipulated” tests.When contacted, Delhi govt said there was a lot of pressure on doctors of mohalla clinics to reduce the number of pathological tests. It added that a number of patients from lower and middle-income groups were widely using the free pathological tests services of mohalla clinics and even those who were consulting central govt hospitals like AIIMS, Safdarjung and Ram Manohar Lohia were availing of this facility.Agilus Diagnostics Ltd, in a statement, said that patient registration, including the linkage through Aadhaar or other IDs for each patient, was the responsibility of Delhi govt staff at health facilities. “Agilus Diagnostics solely manages the testing process for samples received at its laboratory from these health facilities. We would like to mention that there has been a significant increase in referrals and tests conducted since mid-March 2024,” the company said.There was no response from Metropolis Healthcare Limited.ACB had conducted an analysis of pathological tests done at the city’s mohalla clinics between Feb and Dec last year and found “massive irregularities”. The investigating agency , in its PE report, stated that the two pathological laboratories had together conducted nearly 2.2 million tests across the city between Feb and Dec 2023, of which at least 65,000 tests, out of a random sample of 1.15 lakh, were “found to be fake or manipulated”.“There is a serious lapse/misconduct on the part of the district nodal officer, cluster in charge, and project director who failed to supervise and monitor the scrutiny of tests properly. The data indicates a massive fraud, manipulation of records by the outsourced labs with an intention to create a huge loss to the govt exchequer amounting to crores of rupees,” an ACB mentioned in the PE.Following an impact assessment study conducted earlier in seven mohalla clinics by the health and family welfare department of Delhi govt, LG VK Saxena had recommended a CBI investigation into it. A separate inquiry by ACB was also recommended in the case.According to ACB’s PE report, mentioning the name and mobile number of the patient was compulsory for making an entry in the Lab Information Management System, as the reports were also required to be sent to the registered mobile number. Since the system was designed and developed by the outsourced agencies, they had full control and access over the entire data.“Hence, the possibility of manipulation of data by the outsourced lab vendors could not be ruled out,” the report added. ACB had also conducted random tele-verification of mobile numbers of patients at both private labs, which revealed that a large number of tests were conducted on either invalid mobile numbers or mobile numbers not related to the patients.A large number of tests was allegedly done without the presence of treating doctors.","Delhi govt has outsourced the lab investigation services to Agilus Diagnostics and Metropolis Healthcare for mohalla clinics and state-run dispensaries, hospitals and polyclinics.

It was a decision taken by the state cabinet,"" Singh said.""Biometrics were taken in ten villages of Chandel during which 1,165 illegal immigrants were found, 1,147 illegal immigrants were found in 13 villages of Tengnoupal district, 154 illegal immigrants in Churachandpur and rest were found in Kamjong district,"" Singh said.These figures are not inclusive of the additional 5,457 illegal immigrants who entered Kamjong district, Singh said, adding biometrics of 5,173 people have been taken while 329 have returned back voluntarily after situation improved in the neighbouring country.""The detection of illegal immigrants was not limited to one community but was to cover the entire state of Manipur. They were found after visiting villages,"" Singh said.""The campaign for identifying illegal immigrants was, however, cut short just after a month it started and had to be stopped after violence broke out on May 3,"" Singh said.Singh expressed strong disappointment with the Geneva-based International Court of Jurists (ICJ) which had recently ordered Indian authorities to stop deportation in Manipur.Singh asked, ""Does the organisation know the hardship faced by the indigenous population and issues of deforestation, demographic challenges and poppy cultivation caused by the illegal immigrants?""""It is an irresponsible statement. Both the Centre and Manipur government are not under them. The deportations were also not forcible and no laws were broken.

We will engage a team or an NGO to purchase the products and sell them on their behalf.""""We have also prepared to do something for the betterment of those staying in the relief camps once the election code of conduct concludes"", Singh said.More than 219 people were killed and thousands displaced from homes after ethnic clashes broke out on May 3 last year, when a 'Tribal Solidarity March' was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur's population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley.

Indian govt had said last week that there has been no “formal diplomatic communication” on the arrests.The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said that Singh was arrested on May 11 for his role in the killing of Nijjar. He was already in the custody of the Peel Regional Police for unrelated firearms charges, the release said.“This arrest shows the nature of our ongoing investigation to hold responsible those that played a role in the homicide of Hardeep Singh Nijjar,” said Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, IHIT officer-in-charge.“IHIT pursued the evidence and gained sufficient information for the British Columbia Prosecution Service to charge Amandeep Singh with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder,” the police statement said.Investigators said no further details of the arrest can be released due to ongoing investigations and court processes.IHIT investigators on May 3 arrested three Indian nationals — Karan Brar (22), Kamalpreet Singh (22) and 28-year-old Karanpreet Singh — for the murder of Nijjar.

‘Judge’s testimony does not outweigh peon’s’: Gujarat High Court quashes 7-year term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judges-testimony-cant-weigh-more-than-peons-hc/articleshow/110061375.cms,"AHMEDABAD: Does the testimony of a judge in a criminal case carry more weight than that of a peon who works in the same court?It was on this ground that the Gujarat high court quashed an order awarding seven-year jail term to an octogenarian , a former court employee, who was punished after cash and valuables from the court's ""muddamal"" went missing.The HC has now ordered the lower court to take a fresh decision on the case.The case involves 85-year-old Akbarali Saiyed , who was a nazir (curator) at a civil court in Chhota Udepur, which was then part of Vadodara district . In 1991, Vadodara's district judge conducted an unannounced inspection of the ""muddamal"" at the Chhota Udepur court. Due to paucity of time, the district judge decided to continue the inspection the next day. He handed over the dominion of the strongroom to the civil judge and asked him to keep the key.The district judge's visit was not possible the next day, but he turned up a day later, on Nov 16, 1991, to resume the inspection. Some envelopes were found torn and cash worth Rs 80,833 was found missing along with a few silver ornaments and a wristwatch from the ""muddamal.""The missing cash and valuables from the ""muddamal"" led the civil judge and judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) of the court to file a criminal complaint against Saiyed, then the nazir of the court, for misappropriation of cash and valuables in his custody. During the trial, the court's peon testified that the complainant JMFC himself had opened the strongroom on Nov 15, 1991, after office hours, despite the peon and an in charge nazir telling him that the district judge had barred anyone from entering the area in the middle of inspection.In 2000, a trial court held Saiyed guilty and sentenced him to seven years in jail and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000. The punishment was upheld by an appellate court. This brought Saiyed to the HC.Advocate Zubin Bharda, who represented Saiyed, underscored that Saiyed was on leave that day. The district judge had given the dominion of the strongroom to the judge, and Saiyed was not even in charge of the strongroom. Still, just because a judge had filed the complaint, the court staff was held guilty. The lower courts wrongly attached more importance to the judge's statement than the statement of the peon. This is against the provisions of the Evidence Act , particularly when both - the judge and the peon - are prosecution witnesses.","Akbarali Saiyed, 85, was a nazir (curator) at a civil court in Chhota Udepur, Gujarat.

Rocket Enhancement

BENGALURU: A year after Isro ’s biggest rocket LVM3 entered global market launching 72 commercial satellites, India’s Space PSU NewSpace India Limited ( NSIL ), has invited private industry to partner in end-to-end production of the launch vehicle , envisaging the need to double-treble the annual production capability to 4-6 from two at present. LVM3 has successfully accomplished seven missions till date.NSIL has released a Request for Qualification (RFQ) inviting potential bidders. “As part of space sector reforms announced by the govt in 2020, space activities in India were further opened up for the private sector. NSIL is considering collaborating with Indian industries to leverage their expertise towards productionising LVM3 in increased numbers and for a longer period,” the PSU said.TOI had first reported about NSIL’s interest in involving private players to build LVM3 in 2021. At the time, NSIL, which had been mandated with productionising launch vehicles, was gearing up to use the rocket for commercial launches for the very first time. And separately, its CMD had told TOI that it was looking to issue an expression of interest (EoI) enabling private players to build the launch vehicle.A single Indian industry partner will be selected through the process to execute the envisaged LVM3 production programme with NSIL as the overall system integrator responsible for end-to-end realisation.The reason NSIL is looking at private players for LVM3 — which was earlier called GSLV-Mk3 — is to meet increased demand for launches. The PSU is aiming to increase the number of vehicles produced annually. The global launch service market indicates substantial demand for communications satellites and satellite constellations.As per NSIL: “To cater to the projected global launch service market demand, there’s a need to increase the production capability of LVM3 to four-six vehicles per year from the present capability of two vehicles. As part of this, NSIL is exploring options to partner with Indian industry through aPPP framework wherein industry partners would be made responsible to produce LVM3 in large numbers over a period of 10 to 15 years.”Further, NSIL is also considering the option to seek investment from the partnering Indian industry for the same. “LVM3 production programme under a PPP is proposed over a period of fourteen years with the Indian industry expected to produce up to six LVM3 annually from the sixth year of commencement of the programme. Approximately 60 to 65 launch vehicles are projected to be realised through Indian industry during this proposed period,” NSIL added.LVM3, the heavy lift launcher of Isro, has successfully accomplished seven missions till date. During 2023, LVM3 made its successful entry into the global commercial launch service market, launching 72 satellites belonging to OneWeb. As part of payload improvement for LVM3, Isro has outlined plans which among several others, include induction of a semi-cryogenic stage.“The planned technological advancements are expected to significantly improve the LVM3’s payload capability in the coming years. Based on the market assessment for “Global trends in launch service market”, NSIL recognises that there is growing demand for launching heavier communication satellites as well as satellites for global Mega LEO Constellations in large numbers. The market assessment indicates substantial growth potential for the LVM3 class of vehicle in the coming decade,” the PSU added.","NSIL has released a Request for Qualification (RFQ) inviting potential bidders.

Govt primary schools shut due faulty policies over years: CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/govt-primary-schools-shut-due-faulty-policies-over-years-cm/articleshow/110061590.cms,"Panaji:

TOI

The number of govt primary schools during the academic year 2023-24 stood at 696, down from over a thousand around a decade ago. With several others with fewer than 10 students and on the verge of closure, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that faulty govt policies over the years have been responsible for this.Speaking to, Sawant said that it is only after he took over as CM that he altered some of these policies to safeguard the interest of govt schools.“Govt primary schools are shutting down because over the years, govt itself gave permissions to aided schools . I want to state this frankly. Despite our govt schools being in existence, within a 2km radius, permission was given to open aided schools. Automatically, this affected govt schools,” he told TOI.He said that the management of aided schools too took the opportunity to jeopardise the interest of govt schools after taking help from the same state funds.“We ourselves provided buses to these aided schools. So, they took our money and shut down our own schools. I have put a stop to this. In my last five-year tenure, hardly five new schools got permission to open. Our govt schools should come first, then the rest,” said Sawant.He said that aided schools are free to manage their affairs on their own, and that gives them an edge.“I could carry out the recruitment of 150-180 teachers for govt schools only now, after five years. Over four years, I faced a lot of problems. The recruitment rules changed after advertising the posts, etc. Aided schools can recruit teachers more easily. In an aided school, you can apply and just get in as a teacher,” the CM said.He said that the preference among parents for English-medium primary education is also affecting govt schools.“The second issue is that everyone feels their child should study in an English-medium school. Because of this, Marathi-medium primary schools have started shutting down. But govt, with the intention of promoting regional languages , is only giving permission to Marathi or Konkani schools. We now give permissions to aided schools only after conducting a survey and ensuring that there are no objections,” he said.Sawant said that the infrastructure of 90% of govt primary schools has been upgraded by the state to ensure that the schools do well.",The number of govt primary schools in the state stood at 696 in the academic year 2023-24. This is down from over a thousand around a decade ago.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Record 29th ascent for Nepal’s ‘Everest Man’; Briton bests feat by foreigners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/record-29th-ascent-for-nepals-everest-man-briton-bests-feat-by-foreigners/articleshow/110062865.cms,"- 'Not that amazing' -

KATHMANDU: Mount Everest saw a record-breaking day Sunday as Nepali climber Kami Rita Sherpa and Briton Kenton Cool reached the top of the world's highest mountain , extending their records for the most summits by a Nepali and a foreigner.Sherpa, 54, reached the peak for the 29th time and Cool, 50, made his 18th summit .""Kami Rita and Kenton Cool both reached the summit today, making records,"" Rakesh Gurung of Nepal's tourism department told AFP.A guide for more than two decades, Sherpa, also known as ""Everest Man"", first summited the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) peak in 1994 when working for a commercial expedition.He has since climbed Everest almost every year, guiding clients. It was not immediately clear whether he had a client with him on Sunday.""Back again for the 29th summit to the top of the world... One man's job, another man/woman's dream,"" Sherpa posted on his Instagram account from base camp last week.Sherpa climbed Everest twice last year to reclaim his record after another guide, Pasang Dawa Sherpa , equalled his number of ascents.Kami Rita Sherpa has previously said that he has been ""just working"" and did not plan on setting records.He has also conquered other challenging 8,000-metre peaks including the world's second-highest mountain, K2 in Pakistan.Cool, also a guide, was once told he would not walk unaided again after a rock-climbing accident in 1996 that broke both his heel bones, but his mountaineering career has confounded predictions.He told AFP in a 2022 interview after his 16th ascent that his Everest record was ""not that amazing"" in the context of Nepali climbers' achievements.""I'm really surprised by the interest... considering that so many of the Sherpas have so many more ascents,"" he said then.Nepal has issued 414 Everest permits to mountaineers for this year's spring climbing season, which runs from April to early June.Most Everest hopefuls are escorted by a Nepali guide, meaning more than 800 climbers will tread the path to the top of the world's highest peak in the coming weeks after a group of Nepali climbers opened the route to the summit on Friday.China also reopened the Tibetan route to foreigners this year for the first time since closing it in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic.Nepal is home to eight of the world's 10 highest peaks and welcomes hundreds of adventurers each spring, when temperatures are warm and winds are typically calm.A climbing boom has made mountaineering a lucrative business since Edmund Hillary and sherpa Tenzing Norgay made the first ascent in 1953.More than 600 climbers made it to the summit of Everest last year but it was also the deadliest season on the mountain, with 18 fatalities.","Nepali climber Kami Rita Sherpa and Briton Kenton Cool reach the top of Mount Everest. Sherpa, 54, reached the peak for the 29th time and Cool, 50, made his 18th summit. The pair have set records for the most summits by a Nepali and a foreigner.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110063042,imgsize-1426488,width-400,resizemode-4/110063042.jpg"

You have to find a more creative way to solve a problem or to present a concept,"" he said.The roots of Hollywood's golden age in the 1970s can be found in Corman's films.Jack Nicholson made his film debut as the title character in a 1958 Corman quickie, ""The Cry Baby Killer,"" and stayed with the company for biker, horror and action films, writing and producing some of them. Other actors whose careers began in Corman movies included Robert De Niro, Bruce Dern and Ellen Burstyn.Peter Fonda's appearance in ""The Wild Angels"" was a precursor to his own landmark biker movie, ""Easy Rider,"" co-starring Nicholson and fellow Corman alumnus Dennis Hopper. ""Boxcar Bertha,"" starring Barbara Hershey and David Carradine, was an early film by Scorsese.Corman's B-movie directors were given minuscule budgets and often told to finish their films in as little as five days. When Howard, who would go on to win a best director Oscar for ""A Beautiful Mind,"" pleaded for an extra half day to reshoot a scene in 1977 for ""Grand Theft Auto,"" Corman told him, ""Ron, you can come back if you want, but nobody else will be there.""""Roger Corman was my very first boss, my lifetime mentor and my hero. Roger was one of the greatest visionaries in the history of cinema,"" Gale Ann Hurd, whose notable producing credits include the ""Terminator"" film franchise, ""The Abyss"" and ""The Walking Dead"" television series, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.Initially only drive-ins and specialty theaters would book Corman films, but as teenagers began turning out, national chains gave in. Corman's pictures were open for their time about sex and drugs, such as his 1967 release ""The Trip,"" an explicit story about LSD written by Nicholson and starring Fonda and Hopper.Meanwhile, he discovered a lucrative sideline releasing prestige foreign films in the United States, among them Ingmar Bergman's ""Cries and Whispers,"" Federico Fellini's ""Amarcord"" and Volker Schlondorff's ""The Tin Drum."" The latter two won Oscars for best foreign language film.Corman got his start as a messenger boy for Twentieth Century-Fox, eventually graduating to story analyst. After quitting the business briefly to study English literature for a term at Oxford University, he returned to Hollywood and launched his career as a movie producer and director.Despite his penny-pinching ways, Corman retained good relations with his directors, boasting that he never fired one because ""I wouldn't want to inflict that humiliation.""Some of his former underlings repaid his kindness years later. Coppola cast him in ""The Godfather, Part II,"" Jonathan Demme included him in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Philadelphia"" and Howard gave him a part in ""Apollo 13.""Most of Corman's movies were quickly forgotten by all but die-hard fans. A rare exception was 1960's ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" which starred a bloodthirsty plant that feasted on humans and featured Nicholson in a small but memorable role as a pain-loving dental patient. It inspired a long-lasting stage musical and a 1986 musical adaptation starring Steve Martin, Bill Murray and John Candy.In 1963, Corman initiated a series of films based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe. The most notable was ""The Raven,"" which teamed Nicholson with veteran horror stars Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre and Basil Rathbone. Directed by Corman on a rare three-week schedule, the horror spoof won good reviews, a rarity for his films. Another Poe adaptation, ""House of Usher,"" was deemed worthy of preservation by the Library of Congress.""It was my privilege to know him. He was a great friend. He shaped my childhood with science fiction movies and Edgar Allen Poe epics,"" John Carpenter, director of ""Halloween,"" ""The Thing"" and other classic horror and action films, said on X. ""I'll miss you, Roger.""Near the end of his life, Karloff starred in another Corman-backed effort, the 1968 thriller ""Targets,"" which marked Peter Bogdanovich's directorial debut.Corman's success prompted offers from major studios, and he directed ""The St. Valentine's Day Massacre"" and ""Von Richthofen and Brown"" on normal budgets. Both were disappointments, however, and he blamed their failure on front-office interference.Roger William Corman was born in Detroit and raised in Beverly Hills, but ""not in the affluent section,"" he once said. He attended Stanford University, earning a degree in engineering, and arrived in Hollywood after three years in the Navy.After his stint at Oxford, he worked as a television stagehand and literary agent before finding his life's work.In 1964 he married Julie Halloran, a UCLA graduate who also became a producer.He is survived by his wife, Julie, and children Catherine, Roger, Brian and Mary.","Corman helped create hundreds of B-movies as a producer and director. He hired such aspiring filmmakers as Francis Ford Coppola, Ron Howard, James Cameron and Martin Scorsese. Corman got his start as a messenger boy for Twentieth Century- Fox.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110062553,imgsize-739945,width-400,resizemode-4/110062553.jpg"

He’s a senior now in high school, and he’ll be going to college,” Trump shared, providing a glimpse into the young Trump's involvement and personal thoughts on political matters.Despite his interest, Barron recently declined an opportunity to serve as a delegate for the Florida Republican Party at the upcoming Republican National Convention.

Baltimore bridge collapse: Crews prepare for controlled demolition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-crews-prepare-for-controlled-demolition/articleshow/110049362.cms,"NEW DELHI: After weeks of preparation, crews have scheduled a controlled demolition for Sunday to dismantle the largest remaining section of the collapsed Francis Scott key bridge in Maryland . The bridge crashed down under the force of a massive container ship on March 26.The steel span came crashing down after the Dali lost power and collided with one of the bridge's support columns shortly after leaving Baltimore.Since then, the vessel has remained trapped amidst the debris, leading to the closure of Baltimore's bustling port for most maritime traffic.The collapse tragically claimed the lives of six members of a roadwork crew, who plunged to their deaths. The recovery of the last body from the underwater wreckage occurred earlier this week. All the victims were Latino immigrants who had sought job opportunities in the US. They were diligently filling potholes during an overnight shift when the bridge met its destruction.The planned controlled demolition aims to facilitate the refloating of the Dali, enabling its safe return to the Port of Baltimore . Once the ship is extracted, maritime traffic can gradually resume, offering much-needed relief to thousands of longshoremen, truckers, and small business owners whose livelihoods have been affected by the prolonged closure.The 21-member crew of the Dali will remain sheltered aboard the ship during the detonation of the explosives.William Marks, a spokesperson for the crew, stated in an email that they would shelter ""in a designated safe place"" during the demolition. He emphasised, ""All precautions are being taken to ensure everyone's safety.""In a videographic released this week, authorities explained that engineers are employing precision cuts to manage the breakdown of the trusses. They highlighted that this method ensures ""surgical precision"" and is one of the safest and most efficient ways to dismantle steel under significant tension. According to the videographic, the steel structure will be ""thrust away from the Dali"" when the explosives cause it to tumble into the water.Once demolished, hydraulic grabbers will hoist the resulting sections of steel onto barges.""It's important to note that this controlled demolition is not like what you would see in a movie,"" the video explains, emphasizing that from a distance, it will resemble fireworks or loud thunder and emit puffs of smoke.Officials had previously aimed to remove the Dali by May 10 and reopen the port's 50-foot (15.2-meter) main channel by the end of May.The crew members of the Dali haven't been permitted to depart the grounded vessel since the disaster. Officials said that they've been occupied with maintaining the ship and aiding investigators. Among the crew, 20 are from India and one is from Sri Lanka.The National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI are conducting investigations into the bridge collapse .The Danish shipping giant Maersk chartered the Dali for a scheduled journey from Baltimore to Sri Lanka, but the vessel's journey was abruptly halted. The crew issued a distress call, reporting a loss of power and inability to control the steering system. Shortly after, the ship collided with the bridge.Officials have indicated that the safety board investigation will center on the ship's electrical system.(With inputs from agencies)","Crews have scheduled a controlled demolition for Sunday to dismantle the largest remaining section of the collapsed Francis Scott key bridge in Maryland.

International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has warned that Pakistan’s high political uncertainty and resurgence of social tensions could undermine economic stabilisation policies in the cash-strapped country.“Downside risks remain exceptionally high. While the new government has indicated its intention to continue the SBAs (standby arrangement) policies, political uncertainty remains significant,” the IMF said in a staff report on Friday.Pakistan had narrowly averted a sovereign debt default last summer.The economy has now stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to 17% in April from a record 38% in May last year.IMF officials are expected to visit Pakistan this month to discuss a new loan programme. The Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition govt likely to seek at least $6 billion and request additional financing.According to the global lender, while Pakistan did “broadly achieve its narrow objectives, the challenges ahead remained uncomfortably high and would require sustained efforts to address them”.The report said that Pakistan’s fiscal and external vulnerabilities remain very high, including debt sustainability and refinancing risks. “Pakistan’s capacity to repay the IMF hinges on strong policy implementation,” the report stated.

IMF doubts Pakistan's ability to repay debts as support team arrives in Islamabad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-doubts-pakistans-ability-to-repay-debts-as-support-team-arrives-in-islamabad/articleshow/110028404.cms,"NEW DELHI: International Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed serious concerns about Pakistan's ability to repay its debts, particularly to the global lender itself. The IMF 's assessment came as its support team arrived in Pakistan on Friday to discuss a new bailout package under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), following Islamabad's request.The IMF staff report, issued earlier this month, stated that ""Pakistan's capacity to repay the fund is subject to significant risks and remains critically dependent on policy implementation and timely external financing."" The report further highlighted the exceptionally high risks that could jeopardize policy implementation and erode repayment capacity and debt sustainability, including delayed adoption of reforms, high public debt and gross financing needs, low gross reserves, the State Bank of Pakistan's net FX derivative position, a decline in inflows, and sociopolitical factors.The report emphasized that restoring external viability is crucial for ensuring Pakistan's capacity to repay the fund, which depends on strong policy implementation, including external asset accumulation and exchange rate flexibility. Geopolitical instability was also mentioned as an additional source of risk, despite some reduction in uncertainty surrounding global financial conditions since the last review.According to the IMF, Pakistan requires gross financing of USD 123 billion over the next five years, with the country expected to seek USD 21 billion in fiscal year 2024-25, USD 23 billion in 2025-26, USD 22 billion in 2026-27, USD 29 billion in 2027-28, and USD 28 billion in 2028-29.Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the IMF support team will discuss the first phase of the next long-term loan programme with Pakistan's financial team, focusing on data collection from various departments and discussions on the upcoming budget for the fiscal year 2025 (FY2025) with the Ministry of Finance officials. The team is expected to stay in Pakistan for over 10 days.Pakistan has decided to seek a rollover of around USD 12 billion in debt from key allies like China in the 2024-25 fiscal year to address the USD 23 billion gap in its external financing. The Finance Ministry insiders stated that USD 5 billion from Saudi Arabia, USD 3 billion from the UAE, and USD 4 billion from China will be rolled over, with estimates of further new financing from China to be included in the next financial year's budget.The country is expected to receive more than USD 1 billion from the IMF under the fresh loan programme, along with new financing from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. The federal government aims to achieve budget targets before the anticipated arrival of the IMF review mission in Pakistan, with negotiations for a new loan programme expected to commence in mid-May, ahead of the budget presentation in June.Despite narrowly avoiding default last summer and experiencing some economic stabilization, Pakistan continues to face high fiscal shortfalls and stagnating growth, with the external account deficit being controlled through import control mechanisms at the expense of economic growth, which is expected to be around 2 per cent this year compared to negative growth last year.","IMF has expressed serious concerns about Pakistan's ability to repay its debts, particularly to the global lender itself.

Moosa Zameer, Maldives minister of foreign affairs made the announcement on Saturday, putting an end to speculation surrounding the exact number of personnel repatriated from Maldives to India.The personnel, previously stationed in the Maldives to manage two helicopter platforms and a Dornier aircraft primarily used for medical evacuations, were repatriated by Friday, in line with the agreement reached between the two nations in February in New Delhi, setting a deadline of May 10.The agreement was prompted on the request of President Mohamed Muizzu , known for his pro-China stance, shortly after assuming office in November.Reports indicate that personnel withdrawal occurred in phases from various locations in the Maldives. Zameer mentioned that 26 soldiers left Gan between March 7 and March 9, followed by 25 from Hanimaadhoo between April 7 and April 9, and 12 from Kadhdhoo on a recent Tuesday, with the final batch of 13 withdrawing on Thursday.Earlier assertions by the Maldivian government suggested the presence of 89 Indian soldiers responsible for operating two military helicopters and a Dornier aircraft. Zameer clarified that civilian employees from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the manufacturer of the gifted helicopters, have replaced the military personnel.Addressing concerns raised regarding the possibility of military personnel remaining in civilian attire, Zameer dismissed such claims, stating that there was no deception involved and reiterated the Indian government's affirmation that the replacements are civilians. ""Indian military was not here under any deception, were they? So there is no reason for us to have doubts when the Government of India has stated that these are civilians"", he said.Minister of defence Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon confirmed the status of the replacements. ""The command and control of the aircraft are now officially under the Defence Ministry and Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF),"" Ghassan was quoted as saying by the Edition.mv.Relations between India and Maldives have undergone strain since Muizzu's assumption of office, despite the Maldives' historically close ties with India. During Zameer's recent visit to India, external affairs minister S Jaishankar emphasized the development of bilateral ties based on mutual interests and reciprocal sensitivity.The discussions between Jaishankar and Zameer covered various aspects of the India-Maldives partnership, focusing on fostering opportunities for future collaboration.

'Royal rift': Prince Harry in tears as King Charles honors Prince William',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/royal-rift-prince-harry-in-tears-as-king-charles-honors-prince-william/articleshow/110059418.cms,"Prince Harry was reportedly brought to tears after King Charles conferred a prestigious military honor upon his elder brother, Prince William , heightening the ongoing royal family tensions. According to royal expert Tom Quinn , the timing of the announcement seemed designed to deepen the strain, coinciding with Harry's return to London to mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games—an event significantly meaningful to him.On this emotionally charged day, Buckingham Palace declared that William, 41, would be appointed as colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps. This role was notably significant as Harry, 39, had served with distinction in the same unit during his deployment in Afghanistan. Quinn described the decision as ""a real kick in the teeth for the son who always felt marginalized and underrated,"" suggesting the announcement was a deliberate snub.The designation of this role to William, whom Harry reportedly views as a central figure in his personal struggles, added an extra layer of hurt. Quinn articulated the symbolic weight of the appointment, saying, ""They [the royal family] have decided the gloves are off and that Harry needs to realize that when you betray the family, you don’t just escape the things you hated doing as a working royal—you also lose the things you loved.""This event underscores the deep divisions within the royal family, with Harry having stepped down as a senior royal in 2020 and now living in California with his wife, Meghan Markle, and their children. His brief return to the UK was marked not only by his absence at family gatherings but also by this poignant military honor bestowed upon his brother, signifying perhaps a final severing of his ties to his former life within the British military and royal duties.Prince William, while not involved in active combat, served as a search and rescue pilot and later as an air ambulance pilot, roles that have endeared him in the public eye. Meanwhile, Harry’s contributions during his second tour in Afghanistan and subsequent veteran advocacy, highlighted by his involvement with the Invictus Games, paint a picture of a prince deeply connected to his military roots, making this latest development particularly poignant.This complex weave of personal achievements, familial duty, and public service continues to unfold publicly, reflecting the challenging dynamics of modern royal responsibilities and personal desires.","Prince Harry was reportedly brought to tears after King Charles conferred a prestigious military honor upon his elder brother, Prince William.

Putin replaces defense minister in rare cabinet shake-up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/putin-replaces-defense-minister-in-rare-cabinet-shake-up/articleshow/110065410.cms,"BERLIN: President Vladimir Putin of Russia replaced his minister of defense on Sunday with an economist, shaking up his national security team for the first time since his invasion of Ukraine and signaling his determination to put Russia's war effort on an economically sustainable footing.Putin kept the minister, Sergei Shoigu , in his inner circle, tapping him to run the country's security council -- a position giving Shoigu close access to the president but little direct authority.Shoigu will replace Nikolai Patrushev , a former KGB colleague of Putin, whom the Kremlin said would be moved to position to be announced in the coming days.Andrei Belousov, an economist who had served as first deputy prime minister since 2020 and long been seen as one of Putin's most trusted economic advisers, was nominated to become the new defense chief.The Kremlin said Russia's ballooning defense budget warranted putting an economist in charge, and that Belousov would help make the Russian military ""more open to innovation.""The Cabinet shifts represented a rare overhaul for Putin, who tends to avoid rash changes, and they could mark an inflection point in Russia's more than two-year war in Ukraine.He removed from the military's helm a man whom Russian pro-war commentators and Western analysts alike held partly responsible for Moscow's many failures at the outset of the invasion. And by installing an economist, he tacitly acknowledged the importance of industrial might to any military victory.Shoigu's potential dismissal was an object of speculation from the war's first days, when Russian forces appeared unprepared for the determination of Ukraine's resistance.Last summer, mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin staged a mutiny to try to remove Shoigu, the defense minister for more than a decade. But Putin, who analysts say values loyalty, stuck with Shoigu.Now, with the Russian military having gained the battlefield initiative, Putin is signaling a greater willingness to make changes and to show that Russia has the discipline and economic capacity to wage a long war. A possible shift in Shoigu's stature was telegraphed last month, when Russian authorities arrested one of his top deputies on corruption charges.But the Kremlin said Sunday that another frequent target of critics of Russia's war effort -- Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian general staff and the highest-ranking Russian military officer -- would remain in his post.It is unclear how much authority over the war Shoigu will retain. While his new job parallels that of the U.S. president's national security adviser, analysts say that in Putin's Russia, the role has limited influence because it does not directly control the military or a security agency.Shoigu was ""too big to fall,"" Alexander Baunov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, wrote. But in his new role, he added, Shoigu would be ""without real command powers and without a cash box.""Belousov, 65, who was a Kremlin economic adviser before being named first deputy prime minister in 2020, comes from the so-called economic bloc of the government, which won plaudits within the Kremlin for its agile response to Western sanctions and success in stabilizing the country's economy.The security bloc of the government, by contrast, was subject to recriminations after the Russian military pursued a faulty strategy in the early months of the war and faltered on the battlefield.Russian commentators expressed surprise over the appointment of an economist to oversee Russia's military. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Putin made the decision as Russia was once again approaching Soviet-era levels of military expenditure due to ""geopolitical circumstances.""""This is extremely important and it requires special attention,"" Peskov said.He added that Putin wanted his defense ministry to be under civilian leadership because of the need to modernize the military -- an implicit message that Shoigu was not up to the task. (Shoigu held a rank of general because of his previous role as emergencies minister.)""Today on the battlefield, the victor is the one who is more open to innovation, more open to the most rapid implementation,"" Peskov said. ""So it's natural that at the current stage the president decided that the defense ministry be headed by a civilian.""Still, despite his knowledge of economics, Belousov has relatively little executive experience. He served as the country's minister of economic development for a little over a year, from 2012-13.The change comes less than a week after Putin was inaugurated to his fifth term as Russia's president, a ritual that was widely expected to set the stage for a Cabinet shuffle of some kind. The entire Cabinet was dissolved as part of the government transition. Many but not all of his ministers were renominated to their posts.Shoigu was the longest-serving minister in the history of the independent Russian Federation and a fixture of Russian politics since the collapse of the Soviet Union.Originally from the Tuva Republic in southern Siberia, he developed a national profile as a man of action by serving as Russia's emergencies minister for more than two decades, from 1991 to 2012. He could regularly be found on television responding to the country's natural disasters, in contrast to other ministers portrayed as paper pushers.Shoigu's tenure as Russia's defense minister, beginning in 2012, was marked by Putin's military intervention in Ukraine in 2014 and in Syria in 2015. Then in 2022, Shoigu became a lightning rod for criticism as the Russian military faltered in the early months of the war.For months last year, Prigozhin railed against him in videos posted online, assailing him for incompetence in a fight for influence that ultimately ended with the mercenary leader trying to oust him in a failed uprising last summer. Prigozhin later died in a plane crash that U.S. officials believed was likely to have been a Kremlin-approved assassination.The leadership changes Sunday also may signal a change in stature for Patrushev, a hard-liner with a KGB background who has long been seen as a member of Putin's inner circle.It is unclear what new position he will be offered.With war costs rising, Putin's government has embarked on an effort to raise more revenue, including with a planned overhaul of the country's tax system.Nearly a third of the federal budget has been allocated to national defense this year, a huge increase from previous years. The intense government spending on the military has turbocharged the economy but raised the risk of overheating, as a crimped labor force drives up wages and inflation.One of Shoigu's top deputies, Timur Ivanov, was arrested by Russian authorities in April and accused of bribery. Ivanov had long been in charge of military construction projects.His arrest, the removal of Shoigu and the installation of a trusted technocrat to head the defense ministry may also be a signal that the Kremlin, after turning a blind eye to corruption that has blossomed alongside military spending, will now mount a campaign to rein in graft in the sector.""Belousov's first task will be fighting corruption,"" Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, wrote on the Telegram messaging app, referring to the newly appointed defense minister. For Belousov, he added, ""the post of defense minister during a hybrid war against the entire West is the most important challenge of his life.""","Sergei Shoigu will replace Nikolai Patrushev, a former KGB colleague of Putin. Andrei Belousov, an economist who had served as first deputy prime minister, was nominated to become the new defense chief.

This month, the Pentagon confirmed the inclusion of AeroVironment ’s Switchblade 600 drone as part of the first tranche of technologies under the Replicator project.Announced by Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks in August 2023, the initiative seeks to deploy thousands of unmanned aerial and surface vehicles within two years, a report in Asia Times said.The Switchblade 600 has demonstrated its effectiveness in Ukraine, targeting armored vehicles over distances exceeding 38 kilometers. Its success is pivotal as the Pentagon looks to quickly ramp up operational capabilities through leveraging commercial technology, supported by a significant budget allocation. This year alone, the initiative has secured about US$500 million, with a request for an equal amount for the next fiscal year.Beyond aerial drones, the initiative is expanding into maritime territories with the Production-Ready Inexpensive Maritime Expeditionary (PRIME) program. This effort aims to diversify the maritime drone vendor base and includes developing low-cost, highly autonomous unmanned boats capable of challenging tasks in strategic areas like the Taiwan Strait.Despite its ambitious scope, the Replicator program faces hurdles such as bureaucratic delays, cultural resistance within the military, and the rapid advancements of competing drone technologies by China.
