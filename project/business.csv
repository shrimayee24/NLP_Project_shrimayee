NEW DELHI: An undertrial's prolonged incarceration cannot be a ground to grant bail in terror cases, where the intent is to destabilise the country's unity, Delhi high court recently held.A bench of justices Navin Chawla and Shalinder Kaur made the observation while denying bail to separatist Nayeem Ahmad Khan in a terror funding case involving Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed.Khan, who had challenged a trial court order of Dec 2022 rejecting his bail plea, argued the trial was not likely to conclude in the near future, and he ought to be granted bail to balance the period of custody he had undergone with his fundamental right to liberty.Rejecting the contention, the bench said: ""While we are aware that the right of an undertrial to a speedy trial is of paramount consideration, in cases involving terrorist activities ,which have nationwide implications and where there is an intention to destabilise the unity of the Union of India and to disrupt its law and order, more so, to create terror in the minds of the public, which are also factors that weigh in, the long period of incarceration would not, in itself, be ground enough to enlarge an accused on bail.""Khan, a member of Hurriyat Conference and chairman of J&K National Front, was arrested on July 24, 2017, under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and is currently in judicial custody.","Delhi high court denied bail to separatist Nayeem Ahmad Khan in terror funding case involving Lashkar-e-Taiba and 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed that some men and their relatives may have been harassed by fake dowry harassment cases filed in misuse of Section 498A of IPC (equivalent Sec 85 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita) by women but said that cannot be a ground to alter the law protecting women from cruelty in matrimonial homes.""Just because of certain instances of misuse of Section 498A of IPC and Section 85 of BNS, can a sweeping statement be made that women are harassing their husbands and in-laws? Nothing can be further from truth. In a vast majority of cases, it is the women who face harassment at matrimonial homes. Hence, the law and the courts will deal with each case according to the facts therein,"" said a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh.Petitioner NGO 'Janshruti' said it was approaching SC for judicial intervention to address ""critical concerns surrounding matrimonial laws, particularly the misuse and application of provisions relating to maintenance, domestic violence and cruelty.""The NGO's counsel said SC must make Section 498A of IPC and Section 85 of BNS gender neutral to ensure protection of the victim of cruelty, be it women or men, in matrimonial homes and insertion of safeguards to prevent misuse of matrimonial laws, including mandatory preliminary investigation and mediation prior to arrest. Giving instances of extreme cruelty by husbands towards wives, Justice Kant-led bench said, ""The allegations that the provisions have been misused cannot be a ground for forming an opinion by the court while exercising writ jurisdiction.

"As US-China ties crash and burn, eyes turn towards India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-us-china-ties-crash-and-burn-eyes-turn-towards-india-tariff-trade-war/articleshow/120316772.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

US-China ties are headed for a devastating crash with attention in America now pivoting towards New Delhi to assess if India can -- or will -- step into the breach.More signs of the US-China flame-out emerged on Tuesday after Beijing directed its airlines to stop taking delivery of Boeing aircraft. China is Boeing's biggest customer with projections by the company of delivering nearly 9,000 planes to China — about 20% of the total — over the next two decades. By contrast, India is expected to order around 2400 Boeing aircraft till 2043.Also read: China plays rare earth card as US, India dig deep The Chinese directive also included halting orders of aircraft-related equipment and parts, indicating it is ready to suffer pain and disruption to crank up domestic aircraft manufacturing by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), which has been ramping up to take on Boeing and Airbus, the two global aircraft majors.Beijing's blow to Boeing in response to President Trump's tariff gambit came amid growing apprehension in the American commentariat that the MAGA supremo may have overplayed his hand in trying to paint China into a corner -- without rallying support from the rest of the world. There is dismay that on the contrary he has alienated almost the entire world, including European allies.A viral meme showing Trump saying ""I hold the cards"" and Xi responding with ""The cards are made in China"" provided an apt metaphor for the tariff fallout, with many experts saying although both countries will feel the pain from the spat that has inflamed the world, Beijing appears to have more leverage than the Trump White House anticipated, not to speak of greater resilience and endurance to ride out the punishment.US analysts are increasingly looking at India as a potential winner in the trade war expecting New Delhi to take advantage of the tariff differential. ""Is India ready to step in for China?"" the NYT asked in a front page story that said while Trump’s trade war with Beijing could be good for New Delhi, the country's dreams of becoming a new factory to the world is beset with familiar problems -- lack of skilled workers, supply chain issues, infrastructure shortcomings and red tape.But MAGA hardliners, despite being mocked for expecting low-end, assembly-line manufacturing to return to the US, bristle at the idea of depending on India for items like pharmaceuticals after extricating itself from China's dominance. The argument has caused the US President to go back and forth on taxing pharma imports, first holding back on tariffs and later indicating he will review it.In fact, the MAGA Supremo's back-and-forth on the tariff issue on some sectors, including automobiles in the latest instances, has led to allegations of crony capitalism and insider trading as the United States appears to be in far greater turmoil than China and rest of the world after igniting a global trade conflagration.A defensive President Trump pushed back on Monday, asserting that he does not change his mind but he is a ""very flexible person."" Following signs that he's carve out another tariff exception to help the US auto sector, the country's $ 42 billion toy industry, which is heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing and supplies, is also clamoring for a break arguing that toys are critical for child development.Many liberal pundits are now surmising that instead of running rings around China as the White House mandarins are suggesting the US President is doing, it is Trump who is running around in circles. Amid growing concerns about the Chinese President Xi's high-profile visits to Vietnam and Malaysia, US experts are wondering if Trump has unwittingly ceded global primacy to Beijing.""What if you get into a trade war with China and you lose? What if, after infuriating the rest of the world, putting tariffs on them, too, you make China look stronger, more reliable, more farsighted, more strategic in the eyes of all these other countries that are now looking for an exit from the unreliable consequences of US hegemony?"" the liberal podcaster Ezra Klein asked amid growing self-doubt across US business circles.But Trump made light of the Chinese leader's purported inroads in East Asia, saying he does not ""blame"" China or Vietnam for engaging while seeming to hold out an olive branch to Xi. ""I like him. He likes me. I mean, you know, who knows?” Trump said as Chinese interlocutors continued to taunt the US with a flood of memes, cartoons, and videos. One meme showed Xi holding a pair of aces and Trump holding a two and a seven, about the weakest hand in cards.The distrust engendered by Trump's trade, tariff assault, and geo-political assault on the world, including on allies, is so great that the European Commission is reported to have issued burner phones and basic laptops to some US-bound staff to avoid the risk of espionage in Washington, where they are headed to for the World Bank/IMF meetings, according to the Financial Times. The caution is traditionally reserved for trips to China.","US-China ties are headed for a devastating crash with attention in America now pivoting towards New Delhi to assess if India can -- or will -- step into the breach.

Poll Do you agree with the decision to reduce the stipend for beneficiaries of the Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana? No, it negatively impacts the beneficiaries. Yes, it's necessary to ensure eligibility.

MUMBAI: The state govt has reduced the stipend of eight lakh beneficiaries of its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana because they were also receiving benefits under another govt scheme, the Namo Shetkari Mahasanman Nidhi (NSMN).The eight lakh women will receive a payout of Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,500 per month because they already receive Rs 1,000 under Namo Shetkari programme. The Ladki Bahin scheme stipulates that its beneficiaries can avail of other govt schemes only if the benefit is capped at Rs 1,500 per month.This is part of state's move to scrutinise beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahin scheme and to restrict the stipend only to those who fit the eligibility criteria.In Oct, state had around 2.63 crore applicants for the scheme. The scrutiny process reduced that figure by 11 lakh to 2.52 crore beneficiaries by Feb. The final stipend went to 2.46 lakh in Feb & March.""There has been an ongoing scrutiny. First to scan the applications that were sent by the districts to the state headquarters. And then to re-scrutinise the eligible cases,"" an official said.CM Devendra Fadnavis earlier said he expects the number of beneficiaries to reduce by 10-15 lakh after the scrutiny process. ""We're not changing criteria or funding, just ensuring only eligible ones get the stipend,"" he said.The state govt is scrutinising Ladki Bahin beneficiaries on the basis of five key criteria. The beneficiaries have to be within the age limit of 18-65 years, and they must be domiciled in the state. Their family income limit has to be within Rs 2.5 lakh per year. Those with a four-wheel vehicle and a member of the family in a govt job are excluded from the scheme. Those who receive benefits from other govt schemes can do so as long as the combined benefit is within Rs 1,500 per month.The state is under pressure to control its purse strings while keeping its key programmes going. The state's debt projection is 9.3 lakh crore for 2025-26. The outlay for the Ladki Bahin scheme was reduced from 46,000 crore to 36,000 crore in the 2025-26 budget.","The eight lakh women will receive a payout of Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,500 per month.

I do not have any fear, as I have nothing to hide.""""We told the ED we were organising our documents, I am always ready to be here. I hope there's a conclusion today. There is nothing in the case...

It is also crucial for the replenishing of reservoirs critical for drinking water, apart from power generation across the country.However, normal cumulative rainfall does not guarantee uniform temporal and spatial distribution of rain across the country, with climate change further increasing the variability of the rain-bearing system.Climate scientists say the number of rainy days is declining while heavy rain events (more rain over a short period) are increasing, leading to frequent droughts and floods.Monsoon in India usually arrives over the southern tip of Kerala around June 1 and retreats in mid-September.The India Meteorological Department defines average or normal rainfall as ranging between 96% and 104% of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches) for the four-month season.","IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra also ruled out the possibility of El Nino conditions during the entire season.

In violence-ravaged Murshidabad, the spirit of celebration was replaced Tuesday by the silence of a broken community.Nemai Ghosh, a resident of Aurangabad in Suti, opened his outlet Janapriya Sweets but had few customers. Shards of glass and remnants of a damaged shutter littered the storefront.On Poila Baisakh, the store usually has a queue of customers waiting to buy rosogollas and shingaras (Bengali version of samosa).""We had received bulk orders and I was worried whether I could deliver on time. My workers arrived last night and we opened the store, but sales were nothing compared to what we get on this day. My only satisfaction is reopening my business after four days,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: ""Now, there's another order by another judge"" was how Supreme Court reacted while expressing its disappointment over the casual remarks made by judges of Allahabad high court in recent months.The court was referring to remarks made by a judge who, while granting bail to an accused, said the woman herself had invited trouble and was responsible for the alleged rape committed against her.The apex court has been expressing concern over the loose remarks and observations made by judges and taken suo motu cognisance in two cases. A bench of Justices B R Gavai and A G Masih was hearing suo motu a case which was initiated after the Allahabad HC had passed a controversial order that acts of grabbing a child victim's breasts, breaking the string of her pyjama and attempting to drag her beneath a culvert do not constitute the offence of rape or attempt to rape.Though the bench deferred the hearing, it, however, noted the latest controversial remarks made by an HC judge earlier this month. Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh, while granting bail to an accused in a rape case, seemed to blame the complainant for agreeing to go to the accused's house after getting drunk. ""One has to be careful when saying such things, especially from this side,"" the SC bench said.S olicitor General Tushar Mehta also shared the same concern and said such remarks (controversial remarks made by an HC judge earlier this month) send a very wrong signal about the judiciary. He said a judge must realise how his remarks would be perceived by a common person. “Justice should not only be done but also seen to be done,” Mehta said.In another case, SC had last year in Dec taken note of a speech by Allahabad HC judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav, in which he had reportedly said the country would function as per the wishes of the bahusankhyak (majority) while using a derogatory term for Muslims and saying that they were harmful for the nation. Amid protests that his remarks were unconstitutional and were aimed against the minority community, the apex court had sought a report from HC.","Supreme Court expresses disappointment over casual remarks made by judges of Allahabad high court in recent months.

The court asked the bank how it planned to return the valuables to the complainant.A BOB employee approached court seeking to quash the FIR. Although not named in the complaint, he was employed at the branch at the relevant time. His counsel said the locker was opened after multiple notices and reminders went unanswered, and that an inventory of the valuables was prepared and the contents sealed at the head office.However, Kumar, the coholder of the locker, said they never received any such communication from the bank. “When I asked bank officials to show me the notice and letter, they said the documents and register have also been misplaced,” he told TOI. He said the jewellery included 21 ornaments “of high sentimental value”, some dating back to 1875.“The locker contained heirlooms like Ramnavami ornaments, gold buttons and a gold seal, passed down through generations,” he said.

ED questions Vadra in Haryana land deal case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-questions-vadra-in-haryana-land-deal-case/articleshow/120324411.cms,"Robert Vadra (PTI photo)

GURGAON: Enforcement Directorate (ED) Tuesday interrogated Robert Vadra , the businessman-husband of Congress general secretary and LS MP Priyanka Gandhi at its headquarters for six hours in connection with a controversial land deal his company Skylight Hospitality had made in 2008 for Rs 7.5 crore.Vadra, who had missed his first summons on April 8, walked into ED office at 11am and was quizzed over two sessions with a lunch break on his association with the land deal which gave him a handsome return of Rs 50 crore in a matter of a few months. His questioning will continue on Wednesday.This is a new case being investigated against Vadra with two other money laundering probes still in progress related to other land deals in Haryana and Rajasthan. In the present case, Vadra's firm, Skylight Hospitality, bought 3.5 acre in Shikohpur ( Haryana) for Rs 7.5 crore in 2008 from Onkareshwar Properties. The then Congress govt in state under the then CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda granted commercial licences for 2.7 acre shortly afterwards. Four months later, the land was sold to DLF for almost eight times the rate - Rs 58 crore - generating a profit of over Rs 50 crore. Vadra slammed ED's move as an 'attempt to thwart his entry into politics and stop him from raising people's issues'.Action against Vadra came soon after ED issued notices to take possession of over Rs 750 crore worth of land and buildings of Young Indian-controlled Associated Journals Ltd in the National Herald money laundering case. This was followed by the agency filing a chargesheet in the National Herald case where it has made seven individuals and entities as accused, including ex-Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. The court has fixed April 25 as the date of next hearing in order to take cognisance of the chargesheet.On his way to ED office, Vadra said action against him was ""politically motivated"". ""I am not going to be intimidated by this. They can ask me as many questions. I will answer them all. I have nothing to hide,"" he said, adding, ""Whenever I try to raise people's voice or talk of entering politics, this govt uses these agencies to suppress me. I have appeared over 20 times before, submitted 23,000 documents, and sat for 15-hour sessions. Yet, they keep demanding more.""Vadra's land deal in Shikohpur gained national attention in 2012 when IAS officer Ashok Khemka, then director of land registration in Haryana, cancelled the land mutation, citing procedural irregularities. The state transferred Khemka within hours, raising eyebrows. But before relinquishing charge, Khemka submitted a report, setting aside the mutation and questioning the authority of the official who had sanctioned it. In 2013, a three-member IAS panel formed by the then Hooda govt gave a clean chit to both Vadra and DLF.Subsequent BJP govt, which assumed office in 2014, formed Justice Dhingra Commission, which submitted a confidential report. Hooda moved HC against formation of the commission in 2016. Two years later, Haryana police filed an FIR against Vadra, Hooda, DLF & Onkareshwar Properties, charging them with cheating, criminal conspiracy & forgery.

MUMBAI: Several Muslim pilgrims and community leaders have sought PM Narendra Modi's intervention after the minority affairs ministry confirmed that 42,000 applicants won't be able to perform Haj in June this year.On Tuesday, the ministry informed on X that 1,22,518 pilgrims will travel to Saudi Arabia through Haj Committee of India. Earlier, Haj slots for 52,000 pilgrims who had booked through private tour operators (PTOs), officially called combined Haj group operators (CHGOs), were cancelled after Saudi govt shut its Haj portal - Nusuk. Saudi Arabia, following the ministry's intervention, has reopened the portal to allow only 10,000 of the 52,000 pilgrims.Congress MLA Amin Patel said several pilgrims have approached him with a request to do something about the cancellation. ""I spoke to many tour operators who said they had booked pilgrims three months ago and now they are helpless,"" he added.""I've appealed to PM Modi and others to speak to the highest authorities in Saudi as 42,000 is a huge number. If they are allowed to go for Haj in 2026, there will be a huge backlog,"" Patel added.The ministry of minority affairs has blamed PTOs for the situation, citing the alleged delay in uploading necessary documents and making payments on the Nusuk portal. However, one of the CHGOs said the delay was caused because IBAN (International Bank Account Number) linked to Nusuk portal was inactive. ""Since direct payment to Nusuk wallet was not happening, we were directed to pay through Haj Committee, which would send the money to the Consul General of India in Jeddah and they would send that money to the CHGOs' wallets,"" the operator explained.","Minority affairs ministry Tuesday said 1,22,518 will travel to Saudi for Haj this year.

On April 10, he received a call from a neighbour informing him that the lock to the house had been broken. When he reached the property, he found the cash missing and immediately reported the theft to police.Sarwar had mentioned to police that his daughter had visited the house that day, and he recalled her behaving strangely - speaking in hushed tones over the phone. That raised red flags.Investigators subsequently questioned the daughter and her husband, Azeem, a local gym trainer. Within hours, both confessed to the crime. According to police, the couple were in financial distress. On the day of the theft, Azeem entered the house in the afternoon, removed the cash, and left unnoticed, while his wife stayed on a call with him.The stolen money was distributed across locations. Azeem hid Rs 48 lakh at his residence, Rs 1 lakh at his health supplement shop, and handed Rs 10 lakh to his brother, Waseem. He also purchased jewellery with a portion of the stolen funds. The police later arrested all three - Sarwar's daughter, Azeem, and Waseem - and recovered about Rs 60 lakh in cash, the jewellery, and the car used in the operation.The case was registered under BNS sections 305-A (theft) and 331-3 (housebreaking with intent to commit an offence).

CHENNAI: Amid his govt's confrontation with the Centre, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Tuesday announced in the assembly the constitution of a high-level committee led by retired Supreme Court judge Justice Kurian Joseph to address concerns over states' autonomy and federalism .The panel is tasked with recommending measures to protect constitutionally guaranteed rights of states and propose improvements in relationship between Centre and state govts. An interim report is expected by Jan next year and a full report in two years.BJP and AIADMK opposed CM's move by walking out of the assembly while DMK's allies supported Stalin. BJP state president Nainar Nagenthran expressed concern about the demand for ""total autonomy"", questioning its fairness and appropriateness.""I place it on record with pain,"" Stalin said, expressing concern about ""the erosion of states' rights and the need to fight for fundamental rights of the people"". Later, he said on X, ""A strong Union is not built by weakening states. It is built by empowering them. And once again, Tamil Nadu rises to lead this call."" He added that Union govt's steady encroachment into ""rightful domains"" of states has disrupted the constitutional balance.The committee includes former vice-chancellor of Indian Maritime University Ashok Vardhan Shetty and former vice-chairman of Tamil Nadu state planning commission M Naganathan.The committee will recommend measures to restore subjects that were moved from state to concurrent list; address ""challenges faced by states in providing good governance""; ensure states have maximum autonomy in administration, assemblies, and judicial courts, without compromising the country's unity and integrity; and consider recommendations of Rajamannar panel constituted in 1969 by former CM and Stalin's father, late M Karunanidhi.The Rajamannar committee's recommendations on the Centre-state ties were accepted by TN assembly on April 16, 1974. Subsequently, the Centre established the Sarkaria commission in 1983 and Justice Poonchi committee in 2004.Stalin expressed dismay that previous reports have not led to change. ""Union govt is rapidly moving important powers in the state list such as health, law and finance to the concurrent list,"" he said, arguing that education should be reverted to the state list.Expressing disappointment over AIADMK's walk-out ahead of his announcement, Stalin said former chief ministers M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa aligned with DMK in realising the demands of the people, regardless of differences of opinion.",Stalin announces constitution of high-level committee to address concerns over states' autonomy and federalism.

Are Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce hiding something? Inside their mysterious break from the spotlight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/are-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-hiding-something-inside-their-mysterious-break-from-the-spotlight/articleshow/120313452.cms,"Image via GC

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's schedules aligned after a whirlwind year of success

A sweet escape from the spotlight—just long enough to breathe

Life in the public eye is nothing new for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce . With their global fame, packed schedules, and demanding careers, moments of peace are few and far between. But now, for the first time in a long while, the power couple has finally found a pocket of time to slow down, stay grounded, and simply enjoy being together.Following an intense NFL season that saw Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs push through yet another championship run, and Taylor Swift wrapping her record-shattering Eras Tour after 149 sold-out shows across five continents, both stars have pressed pause—at least temporarily. For once, their demanding calendars are in sync, allowing them to enjoy rare downtime as a couple.According to Page Six, this unexpected break has given them the chance to travel, explore, and reconnect away from flashing cameras and screaming fans. Whether abroad or stateside, the two have made headlines for their casual date nights and cozy getaways.While the public only gets glimpses of their life together, insiders say it's the quiet, domestic moments that matter most to the couple. “Other than that, however, most of Kelce and Swift's time together is spent at home just relaxing,” one source shared. “They cuddle on the couch and watch movies, play board games, spend time with family, cook dinner together and just hang out.”It’s a lifestyle that feels miles away from the stadiums, concert arenas, and red carpets they’re used to. But it’s not without a touch of sadness.“This is such a nice escape for them to finally be able to stay out of the limelight for a bit before they eventually have to get out in the public eye again due to their careers,” the insider added.Kelce will soon rejoin the Chiefs for training, while Swift is expected to dive back into the studio—or potentially hit the road again—when the time comes. The couple is fully aware their peaceful chapter won’t last forever.“This time away from the spotlight has been so refreshing for Taylor and Travis,” the insider shared. “They really cherish this time while they can because they know it can’t last forever.” Until then, the duo continues to make the most of every quiet moment, embracing the calm before their next big moves.Also Read: “Nonsense”: Travis Kelce shuts down breakup and false community service rumors in latest podcast appearance","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's schedules aligned after a whirlwind year of success.

Bill Belichick’s power play with 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson raises eyebrows over her growing football influence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/bill-belichicks-power-play-with-24-year-old-girlfriend-jordon-hudson-raises-eyebrows-over-her-growing-football-influence/articleshow/120326869.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

How much influence does Jordon Hudson have on Bill Belichick’s future?



As Bill Belichick starts his collegiate chapter at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , his transition has sparked considerable attention—not just for his legendary resume, but for the growing presence of his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson , in his professional sphere. From sideline appearances to being copied in administrative emails, Hudson’s involvement has ignited a flurry of questions about her role in shaping Belichick’s new tenure.At 72, Bill Belichick accepted a five-year, $10 million-per-season deal in December to coach the Tar Heels. While fans celebrated the historic hire, viral videos—like the TikTok clip showing Jordon Hudson strolling the sidelines during spring practice—have pushed public curiosity into overdrive. Viewed over 400,000 times, the clip has many questioning, not just her presence, but her influence within Belichick’s evolving operations at UNC.This intrigue deepened after it was revealed that Belichick had requested Hudson be CC'd on communications related to his coaching activities. “Robbi, Thank you for the e-mail. I am including Jordon on this email so she can also keep up with our postings. Can you include her on anything you send to me? Thank you. BB,” he wrote to Robbi Pickeral Evans, the Senior Associate Athletic Director at UNC. The move was interpreted by some as signaling a larger advisory role for Hudson—one extending far beyond personal companionship.Documents obtained by The Athletic via an open records request show a deeper connection between Hudson and Belichick’s strategic decisions. Despite having no formal employment agreement with the university, Hudson’s input was sought—or at least acknowledged—on matters ranging from media strategy to staff announcements. Most notably, she advised UNC on how to present the hiring of Stephen Belichick, urging them to highlight his qualifications independently of his father's legacy. “Though Steve Belichick is in fact Bill’s son, he should be depicted and represented as his own established, credible entity… Steve was fortunate to have learned defensive football strategy from the ‘greatest defensive mind’ of all-time,” she wrote.Beyond emails, Hudson appears to be integrated into Belichick’s broader branding efforts. Her email signature identifies her as the Chief Operating Officer of “Belichick Productions,” a company without publicly available records. She also manages TCE Rights Management, which has filed for 14 trademarks, including “Chapel Bill” and “The Belichick Way.” These trademarks suggest an intent to shape Belichick's identity in the college football space as more than just a coach—perhaps a brand unto himself.Hudson’s involvement also extends into public image management. She questioned whether UNC was monitoring social media for negative commentary about Belichick. “Is there anyone monitoring the UNC Football page for slanderous commentary and subsequently deleting it / blocking users that are harassing BB in the comments?” she asked. The next day, Belichick expressed dismay: “I cannot believe that UNC would support my being called a ‘predator.’” Though the university found no such reference, they assured both parties that inappropriate comments would be addressed.What remains clear is that Jordon Hudson’s role, though unofficial, is increasingly influential in shaping Bill Belichick’s narrative off the field. As North Carolina looks to turn a new page with one of the most successful NFL minds at the helm, eyes will remain not only on Belichick’s playbook—but also on the woman who might just be helping to write it.Also Read: Why is Josh Allen's fiance Hailee Steinfeld missing from the Avengers: Doomsday cast reveal?

The firm alerted his wife, but it was too late. The investigation continues to determine the exact cause of death.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS

Akshat Shah, a 30-year-old software engineer from Bengaluru, fell to his death from the fourth floor of a hotel building in the Vesu area of Gujarat, prompting an investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death.

Police discovered a suicide note left by Akshat Shah that does not assign blame or provide a clear reason for his actions, alongside multiple knife wounds on his body.

CCTV footage revealed that Akshat Shah purchased a knife shortly before his death, and he sent an email to his employer informing them of his location and including his wife's contact information.

SURAT: Akshat Shah , 30, fell to his death from the fourth floor of a hotel building in the Vesu area of the city in Gujarat and died on the spot, police said. Shah was a software engineer with a Bengaluru-based IT firm and earned Rs 50 lakh a year.His wife is a dentist with a successful practice. Police are investigating the death to determine if it is a murder or suicide.Vijaysinh Gurjar, DCP (Zone 4), told TOI: ""The victim lived at Veerbhadra Heights in Magdalla. He was employed at an IT firm in the work-from-home mode. We found a suicide note that does not blame anyone and does not cite any reason. As we found multiple wounds from a knife on his body, we are investigating whether this is a suicide or murder.""""On the face of it, it appears to be a suicide, as we have CCTV footage of him buying a knife from a shop. He also made an online payment. He entered Elegant Hotel at about 1pm and fell to the ground at about 5pm, from the window of his hotel room. He likely slashed himself with the knife multiple times in the bathroom before he fell, as it was filled with blood,"" Gurjar said.It is likely Shah planned this course of action, as he sent an email to his firm before taking the extreme step. He wrote his wife's name and mobile number in the email and requested the firm to inform her that he was at the Vesu hotel.The firm promptly sent a screenshot of the email to his wife but, by the time she called up the hotel, he had already jumped, police said.","Akshat Shah, a 30-year-old software engineer from Bengaluru, fell to his death from the fourth floor of a hotel building in the Vesu area of Gujarat.

Tamil Nadu vs governor: 'SC verdict may create imbalance in federal structure',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-vs-governor-sc-verdict-may-create-imbalance-in-federal-structure/articleshow/120317257.cms,"Different-engine government vs double-engine government



A two-way battle?



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court 's recent decision to clear 10 bills passed by Tamil Nadu assembly without the assent of state governor RN Ravi and the top court's move to fix timelines for all governors and President to act on bills passed by the states has been hailed as ""historic"" and ""a victory for federalism"" by several opposition parties amid reports that the Centre may file a review petition against the verdict.The SC bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, without mincing words, said ""where the governor reserves a bill for the consideration of the President and the President in turn withholds assent thereto then, it shall be open to the state government to assail such an action before this court"".Observing that a governor is required to abide by the aid and advice tendered by the council of ministers, the top court said it is not open for a governor to reserve a bill for the consideration of the President once it is presented to him in the second round, after having been returned to the House previously.Further, what makes the verdict more significant is the court’s invocation of its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution. This provision allows the Supreme Court to deliver ""complete justice"" in cases where no direct legal remedy may exist. And in this case, justice came in the form of a stern reminder: governors are not above the Constitution, and their role is not to act as gatekeepers for political interests.The apex court also provided a resort to the state government and said that if a governor reserves a bill for the President’s consideration and the President subsequently withholds assent, the state government has the right to challenge that decision before the Supreme Court.While the verdict has been welcomed by chief ministers of non-BJP ruled states, senior SC advocate Vivek Narayan Sharma argues that it might create ""an imbalance in the federal structure if not tempered with constitutional discipline.""Speaking to TOI, he said, ""The political turf war between states and governors, especially in opposition ruled territories, will persist. What has changed is the axis of power: the upper hand now tilts towards the States. While this strengthens state legislative autonomy, it may also create an imbalance in the federal structure if not tempered with constitutional discipline,"" when asked if the verdict would affect future tussles between governors and chief ministers of non-BJP ruled states.The SC judgment comes as the Centre and several state governments, especially the ones not rightly aligned, have engaged in a power tussle over getting the bills cleared.The opposition has accused the BJP-led central government of using governors in non-BJP ruled states as a weapon to create friction with the governments - be it in Kerala, West Bengal, Karnataka, Punjab or Tamil Nadu by delaying the passage of bills. Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin had remarked that the Centre was running a ""parallel government"" through governors adding that it was not ""just against federal principles but also against the Indian Constitution. India is now witnessing cheap politics by governors, who are unfit to hold such high posts.""Last year, the top court had taken note of West Bengal and Kerala governments, both embroiled in prolonged standoffs with their respective governors over delayed assent to bills.Kerala, led by the CPM’s Left Democratic Front, approached the court in March, arguing that its governor had wrongly referred seven bills—unrelated to Centre-state matters—to the President, leaving them pending for up to two years. The state claimed this move undermined the legislature’s authority.Similarly, West Bengal, governed by the Trinamool Congress, alleged that its governor withheld assent on eight bills and hurriedly referred some to the President once the court hearing loomed.In Punjab’s case, the SC had strongly cautioned then-governor Banwarilal Purohit, warning, “you are playing with fire.” The court voiced serious concern over the legislative deadlock in the state and took a tough stance on the governor’s failure to grant assent to bills passed by the state assembly.And while the opposition ruled states are celebrating this verdict, there are instances when they have also opposed implementing Central legislations. Recently, Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin denied to implement centrally-approved Waqf Act , Kerala government opposed the Citizenship Amendment Act, and Punjab government passed resolution against the now-repealed farm laws. Clearly, it is a tug of war, with both the Centre and the State calling their shots wherever they can. However, the Centre, with governors under their control, perhaps has more weapons in its armor.Also, the state governments don't have the privilege to sit over bills as the governors do. Hence, the SC noted in the recent verdict that the governor must be the ""harbinger of consensus and resolution, lubricating the functioning of the State machinery by his sagacity, wisdom and not run it into a standstill. He must be the catalyst and not an inhibitor. All his actions must be impelled keeping in mind the dignity of the high constitutional office that he occupies"".The verdict under question, however, ""shifts the constitutional balance in favour of the states,"" Sharma said.""This judgment undoubtedly shifts the constitutional balance in favour of the States. It diminishes the discretionary space traditionally accorded to governors—even in cases where the Constitution explicitly provides for it. While sometimes states may be right, and at other times the governor may be, ""rightness"" must always be judged through the lens of the Constitution—not individual ideologies or political agendas,"" he said when asked if the verdict would impact future tussles between the Centre and the states.However, Parliament has the power to pass legislations to overturn SC judgements. Talking about such a possibility, Sharma said, ""There is strong likelihood that the judgment would be reconsidered by a constitution bench of the Supreme Court and the directions and mandate of this judgment would be stayed till the decision by a larger bench. However, if for any reason, the above doesn’t happen, then the government should consider to amend the law to remove anomalies this judgment would bring in the executive and parliament domain.""","Supreme Court's recent decision to clear 10 bills passed by Tamil Nadu assembly without the assent of state governor RN Ravi has been hailed as ""historic"" and ""a victory for federalism"" The top court said it is not open for a governor to reserve a bill for the consideration of the President once it is presented to him in the second round.

Kiss and Hug: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos open the Rocket's door

Excitement, song and more from inside the Blue Origin Space flight

Blue Origin announcement by Lauren Sánchez

Pop icon Katy Perry and Lauren Sánchez, fiancée of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , soared to the edge of space Monday morning (April15) aboard Blue Origin ’s New Shepard rocket, marking the first all-female spaceflight in over six decades. Liftoff occurred at 9:31 a.m. ET from Blue Origin’s launch site in West Texas. The suborbital flight lasted approximately 11 minutes, delivering a brief but weightless experience for the six women aboard. Rounding out the historic crew were CBS broadcaster Gayle King, producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA engineer Aisha Bowe , and scientist-activist Amanda Nguyen.The company has previously flown several celebrity passengers, including Bezos himself in 2021, actor William Shatner, and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan. Monday’s flight, however, stood apart — not just for its famous passengers, but for the milestone it represented in space travel history. Blue Origin’s 11th crewed mission comes as the company eyes bigger ambitions. In January, it successfully launched its heavy-lift New Glenn rocket to orbit. Soon after, the company laid off around 10% of its workforce. CEO Dave Limp later said the company remains focused on future goals, including a planned moon landing with an uncrewed vehicle in 2025 and increased frequency for both New Shepard and New Glenn launches.According to a report in Bloomberg, after experiencing roughly four minutes of weightlessness, the capsule returned to Earth under parachutes, landing safely in the desert. Jeff Bezos was on hand to open the capsule’s hatch, where he embraced Sánchez. Perry followed, dropping to her knees and kissing the Earth.“I feel super connected to love,” Perry reportedly said after the flight, clutching a daisy she had taken into space. “It is the highest high, it is surrender to the unknown.” When asked how the trip compared to other highlights of her career, she replied, “This experience is second to being a mom.”During the flight, excitement echoed through the capsule. “You guys, look at the moon! Oh my god!” one crew member exclaimed, while Perry broke into a rendition of “What a Wonderful World.” According to King, the moment was filled with awe and emotion as they gazed at Earth from above.Sánchez first revealed her spaceflight ambitions during a 2023 interview with Vogue, emphasizing the significance of assembling an all-female crew. “These women are paving the way,” she said at the time.The launch drew a high-profile crowd. Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian watched from the viewing area and praised the mission as “inspirational.” Oprah Winfrey, a close friend of King, was also present. “None of us will ever forget this day,” she remarked.","Katy Perry and Lauren Sánchez, fiancée of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, soared to the edge of space Monday morning (April15) aboard Blue Origin ’s New Shepard rocket.

"Intel sells majority stake in Altera for $4.46 billion, what makes the deal that Intel paid double for in 2025 important",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-sells-majority-stake-in-altera-for-4-46-billion/articleshow/120300236.cms,"Poll Do you believe Intel's sale of Altera is a strategic move for its future? No, it's a sign of weakness. Yes, it will help them refocus.

Intel has agreed to sell a 51% stake in its Altera programmable chip business to private equity firm Silver Lake for $4.46 billion, marking the first significant move by new CEO Lip-Bu Tan to revitalize the struggling chipmaker.The deal, announced Monday, values Altera at $8.75 billion—nearly half the $17 billion Intel paid when acquiring the company in 2015. Despite the significant write-down, the transaction provides Intel with crucial cash as it works to strengthen its financial position following costly manufacturing investments made under former CEO Pat Gelsinger.Asset divestiture forms a central component of Tan's strategy to streamline Intel's operations after years of unsuccessful diversification attempts beyond its core PC and server chip business. These missteps have left Intel struggling to compete in the AI market dominated by Nvidia, while simultaneously facing increased pressure from AMD in its traditional central processor stronghold.""Today's announcement reflects our commitment to sharpening our focus, lowering our expense structure and strengthening our balance sheet,"" said Tan, who replaced Gelsinger in December following his ouster.The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025, after which Intel will deconsolidate Altera's financial results.

Apple again surpasses Microsoft as most valuable company

US President Donald Trump has asserted his direct involvement in securing a relief for Apple as the tech giant’s stock experienced a surge of over 2%, propelling its market capitalisation back above the $3 trillion mark. The iPhone maker experienced this surge after the Trump administration announced temporary tariff exemptions on phones, computers and chips.“I speak to Tim Cook. I helped Tim Cook , recently, and that whole business,” Trump said on Monday (April 14) in a briefing with reporters in the Oval Office, referring to Apple’s CEO.“I don’t want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we’re going to get to the position of greatness for our country,” he added.Trump's comment underscored his administration’s decision to exempt phones, computers and chips (semiconductors) from newly-imposed tariffs, a move crucial for Apple, which manufactures the majority of its iPhones, iPads and MacBooks in China, India and other Asian countries. The President has urged Apple to shift its production locally.However, administration officials have cautioned that these exemptions are temporary, leaving Apple's future tariff burden uncertain.As per CNBC, analysts at Morgan Stanley indicated that the latest developments have reduced Apple's “annualised tariff cost burden” from $44 billion to $7 billion.Nevertheless, Apple has reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded US company, surpassing Microsoft. This followed a dip below the $3 trillion threshold on April 4, triggered by Trump's announcement of “reciprocal tariffs” that would significantly impact China and other manufacturing hubs.Reports said that Apple transported over 1.5 million iPhones aboard six cargo planes from India to minimise the impact of tariffs. Projections indicated that the iPhones that cost $1,599 (top-end iPhone 16 Pro Max in the US) could have surged to $2,300 under the high tariff rate that had been in effect, if Apple imported the phones from China.","Apple's stock experienced a surge of over 2%, propelling its market capitalisation back above the $3 trillion mark.

'Buy European' push

Different values

BRUSSELS: With President Donald Trump more unpredictable than ever and transatlantic ties reaching new lows, calls are growing louder for Europe to declare independence from US tech.From Microsoft to Meta, Apple to Uber, cloud computing to AI, much of the day-to-day technology used by Europeans is American.The risks that brings were hotly debated before Trump returned to power, but now Europe is getting serious -- pushing to favour European firms in public contracts and backing European versions of well-known US services.As Europe faces Trump's tariffs, and threatens to tax US tech unless the two sides clinch a deal averting all-out trade war, there is a growing sense of urgency.Tech sovereignty has been front and centre for weeks: the European Union unveiled its strategy to compete in the global artificial intelligence race and is talking about its own payment system to rival Mastercard.""We have to build up our own capacities when it comes to technologies,"" EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen has said, identifying three critical sectors: AI, quantum and semiconductors.A key concern is that if ties worsen, Washington could potentially weaponise US digital dominance against Europe -- with Trump's administration already taking aim at the bloc's tech rules.That is giving fresh impetus to demands by industry, experts and EU lawmakers for Europe to bolster its infrastructure and cut reliance on a small group of US firms.""Relying exclusively on non-European technologies exposes us to strategic and economic risks,"" said EU lawmaker Stephanie Yon-Courtin, who focuses on digital issues, pointing to US limits on semiconductor exports as one example.The data paints a stark picture.Around two-thirds of Europe's cloud market is in the hands of US titans: Amazon, Microsoft and Google, while European cloud providers make up only two percent.Twenty-three percent of the bloc's total high-tech imports in 2023 came from the United States, second only to China -- in everything from aerospace and pharmaceutical tech to smartphones and chips.Although the idea of a European social media platform to rival Facebook or X is given short shrift, officials believe that in the crucial AI field, the race is far from over.To boost European AI firms, the EU has called for a ""European preference for critical sectors and technologies"" in public procurement.""Incentives to buy European are important,"" Benjamin Revcolevschi, chief executive of French cloud provider OVHcloud, told AFP, welcoming the broader made-in-Europe push.Alison James, European government relations lead at electronics industry association IPC, summed it up: ""We need to have what we need for our key industries and our critical industries to be able to make our stuff.""There are calls for greater independence from US financial technology as well, with European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde advocating a ""European offer"" to rival American (Mastercard, Visa and Paypal) and Chinese payment systems (Alipay).Heeding the call, EU capitals have discussed creating a ""truly European payment system "".Industry insiders are also aware building tech sovereignty requires massive investment, at a moment when the EU is pouring money into defence.In an initiative called EuroStack, digital policy experts said creating a European tech ecosystem with layers including AI would cost 300 billion euros ($340 billion) by 2035.US trade group Chamber of Progress puts it much higher, at over five trillion euros.US Vice President JD Vance has taken aim at tech regulation in denouncing Europe's social and economic model -- accusing it of stifling innovation and unfairly hampering US firms, many of whom have aligned with Trump's administration.But for many, the bloc's values-based rules are another reason to fight for tech independence.After repeated abuses by US Big Tech, the EU created major laws regulating the online world including the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA).Much to the chagrin of US digital giants, the EU in 2018 introduced strict rules to protect European users' data, and last year ushered in the world's broadest safeguards on AI.In practice, supporters say the DMA encourages users to discover European platforms -- for instance giving users a choice of browser, rather than the default from Apple or Google.Bruce Lawson of Norwegian web browser Vivaldi said there was ""a significant and gratifying increase in downloads in Europe"", thanks in large part to the DMA.Lawson insists it's not about being anti-American.""It's about weaning ourselves off the dependency on infrastructure that have very different values about data protection,"" Lawson said.Pointing at rules in Europe that ""don't necessarily exist in the United States"", he said users simply ""prefer to have their data processed by a European company"".","'Buy European' push pushes to favour European firms in public contracts and backing European versions of well-known US services.

'Bribes for influence '

LIMA, PERU: A Peruvian court on Tuesday sentenced ex-president Ollanta Humala and his wife to 15 years in prison for graft linked to a globe-spanning corruption scandal involving Brazilian construction group Odebrecht paying bribes to politicians.The court found the 62-year-old and his wife Nadine Heredia guilty of money laundering for receiving illegal contributions from Odebrecht and the Venezuelan government in two presidential campaigns. Humala was taken into custody in the courtroom right after the verdict was read out and later jailed at a police base. His lawyers said they will file an appeal against his conviction.Judge Nayko Coronado also ordered the arrest of Heredia, who did not attend the sentencing hearing and sought asylum at the Brazilian embassy in Lima. Peru's foreign ministry later said that after talks with Brazil she was granted safe passage to travel there with her son.Humala, a former army officer who led the country from 2011 to 2016, became in 2022 the first Peruvian ex-president to go on trial in the Odebrecht corruption scandal, which has also seen three other former presidents implicated.Two-term leader Alan Garcia committed suicide in 2019 when police came to his house to arrest him, while Alejandro Toledo (in power from 2001 to 2006) was sentenced last year to more than 20 years in prison for accepting multi-million-dollar bribes in exchange for government contracts.Investigations continue into the fourth ex-president who was implicated, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (in office from 2016 to 2018). Prosecutors had sought a 20-year prison term for Humala and 26 years for Heredia for accepting $3 million in illegal contributions for his 2011 campaign from Odebrecht. The company is considered responsible for one of the biggest foreign bribery schemes in history.The pair were also charged with illegally diverting about $200,000 sent by Venezuela's then-president Hugo Chavez for Humala's failed 2006 campaign, and Heredia with ""concealment of real estate purchases"" made with some of the money. They have consistently denied all charges, and Humala's legal team said he would appeal the sentence.In 2016, Odebrecht agreed to pay $3.5 billion in penalties in Brazil, the United States and Switzerland arising out of payments of more than $788 million in bribes to foreign leaders and government officials in order to win infrastructure projects. The company admitted having paid at least $29 million in bribes to Peruvian officials between 2005 and 2014.Leftist Humala came to the presidency in 2011 after beating right-wing candidate Keiko Fujimori in a runoff election. Fujimori herself spent 16 months in pre-trial detention in a case linked to Odebrecht.",Ollanta Humala and his wife Nadine Heredia have been sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment.

US State Department denies plans of Nato funding cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-state-department-denies-plans-of-nato-funding-cuts/articleshow/120329774.cms,"While addressing a press briefing on Tuesday (local time), Bruce said that the US remains committed to Nato and is trying to make the alliance deterrent, not to help with wars, fight them, or fund them. She stated that Nato was meant to be a collection of entities that would stop bad actors from doing bad things.

WASHINGTON: US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce rejected reports that claimed that the Trump administration is seeking to reduce US funding for the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (Nato).While addressing a press briefing on Tuesday (local time), Bruce said that the US remains committed to Nato and is trying to make the military alliance deterrent, not to help with wars, fight them, or fund them. She stated that Nato was meant to be a collection of entities that would stop bad actors from doing bad things.When asked whether the Trump administration is considering eliminating funding for UN and Nato, Bruce responded, ""That's again, that's from a story that is looking at a memo that was leaked or not from a plan that is a suggestion. What I can tell you, though, is it really makes me concerned when I see the word 'eliminate.' I travelled to NATO for that summit with the Secretary. Every meeting, every moment, every time on camera, in every bilateral meeting, talking with the secretary general, the one message - it was - several messages, but the singularly important message that everyone there cared about was the fact that the Secretary of State of the United States reiterated our complete commitment to NATO, as has the President of the United States.""""Now, what we also want in our commitment means that we want to make sure and help to make sure that the nations in Nato can actually deliver on the mission of Nato, which is to be a deterrent. It is not to help with wars or to help fight them or to fund them or to make it a little bit better as the wars are going on. Nato was meant to be a collection of entities that would stop the bad actors from doing the bad thing, because it would be very, very bad for them if they did it. And at this point, clearly we've got nations that have got to ramp up, share the burden, increase their defence spending - not because we're meanies but because we are committed to Nato. And Nato has to be the thing that it has been purported to be and expected to be at the beginning and wants to be,"" she added.Bruce said reports that the department might end funding for Nato ""couldn't be further from the truth,"" describing it as ""fear-mongering"" that ""understandably upsets people."" She noted that there will be plenty to discuss when Trump releases budget bill and sends it to Congress.Tammy Bruce said, ""I have to tell you that there is recognition of this fact at Nato - the number of countries increasing their budget commitment to defence, the recognition that it was an important thing without exception. And that's where when we think about the - a story about eliminating funding to Nato is - couldn't be further from the truth. This is about making Nato stronger, making Nato - well, dare I say great again. But that's where it becomes like fear mongering and understandably upsets people.""""But as I've said with other - with the other review we've had with the foreign aid, some things will change, but it doesn't mean that we've changed our commitment to something, but it may look different. That if in fact other nations are coming together and raising their commitment and their contribution, perhaps the American contribution then does come down and yet Nato is stronger. So that is, I think, part of what every family does is looking out for each other, being honest, and providing solutions to that problem. So that story comes from the same speculation that has come from other documents that are moving about when it's - nothing could be further from the truth and certainly commenting on numbers they might have is not helpful. There will be plenty to discuss when President Trump releases and sends to Congress his budget bill,"" she added.Tammy Bruce's statement comes after reports claimed that the Trump administration could reduce nearly 50 per cent of the State Department's funding next fiscal year, according to an internal memo outlining a downsizing plan being given serious consideration by department leaders, The New York Times reported, citing two officials.The memo proposes eliminating almost all funding for international organisations like the United Nations and Nato, ending the budget for supporting international peacekeeping operations, and reducing educational and cultural exchanges in the department, such as the Fulbright Program.The memo also proposes reducing funding for humanitarian assistance and global health programs by over 50 per cent. It was not clear whether US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had endorsed the cuts outlined in the memo, which was dated April 10, The New York Times reported. It was also not clear how seriously the proposed cuts would be entertained in Congress.According to a US official familiar with the department's review, the White House is likely to send Congress a budget proposal this spring that is similar to what the memo outlines in an effort to press lawmakers to formalise reducing efforts that are already being conducted, The New York Times reported.",US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce rejected reports that the Trump administration is seeking to reduce US funding for the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (Nato) Bruce said that the US remains committed to Nato and is trying to make the military alliance deterrent.

Nvidia braces for $5.5 billion blow as Trump administration tightens grip on AI chip exports to China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-braces-for-5-5-billion-blow-as-trump-administration-tightens-grip-on-ai-chip-exports-to-china/articleshow/120329729.cms,"Nvidia warned that it expects a $5.5 billion hit to its revenue after the Trump administration blocked sales of its China-specific AI chips, a move that could reshape the global chip race and deepen the technology rift between the US and China.In a regulatory filing, Nvidia said it had been notified that the US government would now require a license to export its H20 chip to China — a chip it had designed to comply with earlier restrictions. The company said it would be unable to sell or fulfill existing H20 orders, prompting a multi-billion-dollar write-down of inventory and contracts.The decision comes just days after Nvidia pledged to invest $500 billion in US AI infrastructure — a move praised by the White House. But behind the scenes, the Trump administration had already informed the company it was tightening export controls.""This kills Nvidia's access to a key market,"" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. ""Chinese companies are just going to switch to Huawei.""The US Commerce Department confirmed the new export licensing requirements , which also apply to rival AMD’s MI308 chip. “We are committed to acting on the president's directive to safeguard our national and economic security,” spokesperson Benno Kass said.The blow lands as Nvidia faces rising pressure from Chinese firms like Huawei and DeepSeek, the latter of which recently unveiled a powerful AI model reportedly built at a fraction of the cost of its US counterparts.In 2023, China accounted for 13% of Nvidia's revenue, down from around 20% the year before. The H20 chip — a modified version of its flagship H100 — had been Nvidia’s attempt to salvage access to the Chinese market under existing restrictions.Now, even that window is closing.Notably, the crackdown follows a high-profile Mar-a-Lago dinner between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Trump — a meeting that sparked speculation that the administration might ease its stance. Instead, pressure only mounted.Senator Elizabeth Warren urged the administration to act swiftly in a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, warning that Chinese tech giants were stockpiling chips while US startups struggled to acquire them.The fallout could be long-term. As Nvidia retreats from China, analysts warn that domestic players like Huawei could fill the vacuum — and emerge as global competitors.","N Nvidia warns it expects a $5.5 billion hit to its revenue after the Trump administration blocked sales of its China-specific AI chips.
