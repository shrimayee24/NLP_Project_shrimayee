ASI preps for deeper digs to trace Krishna's ancient Dwarka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/asi-preps-for-deeper-digs-to-trace-krishnas-ancient-dwarka/articleshow/126460369.cms,"Remains of ancient settlement off the Dwarka coast in the Arabian Sea

Upcoming Dwarka exploration phase to be more extensive: ASI

AHMEDABAD: Dwarka, the ancient Gujarat coastal town closely associated with the legend of Lord Krishna and home to the revered Dwarkadhish Temple, is set to witness renewed rounds of archaeological excavations, both on land and underwater, senior officials of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have said. The proposed work aims to explore previously unexamined areas using modern technology to gain a deeper understanding of the region's historical and cultural past, reports Parth Shastri.Underwater archaeological excavations at Dwarka were last carried out between 2005 and 2007, while limited exploratory studies were conducted again in 2025.According to ASI officials, the upcoming phase will be more extensive and systematic. Alok Tripathi, additional director-general of ASI, told TOI that new areas at Beyt Dwarka and unexplored underwater zones will be covered by the agency's Underwater Archaeology Wing (UAW).""Dwarka has been under study for nearly 40 years, but the work so far has been limited in scope and objectives. We are now examining the other side of the mouth of the Gomti river,"" Tripathi said.Experts said modern tools and technology would be deployed to enable larger and deeper excavations in the Arabian Sea.Tripathi himself was part of the five-member UAW team that conducted underwater exploratory work at Dwarka in Feb last year. During that time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also dived underwater off Dwarka coast to view submerged remains discovered on the seabed, drawing national attention to the site.On land, the focus will be on relatively undisturbed areas of Beyt Dwarka. Earlier excavations were largely concentrated near the cliff area. ""We are now going deeper inside the forest area, where we have observed signs of a significant settlement. The site has some remarkable features, and excavations at lower levels could reveal important details about settlement planning, economic activities, arts and crafts, and the way of life of the inhabitants,"" Tripathi said.The site has attracted attention alike due to the legend of the sunken city of Dwarka, believed to be founded by Lord Krishna. The ASI website indicates that explorations were carried out to understand the submerged archaeological remains off the coast of Dwarka as sculptures and stone anchors were found during low tide in coastal areas.The excavations so far have yielded many antiquities, including terracotta objects, beads, fragmented bangles, copper rings, iron ingots and pottery among others, according to the ASI website.Apart from Dwarka, the ASI has also initiated excavations at other key sites in Gujarat. Work has begun at Valabhipur, the ancient capital located in Bhavnagar district, and at Lothal, the Harappan-era site renowned for its water structure believed to be among the world's oldest dockyards. With the upcoming National Maritime Heritage Complex near Lothal, archaeologists are exposing a larger area of the site using advanced tools and techniques. Tripathi emphasised that archaeology goes beyond excavation. ""Our task is to place findings in perspective and fill gaps in historical understanding,"" he said, adding that India's use of technology in archaeology is on par with global standards and increasingly relies on interdisciplinary approaches.Gujarat has seen significant archaeological activity over the past decade, including extensive ASI-led excavations at Vadnagar in Mehsana district, PM Modi's hometown, uncovering evidence of continuous habitation over two millennia. The state is also home to major Harappan sites such as Dholavira, now a Unesco World Heritage Site, and Lothal, highlighting Gujarat's rich and layered archaeological heritage.","Dwarka, the ancient Gujarat coastal town closely associated with the legend of Lord Krishna, is set to see renewed rounds of archaeological excavations.

""People are scared of police. When children study here, they and their parents see a different face of the police.For us, watching children study inside a police station is a huge stress buster,"" he said.The makeshift school runs entirely on contributions from police station staff. ""We have consciously avoided donations so that the initiative remains simple and transparent,"" Agarwal said. Among the three teachers is an elderly former schoolteacher who lives in a nearby old age home after being abandoned by his family. ""This school has given him dignity and purpose again,"" Agarwal said.Classes are held in three batches, mostly for children studying in govt schools.

US Supreme Court ruling: Treasury has enough funds if Trump’s tariffs are struck down; when refunds could begin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-supreme-court-ruling-treasury-has-enough-funds-if-trumps-tariffs-are-struck-down-when-refunds-could-begin/articleshow/126448985.cms,"'No Call From PM Modi': Trump Aide Lutnick's Shocker On India-US Trade Deal Amid Tariff Threats

If the US Supreme Court rules against President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs, the treasury has more than enough funds to pay for the tariff refunds, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said. The timeline of payments, however, might extend to weeks or even a year, he told Reuters.In an interview, Bessent said he doubted the court would rule against Trump's tariffs, but suggested that any refunds could become a “corporate boondoggle” for companies that passed on the costs to their customers.""It won't be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens - which I don't think it's going to - it's just a corporate boondoggle,"" he said.""Costco, who's suing the US government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?""Bessent added that, in general, companies had not been passing tariffs on to consumers, stating there was ""very, very little, if any, pass-through,"" and disputed that Trump's tariffs had contributed to inflation. He noted that goods inflation had remained below headline inflation.Importers and trade lawyers had expected a Supreme Court ruling on Friday, but the court issued a decision on a different matter instead.It remains unclear when the court will rule on the tariff case, which challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.Bessent said he believed that the longer the decision is delayed, the more likely the Supreme Court will rule in Trump's favour.With nearly $774 billion in cash as of Thursday, the treasury has more than enough to cover any refunds. Treasury borrowing estimates for January-March 2026 project an end-March cash balance of around $850 billion.""We're not talking about the money all goes out in a day. Probably over weeks, months, may take over a year, right?"" Bessent told Reuters.He also indicated that Treasury budget data for calendar year 2025 would likely show a deficit reduction of $300 billion to $400 billion from 2024, providing additional capacity. The government reported a fiscal-year deficit of $1.775 trillion for 2025, which ended on 30 September.Importers have warned that recouping any tariffs paid could be difficult if the Supreme Court finds Trump's IEEPA-based duties illegal. According to Customs and Border Protection data, $133.5 billion in such tariffs had been assessed through 14 December, with the total likely approaching $150 billion, based on Reuters calculations.Bessent disputed this estimate, saying it was ""not the number"" for tariffs potentially subject to refunds. He noted that revenues from tariffs imposed under other legal authorities also existed, but did not provide a specific figure for IEEPA-based tariffs.",Treasury secretary Scott Bessent says the treasury has more than enough funds to pay for tariff refunds.

In Fiery UK Conclave Speech, Suhel Seth Says India Has Evolved Beyond 1947, Now Shapes Global Power

NEW DELHI: In a move to shed yet another colonial relic, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Friday announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj — black prince coats (bandhgala coats) — saying that “we have to find every trace of colonialism and banish them”.TOI has learnt that govt is carrying out a larger exercise across the board to identify similar colonial hangovers — attire and ceremonial rites — such as convocation gowns and caps (robe and mortarboard) which are de rigueur at university conovations and bandhgalas officers have to mandatorily wear at formal receptions. In some states personnel attached to district collectors and mayors in some states are required to wear a certain pattern of dress.Speaking at an event to honour railway officials and the zone for their exemplary works, Vaishnaw said, “We have to get rid of all colonial mindset. We need to find each of them and remove them whether it’s in our working style or dressing style. Today (Friday) I am making the first announcement. Humare jo band gale ka kala suit angrezon chalu kiya tha, aaj se yeh railway mein formal dress nehin rahegi. (From today onwards, the black prince coats that the British introduced will no longer be a part of formal dress in railways).Officials said that PM Narendra Modi has asked ministers and top bureaucrats to identify the colonial practices and to suggest alternatives that are of Indian origins and reflect the country's culture.While the practice of convocation gowns and caps has been fading, some institutions have held on to it despite the ceremonial gear not being suited for India’s hot and humid conditions and despite protests from students and faculty. Officials said that more practices, which are not commonly known to many, may be identified during consultations.Sources did not rule out the possibility of a nudge to do away with black coats and gowns that lawyers are required to wear as per Advocates Act, 1961 continuing a tradition inherited from the British legal system where it symbolised authority, dignity, and a commitment to justice. This law formalised the British-era custom, requiring advocates to wear the black robe with a white neckband for uniformity and gravity in court.",Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj.

"Indian firm demonstrates 20km, 10Gbps indigenous wireless laser comms system",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-firm-demonstrates-20km-10gbps-indigenous-wireless-laser-comms-system/articleshow/126430652.cms,"File photo

BENGALURU: Photonics and defence technology firm olee.space Friday said it has successfully demonstrated an indigenous wireless laser communication system capable of transmitting data at 10Gbps over a distance of 20km.The system, built with about 85% locally sourced components, was designed, manufactured and tested in India. The company said the demonstration validated its ability to deliver long-range, high-capacity optical wireless links suitable for defence and other strategic applications under representative atmospheric conditions.Wireless laser communication offers advantages such as independence from radio-frequency spectrum, low probability of interception and resistance to electronic jamming, making it relevant for defence and government use where conventional RF systems face limitations.According to olee.space , the platform integrates precision opto-mechanical subsystems developed in-house, including a high-accuracy, Indian-manufactured gimbal with arc-second level pointing precision.It also features an internally integrated fast steering mirror assembly. “Together, the dual-stage stabilisation system uses voice-coil and piezo-mounted actuators [mechanisms that convert electrical energy into motion] to maintain link stability over long distances, even under dynamic atmospheric or platform-induced disturbances,” the firm said. olee.space founder and CEO James Solomon said the achievement marked a significant milestone for indigenous optical communication capabilities.“Achieving a 20km, 10 Gbps optical link with carrier-grade availability under Indian operating conditions establishes India’s ability to design, manufacture and validate advanced wireless laser communication systems using predominantly indigenous technologies,” he said.During performance validation, the system achieved a carrier-grade link availability of over 99.9%, meeting operational requirements for mission-critical communication.The company said the entire design, integration and field demonstration were completed within four months of project funding. This, it noted, reflected the growing maturity of India’s private-sector defence manufacturing ecosystem and its capacity to deliver advanced optical communication systems at speed.The system’s architecture is designed to be adaptable across terrestrial, maritime, aerial and high-altitude platforms, with potential for future space-based applications, subject to integration requirements. By reducing reliance on imported optical communication subsystems, the capability supports India’s push towards end-to-end indigenous development in advanced wireless communication technologies.","Olee.space Friday said it has successfully demonstrated an indigenous wireless laser communication system.

Amit Shah Outlines Foolproof NIDMS Mechanism To Counter Future Terror Attacks

JAIPUR/JODHPUR: Union minister Amit Shah Saturday credited the Bhajan Lal Sharma-led BJP govt in Rajasthan with streamlining the recruitment system in the state, putting an end to the paper leak scandals, which he alleged had become a recurring feature during the previous Congress dispensation.Shah was addressing newly recruited police constables, while distributing appointment letters at the Rajasthan Police Academy. He said nearly 9,000 candidates were recruited, including over 2,500 women, and symbolically handed appointment letters to 10 constables.""Before coming here, I learnt about the entire (recruitment) process. I want to tell the people of Rajasthan that these 9,000 youths got jobs without paying anything, and without any recommendation, purely on merit and hard work,"" Shah said. He added that the recruitment process ensured transparency, eliminated corruption and respected skills.The home minister maintained that the 2025 constable recruitment examination was conducted transparently with the use of technology.Highlighting the challenges of policing in the state, which has a 1,070-km international border with Pakistan, rugged ravines and the Thar Desert, Shah urged the new recruits to undergo training with full dedication to contribute to the goal of a ""surakshit (safe) Rajasthan"".Shah said this would be the first batch to join Rajasthan Police after the introduction of three new criminal laws, and claimed that once the laws are fully implemented, any FIR registered will have a system in place for justice to be delivered up to the Supreme Court within three years.On the occasion, CM Sharma announced the establishment of Rajasthan Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (R4C) on the lines of Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) to tackle cybercrime. He said the R4C would be developed as a centre of excellence and provide a centralised framework for coordination, information sharing and research on cyber crimes across all districts.Addressing a convention in Jodhpur later, Shah praised the Maheshwari community for its sustained contributions to India - from the era of battles against Mughals through the freedom struggle and into post-Independence nation-building.","Shah was addressing newly recruited police constables, while distributing appointment letters at the Rajasthan Police Academy.

Only 1 in 5 deaths in India medically certified: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-1-in-5-deaths-in-india-medically-certified-study/articleshow/126458125.cms,".

NEW DELHI: India records one of the highest numbers of deaths globally, yet the country still does not know what most people die of - a gap most pronounced in north India and even the national capital. A nationwide study published in Scientific Reports has found that only 22.5% of deaths in India are medically certified, leaving nearly four out of five deaths without a doctor-confirmed cause in official records.The findings are particularly significant for Delhi and north Indian states, which together account for a large share of the population. North India has the poorest medical certification of deaths, averaging just 13%, while Delhi's rate has remained stagnant at around 57-59% for years - far from universal coverage despite its dense network of hospitals and medical colleges.The consequences extend well beyond record-keeping. ""Without knowing the cause of death, it becomes difficult to assess disease prevalence nationally or regionally, which in turn affects health delivery, especially in remote areas,"" said Dr Vinay Aggarwal, former national president of Indian Medical Association. He added that poor death documentation also affected processes such as electoral roll revision, underlining the wider administrative fallout.Public health experts warn that unreliable cause-of-death data means govts are effectively planning health policy without knowing which diseases are killing people. Deaths from heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, infections, maternal causes, injuries and suicides cannot be accurately tracked, distorting disease burden estimates and skewing health spending. Weak certification also delays outbreak detection and undermines surveillance at a time when non-communicable diseases account for a growing share of adult deaths.The study tracked death certification patterns across India over 15 years, from 2006 to 2020.Regional disparities are stark. Large parts of north and east India continue to report single-digit or low double-digit certification rates, pulling down national averages and leaving millions of deaths each year without medical explanation.In contrast, southern and western states perform far better, reflecting stronger hospital reporting and administrative compliance. Some Union Territories are close to universal coverage - Lakshadweep reports over 94% medical certification, while Goa has near-complete coverage.The study challenges the assumption that doctor shortages alone explain the gap. While poorly performing states have fewer physicians, the strongest determinant is whether hospitals actually report deaths. In low-performing states, only about half of registered hospitals submit cause-of-death data, compared with over 90% reporting in high-performing states and UTs.The scale of the problem is stark. In 2020, India recorded around 8.8 million deaths. While about 80% were registered, only around 2 million had a medically certified cause. Progress has been slow, with certification improving by just 2.5 percentage points over a decade, despite expanded health infrastructure.Researchers warn that unless medical certification becomes routine and enforceable - particularly in north India and large urban centres like Delhi - India will continue to underestimate major killers, knowing far more about how many people die than why they die.","Only 22.5% of deaths in India are medically certified. Nearly four out of five deaths without a doctor-confirmed cause in official records. North India has the poorest medical certification of deaths, averaging just 13%. Delhi's rate has remained stagnant at around 57-59% for years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126458126,imgsize-419676,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-1.jpg"

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

KOLKATA: A Rs 20 crore hawala transaction allegedly changed hands six times to erase its trail before reaching political consultancy, Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC)'s Goa office from Kolkata, Enforcement Directorate (ED) has alleged in a petition filed before Calcutta high court.ED said that proceeds of crime generated from alleged coal smuggling in West Bengal were routed through domestic and international hawala channels and used to fund political campaigns. One such transfer reached I-PAC during Goa assembly elections in 2021-22, the agency claimed. The allegations are part of an ongoing investigation and are yet to be tested in court.According to ED, investigators traced the money trail to a former director of a New Delhi-based non-banking financial services firm, who allegedly contacted a person known as Munna to move the funds. ED said that Munna linked up with another member of a hawala network, after which money reached a manager of a Kolkata-based hawala firm.In a statement to ED, the hawala firm manager allegedly said that he arranged cash delivery in Goa during 2021-22. The cash was to be handed over to an employee of an event management company, who then contacted the firm's director and its sister concern.ED claimed both companies were handling events and campaign-related work for I-PAC during Goa assembly elections.ED told high court that I-PAC co-founder and director Pratik Jain handled the consultancy's Goa operations at the time. Based on these findings, searches were carried out on Jan 8 at 10 locations in New Delhi and Kolkata, ED said. One of the locations was Jain's home on Loudon Street in central Kolkata.The agency alleged that proceeds originated from a coal smuggling syndicate led by Anup Majee, accused of stealing and illegally excavating coal from premises of Eastern Coalfields Limited, a central public sector coal producer operating across parts of Bengal and Jharkhand. ED claimed stolen coal was sold to factories and plants in districts, including Bankura, Purba Bardhaman and Purulia - all in western and central parts of Bengal.Factory owners allegedly paid in cash, which syndicate members collected and deposited at an office in Bhamuria, a locality in Asansol subdivision of Paschim Bardhaman district, the central agency said."," Enforcement Directorate (ED) claims proceeds of crime generated from alleged coal smuggling in West Bengal were routed through domestic and international hawala channels.

Insurance premiums may be linked to driver behaviour

NEW DELHI: In its bid to rein in the menace of uninsured vehicles plying on roads and unsafe driving, road transport and highways ministry has proposed amendments in the Motor Vehicles Act to empower enforcement agencies to detain such vehicles and introduce a provision barring the issuance of a fresh driving licence (DL) to applicants whose licence was revoked in the previous three years, reports Dipak Dash.In a set of proposed changes to the MV Act that the ministry shared with state transport ministers and commissioners at a meeting this week, it has also said that section 147 in the current law will also be amended to empower insurance regulator IRDAI to specify base premiums and liabilities considering vehicle's age and challan history.This is being done to link insurance premiums with driver’s behaviour. The history of challans for violations provides sufficient insight into how a vehicle is driven,” said an official. At present, govt prescribes base premiums and liabilities for third party insurance, in consultation with IRDAI. Similarly, the current law has provisions for detention or seizure of a vehicle, if it’s found without registration or permit, or is found violating permit conditions.At present, a large share of vehicles, particularly two-wheelers, don’t have valid insurance cover. To further link driver behaviour with challan history and licence revocation, the ministry has proposed to amend Section 9, which deals with the issuance and renewal of DL.It proposes removing exemptions from driving tests for applicants whose challan history reflects unsafe driving behaviour. Currently, a driving test is not mandatory if an application for renewal is made within one year before the licence expires.“There is a risk of this provision becoming subjective, as receiving challans during the 15-year validity period of a driving licence is common. Ideally, a driving test should be mandatory before every renewal, with no exemptions.There should also not be a blanket ban on issuing a fresh licence to applicants whose licences were revoked. If a probe concludes such individuals were not at fault, they should be allowed to obtain a fresh licence,” said Anil Chhikara, ex-deputy transport commissioner of Delhi. The ministry has also proposed to amend another section to bring in graded eligibility to obtain licence for larger and heavier vehicles by attaining skill acquired through driving experience. It is also seeking to expand the ambit of mandatory third party insurance by including owner, driver and occupant of personal vehicles. At present, it’s applicable only for commercial vehicles. There is also a proposal to extend the applicants’ age criteria for mandatory submission of medical certificates for new DL or for renewal from 40 years at present to 60 years.","Insurance premiums may be linked to driver behaviour.

ISRO’s Heaviest Launch Yet: Five Reasons Why BlueBird-2 Marks India’s Big Leap In Global Space Race

BENGALURU: India took a formal step towards building its own space station, with Isro inviting Indian industry to develop the first module of the proposed Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS).Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, under the Department of Space, issued an expression of interest (EoI) seeking qualified Indian aerospace manufacturers to build two sets of the BAS-01 structure, the first module planned for India's future space station in low Earth orbit. TOI accessed the EoI issued on Jan 8.Bidders must be Indian entities with at least five years of experience in aerospace manufacturing, a minimum annual average turnover of Rs 50 crore over last three financial years, relevant quality certifications, and no record of blacklisting.Isro described BAS as the next major milestone in India's human spaceflight programme, aimed at ensuring a sustained human presence in space, following Gaganyaan missions. The BAS-01 module is expected to be the first operational element of the station.BAS-01 is scheduled for deployment by 2028 and is the first step towards developing five modules by 2035 to complete the full station.According to initial plans that TOI accessed in 2019, BAS, a 20-tonne modular abode, was to have space for three astronauts.Isro is yet to commit to the final design.Union minister Jitendra Singh confirmed that Rs 720 crore was allocated for development of the first module, and procurement activities for long lead items have begun.Isro is targeting several advanced technologies through this mission, including autonomous rendezvous and docking, robotics, in-orbit refuelling, dedicated crew quarters, intra-vehicular activity suits (worn inside spacecraft), and modular racks for conducting microgravity experiments.According to the EoI document, the industry partner will be responsible for complete development and realisation of BAS-01 structure, including fabrication, welding, assembly, inspection, and proof pressure testing.","Isro invites Indian industry to develop the first module of the proposed Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS) Bidders must be Indian entities with at least five years of experience in aerospace manufacturing, a minimum annual average turnover of Rs 50 crore over last three financial years, relevant quality certifications.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126458158,imgsize-830170,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-5.jpg"

PANAJI: Goa officially breached the 1-crore mark in total tourist arrivals last year, riding a booming domestic market. However, foreign tourist arrivals are struggling to regain pre-pandemic levels, currently sitting at nearly 42% below 2017 numbers, data for 2025 released by the tourism department showed.In 2017, Goa welcomed 8.9 lakh foreign tourists. In 2025, that number dwindled to 5.2 lakh. This decline stands in sharp contrast to the domestic market, which rocketed from 68.9 lakh in 2017 to a record-breaking 1 crore in 2025, propelling total arrivals to an all-time high of nearly 1.1 crore travellers.The most dramatic collapse was observed in the charter flight segment, traditionally the backbone of Goa's winter tourism. In 2017, the state saw 1,024 charter flights bringing in nearly 2.5 lakh tourists. In 2025, this plummeted to 189 flights carrying 40,336 passengers.Even with the operationalisation of Manohar International Airport (Mopa) alongside Dabolim, the combined charter traffic continued to slide annually since pandemic recovery began.""The tourist arrival data highlights a clear recovery trajectory across all segments, particularly in the post-pandemic period.The consistent growth in domestic tourism, the return of international charter operations, increased international flight movements through both Dabolim and Mopa airports, and the steady contribution of cruise tourism reflect coordinated efforts in infrastructure development, connectivity enhancement, and destination management,"" said tourism director Kedar Naik.The scheduled international flight segment showed more resilience, but did not fully recover. In 2017, scheduled flights brought in nearly 3.4 lakh foreigners. In 2025, that figure stood at nearly 2.4 lakh. Mopa became the primary gateway, handling 1,141 international flights in 2025 compared to Dabolim's 643.""Foreign tourist arrivals through charter flights played an important role in Goa's inbound tourism, particularly from traditional source markets. Foreign tourist arrivals through international scheduled flights consistently contributed to Goa's inbound tourism. In 2017, 2,460 international flights operated through Dabolim airport, carrying 3,35,573 foreign tourists. This number gradually declined until 2021, when only 265 flights and 11,971 tourists were recorded due to travel restrictions. A steady recovery began in 2022, with 1,135 flights and 1,34,922 tourists,"" said a tourism department official.Cruise tourism is also undergoing a demographic shift. While the total number of cruise passengers in 2025 was 51,510, the vast majority are now domestic travellers. Foreign cruise passengers, who numbered over 40,822 in 2017, accounted for just 10,086 arrivals in 2025.Tourism minister Rohan Khaunte remained optimistic, pointing to the ""resilience"" of the sector. He said the steady rise in domestic arrivals and the gradual revival of international segments, bolstered by improved connectivity via Mopa, underlined the state's ""destination readiness"".","In 2017, Goa welcomed 8.9 lakh foreign tourists.

US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick made a big statement over why the India-US trade deal is not sealed yet, claiming that it was due to PM Modi not calling Trump. Speaking at the All-In Podcast, hosted by Chamath Palihapitiya, Lutnick said, ""Let's be clear, it's his deal. He's the closer. He does the deal. So I said, you got to have Modi. It's all set up. You have to have Modi...they were uncomfortable doing it.""""So Modi didn't call,"" he claimed.This statement comes after US President Donald Trump, on Thursday, approved a bill that can impose at least 500% tariffs for countries buying Russian oil, aiming to ""punish them."" US senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill would give US tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil.In February, leaders from both countries directed officials to begin negotiations, setting an initial goal of completing the first phase by autumn 2025. However the deal still remains stalled with India's trade with Russia remaining a major flashpoint.Back in August, US imposed additional tariffs on Indian imports to the country alleging that New Delhi's purchase of Russian oil was fueling Moscow's 'war machine' in Ukraine.Since then total tariffs on Indian goods stand at 50%, including 25% of additional tariffs and 25% of Trump's reciprocal tariffs.Since then, two nations have held many rounds of trade talks with the meeting back from December 10 to December 12, when US officials visited New Delhi. India and the US are engaged in parallel negotiations, aiming to develop a framework trade deal to address tariff issues, and focus on a comprehensive trade agreement.The proposed agreement aims to more than double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 from the current $191 billion.The US remained India’s largest trading partner for the fourth consecutive year in 2024–25, with bilateral trade standing at $131.84 billion, of which $86.5 billion came from Indian exports. The American market accounts for roughly 18% of India’s total goods exports, 6.22% of its imports, and 10.73% of overall merchandise trade.Exporters have highlighted the need to finalise the agreement, noting that India’s merchandise exports to the US fell for a second straight month in October, declining 8.58% to $6.3 billion, largely due to the steep tariffs imposed by Washington.","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick made a big statement over why the India-US trade deal is not sealed yet.

Gold February futures on MCX are trading near ₹1,37,800 after a sharp pullback from higher levels. The recent recovery attempt appears corrective in nature, with price facing strong resistance near the previous breakdown zone. Technical indicators suggest that upside momentum is losing steam, making higher levels vulnerable to fresh selling pressure. The intraday setup favors a sell-on-rise approach in the ₹1,37,800–₹1,38,000 range.Prices are trading below the short-term EMA cluster, with EMA 8 failing to sustain above EMA 21. This indicates weak short-term structure and suggests that rallies are likely to be sold into rather than extended.Gold has moved back toward the mid-Bollinger band after testing lower levels, but the upper band near ₹1,38,000 continues to act as a firm resistance. This positioning supports the view of capped upside in the near term.• Resistance Zone: ₹1,37,800 – ₹1,38,000• Support Levels: ₹1,36,800 followed by ₹1,36,400Failure to sustain above pivot resistance keeps the intraday bias tilted to the downside.RSI is around 60, indicating a short-term recovery but not strong enough to confirm trend reversal. This level often precedes consolidation or pullback when price approaches resistance.MACD has shown a brief positive crossover, but histogram bars are flattening, signaling waning bullish momentum. This increases the probability of a rollover from higher levels.The recovery has been accompanied by moderate volume, while open interest remains soft, hinting that the move lacks strong long buildup and is prone to reversal.• Strategy: Sell on rise• Sell Zone: ₹1,37,800 – ₹1,38,000• Stop-Loss: ₹1,39,100• Downside Target: ₹1,36,400• Bias: Bearish below ₹1,38,000; strength only above ₹1,39,100.Gold’s intraday technical structure remains vulnerable as prices trade below key moving averages and momentum indicators fail to confirm sustained strength. The resistance band near ₹1,38,000 is likely to attract selling pressure. Traders are advised to sell on rise around ₹1,37,800–₹1,38,000, keep a strict stop-loss at ₹1,39,100, and look for a move toward ₹1,36,400 during the session.","Gold price rally appears to be losing steam for now, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

No More Stopovers: Etihad Launches Direct UAE–Luxembourg Flights

Etihad’s network strategy: Global reach, local focus







In a major expansion of international air links, Etihad Airways has announced the launch of direct flights between Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates and Luxembourg in Europe. This will mark the first time a Middle Eastern airline will serve the small but economically pivotal European country that is bordered by France, Germany and Belgium.Etihad is slated to operate three weekly flights on this route starting from October 29, 2026, using its newest Airbus A321LR aircraft, a long-range single-aisle jet designed for efficient medium-haul services. The move has been welcomed by business leaders, travel professionals and diplomatic circles as a strategic boost to connectivity between the UAE and the European Union According to Etihad CEO Antonualdo Neves, this is not merely a new flight route; it is the first direct air link between Luxembourg and the Middle East and it opens new horizons for business, tourism and cultural exchange.Initially, Luxembourg may appear to be a peaceful European capital city but due to its geographical position, it serves as a hub connecting France, Germany and Belgium, which are among the most prominent European markets.Etihad’s new air service aims to establish Abu Dhabi as a global hub that effortlessly connects the Gulf to Western Europe and other parts of the world.The move strengthens Etihad’s footprint in Europe at a time when airlines are pivoting toward efficient, sustainable connectivity and travellers are demanding more direct options. Luxembourg’s central location within the EU makes it especially attractive for corporate travellers, multi-city holiday planners and even transit passengers connecting onward across the continent.The new Luxembourg–Abu Dhabi service is expected to appeal to a wide range of passengers:With three flights a week, the service offers flexibility without overwhelming frequency, ideal for both short trips and longer itineraries. By using the fuel-efficient A321LR, Etihad aligns with broader airline industry efforts to cut carbon emissions while maintaining route profitability.In announcing the service, Neves emphasised that this new route is not just about moving passengers, it is about deepening economic and cultural ties between two regions that play outsized roles in the global economy. Luxembourg, home to major EU institutions and financial giants, has long been a crossroads of European commerce and diplomacy.Direct air connectivity to the UAE, a key investment destination and global logistics hub, is expected to unlock fresh opportunities for trade delegations, start-ups, investors and creatives alike.Cultural exchange is another key benefit. Students, artists and professionals from both regions will now find it easier to travel without the time and cost penalties associated with multi-stop itineraries. For the UAE, this means strengthening its soft power and tourism appeal in a cluster of countries that have traditionally relied on indirect connections through other European gateways.The Luxembourg route is part of a broader strategy by Etihad to expand its global network while reinforcing Abu Dhabi’s role as a premier aviation hub. In recent years, Etihad has launched and expanded direct services to North America, Africa, Asia and Australasia, always with a focus on linking passengers via the UAE to new, under-served city pairs.Travel industry analysts view this announcement as a calculated move that leverages Luxembourg’s high-value business traffic while offering leisure travellers greater convenience.According to aviation market experts, the world increasingly demands direct, efficient travel and Etihad’s decision to connect Abu Dhabi with Luxembourg directly positions the airline to capture both business and premium leisure traffic that might otherwise fly via other Gulf or European hubs.The introduction of this service has implications beyond air travel. It signals continued confidence in post-pandemic global mobility, underscores the UAE’s strategic aviation ambitions and strengthens Europe–Middle East linkages at a time of shifting geopolitics and economic interdependence.For the UAE, the added connection to Luxembourg enhances tourism appeal at a time when the country continues to diversify its economy. For Europe, it offers travellers and businesses a more seamless path to one of the fastest-growing regions in the world. Etihad’s Luxembourg launch is a historic win for both sides of the route: it connects two dynamic economic regions, expands travel options for business and leisure passengers and reinforces Abu Dhabi’s ambition to be a center of global travel and exchange.","Etihad Airways has announced the launch of direct flights between Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates and Luxembourg in Europe.

CHENNAI: A chilly breeze and overcast skies blanketed the city on Saturday, but the rain forecast for the day fizzled out. Even so, the India Meterological Department said heavy spells are possible on Sunday, retaining a yellow alert for heavy rainfall of 6–12cm in 24 hours for Chennai, Chengalpet and Kancheepuram.The agency, however, quietly dropped Chennai from the heavy rain warning it issued for Saturday.Meteorologists said the city missed the expected heavy spells because the weather system weakened and remained far from the coast. Strong wind shear disrupted the system and pushed the convection away, altering the rainfall pattern. As of Saturday evening, the system crossed the north-east Sri Lanka coast near Mullaitivu and is expected to weaken further into a well-marked low pressure area by Sunday morning as it moves westwards towards Tamil Nadu. “Even though the system weakened, the circulation will persist in the upper atmosphere for one or two days. Along with the north-easterly winds, this will cause convergence and bring rainfall,” said P Senthamarai Kannan, director, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.“On Sunday, its impact could be seen over north coastal Tamil Nadu and even some interior ghat areas. Models show moderate to heavy rain in Chennai.”On Sunday, the city and suburbs may receive moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms and lightning over some areas. Generally cloudy skies are expected to keep maximum temperatures at 27–28°C and minimum temperatures at 22–23°C.Along with Chennai, Chengalpet and Kancheepuram, Cuddalore and Villupuram may also receive heavy rainfall in isolated places on Sunday. On Saturday, cloudy conditions kept temperatures below normal, with Nungambakkam recording 27.7°C and Meenambakkam 28.1°C. Light drizzles were reported in a few pockets, with 0.5mm recorded at an automatic rain gauge in Villivakkam.Several southern and interior districts also received light rain, including Nagapattinam (1mm), Grand Anaicut in Thanjavur (2.5mm), and the hill stations Coonoor and Yercaud (1mm each).Since Jan 1, Chennai recorded 21.9mm of rainfall—about 130% above normal—while Tamil Nadu logged 8.1mm, around 26% above normal.","Chennai missed the expected heavy spells because the weather system weakened and remained far from the coast.

State leaders met with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday for pre-budget discussions, where they reportedly asked for increased financial support for capital investments and compensation for GST revenue losses. The states also asked for more funding for urban and rural development, housing programs, and disaster management ahead of the upcoming FY27 budget presentation on February 1, according to officials cited by ET.During the meeting, Sitharaman emphasised the importance of state participation in achieving India's goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047. She encouraged states to implement necessary reforms to support this vision.Kerala's finance minister KN Balagopal mentioned his state's concerns, claiming that the Centre has held back over Rs 17,000 crore this fiscal year. He requested an increase in the borrowing ceiling and addressed issues like GST-related revenue decline and railway development needs.Telangana presented infrastructure proposals, including the construction of 2.5 million houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and the establishment of an Indian Institute of Management.The state also demanded allocation for various transport sector schemes such as a regional ring road and the expansion of the Hyderabad Metro Rail.Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh pushed on regional development, asking for assistance for the Rayalaseema Horticulture Development Package as well as the Polavaram-Nallamala Sagar Link project.State leaders, including governors, chief ministers, deputy chief ministers, and finance ministers, attended the meeting among others. The union minster of state for finance, Pankaj Chaudhary, and members of the ministry also attended the meeting among others.Before this, Sitharaman has held meetings with different stakeholders such as economists, industrialists, farmers, and students of the Delhi School of Economics to get diverse inputs for the budget.","State leaders met with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday for pre- budget discussions.

"Credit curbs: US banks flag risks to lending as Trump pushes 10% cap on card rates; consumers, small firms may take hit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/credit-curbs-us-banks-flag-risks-to-lending-as-trump-pushes-10-cap-on-card-rates-consumers-small-firms-may-take-hit/articleshow/126455159.cms,"US banks have flagged concerns over President Donald Trump’s call to sharply cut credit card interest rates, warning that such a move could restrict access to credit and hurt households and small businesses that rely heavily on cards, AFP reported.Trump said on Friday that from January 20, marking the first anniversary of his administration, he wants a 10 per cent cap on credit card interest rates. Posting on Truth Social, he said Americans should no longer be “ripped off” by card issuers charging interest rates of 20–30 per cent.In a joint statement issued late Friday, five major banking industry groups said they shared the president’s goal of making credit more affordable, but cautioned against the proposed cap.“At the same time, evidence shows that a 10 per cent interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards,” the associations said.They added that such a cap, if implemented, could push consumers towards “less regulated, more costly alternatives”.The statement was issued by the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum and the Independent Community Bankers of America.Credit cards remain the primary source of consumer credit in the US, with usage rising sharply in recent years as households lean on borrowing to maintain spending, including for essential expenses. Federal Reserve data shows that total outstanding credit card debt crossed $1.23 trillion by the end of September, making it the fourth-largest category of household debt after mortgages, student loans and auto loans.According to the Fed, credit card interest rates currently stand at 21 per cent or higher and can go up to 38 per cent for borrowers with higher risk profiles. This compares with an average of about 12 per cent a decade ago.With midterm elections due in November, Trump is under pressure to deliver on campaign promises to lower the cost of living amid persistent inflation and growing consumer stress.However, Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, questioned Trump’s intent, noting his administration’s efforts to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.“Begging credit card companies to play nice is a joke,” Warren said in a statement. “Trump doesn’t care about affordability.”","US banks have flagged concerns over President Donald Trump’s call to sharply cut credit card interest rates.

JABALPUR: What was projected as a state-funded research initiative to combat cancer using cow dung, cow urine and milk instead snowballed into an alleged financial scandal at Nanaji Deshmukh Veterinary Science University.Following complaints of misuse of research funds, Jabalpur Collector Raghvendra Singh ordered a probe and constituted a 2-member committee led by Additional Collector RS Marawi. “During preliminary scrutiny of documents, it was found that the research money was spent on purposes not related to the project,” Marawi told TOI. He said around Rs 3 lakh was spent on air travel, though there was no evidence of research-related tours.“A car was purchased from the research head and nearly Rs 15 lakh was spent on vehicle repairs, petrol and diesel,” he said. The Panchgavya scheme was launched in 2011 after the state govt sanctioned Rs 3.5 crore for research on treating serious diseases like cancer using gobar, gaumutra and milk. However, the probe found little to show by way of research output.Marawi further toldthat close to Rs 1.75 crore was spent on raw material and machines, which were procured at rates many times higher than prevailing market prices.“About Rs 15 lakh was spent on furniture and electronic items, and nearly Rs 5 lakh was paid under other heads, all from the research fund,” he said, adding that the inquiry report was submitted to the Collector and further action will be decided at the administrative level.University Vice-Chancellor Mandeep Sharma said the research programme ended in 2018, claiming that technical and financial records were approved at the time. “We are gathering details of the project and will officially share information with the media after reviewing the records,” he told. A project meant to give scientific backing to traditional knowledge, instead, has raised troubling questions over accountability.","A state-funded research initiative to combat cancer using cow dung, cow urine and milk instead snowballed into an alleged financial scandal at Nanaji Deshmukh Veterinary Science University.

SHIMLA: At least two residential buildings were evacuated near Sanjauli in Shimla district on Friday night after cracks developed in the structures, allegedly due to ongoing tunnelling work beneath the Chalaunthi bypass.Around 40 people from 15 families were forced to evacuate around 10 pm amid intense cold, with temperatures plunging close to 1°C. Many affected families spent the night by the roadside, lighting fires to keep themselves warm.Police and district administration officials, including additional district magistrate (law and order) Pankaj Sharma, reached the spot at night to supervise the evacuation. After cracks were noticed on the Sanjauli–Dhalli bypass road as well, authorities ordered an immediate suspension of vehicular traffic on the route.Inder Singh, a local, said homeowners had informed the tunnel construction company earlier this week about cracks appearing in their houses. ""Company officials visited and told us the cracks were normal and there was no danger. However, last night, the same officials asked us to evacuate,"" he said.Himachal Pradesh panchayati raj minister Anirudh Singh visited the affected families on Saturday and assured them of all possible help.""Fair compensation will be provided immediately to those who have suffered losses. I have also instructed that an immediate survey be conducted of all buildings along the alignment, from Bhatakuffer onwards. Instruments should be installed so that any settlement or movement can be detected immediately, and no one shifts blame later,"" the minister said.The minister said he had been repeatedly raising the issue with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Union minister Nitin Gadkari for the past one and a half years. Special committees were formed to address damage occurring beyond the acquired land, he said, adding that similar committees were also constituted in Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand.Shimla deputy commissioner Anupam Kashyap, who visited the site with SP Sanjeev Kumar Gandhi, said a committee headed by the Shimla (rural) SDM had been formed to assess the damage. The committee is expected to submit its report within a week, which will help determine compensation. The state geologist has also begun preparing a report on the causes of the damage, which is expected within a week. Four-lane construction work has been suspended.On June 30 last year, a multi-storeyed building in Mathu Colony of Bhatakuffer near Sanjauli collapsed following a landslide. An inquiry committee attributed the incident to hill cutting for the four-lane road project. In July 2025, the Shimla district administration directed the company executing the Kaithlighat–Dhalli four-laning of National Highway-5 to pay Rs 5.61 crore as compensation to affected families.On Jan 8, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) took cognisance of environmental and safety concerns linked to the four-lane road widening project on NH-5 in Shimla and issued notices to the state govt and the NHAI. Petitioner Narender Singh Rathore, an agricultural landowner in the Mashobra and Lindhi-Dhar areas of Shimla (rural), submitted that the work was being carried out on an extremely fragile and environmentally sensitive slope with a steep gradient of nearly 70 degrees, leading to landslides and environmental degradation. The matter is scheduled for hearing on Feb 9.","Around 40 people from 15 families were forced to evacuate around 10 pm amid intense cold.

Udaipur Leela Palace fined Rs 10 lakh: Staff entered occupied room with master key; pregnant guest suffered mental trauma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/udaipur-leela-palace-fined-rs-10-lakh-staff-entered-occupied-room-with-master-key-pregnant-guest-suffered-mental-trauma/articleshow/126451091.cms,"Chennai Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.







CHENNAI: A Chennai consumer court has ordered luxury hotel The Leela Palace, Udaipur, to pay more than Rs 10.65 lakh in compensation and refund after holding it guilty of deficiency in service over a serious breach of guest privacy involving a pregnant woman.The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chennai (North), in its December 16 order, found that a housekeeping staff member unlawfully entered an occupied room using a master key while the complainant and her husband were inside the washroom, causing severe mental trauma and humiliation.The complainant, a Chennai-based advocate, had booked a premium “Grand Room with Lake View” at the Leela Palace, Udaipur, for Rs 55,500 on a non-refundable basis for a one-day stay in January 2025 to celebrate her husband’s birthday and their baby-moon. The commission noted that despite the room being occupied, a housekeeping associate entered the room within seconds of ringing the bell, relying on internal standard operating procedures.Rejecting the hotel’s defence, the commission held that internal SOPs cannot override a guest’s fundamental right to privacy, particularly in a five-star hotel charging premium tariffs. It observed that entry using a master key within less than a minute was unreasonable and unsafe, especially when the washroom was in use.The commission relied on contemporaneous evidence, including WhatsApp communications with hotel officials, apology letters issued by the housekeeping staff and hotel management on the same day, and photographs showing a broken washroom door and a non-functional CCTV camera outside the room. It said these documents supported the complainant’s version and disproved the hotel’s claim that there was no immediate protest.The court also criticised the hotel’s conduct after the incident, citing delays in sharing CCTV footage, misleading assurances, and harassment at checkout, when the complainant and her husband were made to wait for hours and their luggage was withheld. The complainant’s pregnancy, the commission said, aggravated the trauma and imposed a higher duty of care on the hotel.Holding the hotel liable, the commission ordered refund of the full room tariff of Rs 55,500 with 9% interest from January 26, 2025, Rs 10 lakh as compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, and Rs 10,000 towards litigation costs, to be paid within two months.","Chennai consumer court orders luxury hotel The Leela Palace, Udaipur, to pay more than Rs 10.65 lakh in compensation and refund.

‘Remarkable features’: ASI prepares for deeper digs to trace Krishna’s ancient Dwarka; aims to explore unexamined areas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/remarkable-features-asi-prepares-for-deeper-digs-to-trace-krishnas-ancient-dwarka-aims-to-explore-previously-unexamined-areas/articleshow/126460464.cms,"TOI







AHMEDABAD: Dwarka, the ancient Gujarat coastal town closely associated with the legend of Lord Krishna and home to the revered Dwarkadhish Temple, is set to witness renewed rounds of archaeological excavations, both on land and underwater, senior officials of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have said. The proposed work aims to explore previously unexamined areas using modern technology to gain a deeper understanding of the region’s historical and cultural past.Underwater archaeological excavations at Dwarka were last carried out between 2005 and 2007, while limited exploratory studies were conducted again in 2025.According to ASI officials, the upcoming phase will be more extensive and systematic. Alok Tripathi, additional director-general of ASI, toldthat new areas at Beyt Dwarka and unexplored underwater zones will be covered by the agency’s Underwater Archaeology Wing (UAW).“Dwarka has been under study for nearly 40 years, but the work so far has been limited in scope and objectives. We are now examining the other side of the mouth of the Gomti river,” Tripathi said.Experts said modern tools and technology would be deployed to enable larger and deeper excavations in the Arabian Sea. Tripathi himself was part of the five-member UAW team that conducted underwater exploratory work at Dwarka in Feb last year.During that time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also dived underwater off Dwarka coast to view submerged remains discovered on the seabed, drawing national attention to the site.On land, the focus will beon relatively undisturbed areas of Beyt Dwarka. Earlier excavations were largely concentrated near the cliff area. “We are now going deeper inside the forest area, where we have observed signs of a significant settlement. The site has some remarkable features, and excavations at lower levels could reveal important details about settlement planning, economic activities, arts and crafts, and the way of life of the inhabitants,” Tripathi said.The site has attracted attention alike due to the legend of the sunken city of Dwarka, believed to be founded by Lord Krishna. TheASI website indicates that explorations were carried out to understand the submerged archaeological remains off the coast of Dwarka as sculptures and stone anchors were found during low tide in coastal areas.The excavations so far have yielded many antiquities, including terracotta objects, beads, fragmented bangles, copper rings, iron ingots and pottery among others, according to the ASI website.Apart from Dwarka, the ASI has also initiated excavations at other key sites in Gujarat. Work has begun at Valabhipur, the ancient capital located in Bhavnagardistrict, and at Lothal, the Harappan-era site renowned for its water structure believed to be among the world’s oldest dockyards. With the upcoming National Maritime Heritage Complex near Lothal, archaeologists are exposing a larger area of the site using advanced tools and techniques. Tripathi emphasised that archaeology goes beyond excavation. “Our task is to place findings in perspective and fill gaps in historical understanding,” he said, adding that India’s use of technology in archaeology is on par with global standards and increasingly relies on interdisciplinary approaches.Gujarat has seen significant archaeological activity over the past decade, including extensive ASI-led excavations at Vadnagar in Mehsana district, PM Modi’s hometown, uncovering evidence of continuous habitation over two millennia. The state is also home to major Harappan sites such as Dholavira, now a Unesco World Heritage Site, and Lothal, highlighting Gujarat’s rich and layered archaeological heritage.","Dwarka, the ancient Gujarat coastal town, is set to witness renewed rounds of archaeological excavations, both on land and underwater.

MUMBAI: BJP candidate Makrand Narwekar , brother of state assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar, is among the richest candidates in the forthcoming BMC elections , with assets worth Rs 124 crore declared in his affidavit.The 47-year-old two-time corporator, listed as an advocate in his affidavit, purchased 27 land parcels in Alibaug between Oct 2022 and Nov 2025. “Everything is shown in my affidavit. I would only like to say this is a live example of India shining,” he told TOI .With infrastructure projects such as the Atal Setu, RoRo ferry to Alibaug, the value of these holdings has suddenly gone up, said Narwekar, whose assets were listed as Rs 6.32 crore in 2017 and Rs 3.67 crore in 2012.Around 35% of the candidates contesting the BMC elections are crorepatis. His sister-in-law Harshita Narwekar, who is contesting from ward 225, has declared assets worth Rs 63.62 crore — up from Rs 10.74 crore in 2017. Close behind is Sana Abbas Qureshi with Rs 60.3 crore. Contesting from Kalina on a Samajwadi Party ticket, Qureshi says the collapse of the area pushed her into politics.“This is my first election,” she said. “My family runs schools.But I realised that if you want change, you cannot only complain — you have to be a part of it.” Every lane, she says, carries its own catalogue of neglect. “Sanitation is a mess. Toilets don’t even have doors. We need better hospitals, better schools. The problems are visible everywhere,” she added.Another affidavit drawing attention is that of Samadhan Sarvankar, son of former MLA Sada Sarvankar, who is seeking a second term as corporator. Sarvankar has declared assets of Rs 46.59 crore, up from Rs 9.43 crore he reported in 2017. Of this, Rs 40.59 crore is listed under immovable assets. Meanwhile, his sister, Priya Sarvankar, who is contesting from Dadar Shivaji Park, has declared assets of Rs 12.16 crore. Former mayor Shraddha Jadhav, the first female mayor from the Shiv Sena from 2009-2012, has assets worth Rs. 46.34 crore.Independent candidate Ashok Gupta, a pan vendor from Bandra, has declared assets of Rs 1.6 crore. Gupta says he worked for years for Sharad Pawar’s party but was denied a ticket, prompting him to contest as an independent. “I want to work to make Mumbai a better city,” says Gupta, who assets include an SRA house worth Rs 1 crore, some savings and his wife’s jewellery.And then, there are candidates like Khandu Nana Khandekar, a rickshaw driver from Mankhurd–Govandi, whose affidavit carries no such heft. “When auto drivers stand for elections, they go door-to-door touching people’s feet,” he said. “But after they get elected, they behave like kings. I am not like that. I will never become that. So, people will vote for me.”",BJP candidate Makrand Narwekar is among the richest candidates in the forthcoming BMC elections.

Mathematics with real-world impact



Securing the quantum future

Indian-origin mathematician Nalini Joshi has been named New South Wales’ Scientist of the Year, becoming the first mathematician to receive the state’s top science honour in Australia. The recognition highlights her pioneering work in applied mathematics and its growing importance in addressing complex scientific and technological challenges, from climate modelling to secure digital communications.The award places a spotlight on the often unseen role mathematics plays in modern life, with Joshi’s research helping to shape advances in fields such as fibre-optic technology, nonlinear physics and emerging quantum systems.Nalini Joshi is a world-leading applied mathematician and a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Sydney, where she currently serves as Chair of Applied Mathematics. She made history as the first woman appointed Professor of Mathematics at the university, a milestone widely seen as a breakthrough for gender representation in Australian academia.Her research is internationally recognised in the field of integrable systems, a branch of mathematics that studies complex nonlinear equations.These equations are essential for describing real-world phenomena that do not behave in simple or predictable ways, including fluid flows, wave motion and optical systems.Although rooted in theory, Joshi’s work has had wide practical influence. Integrable systems play a crucial role in fibre-optic communications, which form the backbone of the internet and global data networks, as well as in climate science, where advanced mathematical models help scientists understand highly sensitive and chaotic environmental systems.Colleagues often note that her research demonstrates how abstract mathematics can drive innovation across disciplines, even when its contributions remain largely invisible to the public.In recent years, Joshi has increasingly focused on the implications of quantum computing, particularly in the area of cryptography. Cryptography is the science of keeping information secure so that only authorised people can access it. It is what protects online banking, digital payments, emails, messaging apps and government systems by scrambling data into coded forms that are extremely difficult to break.While quantum computers promise major advances in areas such as drug discovery and materials science, they also pose a serious risk to today’s cryptographic systems. Powerful quantum machines could potentially crack many of the encryption methods currently used to protect financial systems and digital infrastructure.Joshi has warned that governments and industries are not sufficiently prepared for this shift. She has highlighted Australia’s limited number of specialists capable of developing post-quantum cryptography, new encryption techniques designed to withstand quantum attacks, and has argued that long-term investment in advanced mathematics is essential.“Mathematics is central to securing our quantum future,” she has said.The New South Wales Scientist of the Year award also acknowledges Joshi’s broader contributions as a leader, mentor and advocate for science. She has been a strong voice for strengthening mathematical education and research capacity, and for recognising mathematics as a foundational discipline that enables progress across science and technology.",Nalini Joshi has been named New South Wales’ Scientist of the Year.

Iran Burns As Protests Explode, Regime Elites Quietly Seek French Exit: Report

Dubai suspends key flight paths to Iran

Airline Status Impacted Cities flydubai 6 Flights Cancelled Tehran (IKA), Shiraz (SYZ), Mashhad (MHD) Emirates Transit Suspended Passengers starting from other cities cannot board for Iran. Air Arabia Reviewing Schedule Expect delays or short-notice cancellations for Sharjah routes.

The ""Transit Rule""

Why your flight was cancelled?

What travellers should do?

Check flight status before leaving for the airport: Airlines and airport authorities recommend confirming your scheduled flight online or via the airline’s app.

Stay updated with official notifications: Airlines often send updates via email or SMS, ensure your booking contact information is current.

Prepare for possible rebooking or refund: If a flight is cancelled, passengers usually qualify for free rebooking, changes, or full refunds under airline policies when cancellations are initiated by the carrier.

Monitor travel advisories: Government travel warnings and airspace updates may influence airline operations and security protocols, check with official sources before planning.





In a swift response to shifting regional dynamics, Friday, January 9, 2026, became a day of unexpected ""grounding"" for hundreds of travelers. At least six major flights scheduled to depart from Dubai to various Iranian hubs were abruptly cancelled.According to data from the Dubai Airports website, these cancellations aren't just minor delays; they represent a cautious, safety-first response to ""heightened regional uncertainty"" and ongoing civil unrest within Iran.The atmosphere at Dubai International (DXB) remains calm but busy as ground staff work to reroute passengers. For the ""common traveler,"" this means the usual hop across the Gulf has become a waiting game. These disruptions follow a pattern seen across the Middle East this week, where airlines like Turkish Airlines also scrapped seven flights to Tehran, signaling a broader industry-wide pivot toward caution as regional stability fluctuates.The cancellations have primarily targeted the most popular gateways into Iran. If you are flying with flydubai, a total of six flights have been officially removed from today's schedule.Emirates has taken a different approach, focusing on its transit network to manage the flow of passengers during this volatile window.For those traveling from London, Paris, or New York with a connection in Dubai to Iran, the rules have changed overnight. Emirates has officially stated that customers transiting through Dubai with a final destination in Iran, Iraq, or Jordan will not be accepted for travel at their original point of departure.This is a strategic move to prevent thousands of travelers from becoming ""stranded"" inside Dubai International Airport (DXB). If your ticket starts outside the UAE, your journey will likely be paused at your home airport until the regional safety assessment is cleared.The decision is purely a precautionary measure driven by ""heightened regional uncertainty"" and the need to ensure airspace safety. The primary driver behind today's cancellations is a massive wave of civil unrest sweeping through Iran.Since late December 2025, a sudden 30% devaluation of the Iranian Rial and soaring inflation sparked protests that have now spread to over 150 locations across 27 provinces, including Tehran, Isfahan, and Mashhad.This isn't just a local protest; it has evolved into a significant political challenge.Protesters have been seen chanting slogans like ""Not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran,"" expressing frustration over the government's focus on regional proxy conflicts while the domestic economy struggles.For airlines, flying into major cities where street battles and ""debris-strewn roads"" are being reported on state TV poses a high operational risk for both crews and passengers.If you’re planning to travel between Dubai (or other UAE airports) and Iran, here’s what you should do:Flight cancellations between Dubai and Iran highlight the importance of staying informed, checking live flight updates, and planning flexible travel arrangements. While some flights are resuming as airspace reopens, schedules can still be affected by regulatory decisions and safety precautions.

Why Jensen Huang believes being Nvidia CEO is a ‘great responsibility’

“great responsibility”

“We are the captain of this industry and we have supply chain partners and collaboration partners all over the world who are counting on us to do our part. So there is a great responsibility that comes with our company. It took us 34 years to get here. We're getting good at it. If you do something for 34 years, you can figure it out,”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has revealed he has no plans to step down from his position at the company anytime soon. He noted that he will remain in charge for now. During a question-and-answer session at CES, 62-year-old Huang said this in response to shareholders' questions about his future at the chipmaker. Huang has led Nvidia since he started the company in 1993. He said he currently has no plans to leave his role, while the company has yet to announce who may replace him in the coming days.Huang attributed his long tenure to his continued interest in the company’s operations and his ability to meet performance expectations.

He noted that the AI chipmaker's performance will not just affect the tech industry but will also impact the entire market.he explained.Huang and Nvidia will have a lot of work to do in the coming years. At CES, Huang announced Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin superchip, which will begin shipping later this year. The company also announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to develop self-driving technology that will compete with Tesla's Autopilot.The Vera Rubin platform, which is named after American astronomer Vera Rubin, who changed how scientists understand galaxy motion, was one of the biggest highlights. It promises to train AI 10 times more efficiently than its previous version, Blackwell. According to Huang, a 10 trillion-parameter model can now be trained in one month using one-quarter of the chips.Huang noted.Huang has been Nvidia's CEO since 1993. He took the company from a stock price of just pennies per share between 1999 and 2016 to more than $187 today, making it the most valuable company in the world.His tenure has been much longer than that of most other tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook (14 years), Meta's Mark Zuckerberg (22 years), and Tesla's Elon Musk (who founded SpaceX in 2002).Born in Taipei in 1963, Huang moved to the US at age nine after his parents sent him to study there. Due to a mistake, he ended up at a tough school in rural Kentucky, where he did chores like cleaning toilets and helped his roommate learn to read.He finished high school at 16, studied electrical engineering, and worked night shifts at a diner to support himself. In 1993, Huang co-founded Nvidia at a Denny’s restaurant.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ However, he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

What FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said about the SpaceX approval

“This FCC authorisation is a game-changer for enabling next-generation services. By authorising 15,000 new and advanced satellites, the FCC has given SpaceX the green light to deliver unprecedented

satellite broadband capabilities

, strengthen competition, and help ensure that no community is left behind.”

“We find that authorisation for additional satellites is in the public interest, even as the Gen2

Starlink

Upgrade satellites remain untested on orbit. We defer authorisation of the remaining 14,988 proposed Gen2 Starlink satellites, including satellites proposed for operations above 600 km,”





The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has authorised SpaceX to expand its satellite network to enhance global internet and mobile connectivity. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the US government agency recently approved a request from the rocket company to deploy 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites. This authorisation will increase the total permitted number of satellites to 15,000 and will allow the company to operate across five different frequencies to increase network capacity and coverage.The expanded satellite constellation is also intended to support direct-to-cell connectivity and provide internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, the Reuters report claims. According to the FCC, the additional hardware will facilitate mobile services outside the US while providing supplemental coverage within the country. As per the report, the agency relaxed earlier regulations that limited overlapping coverage, enabling more reliable service.In a statement to Reuters, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said,The Reuters report noted that SpaceX had applied for permission to deploy close to 30,000 satellites, but the FCC said it is currently approving only 15,000 of them.the FCC noted.The FCC has even ordered SpaceX to launch 50% of its approved Gen2 satellites, put them in their assigned orbits, and operate them by December 1, 2028.SpaceX must launch the remaining satellites by December 2031. It must also complete the deployment of all 7,500 first-generation satellites into orbit by late November 2027.Last week, Starlink said it would start moving its satellites to lower orbits in 2026. The satellites currently orbiting at around 550 km (342 miles) will be lowered to 480 km. This move is meant to improve space safety.In December, Starlink said one of its satellites had a problem in space that created a small amount of debris. The company lost communication with the spacecraft, which was orbiting at 418 km. This kind of accident is rare for the satellite internet company.SpaceX has become the world's largest satellite operator through Starlink, a network of about 9,400 satellites that provide broadband internet to consumers, governments, and businesses.The FCC's former head, Jessica Rosenworcel, demanded more competition for SpaceX's Starlink in 2024. She pointed out that at the time, Starlink was in charge of almost two-thirds of all operational satellites.","The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has authorised SpaceX to expand its satellite network to enhance global internet and mobile connectivity.

Bill Gates pens the year 2026 note; says: Thing I am most upset about is ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-pens-the-year-2026-note-says-thing-i-am-most-upset-about-is-/articleshow/126450754.cms,"Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Here’s Bill Gates annual 2026 letter in full

Optimism with footnotes

As we start 2026, I am thinking about how the year ahead will set us up for the decades to come.

I have always been an optimist. When I founded Microsoft, I believed a digital revolution powered by great software would make the world a better place. When I started the

Gates Foundation

, I saw an opportunity to save and improve millions of lives because critical areas like children’s health were getting so little money.

In both cases, the results exceeded my expectations. We are far better off than when I was born 70 years ago. I believe the world will keep improving—but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time.

Friends and colleagues often ask me how I stay optimistic in an era with so many challenges and so much polarization. My answer is this:

I am still an optimist because I see what innovation accelerated by artificial intelligence will bring.

But these days, my optimism comes with footnotes.

The thing I am most upset about is the fact that the world went backwards last year on a key metric of progress: the number of deaths of children under 5 years old. Over the last 25 years, those deaths went down faster than at any other point in history. But in 2025, they went up for the first time this century, from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025—an increase driven by less support from rich countries to poor countries.

This trend will continue unless we make progress in restoring aid budgets.

The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools. Yet I remain optimistic about the long-term future. As hard as last year was, I don’t believe we will slide back into the Dark Ages.

I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress.

The key will be, as always, innovation. Consider this: An HIV diagnosis used to be a death sentence. Today, thanks to revolutionary treatments, a person with HIV can expect to live almost as long as someone without the virus. By the 2040s, new innovations could virtually eliminate deaths from HIV/AIDS.

Budget cuts limit how many people benefit from lifesaving tools, as we saw to devastating effect last year. But nothing can erase the fact that for decades we didn’t know how to save people from HIV, and now we do.

Breakthroughs are a bell that cannot be unrung. They ensure that we will never go back to the world in 2000 where over 10 million children died from preventable causes every year—and they form the core of my optimism about where the world is headed.

But as I mentioned, there are footnotes to my optimism. Although the innovation pipeline sets us up for long-term success, the trajectory of progress hinges on how the world addresses three key questions.

1. Will a world that is getting richer increase its generosity toward those in need?

The “golden rule” precept is more important now than ever with the record disparities in wealth. This idea of treating others as you wish to be treated does not just apply to rich countries giving aid. It must also include philanthropy from the wealthy to help those in need—both domestically and globally—which should grow rapidly in a world with a record number of billionaires and even centibillionaires.

Through the Giving Pledge, I get to work with a number of incredible philanthropists who set a great example by giving away substantial portions of their wealth in smart ways. However, more needs to be done to encourage higher levels of generosity from the rich and to show how fulfilling and impactful it can be.

More needs to be done to encourage higher levels of generosity from the rich and to show how fulfilling and impactful it can be.

Turning to aid budgets for poor countries, I am worried about one number: If funding for health decreases by 20 percent, 12 million more children could die by 2045. I know cuts won’t be reversed overnight, even though aid represented less than 1 percent of GDP even in the most generous countries. But it is critical that we restore some of the funding. The foundation’s Goalkeepers report lays out what is at risk and how the world can best spend the aid it gives.

I will spend much of my year working with partners to advocate for increased funding for the health of the world’s children. I plan to engage with a number of communities, including health care workers, religious groups, and members of diaspora communities to help make this case.

2. Will the world prioritize scaling innovations that improve equality?

Some problems require doing far more than just letting market incentives take their course.

The first critical area is climate change. Without a large global carbon tax (which is, unfortunately, politically unachievable), market forces do not properly incentivize the creation of technologies to reduce climate-related emissions.

Yet only by replacing all emitting activities with cheaper alternatives will we stop the temperature increase. This is why I started Breakthrough Energy 10 years ago and why I will continue to put billions into innovation.

The world has made meaningful progress in the last decade, cutting projected emissions by more than 40 percent. But we still have a lot of innovation and scaling up to do in tough areas like industrial emissions and aviation. Government policies in rich countries are still critical because unless innovations reach scale, the costs won’t come down and we won’t achieve the impact we need.

If we don’t limit climate change, it will join poverty and infectious disease in causing enormous suffering, especially for the world’s poorest people.

Since even in the best case the temperature will continue to go up, we also need to innovate to minimize the negative impacts.

This is called climate adaptation, and a critical example is helping farmers in poor countries with better seeds and better advice so they can grow more even in the face of climate change. Using AI, we will soon be able to provide poor farmers with better advice about weather, prices, crop diseases, and soil than even the richest farmers get today.

The foundation has committed $1.4 billion to supporting farmers on the frontlines of extreme weather.

I will be investing and giving more than ever to climate work in the years ahead while also continuing to give more to children’s health, the foundation’s top priority. The need to ensure money is spent on the most important priorities was the topic of a memo I wrote in the fall.

A second critical area where the world must focus on innovation-driven equality is health care.

Concerns about healthcare costs and quality are higher than ever in all countries.

In theory, people should feel optimistic about the state of health care with the incredible pipeline of innovations. For example, a recent breakthrough in diagnosing Alzheimer’s will revolutionize how we test for—and ultimately prevent—this disease, saving billions of dollars in costs. (Funding Alzheimer’s research is a particular focus for me.)

There’s similar progress on obesity and cancer, as well as on problems in developing countries like malaria, TB, and malnutrition.

Despite so much progress, however, the cost and complexity of the system means very few people are satisfied with their care. I believe we can improve health care dramatically in all countries by using AI not only to accelerate the development of innovations but directly in the delivery of health care.

Like many of you, I already use AI to better understand my own health. Just imagine what will be possible as it improves and becomes available for every patient and provider. Always-available, high-quality medical advice will improve medicine by every measure.

We aren’t quite there yet—developers still have work to do on reliability and how we connect the AI to doctors and nurses so they are empowered to check and override the system.

But I’m optimistic we will soon begin to scale access globally. I am following this work so the Gates Foundation and partners can make sure this capability is available in the countries that need it most—where there aren’t enough medical personnel—at the same time it is available elsewhere.

We are already working on pilots and making sure that even relatively uncommon African languages are fully supported.

Governments will have to play a central role in leading the implementation of AI into their health systems.

This is another case where the market alone won’t and can’t provide the solution.

A third and final area I will mention briefly is education. AI gives us a chance for the kind of personalized learning to keep students motivated that we have dreamed of in the past. This is now a focus of the Gates Foundation’s spending on education, and I am hopeful it will be empowering to both teachers and students. I’ve seen this firsthand in New Jersey, and it will be game changing as we scale it for the world.

All three of these areas—climate, health, and education—can improve rapidly with the right government focus. This year I will spend a lot of time meeting with pioneers all over the world to see which countries are doing the best work so we can spread best practices.

3. Will we minimize negative disruptions caused by AI as it accelerates?

Of all the things humans have ever created, AI will change society the most. It will help solve many of our current problems while also bringing new challenges very different from past innovations.

When people in the AI space predict that AGI or fully humanoid robots will come soon and then those deadlines are missed, it creates the impression that these things will never happen. However, there is no upper limit on how intelligent AIs will get or on how good robots will get, and I believe the advances will not plateau before exceeding human levels.

The two big challenges in the next decade are use of AI by bad actors and disruption to the job market.

Both are real risks that we need to do a better job managing. We’ll need to be deliberate about how this technology is developed, governed, and deployed.

In 2015, I gave a TED talk warning that the world was not ready to handle a pandemic. If we had prepared properly for the Covid pandemic, the amount of human suffering would have been dramatically less. Today, an even greater risk than a naturally caused pandemic is that a non-government group will use open source AI tools to design a bioterrorism weapon.

We’ll need to be deliberate about how AI is developed, governed, and deployed.

The second challenge is job market disruption. AI capabilities will allow us to make far more goods and services with less labor. In a mathematical sense, we should be able to allocate these new capabilities in ways that benefit everyone. As AI delivers on its potential, we could reduce the work week or even decide there are some areas we don’t want to use AI in.

The effects of this disruption are hard to model. Sometimes, when a game-changing technology improves rapidly, it drives more demand at lower cost and, by making the world richer, increases demand in other areas. For example, AI makes software developers at least twice as efficient, which makes coding cheaper while also creating demand elasticity for code. (Computing is a good historical example where lower costs actually caused the overall market to grow.

)

Even with this complexity, the rate of improvement is already starting to be enough to disrupt job demand in areas like software development. Other areas like warehouse work or phone support are not quite there yet, but once the AIs become more capable, the job disruption will be more immediate.

We’re already starting to see the impact of AI on the job market, and I think this impact will grow over the next five years. Even if the transition takes longer than I expect, we should use 2026 to prepare ourselves for these changes—including which policies will best help spread the wealth and deal with the important role jobs play in our society.

Different political parties will likely suggest different approaches.

By including these footnotes, particularly the last one, some readers may find my continued optimism even more surprising. But as we start 2026, I remain optimistic about the days ahead because of two core human capabilities.

The first is our ability to anticipate problems and prepare for them, and therefore ensure that our new discoveries make all of us better off. The second is our capacity to care about each other. Throughout history, you can always find stories of people tending not just to themselves or their clan or their country but to the greater good.

Those two qualities—foresight and care—are what give me hope as the year begins. As long as we keep exercising those abilities, I believe the years ahead can be ones of real progress.





Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has written his annual letter for 2026, expressing a rare and “upsetting” shift in global progress. While maintaining long-term optimism, Gates revealed that a critical metric of human health has moved backward: child mortality. Gates noted that the trend will continue unless we make progress in restoring aid budgets.In his annual letter titled, “Optimism with footnotes”, Gates highlighted that for the first time since 2000, the number of deaths for children under the age of five increased, rising from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025. He also noted that while AI-driven innovation in health and climate is accelerating, the “trajectory of progress” is currently under threat by multiple factors: dwindling generosity, climate and health equality and AI disruptions.Gates remains confident that the “innovation pipeline” will eventually spark a new era of progress.","Gates: I believe the world will keep improving, but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time.

"Chhattisgarh: Rid of Red Terror, Bastar villagers seek Naxal-free tag",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/chhattisgarh-rid-of-red-terror-bastar-villagers-seek-naxal-free-tag/articleshow/126461274.cms,"





RAIPUR: Consigned to live in the shadow of Red Terror for years, several villages across the insurgency-hit Bastar division are now voluntarily approaching the Chhattisgarh government, seeking to be officially declared 'Naxal-free' under the Ilwat panchayat (neat & clean) scheme.The sudden surge in proposals has prompted the state Home department to prepare a clear standard operating procedure (SOP) to determine which gram panchayats genuinely qualify, as officials warn that the scheme must not be diluted by rolling it out in areas that were never affected by Left-wing Extremism.Over the past two days, deputy chief minister and home minister Vijay Sharma travelled through Sukma, Bijapur and Narayanpur, meeting sarpanches, ward members and traditional community heads. During these interactions, several panchayats expressed their willingness to be evaluated for Ilwat status - a declaration that brings with it a Rs 1-crore development grant and priority execution of village-level works.Officials say the number of villages stepping forward is far greater than what the state had anticipated when the model was introduced last year.The Ilwat panchayat scheme, conceptualised under the govt's Niyad Nella Nar initiative, recognises villages where Maoist presence has ended and residents have fully returned to civilian life.Two villages in Sukma—Badesatti and Kerlapendra—have already been certified Naxal-free under this model.Now, the five villages of Bastar division has proposed the same to the home minister and Shara has asked the sarpanch and village representatives of Ketulnar Petha, Mangapetha, Rani Bodli, Ambeli and Darbha—to begin the formal process by passing gram sabha resolutions.Bastar range inspector general of police Sundarraj Pattlingam said that there were more than 1,800 gram panchayats in the Bastar division, not every village can or should qualify.""The first key criterion is that the village must have been historically Naxal-affected. “If a village in a relatively calmer belt like Keshkal sends a proposal, it cannot be considered. Ilwat panchayat is a conflict-to-peace transition model; only genuinely impacted areas will be eligible,"" Sundarraj told TOI.He added that the second criterion is the absence of recent Maoist activity—typically, no violence, recruitment, threats or sighting of armed cadres for several months, ideally close to a year. A third requirement is demonstrable community effort: preventing recruitment, providing information on Maoist movement, or facilitating the surrender of cadres from the same village. In several cases, such community-led actions are expected to weigh strongly in favour of the proposal.The most sensitive question before the govt is how to treat villages where a resident cadre remains active elsewhere.Now, as the insurgency weakens further, home minister Sharma has indicated that relaxations may be applied if the top cadres have stopped visiting the village altogether.Under the Ilwat framework, the first step rests with the village. The gram sabha must pass a resolution declaring that no Maoist remains in the village and no resident is involved in the Maoist organisation. The resolution then goes to the district collector and is jointly verified by the district administration and the police. The verification process, officials estimate, can take two to three months.Even if a stray Maoist throws a pamphlet into the village, police said the larger pattern of peace will matter more than an isolated provocation.The govt is now drafting a detailed SOP that lays out scheduled dates for gram sabhas, submission windows for proposals, checklists for verification teams, and reviewing the Naxal-free tag if any future Maoist activity emerges. Officials also stress that legal action will be taken if a village, after certification, is later found to be involved in Maoist recruitment or sheltering cadres, though chances for such a thing are bleak.Bastar IG Sundarraj Pattlingam mentioned that the “Ilwat Panchayat” scheme, introduced as part of its broader strategy to address LWE, is a community-driven initiative aimed at empowering erstwhile LWE-affected gram panchayats to formally declare that none of their residents are any longer associated with any kind of Maoist activities.Panchayats achieving this status become eligible for special development assistance of up to ₹1 crore for infrastructure and welfare works such as roads, drinking water, electricity, education, and healthcare, thereby reinforcing peace and development at the grassroots level.As LWE is now facing rapid extinction, an increasing number of villages are coming forward to avail the benefits of this scheme by passing resolutions in their respective gram panchayats declaring the absence of any active Maoist presence within their jurisdiction. Such resolutions are subjected to careful scrutiny and verification based on police records and relevant documents before further action is taken under the scheme.During his Bastar tour, Sharma told community leaders—gayta, sirha, pujari, baiga and others—that “violence and development cannot go together”, urging them to persuade any youth still in the forests to return and accept rehabilitation.",The Ilwat panchayat scheme recognises villages where Maoist presence has ended and residents have fully returned to civilian life. Officials warn that the scheme must not be diluted by rolling it out in areas that were never affected by Left-wing Extremism. Two villages in Sukma have already been certified Naxal- free under this model.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126461311,imgsize-11178,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/bastar-range-inspector-general-of-police-sundarraj-pattlingam-said-that-there-were-more-than-1800-gram-panchayats-in-the-bastar-division-not-every-village-can-or-should-qualify.jpg"
"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
