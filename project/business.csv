NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi has not paid maintenance charges of about Rs 63 lakh for his flat at Gokul Apartments in Malabar Hill, Mumbai, news agency ANI reported, quoting a society member on Monday.The member told ANI that Choksi owns three units in the building – on the 9th, 10th, and 11th floors – and has not paid maintenance for more than seven years.""He has seven years of maintenance due. He has three units– 9th, 10th, and 11th floors. The 11th floor is a terrace, he has illegally occupied it. There are maintenance dues of around Rs 63 lakh without interest. In 2020, our condominium had renovation work done, the cost per unit came to Rs 30-35 lakh, so if you add the cost of three units, it will be around Rs 95 lakh,"" the society member was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.""Big trees have started growing in the flat and the roots will definitely damage the structural integrity of the building. This is an additional burden that we have to bear without any fault of ours. We have faith in the legal system of India, ED officials, and we hope we will get the dues,"" he added.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had earlier attached the property.Earlier on Monday, the Belgian Federal Public Service of Justice confirmed that Mehul Choksi was arrested on April 12 and is currently in detention. The department also said that India has submitted a request for his extradition.At least two open-ended arrest warrants, issued by a special court in Mumbai in 2018 and 2021, have been shared by the Indian agencies with their Belgian counterparts as part of the extradition request, the sources said.Choksi, aged 65, left India on January 2, 2018. He is wanted by the CBI and the ED in connection with a case involving alleged fraud of Rs 13,850 crore at Punjab National Bank (PNB). Hisnephew, Nirav Modi is also accused in the same case.According to investigators, between 2014 and 2017, Choksi worked with his associates and some PNB officials to obtain letters of undertaking (LoU) and foreign letters of credit fraudulently, causing a loss of Rs 6,097.63 crore to the bank.The ED has attached or seized assets worth Rs 2,565.90 crore in the case against Choksi and the court has allowed ""monetisation"" of all these properties.","Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi has not paid maintenance charges of about Rs 63 lakh for his flat in Mumbai.

Emphasising how the use of advanced technology and modern means of communication have made crimes borderless, Amit Shah on Monday said the use of forensic science is crucial for speedy investigation and improving the conviction rate from the current 54% to, say, 94% in a few years. Addressing AllIndia Forensic Science Summit 2025, Shah said PM Modi was farsighted to visualise the growing importance of forensic sciences four years before the enactment of three new criminal laws, as he had set up NFSU in 2020. Stating that seven NFSU campuses have since been established in different states, with nine more coming up in next six months and 10 at the proposal stage, Shah said these will together churn out 36,000 trained forensic experts every year.","Amit Shah said the use of forensic science is crucial for speedy investigation.

Karnataka bid to breach 50% quota cap awaits tough judicial test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-bid-to-breach-50-quota-cap-awaits-tough-judicial-test/articleshow/120293178.cms,"Karnataka CM siddaramaiah

NEW DELHI: Any decision taken by the Karnataka government on increasing reservation on the basis of its caste census for socially and educationally backward communities and those who are inadequately represented will have a tough time passing judicial muster, as many such laws framed by other states have failed.Though Supreme Court, while upholding Centre's decision to provide 10% quota for economically weaker sections (EWS) by a 3-2 majority, had said ""50% cap on quota is not inflexible and inviolable for all times to come"", the controversial issue cannot be said to have been authoritatively adjudicated with the majority verdict adding a rider that the cap applied only to SC/ST/OBC reservation and the dissent verdict of two judges refusing to go into the issue of the cap as the matter was pending in court for adjudication in case of Tamil Nadu.""Reservation for EWS of citizens up to 10%, in addition to the existing reservations, does not result in violation of any essential feature of the Constitution and does not cause any damage to the basic structure of the Constitution on account of breach of the ceiling limit of 50% because that ceiling limit itself is not inflexible and in any case, applies only to the reservations envisaged by Articles 15(4), 15(5) and 16(4) of the Constitution,"" the majority verdict penned by Justice Dinesh Maheshwari had said.In a dissent note, Justice Ravindra Bhat had said he was not going into the question of violation of 50% rule as it was the principal ground of challenge on the validity of Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act, 1993, which was pending in court. ""The view of the members of this bench constituting the majority - that creation of another class which can be a recipient of up to 10% of reservation, over and above 50%, which is permitted under Articles 15(4) or 16(4), in my considered opinion, therefore, has a direct bearing on the likely outcome in the challenge in that proceeding,"" he had said.In a note of caution, Justice Bhat said if the ambit of reservation kept increasing, then the right to equality would be reduced to right to reservation and the observations of B R Ambedkar had to to be kept in mind that reservations were to be seen as temporary and exceptional or else they would ""eat up the rule of equality"".In a landmark judgment in Indra Sawhney case in 1992, SC had held that 50% quota shall be the rule and can be increased only in case of extraordinary situations ""inherent in the great diversity of this country and the people"".In recent years, many state govts attempted to breach the cap but they failed to pass judicial muster. On the basis of a caste census's findings, Bihar govt increased quota for reserved classes from 50% to 65%. However, Patna high court last year declared the law unconstitutional and the appeal against the HC ruling is pending in the SC which refused to stay the order.Chhattisgarh govt had also amended reservation rules, slashing the quota for Scheduled Castes by 4% (16% to 12%) and raising reservation for Scheduled Tribes by 12% - from 20% to 32%. OBC reservation was kept unchanged at 14%, taking the total reservation to 58%. But the HC in 2022 quashed the decision for breach of the cap.","Supreme Court upheld Centre's decision to provide 10% quota for economically weaker sections (EWS) by a 3-2 majority.

Comments being misrepresented: Hassan

NEW DELHI: Jharkhand minister Hafizul Hassan ignited a massive political firestorm on Monday after the JMM leader said he prioritises Shariat over Constitution, and claimed that a Muslim ""keeps the Quran in his heart and the Constitution in his hand"".The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lashed out at Hassan calling his comments ""a blatant insult"" to Indian democracy.""For those who have Sharia in their hearts, the doors to Pakistan and Bangladesh are open. India will run only under the Constitution of Baba Saheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar and will remain supreme,"" the Jharkhand unit of BJP said in a post on X.Zubin Ashara, who serves as the state media co-head of Gujarat BJP, further accused the INDIA bloc of being packed with ""people who treat religious law as superior to the very foundation of our nation.""""A minister like Hassan Ansari saying Sharia outweighs the Indian Constitution is not boldness, it's a blatant insult to our democracy. INDI Alliance seems packed with such mindset people who treat religious law as superior to the very foundation of our nation,"" he said.On Sunday, Hassan speaking about the ongoing Waqf protests across the country said that a Muslim ""keeps the Quran in his heart and the Constitution in his hand.""Hassan, who serves as the minority affairs minister in the JMM-led government, accused the Central government of targeting Muslims in order to ""send them to jail.""“Waqf is not a new concept – it has existed for 1,400 years and continues today. Shariat is bigger for me. We keep Quran in our heart and the Constituion in our hand. A muslim keeps the Quran in his heart and Constitution in his hand. So we will first hold the Shariat and then the Constituion,” he said while speaking to a local news channel.He labelled the Waqf Act a “political stunt” by BJP, warning that within the next six months, the Centre would introduce laws targeting Christians and tribal communities. Hassan's comments come as the country is witnessing widespread protests with the agitation in West Bengal leading to over 150 arrests.“Muslims sabr mein hai kabr mein nahi (muslims are patient, but not dead),” Hassan said, adding, “If they push us too far, it will lead to massive unrest both in the country and globally.”Reacting to Jharkhand Minister Hafizul Hassan, BJP MP Manish Jaiswal hit out, saying such comments undermine India’s secular foundation. Jaiswal said Hassan should have taken office swearing on Shariat if he didn’t intend to uphold the Constitution, adding that India is a nation where people of all faiths coexist. He warned that allowing leaders to prioritise religious law over the Constitution could lead to anarchy.""I would also like to advise people who elect such people that this country runs on the Constitution. People with different faiths live here. If a Hindu or Christian says that this individual works as per Shariat and we won't listen to him, then there would be anarchy in the country. This is a secular nation which runs as per the Constitution,"" he said.Responding to criticism over his remark Hassan clarified that his words were being misrepresented. Hassan stressed that as a minister, he believes in and functions according to the Constitution, while also recognising the place of Shariat.""I did not say 'main' (I), I said 'hum' (we). Watch the full statement. I am a minister, 'hum' includes everyone. A minister believes in the Constitution and functions in accordance. Shariat too has its own place,"" the minister said.""People keep Lord Hanuman in their heart...it's a way of saying. I said something similar. Everyone is distorting it and presenting it. You will find out, when you watch the entire 5-6 minutes of what I said,"" he added.On 5 April, President Droupadi Murmu approved the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, and the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2025, both passed during the budget session.The amendment bill aims to modernise waqf property management, streamline surveys, registrations, and dispute resolution, and empower stakeholders. However, it has triggered backlash, with parties like Congress, AIMIM, and AAP challenging it in the Supreme Court. They argue the bill could adversely affect waqf oversight.","Jharkhand minister Hafizul Hassan ignited a massive political firestorm on Monday.

'Choksi's arrest is a

very big

achievement': India

'Choksi's human rights will be affected if extradited,' says his lawyer

NEW DELHI: The Belgian federal public service of justice on Monday confirmed that India has filed an extradition request for fugitive Mehul Choksi , who has been arrested in Belgium for his involvement in the Rs 13,000 crore PNB bank loan ""fraud"" case.The Belgian federal public service of justice said, ""Mehul Choksi was arrested on Saturday, April 12, 2025. He is being detained in anticipation of further judicial proceedings. Access to his legal counsel has been assured. The Belgian Federal Public Service of Justice can confirm that the Indian authorities have introduced an extradition request for Choksi.""Choksi, 65, was taken into custody by Belgian authorities on Saturday (April 12) after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) requested his extradition. He had been living in Antigua since fleeing India in 2018, and was recently traced to Belgium, where he had reportedly gone for medical treatment.Choksi is the second main accused in the PNB scam after his nephew, Nirav Modi, who is currently in a London prison and is also fighting extradition to India.Sources said that although the Interpol Red Notice against Choksi was deleted some time ago, Indian agencies have been actively pursuing his extradition. Two arrest warrants issued by a Mumbai special court in 2018 and 2021 were shared with Belgian authorities as part of the request.Formal extradition procedures are currently underway, and Choksi may seek bail on health grounds. His lawyer, Vijay Agarwal, confirmed the arrest and said that Choksi is currently in a Belgian prison.""At the moment, he is in prison and there (Belgium), the procedure is not to apply for bail but file an appeal. During that appeal, request is made that he should not be kept in detention and he should be permitted to defend himself and oppose the extradition request while not being in custody,"" Agarwal said, adding that their legal defense will also highlight concerns about prison conditions in India and claim the case is politically motivated.Choksi, his company Gitanjali Gems, Nirav Modi, their associates, and some PNB officials were booked by the CBI and ED in 2018 for allegedly cheating the bank. The scam involved the fraudulent issuance of Letters of Undertaking (LOUs) and Foreign Letters of Credit (FLCs), causing massive financial losses.The CBI has filed two charge sheets against Choksi, while the ED has submitted three prosecution complaints in connection with the case.Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal on Monday called the arrest of Choksi a ""success"" for India's diplomatic efforts.""Look, our external affairs minister has said clearly, and I will also repeat it. The government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has had successful diplomacy, which is part of the foreign policy. Because of successful diplomacy only we can do this work (extradition). This is a proud moment for India,"" Meghwal said during a program paying tribute to BR Ambedkar.Following Choksi's arrest, minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary lauded the move, calling it a ""very big achievement.""""Prime Minister Narendra Modi had already said that those who have looted the money of the poor will have to return it. And action is being taken against such people in the country. Mehul Choksi has been arrested; it is definitely a very big achievement,"" Chaudhrary said.Meanwhile, Choksi's lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, said that his ""human rights"" will be ""greatly affected"" if he is extradited back to the country.""His human rights will be greatly affected,"" Aggarwal said. ""That's a procedure. Basically, we will be defending it on two grounds. It is a political case and, secondly, because of the human condition in India,"" he added.","Fugitive Mehul Choksi has been arrested in Belgium for his involvement in the Rs 13,000 crore PNB bank loan ""fraud"" case.

India has successfully demonstrated its capability to neutralise fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon system, marking a significant milestone in the nation's defense technology.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) developed this directed-energy weapon (DEW), which is now ready for production and deployment across various military platforms.With this achievement, India joins an elite group of countries, including the United States, China, and Russia, that possess advanced laser weapon capabilities.DRDO chairman Dr Samir V Kamat said: ""This is just the beginning of the journey. The synergy that this lab has achieved with other DRDO labs, industry and academia, I am sure we will reach our destination soon...

Israel is also working on similar capabilities, I would say we are the fourth or fifth country in the world to demonstrate this system,"" he added.The 30-kilowatt laser weapon system is designed to counter aerial threats such as drones and helicopters within a range of 5 kilometers.It features advanced electronic warfare capabilities, including jamming communication and satellite signals.Its versatility allows it to be adapted for both ground-based and shipborne applications, enhancing India's defense readiness across multiple domains. The system is equipped with a 360-degree Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor for precise targeting and can be rapidly deployed via air, rail, road, or sea.Dr BK Das, Director General (Electronics & Communication System) DRDO, said: ""For the first time, we are showing a technology in use and its devastation. This shows how far we are going in our technology maturity... What you saw is a completely indigenous product of many DRDO laboratories working in synergy with startups, academic institutions and industries. We are confident that we are going to reach high power very soon... We are planning to deploy similar systems with slight modifications on ships to prove the capability.""Dr Jagannath Nayak, director of the Centre for High Energy System, and Sciences (CHESS), DRDO said: ""Whatever we have achieved today is a great success, and we have seen that we have neutralised fixed-wing aircraft at long range and then we have also seen that we have neutralised swarm drone... with the laser weapon, we can neutralise multiple targets. So, this is one of the new and emerging weapon systems. It is a massless weapon and the concentration of laser light falls on the target and neutralises it. So this is an achievement for our country and DRDO.""India's efforts in directed-energy weapons extend beyond the 30-kilowatt system.The DRDO is also developing more powerful systems, such as the 300-kilowatt "" Surya "" laser weapon, which boasts an operational range of 20 kilometers.This system is designed to target high-speed aerial threats like missiles and unmanned aerial systems (UAS), further strengthening India's position in modern warfare.

2008 Mumbai Terror Attacks Plotter Tahawwur Rana Extradited To India To Face Trial | Watch

NEW DELHI: 26/11 mastermind Tahawwur Rana is currently being interrogated daily for up to ten hours by National Investigation Agency (NIA) over his alleged role in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks , news agency PTI reported citing sources. Rana arrived in New Delhi on Thursday following his extradition from the United States.The NIA aims to uncover a wider conspiracy behind the attacks, which killed 166 people and injured over 230.Rana is being held in a high-security cell at the NIA headquarters in Delhi's CGO Complex. According to PTI sources, he has been cooperating with investigators led by Chief Investigating Officer Jaya Roy. So far, Rana has requested a pen, some paper or a notepad, and a Quran—all of which have been provided.He has raised no special food demands and is being given standard meals as per protocol.As per PTI sources, the 64-year-old Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman, is being held in a high-security cell at the anti-terror agency’s CGO Complex office. He is under constant guard and is being interrogated based on evidence collected during the agency's investigation, including a large number of phone calls with co-conspirator David Coleman Headley.The Delhi court granted the NIA 18 days of custody, stressing the gravity of the charges and the national security threat they pose. The court also directed medical check-ups every 48 hours and permitted Rana to meet his lawyer, following due legal process and the conditions outlined in the extradition agreement.Rana faces multiple charges including conspiracy to commit murder, waging war against India, and planning terrorist acts under the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). These charges stem from his alleged involvement with David Coleman Headley, a key figure in the Mumbai attacks who is currently imprisoned in the US.The NIA believes Rana may provide crucial information about reconnaissance visits to various Indian cities before the 2008 attacks and about his communication with operatives of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror group. Investigators are also examining potential links between Rana and senior figures in terror outfits such as LeT and Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami (HuJI), along with suspected involvement of Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI officers.The court said that the case has international dimensions, with multiple Indian cities identified as potential targets. It also pointed out the need to confront Rana with key witnesses, documents, and forensic evidence.","Tahawwur Rana arrived in New Delhi on Thursday following his extradition from the United States.

Maharashtra stipend for 8L Ladki beneficiaries cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-stipend-for-8l-ladki-beneficiaries-cut/articleshow/120290515.cms,"Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis

MUMBAI: The state govt has reduced the stipend of eight lakh beneficiaries of its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana because they were also receiving benefits under another govt scheme, the Namo Shetkari Mahasanman Nidhi (NSMN).The eight lakh women will receive a payout of Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,500 per month because they already receive Rs 1,000 under Namo Shetkari programme. The Ladki Bahin scheme stipulates that its beneficiaries can avail of other govt schemes only if the benefit is capped at Rs 1,500 per month.This is part of state's move to scrutinise beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahin scheme and to restrict the stipend only to those who fit the eligibility criteria.In Oct, state had around 2.63 crore applicants for the scheme. The scrutiny process reduced that figure by 11 lakh to 2.52 crore beneficiaries by Feb. The final stipend went to 2.46 lakh in Feb & March.""There has been an ongoing scrutiny. First to scan the applications that were sent by the districts to the state headquarters. And then to re-scrutinise the eligible cases,"" an official said.CM Devendra Fadnavis earlier said he expects the number of beneficiaries to reduce by 10-15 lakh after the scrutiny process. ""We're not changing criteria or funding, just ensuring only eligible ones get the stipend,"" he said.The state govt is scrutinising Ladki Bahin beneficiaries on the basis of five key criteria. The beneficiaries have to be within the age limit of 18-65 years, and they must be domiciled in the state. Their family income limit has to be within Rs 2.5 lakh per year. Those with a four-wheel vehicle and a member of the family in a govt job are excluded from the scheme. Those who receive benefits from other govt schemes can do so as long as the combined benefit is within Rs 1,500 per month.The state is under pressure to control its purse strings while keeping its key programmes going. The state's debt projection is 9.3 lakh crore for 2025-26. The outlay for the Ladki Bahin scheme was reduced from 46,000 crore to 36,000 crore in the 2025-26 budget.","The eight lakh women will receive a payout of Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,500 per month.

Can President be forced to seek Supreme Court opinion on a bill?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-president-be-forced-to-seek-supreme-court-opinion-on-a-bill/articleshow/120290271.cms,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: Can Supreme Court force the President to approach SC under Article 143 of the Constitution seeking its opinion on constitutionality of a bill ? This is one of the key questions that has emerged on a closer study of the SC's recent judgment on the President's powers regarding bills passed by state legislatures.Article 201 of the Constitution does not prescribe a time limit or warrant the President to provide a reason for withholding assent to a bill reserved for her by governors. But a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan asked the President to do what is not mandated by the Constitution - to specify elaborate reasons for withholding assent to a bill or returning it to the state legislature.SC also appeared to have stepped into the legislative process, that includes assent of the President, when it said, ""We are also of the view that a bill appearing to be unconstitutional must be assessed by a judicial mind. The President is not just precluded but constitutionally expected to refer the question of vires of a bill to this court as the apex judicial institution to ascertain the constitutionality thereof and accordingly enable President to act in respect of the said bill under Article 201."" This has raised eyebrows as there is no concept of 'advance ruling' in constitutional litigation, as is available under the GST and income tax laws. ""We are of the considered view that constitutional courts are not precluded from making suggestions or giving opinion about constitutional validity of a bill before the same becomes a law,"" the court said, inserting itself into a process that is hardly its domain.Teaching prudence to the President, SC said she ought to ""seek an opinion under the said provision in respect of bills that have been reserved for consideration of the President on grounds of perceived unconstitutionality...President's recourse to Art 143 also palliates any apprehensions of bias or mala fides in the central govt's approach to bills reserved under Article 200"".Article 143 makes no mention of bills or the question of constitutionality. It provides: ""If at any time it appears to the President that a question of law or fact has arisen, or is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of SC upon it, he may refer the question to that court for consideration and the court may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report to the President its opinion thereon."" SC judgment said ""where the bill upon becoming law would be a peril to democracy, the decision of the President must be guided by the fact that it is the constitutional courts that have been conferred with the ultimate authority of interpretation of the Constitution and the laws"", its remarks seemingly reflecting the assumption that the Union, its law ministry and top law officers lacked understanding of the intricacies of the Constitution and were incompetent to tender proper advice in a matter involving intricate play of constitutional provisions.""It is expected that the Union executive should not assume the role of the courts in determining the vires of a bill and should, as a matter of practice, refer such a question to the Supreme Court under Article 143. We have no qualms in stating that the hands of the executive are tied when engaging with purely legal issues in a bill and only the constitutional courts have the prerogative to study and provide recommendations as regards the constitutionality of a bill,"" the bench said, knowing full well that the SC's opinion under Article 143 is not binding on the govt.There are 28 states and if five bills passed every year by each state legislature are reserved for the President by the governor on grounds of its constitutionality, then going by the court's reasoning, President ought to seek the opinion of SC on all 140 bills, a law ministry source said.For the record, the President had sought SC's opinion in 2004 on the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act which annulled water sharing agreements with neighbouring states. SC gave its opinion 12 years later in 2016.","Supreme Court asked President to specify elaborate reasons for withholding assent to a bill or returning it to the state legislature.

NAVI MUMBAI/ PUNE: An Olive Ridley turtle tagged in 2021 has become the first recorded instance of the endangered species traveling over 3,500km from Odisha's eastern coast to Maharashtra's Konkan coast. Tagged with ID number '03233' at Gahirmatha beach in Odisha, the turtle crossed two ocean basins to reach Guhagar in Ratnagiri, where it laid 120 eggs in 2025, of which 107 hatched.Dr Basudev Tripathy, scientist at Zoological Survey of India, explained that in 2021, ZSI researchers tagged over 12,000 Olive Ridley turtles at Gahirmatha. While these turtles typically return south to Sri Lanka after nesting, turtle '03233' made a rare journey to Arabian Sea, nesting in Maharashtra. This discovery challenges previous theories that turtles on east and west coasts were distinct populations, showing that their nesting sites might be interconnected. Tripathy emphasised the importance of conserving nesting grounds on both coasts.Dr Suresh Kumar of Wildlife Institute of India suggested that the turtle might have exhibited a dual reproductive strategy, nesting in Odisha and then traveling to Maharashtra for additional nesting. The turtle's migration has reshaped researchers' understanding of Olive Ridley migration patterns.Researchers continue to monitor turtle '03233', aiming to gather more insights into Olive Ridley turtle populations and migration patterns.","Turtle '03233' was tagged in 2021 at Gahirmatha beach in Odisha.

The penalties include Rs 5 crore on Google India and Rs 45 lakh collectively on three officials.On Jan 11, 2019, the appellate tribunal for Fema cases in Delhi stayed penalties, noting Google India's appeal prospects favourable. ED challenged this through second appeals.ED alleged violations under Fema Sec 6(3)(d), involving Rs 364 crore in transactions, specifically distributor fees to Google Ireland and equipment purchases from Google US. The agency noted that Rs 363 crore owed to Google Ireland remained unpaid for over four years until May 2014, while Rs 1 crore in assets from Google US stayed outstanding for over seven years until Jan 2014. These, it claimed, were commercial loans requiring RBI approval.Google India argued these were not foreign exchange borrowings under Fema, as there were no loan agreements, no deferred payments, and no interest involved. It cited compliance with RBI's circular dated July 1, 2014.A division bench of Justices V Kameshwar Rao and S Rachaiah said the tribunal's stay was only a prima facie view and directed the respondents to furnish bank guarantees for 50% of the penalties within two weeks.",Karnataka HC has directed Google India and three of its top officials to submit 50 per cent of the penalties imposed on them for alleged Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema) violations in the form of bank guarantees.

Despite the dismal performance in the field right now, Bryant’s 9-year-long career in the MLB has blessed him with all things upscale and intriguing.Let’s explore the luxurious lifestyle, net worth, endorsements, and other interesting facts about the Rockies’ star who could make only 37 appearances last season and is yet to return to his peak form.A significant part of Kris Bryant’s net worth is contributed by his earnings from his baseball career, which are reported to be $163,020,737 by Spotrac.

Blue Origin space flight launches with all-female crew including Katy Perry | AFP

The Blue Origin rocket carrying pop superstar Katy Perry , journalist Gayle King, and Jeff Bezos’ fiancee Lauren Sanchez successfully launched from West Texas, marking the company’s 11th human flight. The all-female crew also included former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights advocate Amanda Nguyn, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.The sub-orbital flight lifted off from West Texas just after 8:30am (local time) and lasted around 10 minutes. The fully automated mission took the crew more than 100km above Earth, past the Karman line—the internationally recognised boundary of space—where the women experienced a few moments of weightlessness.This marks Blue Origin’s 11th human spaceflight and the first all-woman space mission since Valentina Tereshkova’s solo flight in 1963. The mission adds Perry to the list of high-profile Blue Origin passengers, including Star Trek actor William Shatner.Ahead of the flight, Perry spoke about how she had been preparing mentally by reading works by Carl Sagan and diving into astrophysics. “I've always been interested in the stars. We’re all made of stardust,” she said. She added that the mission was about more than space travel — it was about breaking boundaries and inspiring young girls to dream big. “You're brave, you're bold… No limitations,” she said, reflecting on her internal pep talks before training.The pop icon, known for space-themed songs like E.T. and Firework, said the mission aligns with her interest in STEM and women’s empowerment. “Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she added, referring to her daughter Daisy.Blue Origin described the flight as a historic moment for women in space , with the mission patch reflecting each woman’s contributions and symbols of their legacies. The New Shepard astronauts soar toward space at speeds exceeding three times the speed of sound.","Blue Origin rocket carrying Katy Perry and all-female crew reaches edge of space, returns safely.

In an uncanny case of fiction overlapping with reality, gamers and political observers alike are drawing parallels between the storyline of Call of Duty : Black Ops II—a military-themed video game released in 2012—and the current trade and diplomatic standoff between the United States and China in the year 2025. What once seemed like a purely speculative plot about futuristic warfare and international cyberconflict now appears to mirror ongoing global developments with surprising precision. The similarities extend beyond general themes of geopolitical rivalry; specific plot points, economic triggers, and even calendar dates portrayed in the game have stunned the public and sparked widespread conversation across social media. With global trade relations in flux and international security concerns mounting, the apparent foresight shown in Black Ops 2 is being reexamined not just by fans but by those analyzing the complexities of present-day international relations.Released in November 2012, Call of Duty: Black Ops II marked a significant departure from previous entries in the franchise by venturing into a near-future setting. The game toggles between the late 1980s and the year 2025, featuring a new form of Cold War involving advanced technology, cyberweapons, and autonomous military drones.The central antagonist, Raul Menendez, orchestrates a cyberattack on China’s stock market, triggering a worldwide economic crisis. In retaliation, the fictional Chinese government halts exports of rare earth elements—a vital component for global electronics and military equipment—effectively weaponizing its monopoly on these resources. The crisis rapidly escalates, resulting in heightened tensions between the United States and China, placing the two superpowers on the brink of a second Cold War. The game’s storyline further intensifies with drone warfare, hijacked military systems, and a global battle for control over digital and economic infrastructures.As of April 2025, geopolitical events involving the United States and China bear a striking resemblance to this storyline. As per reports, former US President Donald Trump has recently announced a sweeping set of tariffs on global imports, framed as ""reciprocal measures"" against trade imbalances. While many nations face a tariff rate of 10%, China has been specifically targeted with rates as high as 84%, with indications that this figure could rise to 125% in the near future.This dramatic escalation in trade barriers closely mirrors the game's depiction of economic warfare. In addition, mounting discussions about rare earth supply chains and China's control over these resources have surfaced, echoing the fictional embargo that catalyzed the game’s global conflict.Perhaps most remarkably, Black Ops 2 places the onset of its fictional war on April 19 and 20, 2025—dates that are now just days away. Social media users have taken notice, widely circulating screenshots from the game showing these specific dates and drawing eerie comparisons to real-world headlines.Across social media platforms, users are expressing amazement—and some concern—at the overlap between the game’s plot and actual developments in global politics. Posts have ranged from humorous takes to serious reflections.One user noted, “It’s 2025 and we’re basically living through the Black Ops 2 campaign in real life.” Another joked, “Trump might’ve taken his foreign policy directly from Black Ops 2.” A more serious comment suggested, “The developers of Black Ops 2 need to be investigated. How did they predict this so accurately?”The viral nature of these posts has turned Black Ops 2 into a surprising focal point of current geopolitical discussions, despite being a 13-year-old video game.A central theme in both the game and today’s geopolitical tensions is the strategic importance of rare earth elements. These 17 metallic elements are essential for manufacturing high-tech devices, electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and advanced weaponry. China currently dominates global rare earth production, accounting for more than 60% of total output and refining capabilities.Any real-world restriction or embargo on rare earth exports, as fictionalized in Black Ops 2, could severely disrupt global supply chains and technological infrastructure—adding economic leverage to diplomatic standoffs. Recent discussions among US and European policymakers have acknowledged the vulnerability of depending on a single source for such critical materials.Another major parallel between the game and real-world developments is the role of cyberwarfare. In Black Ops 2, the antagonist gains control of the US drone fleet through a large-scale digital breach. In reality, cybersecurity concerns have become a central issue in international relations, with numerous cyberattacks targeting government institutions, financial markets, and defense contractors in recent years.Governments across the globe are now actively investing in cyberdefense and cybersecurity infrastructure to protect against threats similar to those envisioned in the game. Artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and digital espionage have all become frontline components of 21st-century military and diplomatic strategy.For those interested in revisiting the game that seems to have foretold elements of today’s geopolitical climate, Call of Duty: Black Ops II is available on:Despite its age, the game remains a cult favorite due to its innovative mechanics, branching narrative structure, and now, its unexpectedly prescient plot.","Gamers and political observers are drawing parallels between the storyline of Call of Duty : Black Ops II and the current trade and diplomatic standoff between the United States and China in the year 2025.

Earthquake of magnitude 4.0 jolts Nepal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/earthquake-of-magnitude-4-0-jolts-nepal/articleshow/120297748.cms,"Representative Image

KATHMANDU, NEPAL: An earthquake of magnitude 4.0 jolted Nepal on Tuesday, a statement by the National Center for Seismology (NCS) said. As per the NCS, the earthquake occurred at a depth of 25km, making it susceptible to aftershocks.In a post on X, the NCS said, ""EQ of M: 4.0, On: 15/04/2025 04:39:02 IST, Lat: 28.76 N, Long: 82.01 E, Depth: 25 Km, Location: Nepal.""Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deeper ones due to their greater energy release closer to the Earth's surface, causing stronger ground shaking and increased damage to structures and casualties, compared to deeper earthquakes, which lose energy as they travel to the surface.Nepal is the 11th most earthquake-prone country in the world. It is situated along the Himalayas, where there is a lot of seismic activity. It is located on a convergent boundary, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. This collision causes stress and strain to build up in the crust, which is eventually released in the form of earthquakes.Nepal is also located in a subduction zone, where the Indian Plate is sliding underneath the Eurasian Plate. This subduction process further increases the stress and strain on the crust, and can also lead to Nepal earthquakes. The collision of these plates is also responsible for the uplift of the Himalayan mountains. This movement generates immense pressure and stress, which can be released as earthquakes.Many buildings in Nepal are made of unreinforced masonry, which is not very strong and can easily collapse in an earthquake. Much of Nepal is remote and mountainous, which can make it difficult to provide relief and assistance in the aftermath of an earthquake.","An earthquake of magnitude 4.0 jolted Nepal on Tuesday, a statement by the National Center for Seismology said.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Read the full letter by the Trump administration

The United States has invested in

Harvard

University’s operations because of the value to the country of scholarly discovery and academic excellence. But an investment is not an entitlement. It depends on Harvard upholding federal civil rights laws, and it only makes sense if Harvard fosters the kind of environment that produces intellectual creativity and scholarly rigor, both of which are antithetical to ideological capture.

Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment. But we appreciate your expression of commitment to repairing those failures and welcome your collaboration in restoring the University to its promise. We therefore present the below provisions as the basis for an agreement in principle that will maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government.

If acceptable to Harvard, this document will constitute an agreement in principle, which the parties will work in good faith to translate into a more thorough, binding settlement agreement. As you will see, this letter incorporates and supersedes the terms of the federal government’s prior letter of April 3, 2025.

● Governance and leadership reforms. By August 2025, Harvard must make meaningful governance reform and restructuring to make possible major change consistent with this letter, including: fostering clear lines of authority and accountability; empowering tenured professors and senior leadership, and, from among the tenured professoriate and senior leadership, exclusively those most devoted to the scholarly mission of the University and committed to the changes indicated in this letter; reducing the power held by students and untenured faculty; reducing the power held by faculty (whether tenured or untenured) and administrators more committed to activism than scholarship; and reducing forms of governance bloat, duplication, or decentralization that interfere with the possibility of the reforms indicated in this letter.

● Merit-Based Hiring Reform. By August 2025, the University must adopt and implement merit-based hiring policies, and cease all preferences based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin throughout its hiring, promotion, compensation, and related practices among faculty, staff, and leadership. Such adoption and implementation must be durable and demonstrated through structural and personnel changes. All existing and prospective faculty shall be reviewed for plagiarism and Harvard’s plagiarism policy consistently enforced. All hiring and related data shall be shared with the federal government and subjected to a comprehensive audit by the federal government during the period in which reforms are being implemented, which shall be at least until the end of 2028.

● Merit-Based Admissions Reform. By August 2025, the University must adopt and implement merit-based admissions policies and cease all preferences based on race, color, national origin, or proxies thereof, throughout its undergraduate program, each graduate program individually, each of its professional schools, and other programs. Such adoption and implementation must be durable and demonstrated through structural and personnel changes. All admissions data shall be shared with the federal government and subjected to a comprehensive audit by the federal government—and non-individualized, statistical information regarding admissions shall be made available to the public, including information about rejected and admitted students broken down by race, color, national origin, grade point average, and performance on standardized tests—during the period in which reforms are being implemented, which shall be at least until the end of 2028. During this same period, the dean of admissions for each program or school must sign a public statement after each admissions cycle certifying that these rules have been upheld.

● International Admissions Reform. By August 2025, the University must reform its recruitment, screening, and admissions of international students to prevent admitting students hostile to the American values and institutions inscribed in the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence, including students supportive of terrorism or anti-Semitism. Harvard will immediately report to federal authorities, including the Department of Homeland Security and State Department, any foreign student, including those on visas and with green cards, who commits a conduct violation. As above, these reforms must be durable and demonstrated through structural and personnel changes; comprehensive throughout all of Harvard’s programs; and, during the reform period, shared with the federal government for audit, shared on a non-individualized basis with the public, and certified by deans of admissions.

● Viewpoint Diversity in Admissions and Hiring. By August 2025, the University shall commission an external party, which shall satisfy the federal government as to its competence and good faith, to audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity, such that each department, field, or teaching unit must be individually viewpoint diverse. This audit shall begin no later than the summer of 2025 and shall proceed on a department-by-department, field-by-field, or teaching-unit-by-teaching-unit basis as appropriate. The report of the external party shall be submitted to University leadership and the federal government no later than the end of 2025. Harvard must abolish all criteria, preferences, and practices, whether mandatory or optional, throughout its admissions and hiring practices, that function as ideological litmus tests. Every department or field found to lack viewpoint diversity must be reformed by hiring a critical mass of new faculty within that department or field who will provide viewpoint diversity; every teaching unit found to lack viewpoint diversity must be reformed by admitting a critical mass of students who will provide viewpoint diversity. If the review finds that the existing faculty in the relevant department or field are not capable of hiring for viewpoint diversity, or that the relevant teaching unit is not capable of admitting a critical mass of students with diverse viewpoints, hiring or admissions within that department, field, or teaching unit shall be transferred to the closest cognate department, field, or teaching unit that is capable of achieving viewpoint diversity. This audit shall be performed and the same steps taken to establish viewpoint diversity every year during the period in which reforms are being implemented, which shall be at least until the end of 2028.

● Reforming Programs with Egregious Records of Antisemitism or Other

Bias

. By August 2025, the University shall commission an external party, which shall satisfy the federal government as to its competence and good faith, to audit those programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.

o The programs, schools, and centers of concern include but are not limited to the Divinity School, Graduate School of Education, School of Public Health, Medical School, Religion and Public Life Program, FXB Center for Health & Human Rights, Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Carr Center for Human Rights at the Harvard Kennedy School, Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, and the Harvard Law School International Human Rights Clinic.

The report of the external party shall include information as to individual facult members who discriminated against Jewish or Israeli students or incited students to violate Harvard’s rules following October 7, and the University and federal government will cooperate to determine appropriate sanctions for those faculty members within the bounds of academic freedom and the First Amendment.

The report of the external party shall be submitted to University leadership and the federal government no later than the end of 2025 and reforms undertaken to repair the problems. This audit shall be performed and the same steps taken to make repairs every year during the period in which reforms are being implemented, which shall be at least until the end of 2028.

● Discontinuation of DEI. The University must immediately shutter all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, offices, committees, positions, and initiatives, under whatever name, and stop all DEI-based policies, including DEI-based disciplinary or speech control policies, under whatever name; demonstrate that it has done so to the satisfaction of the federal government; and demonstrate to the satisfaction of the federal government that these reforms are durable and effective through structural and personnel changes. By August 2025, the University must submit to the government a report—certified for accuracy—that confirms these reforms.

● Student Discipline Reform and Accountability. Harvard must immediately reform its student discipline policies and procedures so as to swiftly and transparently enforce its existing disciplinary policies with consistency and impartiality, and without double standards based on identity or ideology. Where those policies are insufficient to prevent the disruption of scholarship, classroom learning and teaching, or other aspects of normal campus life, Harvard must develop and implement disciplinary policies sufficient to prevent those disruptions. This includes but is not limited to the following:

Discipline at Harvard must include immediate intervention and stoppage of disruptions or deplatforming, including by the Harvard police when necessary to stop a disruption or deplatforming; robust enforcement and reinstatement of existing time, place, and manner rules on campus, including ordering the Harvard police to stop incidents that violate time, place, and manner rules when necessary; a disciplinary process housed in one body that is accountable to Harvard’s president or other capstone official; and removing or reforming institutional bodies and practices that delay and obstruct enforcement, including the relevant Administrative Boards and

FAS Faculty Council.

Harvard must adopt a new policy on student groups or clubs that forbids the recognition and funding of, or provision of accommodations to, any student group or club that endorses or promotes criminal activity, illegal violence, or illegal harassment; invites non-students onto campus who regularly violate campus rules; or acts as a front for a student club that has been banned from campus. The leaders or organizers of recognized and unrecognized student groups that violate these policies must be held accountable as a matter of student discipline and made ineligible to serve as officers in other recognized student organizations. In the future, funding decisions for student groups or clubs must be made exclusively by a body of University faculty accountable to senior University leadership. In particular, Harvard must end support and recognition of those student groups or clubs that engaged in anti-Semitic activity since October 7th, 2023, including the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee, Harvard Graduates Students 4 Palestine, Law Students 4 Palestine, Students for Justice in Palestine, and the National Lawyers Guild, and discipline and render ineligible the officers and active members of those student organizations.

Harvard must implement a comprehensive mask ban with serious and immediate penalties for violation, not less than suspension.

Harvard must investigate and carry out meaningful discipline for all violations that occurred during the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 academic years, including the Harvard Business School protest of October 2023, the University Hall sit-in of November 2023, and the spring encampment of 2024. This must include permanently expelling the students involved in the October 18 assault of an Israeli Harvard Business School student, and suspending students involved in occupying university buildings, as warranted by the facts of individual cases.

The Harvard president and police chief must publicly clarify that the Harvard University Police Department will enforce University rules and the law. Harvard must also commit to cooperating in good faith with law enforcement.

●

Whistleblower Reporting and Protections

. The University must immediately establish procedures by which any Harvard affiliate can report noncompliance with the reforms detailed in this letter to both university leadership and the federal government. Any such reporter shall be fully protected from any adverse actions for so reporting.

● Transparency and Monitoring. The University shall make organizational changes to ensure full transparency and cooperation with all federal regulators. No later than June 30, 2025, and every quarter thereafter during the period in which reforms are being implemented, which shall be at least until the end of 2028, the University shall submit to the federal government a report—certified for accuracy—that documents its progress on the implementation of the reforms detailed in this letter. The University must also, to the satisfaction of the federal government, disclose the source and purpose of all foreign funds; cooperate with the federal government in a forensic audit of foreign funding sources and uses, including how that money was used by Harvard, its agents, and, to the extent available, third parties acting on Harvard’s campus; report all requested immigration and related information to the United States Department of Homeland Security; and comply with all requirements relating to the SEVIS system.

We expect your immediate cooperation in implementing these critical reforms that will enable Harvard to return to its original mission of innovative research and academic excellence.

Harvard letter's full text

For three-quarters of a century, the federal government has awarded grants and contracts to Harvard and other universities to help pay for work that, along with investments by the universities themselves, has led to groundbreaking innovations across a wide range of medical, engineering, and scientific fields. These innovations have made countless people in our country and throughout the world healthier and safer. In recent weeks, the federal government has threatened its partnerships with several universities, including Harvard, over accusations of antisemitism on our campuses. These partnerships are among the most productive and beneficial in American history. New frontiers beckon us with the prospect of life-changing advances—from treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes, to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, quantum science and engineering, and numerous other areas of possibility. For the government to retreat from these partnerships now risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals but also the economic security and vitality of our nation.

Late Friday night, the administration issued an updated and expanded list of demands, warning that Harvard must comply if we intend to “maintain [our] financial relationship with the federal government.” It makes clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner. Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the “intellectual conditions” at Harvard.

I encourage you to read the letter to gain a fuller understanding of the unprecedented demands being made by the federal government to control the Harvard community. They include requirements to “audit” the viewpoints of our student body, faculty, staff, and to “reduc[e] the power” of certain students, faculty, and administrators targeted because of their ideological views. We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept their proposed agreement. The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.

The administration’s prescription goes beyond the power of the federal government. It violates Harvard’s First Amendment rights and exceeds the statutory limits of the government’s authority under Title VI. And it threatens our values as a private institution devoted to the pursuit, production, and dissemination of knowledge. No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.

Our motto—Veritas, or truth—guides us as we navigate the challenging path ahead. Seeking truth is a journey without end. It requires us to be open to new information and different perspectives, to subject our beliefs to ongoing scrutiny, and to be ready to change our minds. It compels us to take up the difficult work of acknowledging our flaws so that we might realize the full promise of the University, especially when that promise is threatened.

We have made it abundantly clear that we do not take lightly our moral duty to fight antisemitism. Over the past fifteen months, we have taken many steps to address antisemitism on our campus. We plan to do much more. As we defend Harvard, we will continue to: nurture a thriving culture of open inquiry on our campus; develop the tools, skills, and practices needed to engage constructively with one another; and broaden the intellectual and viewpoint diversity within our community; affirm the rights and responsibilities we share; respect free speech and dissent while also ensuring that protest occurs in a time, place, and manner that does not interfere with teaching, learning, and research; and enhance the consistency and fairness of disciplinary processes; and work together to find ways, consistent with law, to foster and support a vibrant community that exemplifies, respects, and embraces difference. As we do, we will also continue to comply with Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which ruled that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act makes it unlawful for universities to make decisions “on the basis of race.”

These ends will not be achieved by assertions of power, unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how we operate. The work of addressing our shortcomings, fulfilling our commitments, and embodying our values is ours to define and undertake as a community. Freedom of thought and inquiry, along with the government’s longstanding commitment to respect and protect it, has enabled universities to contribute in vital ways to a free society and to healthier, more prosperous lives for people everywhere. All of us share a stake in safeguarding that freedom. We proceed now, as always, with the conviction that the fearless and unfettered pursuit of truth liberates humanity—and with faith in the enduring promise that America’s colleges and universities hold for our country and our world.

The Trump administration on Monday froze $2.2 billion in grants and $6 million from contracts awarded to Harvard University after the university refused to comply with a series of policy changes proposed by the US President.The Ivy League institution was asked by the government to share its hiring data and to bring in an external party to ensure that each academic department is ""viewpoint diverse.The letter was followed by a detailed statement by the university, in which it acknowledged that while some of the administration's demands aim to combat antisemitism, the majority appear to be attempts to regulate the ""intellectual conditions"" at Harvard.","Harvard must make meaningful governance reform and restructuring to make possible major change consistent with this letter.

Music mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs pleaded not guilty on Monday to two new federal charges of sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution, in a criminal racketeering case set for trial next month.The latest charges, detailed in a superseding indictment, involve a second alleged victim, identified in court documents as "" Victim-2 ."" Combs, 55, appeared in Manhattan federal court to enter his plea, as prosecutors expand the case to now include five criminal counts in total—sex trafficking, racketeering, and prostitution-related charges among them.Prosecutors allege that over two decades, Combs ""abused, threatened, and coerced women and others around him to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation and conceal his conduct."" They further claim he used his business empire and staff to build a criminal enterprise engaged in sex trafficking, forced labour, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.The Grammy-winning artist , long a prominent figure in the hip-hop world, is accused of organizing drug-fueled sex parties and using threats and violence to manipulate victims and silence employees. Combs has denied all charges, maintaining that “any sex acts were consensual.”Judge Arun Subramanian, who is overseeing the case, said during Monday’s hearing, “We are a freight train moving toward trial.” However, Combs’ attorney Marc Agnifilo indicated the defense may request a brief delay, citing the need to review new evidence including emails not previously submitted by a key witness. The judge gave the defense until Wednesday, April 16, to file a written request.The trial is scheduled to begin with jury selection on May 5, though the timeline may shift depending on the court’s decision regarding the delay.Combs has been incarcerated since September 2024, and his legal troubles have deepened amid a growing wave of civil lawsuits and public allegations. The case gained national attention in late 2023 when singer Cassie Ventura accused him of a decade of abuse and rape.Alongside the criminal charges, Combs continues to face a string of civil suits alleging abuse, coercion, and a pattern of misconduct with the assistance of his staff and close associates.","Sean ""Diddy"" Combs pleaded not guilty on Monday to two new federal charges of sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.

Bessent on Trade Talks, Powell Future, Argentina, Dollar

The White House is preparing to begin interviews for a new Federal Reserve Chair this autumn, as Jerome Powell , a Biden appointee's term ends in May 2026. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent confirmed to Bloomberg the timeline during a visit to Argentina, saying it gives the Trump administration a six-month window to plan ahead.The decision comes amid growing political pressure on the Federal Reserve. President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged the Fed to cut interest rates. On 4 April, he posted on Truth Social: “Cut interest rates, Jeroma, and stop playing politics”Despite the criticism, Bessent said there were no plans to remove Powell before his term ends. He also said the Fed’s independence is not under threat. However, Bessent did call for more conversation about the Fed’s regulatory role. “The Fed is one of three bank regulators—the other two being the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC,” he said. “It’s possible to separate monetary policy from regulatory policy.”He also noted there was no sign of panic during his recent visit to the Fed. “It seems like business as usual,” he added.Powell had warned that Trump's new tariffs could lead to slower growth and higher inflation. Speaking in Virginia last week, he said the economy faces “elevated risks” of both rising joblessness and price pressures—challenges that could complicate any decision by his eventual successor.""We face a highly uncertain outlook with elevated risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation,"" he said, undermining both of the Fed's mandates of 2% inflation and maximum employment.",The White House is preparing to begin interviews for a new Federal Reserve Chair this autumn.
