AHMEDABAD: Despite the perilous journey and a series of deaths of illegal Indian immigrants trying to cross the border, the lure of a life in the US, especially among Gujaratis, remains strong.During US FY 2024 - October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024 - 29 lakh illegal immigrants were caught trying to enter the country through Mexico and Canada. Of these, Indians constituted 90,415, US Customs and Border Protection (US-CBP) data shows.Of this total, roughly 50% were from Gujarat, sources in Indian agencies tracking illegal immigration said. It could also be said that 10 Indians were arrested every hour, the sources said. Also, 43,764 were arrested at the US border with Canada, in the north, making it the highest number of Indians caught at this border till now.The data reveals a slight decline from the previous year's total of 32 lakh people, and in the number of Indians caught on the Mexico route . In FY 2023, the number of illegal Indian immigrants caught was 96,917. In 2024, fewer Indians (25,616) were caught at the US-Mexico border; this number in US FY 2023 was 41,770.""People have stopped using the donkey route via Mexico due to two key reasons. One is that they would be kept in Dubai or Turkey for some time before being taken to Mexico. US agencies, over the past few years, have been keeping sharp vigil on illegal immigrants staying in those countries and have broken links in the human smuggling chain,"" a source in the immigration network said.A source said, ""Gujaratis, too, began choosing Canada over Mexico as they could easily hire a taxi and cross over to the US. Recently, US authorities have tightened vigil on this border. Such immigrants are usually sent to Canada as most of them carry a Canadian visitor visa. However, the immigrants try again after some time on the same route.""Sources also said that people caught at the border may be very few compared to those who actually manage to sneak into the US.","During US FY 2024 - October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024 - 29 lakh illegal immigrants were caught trying to enter the country through Mexico and Canada.

Khajuraho Temples: What will you say of Khajuraho temples: Bombay HC to Customs department,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-will-you-say-of-khajuraho-temples-bombay-hc-to-customs-department/articleshow/114561057.cms,"Bombay high court

MUMBAI: Criticising Customs department for confiscating nude artworks of Francis Newton Souza and Akbar Padamsee on the ground that such "" obscene material "" is prohibited for import, Bombay high court asked if Customs officials can apply their own notion of what is obscenity. ""At this rate, what will you say of Khajuraho temples ?"" Justice Mahesh Sonak asked the Customs' advocate.On Monday, a bench of Justices Mahesh Sonak and Jitendra Jain said Souza and Padamsee are world renowned artists. They said ""art ultimately reflects the mores of the society"". It may be good, bad or horrendous to some, ""but the true test of freedom of speech is we are able to appreciate... at least tolerate whatever offends us. Further, a mature society is one that learns to appreciate criticism.""In June and October 2022, three nude drawings of Padamsee and four of Souza, titled 'Lovers', were purchased at auction houses Rosebery's in London and Lyon and Turnbull in Scotland. When they reached Mumbai in April 2023, Customs seized them. The petitioner, B K Polimex India Pvt Ltd, wrote for their release and provided certificates of art galleries Grosvenor in London and Sakshi in India. After a show-cause notice as to why the drawings should not be destroyed and a personal hearing, the July 1 order was passed and Rs 50,000 penalty imposed.The petitioner's advocate Shreyas Shrivastava complained that Customs had ""not even relied on experts' opinion"". Customs' advocate Jitendra Mishra said ""they are prohibited goods falling under the category of obscene material"".When HC enquired if Customs can ban something in terms of obscenity, Mishra said it relied on a 1964 notification issued under the Customs Act that gives power to prohibit import for the purpose of maintenance of public order and standards of decency or morality.Shrivastava then said these drawings are publicly available, and even on National Gallery of Modern Art 's website. The judges recalled the ban on the book, 'Lady Chatterley's Lover', and standards applied by Supreme Court while deciding the matter. ""I don't know if anybody in India could afford it. If they tried to import Michaelangelo's David, you'll say it is obscene? Because it is completely nude. Not even a fig leaf,"" said Justice Sonak.Shrivastava said Souza was awarded the prestigious Guggenheim International Award and Padamsee with Padma Shri.Shrivastava said Souza and Padamsee faced such scrutiny in the past too. In 1979, 62 drawings of Souza's were confiscated by Delhi Customs, adding, ""the matter went up to Parliament...Customs conceded it is not obscene."" Padamsee was tried under IPC 292 (obscenity) and acquitted by a magistrate court.","Customs confiscated nude artworks of Francis Newton Souza and Akbar Padamsee. Justices Mahesh Sonak and Jitendra Jain said ""art ultimately reflects the mores of the society"" The judges recalled the ban on the book 'Lady Chatterley's Lover', and standards applied by Supreme Court.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114561077,imgsize-1028992,width-400,resizemode-4/114561077.jpg"

Recalled envoy Verma's stark warning for parents sending kids to Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/recalled-envoy-vermas-stark-warning-for-parents-sending-kids-to-canada/articleshow/114552680.cms,"Sanjay Verma, Indian envoy recalled from Canada, during an interview with PTI, in New Delhi. (PTI Photo)

NEW DELHI: Indian High Commissioner to Canada, Sanjay Verma , recently expressed deep concerns about the harsh realities faced by Indian students pursuing higher education in Canada. Speaking to PTI, Verma highlighted issues such as substandard living conditions, underemployment , and the rising influence of Khalistani elements in the country.Verma pointed out that many students, who come from well-off families, are often forced to live in cramped spaces, with eight students sharing a single room.Despite their expectations of a promising academic journey, they end up enrolled in institutions that offer minimal classes, leading them to work low-wage jobs just to make ends meet.""A whole week they work at a store, as a daily wager,"" Verma said, referring to students’ reliance on part-time jobs rather than focusing on their education. He added that many students, despite their qualifications, are compelled to take on jobs as cab drivers or other odd roles, diverging from their original aspirations.Verma also raised concerns about the social situation in Canada, particularly the influence of Khalistani elements on young students. He noted that non-Khalistani students are being threatened and even pressured into joining gangs. ""Many innocent children who went there became criminals, gangsters, Khalistani criminals,"" he said, emphasizing that these students are being negatively influenced by local Khalistani groups.The High Commissioner's comments come amid rising tensions between India and Canada, with an increasing number of Indian parents expressing anxiety over their children’s safety and future prospects abroad.","Indian High Commissioner to Canada, Sanjay Verma, recently expressed deep concerns about the harsh realities faced by Indian students pursuing higher education in Canada.

India-Canada ties: 'The onus is on Trudeau to clean up the mess',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-canada-ties-the-onus-is-on-trudeau-to-clean-up-the-mess/articleshow/114546724.cms,"The India-Canada diplomatic spat has escalated to unprecedented levels as New Delhi recalled six of its diplomats including the high commissioner, and expelled as many Canadian envoys. The diplomatic clash started from Canadian PM Justin Trudeau ’s decision to publicly accuse India of being allegedly involved in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Khalistani separatist leader, last year without providing “hard evidentiary proof” to India.Joe Adam George, a national security analyst on South Asia affairs, has put the onus of deteriorating bilateral ties on Canadian PM Trudeau. Writing on the latest diplomatic row in National Post, a Canadian newspaper, George argues that the Trudeau government's handling of the diplomatic spat with India has been misguided and counterproductive. The author contends that instead of tactfully addressing India's concerns about alleged transnational repression activities, Trudeau chose to publicly accuse India without providing sufficient evidence, further straining the already fragile relationship between the two countries.The article highlights the importance of recognizing India's priorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, particularly the country's zero-tolerance policy on issues such as terrorism and separatism. The author points out that India faces unique security challenges due to its geographical location and history, and that the Modi government has taken decisive actions to address these concerns, such as the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.The piece also delves into the issue of Khalistani separatism , which New Delhi alleges is being promoted by extremists in Canada with support from Pakistan. The author argues that by appeasing Khalistani extremists, the Trudeau government is not only undermining Indian interests but also risking the lives of innocent Sikhs who have no interest in the militant movement.“By siding with Khalistani extremists, Ottawa is conflating separatist militancy with legitimate religion and risking the lives of innocent Sikhs,” said George, emphasizing the Trudeau government's failure to recognize the complex history of Khalistan militancy. The UK's Bloom Review, commissioned last year, warned that Khalistani activists have exploited government ignorance, brainwashed youth, and raised funds to support their separatist cause. George points out that Trudeau’s actions are not rooted in ignorance but in “wilful blindness” for partisan gain, despite decades of warnings from New Delhi.""Michael Rubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former Pentagon official, accused Trudeau of sparking an international crisis by “mischaracterizing” and “politicizing” American intelligence to justify his allegations that India had a hand in the Nijjar assassination. Rubin added that Trudeau, like his father, Pierre Trudeau, has not only permitted Khalistan militancy to thrive in Canada but also transformed the country into a hub for terrorism and terror financing,"" the article said.Trudeau's decision to engage in a diplomatic spat with India was a grave error in judgment, irrespective of the purported missteps of the Modi administration. This ill-advised move has unintentionally refocused attention on the Canadian government's leniency concerning international meddling and cross-border criminal activities, which are causing harm to both Canada and its partners, the article added.As per George, Trudeau's actions have served to highlight the very issues he likely sought to downplay, casting a shadow on his administration's ability to effectively address these pressing concerns. The unintended consequences of this diplomatic misstep may have far-reaching implications for Canada's relationships with its allies and its reputation on the global stage.The author concludes by emphasizing India's growing importance in geopolitics and the need for Trudeau to forge a fresh path forward with New Delhi if he expects cooperation in the ongoing investigation.""India is no longer a nominal player in geopolitics. It will let its relationship with Canada disintegrate if it must. The onus is on Trudeau to clean up the mess he created by forging a fresh path forward with New Delhi if he expects it to co-operate in the investigation,"" George said.","The India-Canada diplomatic spat has escalated to unprecedented levels as New Delhi recalled six of its diplomats including the high commissioner, and expelled as many Canadian envoys.

"India, China begin troop disengagement in eastern Ladakh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-china-begin-troop-disengagement-in-eastern-ladakh/articleshow/114559524.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: Indian and Chinese troops have kicked off the process to disengage in phases at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh , even as defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said `a broad consensus’ has been achieved to restore the `ground situation’ in certain areas based on the principles of equal and mutual security.“The dismantling of temporary posts and structures erected at the two face-off sites after May 2020 is now taking place in a controlled manner as part of the modalities worked out by the tactical commanders on the ground,” a source told TOI.“The dismantling and pullback by the rival troops will take around a week or so. The local commanders will then verify it physically on the ground before the coordinated patrolling begins,” he added.As per the new India-China pact on “patrolling arrangements” announced on Monday, Chinese troops will no longer block Indian soldiers at the “Bottleneck” area in the strategically-located Depsang Plains , which is around 18-km inside what India considers its own territory.“Indian troops will also not block Chinese patrols in the region. The two armies will inform each other of the date and time of their patrols in advance to avoid face-to-face confrontations. The aim is to ensure no clashes and violence takes place,” the source said.The Indian side is hopeful that its troops will now be able to go right up to their patrolling points (PPs) 10, 11, 11A, 12, and 13 in Depsang, the crucial table-top plateau located at an altitude of 16,000-feet towards the crucial Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) and Karakoram Pass in the north.Similarly, the disengagement is also underway at the Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok in the south, where the People’s Liberation Army has erected some tents on Indian territory.The new patrolling pact, however, is limited to Depsang and Demchok and does not include the “buffer zones” created earlier in eastern Ladakh. The no patrol buffer zones, varying from 3-km to 10-km largely on the Indian side of the LAC , were created after troop disengagements at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, with the last being established in Sept 2022. “The question of patrolling in the buffer zones will be taken up later,” the source said.In his first comments on the “significant development” in the border imbroglio, Singh said, “India and China have been involved in talks both at diplomatic and military levels to resolve their differences in certain areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Pursuant to the talks, broad consensus has been achieved to restore the ground situation based on the principles of equal and mutual security.”“The consensus achieved includes patrolling and grazing (cattle) in traditional areas. This is the power of engaging in continuous dialogue because sooner or later, solutions will emerge,” he added, speaking at the Army’s Chanakya Defence Dialogue here.While the new pact will lead to disengagement at Depsang Plains and near Demchok, the subsequent process of de-escalation and de-induction of forward deployed troops, which is imperative for the restoration of status quo that existed before April 2020, is still nowhere on the horizon yet.At the event, Singh said ‘development’ and ‘security’ are often viewed from separate perspectives, but are actually deeply interconnected and mutually reinforcing. “Defence spending, military infrastructure and national security can significantly affect economic growth and resource allocation, even in non-war periods or in peacetime,” he said.The govt’s consistent efforts to attain ‘Aatmanirbharta (self-reliance)’ has directly linked the defence sector with the nation’s development. “If defence had been recognised as an integral component of development and studied more comprehensively in the past, India might have achieved self-reliance in the sector much earlier. The prolonged dependency on imports can be attributed, in part, to the lack of a coordinated approach between defence and development,” he said.",Indian and Chinese troops have kicked off the process to disengage in phases at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh.

According to the MoPR this is the first time that localised weather forecasts will be available at the gram panchayat level, supported by IMD’s expanded sensor coverage.Panchayati Raj minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh said connecting gram panchayats to realtime weather forecasting is a “key step towards empowering the Indian economy and enhancing the ease of living for rural populations”. He also highlighted that this will help reduce agricultural losses due to weather uncertainties.Earth sciences minister Dr Jitendra Singh pointed out that this initiative is part of the government’s broader commitment to strengthen the rural economy . “This initiative will also ensure that farmers and common citizens receive timely updates, helping them make informed decisions to improve both productivity and safety,” he added.The forecasts will be disseminated through the Panchayati Raj ministry ’s digital platforms: e-GramSwaraj, which enables efficient governance, project tracking, and resource management; the Meri Panchayat App, which fosters community engagement by allowing citizens to interact with local representatives and report issues; and Gram Manchitra, a spatial planning tool that provides geospatial insights for development projects.“Gram Panchayats will receive daily updates on temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and cloud cover, empowering them to make critical decisions in agriculture, such as planning sowing, irrigation, and harvesting activities,” MoPR highlighted in a statement.“These tools will also strengthen disaster preparedness and infrastructure planning. Furthermore, SMS alerts will be sent to Panchayat representatives regarding extreme weather events like cyclones and heavy rainfall, ensuring immediate action to protect lives, crops, and property,” the ministry explained in the statement.Vivek Bharadwaj, secretary, MoPR, also shared that the ministry is working on a pilot to train locals at the panchayat level to be the first line of response in a disaster situation. MoPR will be collaborating with the National Disaster Management Authority to start a pilot in 27 districts across the country where locals will be trained and provided with some specialised equipment to help create a localised disaster response system at the grassroots.",The initiative is projected by government as a measure for boosting local-level governance and making villages climate-resilient.

Crude Palm Oil: No relief for consumers as global prices of edible oils spike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-relief-for-consumers-as-global-prices-of-edible-oils-spike/articleshow/114559274.cms,"NEW DELHI: Consumers will have to live with the increase in edible oil prices for the next few months as there has been a spike in global prices after the government increased import duties on inbound shipments.Government sources said there is hardly any chance of reducing the import duty and this would continue to help the country move towards self-sufficiency in edible oil.Industry sources also said farmers need to get a good price for oilseeds, and for that, the current regime of import duty needs to continue.The government has increased import duties on crude palm, soybean , and sunflower to 27.5% from 5.5%. The duty on refined edible oil has also been raised to 35.75% from 13.75%.The global prices of crude palm, soybean, and sunflower have risen by approximately 10.6%, 16.8%, and 12.3%, respectively, in the last one month. These three oils constitute the major share of the country's edible oil import basket. At present, India meets around 60% of its edible oil demand through imports.As per Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA), land prices of crude palm, soybean and sunflower on Thursday were $1,145, $1,160 and $1,165 per tonne, respectively. This is an increase of 32%, 18% and 26%, respectively, compared to last year.The data collated by the price monitoring cell of the consumer affairs department show that the modal or most common prices across centres of mustard, sunflower and soybean increased to Rs 181, Rs 148 and Rs 143 per litre, respectively, on Thursday. Before the hike in import duty on Sept 16, the per litre modal prices of mustard, sunflower, and soybean were Rs 135, Rs 126, and Rs 143.Prices of mustard oil have gone up despite India not importing any of it due to increase in prices of other edible oils. “When there is price pressure on the other major edible oils, it’s bound to have an impact on the entire basket,” said a government official. India is the world’s second-largest consumer of edible oil and the biggest importer of vegetable oil.BV Mehta, executive director of SEA, said that while the immediate price rise seems significant, there has been very little change if seen across the past few years. “If we want to make ourselves self-sufficient in edible oil, we have to encourage farmers to bring more areas under oilseeds. That will happen only when farmers get good prices for years and we don’t go for excess import of oil.”","Global prices of crude palm, soybean, and sunflower have risen by approximately 10.6%, 16.8%, and 12.3%, respectively, in the last one month.

NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday attacked Madhabi Puri Buch, the chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ), for her absence from a meeting with the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Thursday. Gandhi alleged that someone was shielding Buch from being accountable to the PAC .""Why is Madhabi Buch reluctant to answer questions before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament? Who is behind the plan to protect her from being answerable to the PAC?"" Rahul Gandhi posted on X.The PAC meeting was postponed due to a ruckus that arose after Buch failed to appear before the committee. According to sources, she was expected to attend the meeting in New Delhi on Thursday. KC Venugopal , the Congress leader who chairs the PAC, informed reporters that Buch had notified him on Thursday morning about her inability to travel to Delhi.""In the first meeting of the committee itself, we decided to have a suo moto subject for review of our regulatory bodies. That is why we called SEBI, today morning for a review of SEBI. The committee branch sends the notice to the concerned people. First of all, they sought an exemption, SEBI chairperson sought an exemption from appearing before the committee which we denied. After that, she confirmed she and her team would be present on this committee... Today morning, she (SEBI chairperson, Madhabi Puri Buch) informed me that she is not in a position to travel to Delhi.

NEW DELHI: Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said the India-China pact that eases border tension between New Delhi and Beijing was the outcome of the ""power of engaging in dialogue "".He said that the consensus between both nations includes ""patrolling, grazing in traditional areas"".""India and China have been involved in talks both at the diplomatic and military levels to resolve their differences in certain areas along the LAC.A broad consensus has been achieved to restore the ground situation based on the principles of equal and mutual security. The consensus achieved includes patrolling and grazing to the traditional areas.

Progress was slow, but a notable development occurred in September 2022 when both sides undertook disengagement along the LAC.Troops were withdrawn from Patrolling Point-15 in the Gogra-Hot Springs area of Eastern Ladakh, which was seen as a crucial step towards de-escalation. The establishment of buffer zones along the LAC provided a framework for potential resolutions.","India and China have been involved in talks both at the diplomatic and military levels to resolve their differences in certain areas along the LAC.

Zero tolerance for terrorism

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar, speaking at the Brics Plus Summit on Thursday, reiterated India's pitch for reforms in the permanent and the non-permanent categories of the UN Security Council Speaking at the 16th Brics summit in Brics plus format in Russia's Kazan , Jaishankar also sought reforms in the multilateral development banks , whose working procedures he said ""are just as outdated as that of the UN"".""By reforming established institutions and mechanisms, especially the UN Security Council in the permanent and the non-permanent categories. So too the multilateral development banks, whose working procedures are just as outdated as that of the UN,"" Jaishankar said.Listing out the five points while advocating for a more equitable global order, S Jaishankar said ""Brics can make a difference for the Global South"".""...How do we create a more equitable global order? First, by strengthening and expanding platforms of an independent nature and by widening the choices in different domains and minimizing undue reliance on those that can be leveraged. This is really where BRICS can make a difference for the Global South. Second, by reforming established institutions and mechanisms, especially the UN Security Council in the permanent and the non-permanent categories. So too the multilateral development banks, whose working procedures are just as outdated as that of the UN. India initiated an effort during its G20 Presidency and we are glad to see Brazil take that forward. Third, by democratizing the global economy through creating more production hubs... Fourth, by correcting distortions in global infrastructure that are a legacy from the colonial era. The world urgently needs more connectivity options that enhance logistics and mitigate risks. This must be a collective endeavour for the common good, with the utmost respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. And fifth, by sharing experiences and new initiatives,"" the minister said at the meeting.Jaishankar also underlined PM Modi's ""not an ear of war"" remark and said ""differences must be settled by dialogue and diplomacy"".""Addressing conflicts and tensions effectively is a particular need of the day. Prime Minister Modi has emphasized that this is not an era of war. Disputes and differences must be settled by dialogue and diplomacy. Agreements, once reached, must be scrupulously respected. International law should be adhered to, without exception and there should be zero tolerance for terrorism,"" he said.Jaisankar on the situation in Middle East said: ""The situation in the Middle East - West Asia for us, is an understandable concern. There is a widespread anxiety that the conflict would spread further in the region. Maritime trade has also been deeply affected.

The Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has sought an explanation from the teacher involved in the paper-setting process after the Urdu paper provided by the board for the Class IX semester I exam came attached with the answer key .This year, following the implementation of the National Education Policy 2020 at Class IX, the class portion has been divided into two semesters.Both the semester-end exam question papers are being provided by the Goa board for the first time, while correction of the answer sheets will be done by the respective schools.On Thursday, during the Urdu exam, the supervisor at a centre in Bicholim found that the question paper provided by the board had the answer key attached to it. The supervisor alerted the board, which in turn alerted all the other centres. There were around 10 students answering the exam from the Bicholim centre and around 250 across the state.After the alert, the answer key was removed, and the question papers were given to the students, and the exam went on smoothly. “The alert came before the question paper could be provided to the students. No student received the answer key due to the alert from the Bicholim supervisor. All question papers were provided to the students across the state after removal of the answer key. However, it is to be investigated how it happened, and we have sought an explanation from the teacher who set the papers. They were clearly instructed that the answer key is to be provided at a later stage by them,” board chairperson Bhagirath Shetye toldThe question paper is provided by the Goa board at designated centres across the state, from where the school head or a senior teacher authorised by the school collects the question paper in the sealed envelope. The envelope is then opened by the supervisor at the exam hall itself, following a protocol akin to that followed at the Goa board Class X and XII public exams to maintain confidentiality.","Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has sought an explanation from the teacher involved in the paper-setting process.

New Delhi: India will not have any representation at the upcoming World wrestling championships in Tirana, Albania.The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) on Thursday decided against sending the team to the prestigious event citing continued government interference. The federation also blamed Bajrang Punia Vinesh Phogat , Sakshee Malikkh and Satyawart Kadian – the prominent faces of the wrestlers’ protest against former WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh – for conspiring to get the national body suspended and putting it in the hands of an administrator.The Worlds is scheduled from Oct 28 to 31.WFI president Sanjay Singh – a close aide of Brij Bhushan – had recently called off a selection trial on Oct 6 and 7 to pick teams for the World under-23 and World championships in non-Olympic weight categories. The Delhi high court ordered that WFI had no jurisdiction to hold trials and that it would only be conducted by an Indian Olympic Association (IOA)-appointed ad-hoc committee.In a letter to United World Wrestling – the sport’s global governing body – Singh alleged that the sports ministry continues to interfere in WFI’s autonomy despite the UWW’s recognition.“The MYAS had ordered WFI on 24th Dec 2023 to cease and desist from discharging the day to day administration of the federation and had directed the IOA (NOC of India) to make an ad-hoc committee for governance of WFI. The IOA continues to support the WFI and dissolved the ad hoc committee on 18th Mar 2024. After that WFI was functioning smoothly.""A case filed in the Indian courts by four wrestlers namely Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik and Satyawart who want an administrator to run the affairs of WFI instead of an elected body in WFI, the Indian court has on 16th Aug 2024 based on the MYAS interference letter directed the IOA to make another ad-hoc committee to run the affairs of the WFI. Though the IOA through its president P T Usha had supported the WFI in the case, it is the MYAS that is the problem creator because of their letter of 24th Dec 2023 which is being used as a tool to interfere in the administration of the WFI by the wrestlers,” Singh wrote in his communication to UWW chief Nenad Lalovic.Singh requested Lalovic to invoke Article 6.3 of its constitution which says UWW’s members “shall govern and administer their activities independently. They shall preserve their autonomy and oppose any political, religious or economic pressures”.“We also request you to forward this letter as a formal complaint to the IOC as the autonomy of the national federation is severely compromised due to constant interference by the MYAS. It is clear that four wrestlers are adamant on getting the WFI suspended no matter what the cost is to all the others,” he wrote.The WFI was suspended by the ministry on December 24 last year soon after the polls were conducted to elect the new office-bearers.","India will not have any representation at the upcoming World wrestling championships in Tirana, Albania.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public. Musk has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-96413764,imgsize-26192,width-400,resizemode-4/96413764.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Unfair Dismissal: UK woman pregnant again after coming back from maternity leave gets fired; later given compensation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-woman-pregnant-again-after-coming-back-from-maternity-leave-gets-fired-later-given-compensation/articleshow/114497195.cms,"Representative Image

A woman who was fired from her job back in 2022 after revealing she was pregnant with her second child has been awarded £28,000 in compensation . Nikita Twitchen , who worked as an assistant at Pontypridd-based building firm First Grade Projects , was made redundant in April 2022 shortly after returning from maternity leave .Twitchen filed an unfair dismissal claim, she told employment tribunal that during her back to office meeting her managing director Jeremy Morgan showed enthusiasm about her return.However, when she informed Morgan at the end of the meeting that she was pregnant again, his attitude changed.Metro UK reported that although they had a good working relationship, Twitchen noticed a shift in communication. When her maternity leave ended in March 2022, no one from the company contacted her about returning to work.After returning from maternity leave in March 2022, Twitchen did not hear from her employer about resuming work. Despite emailing her boss on April 4 regarding her holiday entitlement, she received no reply. She followed up on April 11 and 18, and later that day, her boss informed her that she was being made redundant due to financial difficulties and delays in payments affecting the business.Morgan later informed her that because of a new software installation her role in the company ""would no longer exist.""However, the employment tribunal said that they found no evidence of financial issues or new software, which Morgan claimed had made her role obsolete. Judge Robin Havard said that Morgan had made no mention of these challenges during their earlier discussions, and that the company had since rebranded, hired new employees, and invested in vehicles.The judge determined that Twitchen’s dismissal was both unfair and discriminatory, concluding that her termination was due to her pregnancy. The judge also highlighted that the absence of a written explanation for her redundancy, along with Morgan’s shift in attitude, indicated discrimination.First Grade Projects and Morgan were ordered to pay £28,706 in compensation. The company, a sponsor of Swansea City FC and First Grade Projects said, """"We are deeply disappointed with the tribunal's decision. We are currently reviewing all relevant information and exploring all possible options. At this time, we are unable to provide any further comment.""","Nikita Twitchen worked as an assistant at Pontypridd-based building firm First Grade Projects.

First Category 5 storm in the Pacific without El Niño since 2010

Expected weakening ahead

Hurricane Kristy intensified into a Category 5 storm on Thursday as it churned in the Pacific Ocean , with forecasters expecting it to gradually weaken over the coming days.As of Thursday afternoon, Kristy was located 970 miles southwest of the southern tip of Baja California , Mexico, moving westward at 16 mph (26 kph) with sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).As per USA Today, although Kristy poses no immediate threat to land, the NHC warned that swells generated by the storm are expected to impact parts of the Baja California peninsula’s west coast through the weekend, creating dangerous surf and rip current conditions.Kristy made history as the first Pacific hurricane to reach Category 5 status without the influence of El Niño since Hurricane Celia in 2010.Typically, El Niño conditions, which involve warmer waters and reduced wind shear in the eastern Pacific, contribute to stronger storm formation. However, Kristy defied this trend, further showcasing the unpredictability of the 2024 hurricane season .The storm originated fromTropical Storm Nadine , which made landfall in Belize earlier in October. After Nadine dissipated, its tropical energy moved westward across Mexico and fuelled Kristy’s rapid intensification in the Pacific basin.Kristy joins Beryl and Milton as the third Category 5 storm of 2024, marking an active hurricane season.Kristy is forecast to begin weakening on Friday, with the hurricane expected to lose its Category 5 status as it continues to drift over open waters. The NHC anticipates the storm will downgrade to a tropical depression by the weekend. However, fluctuations in intensity are still possible through Thursday night.The storm is not expected to impact any landmass directly, but its powerful winds and swells will likely create hazardous conditions along the west coast of the Baja California peninsula.As the hurricane season in the Eastern Pacific continues until November 30, forecasters are also monitoring the potential development of La Niña , which could affect future storm activity by increasing wind shear in the Pacific and making it harder for storms to form.","Kristy is the first Pacific hurricane to reach Category 5 without the influence of El Niño since Hurricane Celia in 2010.

Yum! Brands Inc and Burger King removed onions from some of their locations as the restaurant industry investigates an E. Coli outbreak first traced to McDonald’s Corp.Yum withdrew fresh onions from some Taco Bell , Pizza Hut and KFC locations “out of an abundance of caution,” the company said Thursday in a statement to Bloomberg News, without disclosing which stores and regions were affected or naming suppliers.“We will continue following supplier and regulatory guidance to ensure the ongoing safety and quality of our food,” the company said.Burger King said Thursday that it gets some of its onions from a Colorado facility run by Taylor Farms, which supplied the McDonald’s restaurants that have been impacted by the outbreak.Taylor Farms issued a recall of some its yellow onion batches despite finding no traces of E. coli as of Wednesday. Restaurant distributors US Foods Holding Corp and Sysco Corp have also notified customers of the recall.“Despite no contact from health authorities and no indications of illness, we proactively asked our 5% of restaurants who received whole onions distributed by this facility to dispose of them immediately two days ago and we are in the process of restocking them from other facilities,” Burger King said.Fat Brands Inc, owner of restaurants including Johnny Rockets, said it pulled all of Taylor Farms’ fresh onion products.“We have identified an extremely limited number of Buffalo’s Cafe locations and Ponderosa and Bonanza Steakhouses that are currently utilizing Taylor Farms as a supplier for onions,” the company said in a statement Thursday.The restaurant industry is on alert after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that an E. coli outbreak likely tied to pre-slivered onions served on McDonald’s Quarter Pounders sickened dozens of people in the US and killed one. Burger King said it buys whole onions that are cut, peeled and sliced in its restaurants.McDonald’s pulled the popular product from about 20% of its more than 13,000 US restaurants, and it’s working with health authorities to confirm the source of the contamination.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc said in a statement Thursday that it doesn’t source onions from Taylor Farms or any ingredients from the Colorado facility.Inspire Brands Inc, which owns Arby’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, Sonic, Jimmy John’s, Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin’, said its onions don’t come from the facility.
