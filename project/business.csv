'Fanatical mindset': India slams Pakistan in UN over 'unjustified' reference to J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fanatical-mindset-india-slams-pakistan-in-un-over-unjustified-reference-to-jk/articleshow/119029298.cms,"India at UN

NEW DELHI: India raised strong objections against Pakistan's mention of Jammu and Kashmir at the UN General Assembly, emphasising that such statements doesn't substantiate their territorial claims.""As is their habit, the former foreign secretary of Pakistan today has made an unjustified reference to the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir,"" stated India's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador P Harish, during Friday's General Assembly meeting, which was held to observe the International Day to combat Islamophobia.Harish added that that Pakistan's repeated mentions would ""neither validate their claim nor justify their practice of cross-border terrorism "". ""The fanatical mindset of this nation is well known, as also its record of bigotry. Such efforts will not change the reality that Jammu and Kashmir was, is and will always be an integral part of India,"" he declared.This forceful response followed Pakistan's former foreign secretary, Tehmina Janjua's references to Jammu and Kashmir during the informal gathering commemorating the International Day to Combat Islamophobia.The Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations shared further details on the ambassador ""delivering India's statement"". Talking about Islamophobia, Harish added to his statement, ""India stands united with the UN membership in condemning incidents of religious intolerance against Muslims."" ""It is imperative to recognize that religious discrimination is a broader challenge that affects followers of all faiths,"" also said P Harish adding that, ""Any deliberation on issues of faith must seek to unite , not divide.""India's criticism on Pakistan at the UN comes after Pakistan suggested India's involvement in the recent train hijacking in Balochistan, to which the ministry of external affairs (MEA) released a statement, rejecting 'baseless allegations' and asked their neighbour to look inwards for 'its own internal problems.'MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal responded to media queries regarding remarks made by the Pakistan side, saying, ""We strongly reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan. The whole world knows where the epicenter of global terrorism lies. Pakistan should look inwards instead of pointing fingers and shifting the blame for its own internal problems and failures on to others.""Read more: MEA rejects Pakistan’s claim of India's role in train hijacking The attack on the Jaffar Express on March 11, which was carrying more than 450 passengers, led to 58 deaths, comprising 21 passengers, four soldiers, and 33 militants belonging to the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist group.Pakistan regularly claims that India provides support to organisations such as the BLA to foment instability in Balochistan, charges that New Delhi categorically rejects.","Pakistan's former foreign secretary, Tehmina Janjua, made references to Jammu and Kashmir during the informal gathering commemorating the International Day to Combat Islamophobia.

Only days spent in India to decide NRI tax status: ITAT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-days-spent-in-india-to-decide-nri-tax-status-itat/articleshow/119029053.cms,"Mumbai :

The Mumbai Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has ruled in favour of an individual who claimed his tax residential status to be that of a ‘ non-resident ’ as he had spent 210 days on work abroad, reports Lubna Kably.As India does not tax overseas income in the hands of a non-resident, M Gulati did not disclose his overseas income of Rs 1.2 crore for the financial year 2015-16. He contended he had spent less than 182 days in the country and was a non-resident. But I-T claimed that of the 210 days, he had spent 28 days looking for work, and hence a tax resident of India. ITAT made it clear an individual’s tax residential status must be determined solely by the number of days spent in India.The ITAT rejected the contention of the Income-tax (IT) department, which had recomputed Gulati’s stay outside India as it partly comprised of days spent job-hunting. The ITAT order provides clarity on the tax treatment of individuals who split their time between employment and job search abroad. It reinforces that any period spent outside India for employment or in search of employment should be counted towards non-resident status determination.The decision will benefit expatriates who go overseas in search of a job and gain employment.A person who is a tax resident of India has to pay tax on his global income. A non-resident does not pay tax in India on his or her overseas income but only on the income that accrues or arises in India (example: rent from property in India, bank interest, etc).The number of days stayed in India determines the tax residency status.Under provisions of the I-T Act, viz: Explanation 1 to section 6(1), if an individual leaves India for the ‘purpose of employment’ overseas, he or she will qualify as a tax resident only if the stay ‘in India’ is for 182 days or more in a particular year.From financial year 2020-21, the period was reduced to 120 days or more, for those individuals whose total income (other than foreign sources) exceeds Rs 15 lakh.The I-T officer noted Gulati had spent 210 days outside India in the relevant assessment year (AY 2016-17), of which 28 days were in search of employment.He held that only the days of actual employment could be considered. Thus, based on a revised calculation, he held that Gulati had spent more than 182 days in India and was hence a tax resident. Consequently, the overseas salary of Rs 86.2 lakh and interest income of Rs 2.8 lakh would be taxable in India. The Appellate Commissioner upheld the stand of the I-T officer by holding that during the 28-day period, the taxpayer had not received any salary and the adjustment in days was correctly made.However, the ITAT relying on judicial precedents disagreed and overruled the I-T department’s stand. The tax tribunal held that seeking employment abroad also qualifies as a legitimate purpose under Explanation 1 to section 6 (1). An individual’s tax residential status must be determined solely based on number of days spent in India.",M Gulati did not disclose his overseas income of Rs 1.2 crore for the financial year 2015-16. He contended he had spent less than 182 days in the country and was a non-resident. The number of days stayed in India determines the tax residency status.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119029202,imgsize-984713,width-400,resizemode-4/119029202.jpg"
India adds 6 properties to its tentative list for Unesco heritage status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-adds-6-properties-to-its-tentative-list-for-unesco-heritage-status/articleshow/119028404.cms,"NEW DELHI: A set of six properties-including some considered serially, such as Ashokan Edict Sites and Chausath Yogini Temples spread across multiple states-have been added to India's tentative list by Unesco's World Heritage Centre.These sites were added to the list on March 7, the Permanent Delegation of India to Unesco said in a statement. India at Unesco shared the statement on microblogging site X, late on Thursday. Addition to the World Heritage Centre's tentative list is mandatory if a property is to be nominated for inscription to World Heritage List in future, it said.The six properties added to the tentative list include Kanger Valley National Park in Chhattisgarh; Mudumal Megalithic Menhirs in Telangana; serial nomination of Ashokan Edict Sites along the Mauryan Routes (multiple states); serial nomination of Chausath Yogini Temples (multiple states); serial nomination of Gupta Temples in north India (multiple states), and the palace-fortresses of the Bundelas in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the statement said.With these additions, India now has 62 sites on the tentative list. The 'tentative list' is an inventory of properties each country intends to consider for Unesco nomination.According to the Unesco website, Chausath Yogini Temples considered serially includes sites at multiple locations in the country. ""The Chausath Yogini Temples have 64 images of Yoginis in their individual shrines with intricate stone carvings circularly arranged. These temples are mostly situated on hilltops. 'Yogini' refers to a female practitioner of yoga and 'chausath' is the Hindi word for the number 64. The Yoginis are 64 in number and hence called the Chausath Yogini. They are a group of forest spirits and mother goddesses,"" reads a description on Unesco website.""It is this embodiment of both alluring and threatening qualities, as well as the large number of goddesses from the group that identifies them as Yoginis,"" it reads.At present, a total of 43 properties from India are inscribed on Unesco World Heritage List, including 35 in the 'Cultural' category, seven in 'Natural' and one in 'Mixed' category.India hosted a World Heritage Committee meeting for the first time in 2024, during which the Moidams-the mound-burial system of the Ahom Dynasty in Assam-was accorded the coveted Unesco tag.","A set of six properties have been added to India's tentative list by Unesco.

Indian leads study that could usher in diabetic astronauts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-leads-study-that-could-usher-in-diabetic-astronauts/articleshow/119028320.cms,"HOUSTON: Research geared to pave the way for people with insulin-dependent diabetes to travel to space is one of the more fascinating tasks entrusted to India's Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla and three other astronauts prepping for Axiom-4 (Ax4) mission that will take them to the International Space Station (ISS) later this year.In an exclusive interview with TOI at the Axiom Space headquarters in Houston, Texas, Ax4 mission manager Byran Mitchell said the research project, called ""Suite Ride, "" was about ""expanding the possibilities and enabling inclusion of a group of people and population that traditionally has been excluded from the space environment"".""We are attacking this problem in three ways,"" Mitchell said. First is ensuring that they get calibrated blood glucose monitoring data. Second is capturing that data on orbit from crew members. The final step is bringing that data to the ground to enable medical professionals to be able to assess it.Mitchell said the diverse & multinational crew would bring unique perspectives on this flight, with ""Shux"" (Shukla's call sign for the mission) being tasked with research focused on life science. ""One is to investigate the effects of microgravity on micrology, which is important as it could have potential future applications on uses like food, fuel, and life support systems. The second experiment he's working to accomplish is to investigate the viability of six different crop seeds for future spaceflight applications.""TOI visited the mission control room and facilities where Axiom is building its space station, but couldn't speak to Shukla or Group Captain Prashanth Nair, the second Indian astronaut training with Axiom as his backup, because of Isro's protocol.","Axiom-4 (Ax4) mission will take them to the International Space Station (ISS) later this year.

"Only 388 Indian illegals in US verified, all back: Govt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-388-indian-illegals-in-us-verified-all-back-govt/articleshow/119028170.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has identified 388 illegal Indian immigrants in the US since President Donald Trump launched his mass deportation campaign and all of them have returned to their home country, TOI has learnt. These include the plane-loads of illegals who landed in Amritsar and those who returned from third countries, mostly Panama, with help from the International Organisation for Migration.Verification of nationality is an ongoing process, and more are expected to be deported sooner than later, but not before their nationality is confirmed like in the past. For India, whether it's a million or a few thousand, there's no way of knowing conclusively how many Indians are living illegally in the US as they become Indian only after verification.While extremely large figures - ranging from 200,000 to 700,000 - have been bandied around about the number of Indian illegals in the US, the govt has maintained it has no data about the number of ""undocumented"" Indian immigrants residing in the US. ""The reason is that these immigrants have legally exited India but have either overstayed their US visa validity or have entered the US illegally or without valid documents,'' said junior external affairs minister Kirti Vardhan Singh, responding to a written question in RS earlier.Various Indian agencies closely scrutinise the list of persons identified for deportation by the US and only those who have been verified to be Indian nationals are accepted for deportation. Foreign minister S Jaishankar had said in his statement in Parliament that it is the obligation of all countries to accept their nationals living abroad illegally but it is subject to an ""unambiguous"" verification of their nationality. India has been accepting deportees from the US for the past couple of decades, with the maximum number (2,042) in 2019. Last year, it took back 1,368 illegal Indians.For the Indian govt, the real issue remains the need for a crackdown on what Jaishankar had described in his statement in Parliament last month as the illegal migration industry. He had said that law enforcement agencies will take action against agents facilitating illegal migration.","India has identified 388 illegal Indian immigrants in the US since President Donald Trump launched his mass deportation campaign.

BENGALURU: Forget Chandrayaan, Isro. If you really want to test lunar terrain, just get your mission vehicles to take a drive down Bellandur's crater-riddled roads! This was the new cry that echoed in the IT hub Wednesday.With deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar scheduled to visit Bellandur at 4pm, hundreds of residents hit the road at Devarabeesanahalli near Sakra Hospital. Waving placards that read, ‘No Need for Moon Mission, Isro — Just Drive Here!', frustrated residents chanted ""Beku beku, road beku."" That Shivakumar did not turn up only left them angry and frustrated.""This road has been in a terrible condition for the last six months,"" said Kusum Sahay , an elderly resident, adding, ""There are no pavements for pedestrians, and stepping out of a car itself is a challenge.""Venkat, another resident, fumed over the neglect of one of the city's key localities. ""We are the creme de la creme of Bengaluru, yet infrastructure here is cringe-worthy. This is a major road connecting Koramangala and Indiranagar — how hard is it to fix it quickly?""A resident of Mantri Espana highlighted the daily struggle. ""We moved here two years ago hoping things would improve, but nothing has changed. Just yesterday (Tuesday), I took my father to an eye hospital — a seven-minute drive took 20 minutes because of these crater-sized potholes. For elderly people, walking to Sakra Hospital is impossible. We are forced to take cars even for short distances, and that just adds to the traffic chaos.""Kanchana Ganeshan, another protester, recalled how she used to cycle on the lake road four years ago. ""Now, I wouldn't dare. What used to be a smooth ride turned into a bone-rattling nightmare. Every day, travelling just seven kilometres is an ordeal.""Rajesh Narka, representing Bellandur Rising 2025 initiative, called for swift action. ""Bellandur is home to some of the biggest IT hubs, yet the roads are in a shambles. We take pride in our city, but we cannot be expected to tolerate this mess. If the govt really wanted to fix this, it wouldn't have taken long.""Joginder Yadav, a resident, pointed to the irony of last-minute patchwork before the DCM's scheduled visit. ""BBMP suddenly laid gravel and sprinkled water just because a minister was expected. Illegal parking, footpath encroachments and lack of traffic lights make things worse. We pay our taxes — we contribute to nation-building. Even though many of us are migrants, the govt should remember ‘Atithi Devo Bhava' and give us basic infrastructure in return,"" he said.","Hundreds of residents hit the road at Devarabeesanahalli near Sakra Hospital.

NEW DELHI: After Pakistan suggested India's involvement in the recent train hijacking in Balochistan, ministry of external affairs (MEA) released a statement on Friday rejecting 'baseless allegations' and asked their neighboour to look inwards for 'its own internal problems.'During a press briefing on Thursday, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan presented evidence of calls traced to Afghanistan regarding the hijacking. When questioned about Pakistan's stance shift from India to Afghanistan concerning terrorist attacks, he maintained their position, stating there was no policy change and reaffirmed their belief in India's involvement in terrorism against Pakistan.Since Tuesday's attack, Pakistan's military, government and media allies have implicitly suggested Indian involvement in the train assault, whilst overlooking significant security lapses by their military and intelligence services.MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal responded to media queries regarding remarks made by the Pakistan side, saying, ""We strongly reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan. The whole world knows where the epicenter of global terrorism lies.

While traveling from India to Dubai, people are curious about the legal restrictions on carrying gold. Whether you are carrying gold for personal consumption or as a gift, it is important to know the customs rules and duties to prevent any legal issues. India has certain regulations regarding the amount of gold you can carry, and carrying more than that can lead to heavy fines or confiscation. In this comprehensive guide, we'll take you through the main customs rules, gold duty rates, and advice on avoiding running afoul of Indian laws while carrying gold. Stay updated to make your trip smooth and problem-free.As per the CBIC guidelines, Indian passengers returning from Dubai after a stay of more than six months can bring up to 1 kg of gold with them. However, as per Economic Times report, this is allowed only if they pay the applicable customs duty. The gold can be in the form of jewelry, coins, or bars. It is important for travelers to carry proper documentation, such as purchase invoices, that provide details on the price, purity, and date of purchase. These documents are required for verification during customs clearance at Indian airports, ensuring the process goes smoothly and in compliance with regulations.Men returning to India from Dubai are allowed to carry up to 20 grams of gold, with a maximum value of Rs 50,000, duty-free. If they exceed this limit, customs duty will apply.Women are allowed to bring up to 40 grams of gold, valued at Rs 1 lakh, without paying customs duty. The gold can be in the form of jewelry, bars, or coins for personal use. Any quantity over this limit will incur customs duty.Children are also allowed to carry up to 40 grams of gold as gifts or for personal use, provided they show proof of relationship and proper invoices.The customs duty on gold can vary depending on how long a traveler has stayed in Dubai.Travelers staying in Dubai for more than six months may also benefit from a reduction in customs duty, with a remission of 12.5% and an additional 1.25% social welfare surcharge on gold brought back to India.The customs duty for gold bars and coins depends on their weight.The customs duty is calculated based on the international price of 24K gold on the day of import. Customs officers assess the value of the gold and apply the corresponding duty rate. To avoid complications, it’s crucial to have accurate invoices and certificates for purity and weight. As per reports from Economic Times, If the proper documentation is not provided, the traveler may face penalties, including confiscation of the gold.If you’re carrying more gold than the duty-free limit allows, you must declare it at the airport. Passengers should use the Red Channel for declaring goods and paying any applicable customs duty. The Green Channel is only for those who are carrying goods within the permissible limits. As per the Customs Act, 1962, failing to declare excess gold can lead to confiscation, penalties, and possible legal action.","Men returning to India from Dubai are allowed to carry up to 20 grams of gold, with a maximum value of Rs 50,000, duty-free.

Visuals of former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy's office-residence have emerged showcasing unprecedented grandeaur of a luxurious seaside mansion on Rushikonda hill in Visakhapatnam.The coastal property, which critics call Andhra's ',' features four extensive blocks spread across 10 acres.The Rushikonda structure, which Chandrababu Naidu 's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) says was initially proposed as Reddy's camp office, now features lavish interiors with gold accents, Italian marble floors, premium furniture, bright chandeliers and bathtubs.The facility boasts comprehensive infrastructure including well-constructed roads, drainage networks, substantial water supply and a 100 KV electrical substation.Similar to Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal's ',' Andhra Pradesh's new administration faces uncertainty regarding the building's utilisation. The renovation of Kejriwal's official residence at Flagstaff Road, Civil Lines - which the BJP used effectively against him in elections - cost Rs 33 crore, up from the initial Rs 7.9 crore estimate.According to TDP, the project's purpose changed multiple times during development - initially presented as a luxury hotel, then proposed as the chief minister's camp office, and later suggested as a tourism venture.Despite receiving CRZ (Coastal Regulatory Zone) approval from central authorities in May 2021, concerns exist about the extensive demolition of Rushikonda hill during construction.The project, initially presented as a premium hotel with a Rs 91 crore budget, has reportedly exceeded Rs 500 crore upon completion, according to TDP assertions.The Comptroller and Auditor General's report suggests that including furnishings would significantly increase the total cost.","Jagan Mohan Reddy's seaside mansion on Rushikonda hill in Visakhapatnam features four extensive blocks spread across 10 acres.

The Union law ministry has asked a district court in Ahmedabad to deliver a summons issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to billionaire Gautam Adani over alleged securities fraud and a $265 million bribery scheme, according to a letter dated Feb 25, seen by Reuters.The summons, issued under Hague Service Convention that does not allow the serving of legal documents directly to defendants in India, would require Adani or his legal counsel to appear in the case in the US, said Indian lawyers.Adani and the law ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Adani Group has, in the past, termed the allegations ‘baseless’ and vowed to seek all possible legal recourse’. The summons does not imply an extradition risk for the businessman, according to a lawyer. “Extradition proceedings only come in to the picture if the US court issues warrants of arrest,” said Malak Bhatt, founding partner at NM Law Chambers.However, Arshdeep Khurana, a criminal lawyer in India, said, “The summons seems to be for appearance in a court in New York.

NEW DELHI: Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Friday called his discussion with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer a “forward-looking” step toward a mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement , setting the stage for a major economic shift between the two nations.Goyal, who was in the US last week, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a photo from the meeting, emphasizing that India's approach would be rooted in 'India First,' 'Viksit Bharat,' and the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two nations.The meeting follows US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s commitment to negotiating the first phase of a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) by fall 2025. Both leaders have designated senior representatives to accelerate these talks, underscoring their intent to strengthen economic ties.Also read: Come out of protectionist mindset: Goyal to exporters During their recent discussions, Modi and Trump set an ambitious goal—doubling total US-India bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, dubbed ‘Mission 500.’ The two leaders framed the initiative as a pathway to boosting prosperity, strengthening national economies, and making supply chains more resilient.President Trump, now in his second term, has maintained his tough stance on trade fairness, emphasizing tariff reciprocity—a policy where US tariffs will mirror those imposed by trade partners, including India. Washington has long argued that India maintains some of the highest tariffs globally, a concern that could become a sticking point in negotiations.US Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick recently acknowledged the complexities of the trade relationship, advocating for a broad-based trade agreement rather than product-specific negotiations. Speaking virtually at the India Today Conclave, Lutnick called for “understanding and cooperation” to craft a deal that benefits both sides.As trade negotiations progress, both nations must navigate sensitive issues, including tariffs, market access, and national security concerns.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka high court on Friday provided interim relief to former chief minister and BJP central parliamentary committee member BS Yediyurappa in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) case, staying the summons that required his personal appearance before the First Fast Track Court on March 15.Justice Pradeep Singh Yerur's bench was reviewing Yediyurappa's petition to dismiss the chargesheet and noted the necessity for a thorough investigation and subsequently stayed both the summons and the court's recognition of the matter.Senior counsel CV Nagesh, representing Yediyurappa, noted previous interim relief granted by the high court. He clarified that the IT section in the FIR would apply to the complainant, not Yediyurappa, as the conversation remained intact on the victim's mother's mobile phone.The chargesheet relied on statements from the victim and her mother. Counsel Nagesh said that the complaint reached police commissioner a month after the alleged occurrence.The case concerns allegations of inappropriate contact on February 2, 2024.The CID submitted their charge sheet on June 27, 2024, to a special fast-track court. The chargesheet names Yediyurappa and three others under POCSO Act and IPC sections including 354(A), 204, and 214. According to the chargesheet, when the complainant sought assistance regarding her 17-year-old daughter's assault, Yediyurappa allegedly committed misconduct.The document states that following social media posts about the incident, intermediaries arranged a meeting where Yediyurappa provided Rs 2 lakh, allegedly leading to deletion of related media. The victim's mother died on May 26, 2024, in Bengaluru due to health issues.Yediyurappa had said, ""A mother and daughter were found near my residence, appearing distressed. Out of compassion, I called them to inquire about their situation. I even called the Bengaluru Police Commissioner to help them. However, they began making accusations against me. Despite this, I gave them financial help. I will face these charges in court.""Although the HC previously granted concessions regarding court appearances, it had not stayed the case. Advocate general Shashikiran Shetty opposed relief for Yediyurappa, emphasising that the previous HC order merely excused court appearances without halting proceedings.The Bengaluru First Fast Track court had issued summons on February 28, requiring Yediyurappa's presence on March 15. The court's decision followed review of the police chargesheet. Yediyurappa had previously received HC immunity regarding summons.On February 7, the HC declined to dismiss charges against him and granted him anticipatory bail, preventing arrest. The fresh FTC summons raised potential legal consequences.","Karnataka high court provides interim relief to former chief minister BS Yediyurappa in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) case.

Little known byrnihat

NEW DELHI: India was the fifth most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with Byrnihat in Meghalaya being the most polluted metropolitan area globally last year, according to IQAir’s 2024 World Air Quality Report released Tuesday.Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) which was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards. High air pollution level in the little-known Meghalayan city can be attributed to rapid industrialisation, unregulated emission, construction and deforestation.Though India improved its overall ranking from third most-polluted in 2023 to fifth last year, it had the dubious record of having six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities and 13 of the 20 most polluted cities globally, with Delhi being the most polluted capital in the world in 2024.The report that analysed a critical pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) data from over 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, finds Chad — a central African country — as the most polluted country last year, followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Congo and India by exceeding the WHO standards of acceptable limit of that pollutant multiple times.Only seven countries — Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — met WHO annual average PM2.5 guideline level of 5 µg/m3.As far as India is concerned, the report finds that the country with the annual average PM2.5 concentration of 50.6 µg/m3 in 2024 reported more than 10 times higher than the WHO PM2.5 annual guideline and over 26% higher than the acceptable limit of the hazardous pollutant as per Indian national ambient air quality standards.The report shows that India saw a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentrations in 2024, averaging 50.6 µg/m3 compared to 54.4 µg/m3 in 2023, but the capital, New Delhi, maintained consistently high pollution levels, with annual average of 91.6 µg/m3, nearly unchanged from 92.7 µg/m3 in 2023.“Overall, 35% of Indian cities reported annual PM2.5 averages exceeding 10 times WHO guideline,” it says. In 2024, air quality data was reported from 371 cities across 11 countries, with India being the most monitored, hosting more than half of central and south Asia region’s stations. The region was home to the top nine most-polluted cities in the world with six of them in India last year.Citing Air Quality Life Index released by University of Chicago in 2023, IQAir’s report noted that air pollution remains a significant health burden in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years.PM2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, is considered the most hazardous air pollutant. It can be deposited in lungs, causing respiratory problems and other health issues.","Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) It was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin dropped the rupee symbol in the state budget on Thursday, replacing it with Tamil letter amid row over ""Hindi imposition"" with the BJP-led Central government. The DMK government replaced ""₹"" with the Tamil script ""ரூ"" in the logo for the state's 2025-26 budget.In return, the BJP quickly informed Stalin about the Tamil Nadu man who designed the dropped rupee symbol and calling the DMK government's move ""stupid"".Also read: Stalin government replaces Rupee symbol with Tamil letter in state budget amid language row The current rupee symbol was designed by a Tamilian designer Udaya Kumar Meanwhile, BJP's Tamil Nadu chief K Annamalai on X said, ""The DMK government's state budget for 2025-26 has replaced the Rupee symbol, which was designed by a Tamilian and adopted nationwide as part of our currency. The creator of the symbol, Thiru Udhay Kumar, is the son of a former DMK MLA.""The second of four children, Udaya Kumar was born to N Dharmalingam, a contractor, and Jayalakshmi in 1978 in Chennai. While doing his bachelor's in architecture from Anna University, he designed posters and publications that helped him define his calling — visual design.""I realised Indian scripts don't have their design repertoire. After two years of trying to create something new in Tamil typography, I realised that I shouldn't work on my own. I needed expert guidance and hence, came to Industrial Design Centre at IIT-Bombay,"" Kumar told TOI in an earlier interview.Designing the simple-looking Indian rupee symbol did not come easy for Udaya Kumar.""I spent endless nights on trial and error. The symbol had to have universal design features while staying Indian in spirit,"" Kumar told TOI.That explains the propensity of his symbol towards the Latin letter form, 'R' for rupee, and the stroke across the top curve, parallel to the 'shirorekha', the line heading the alphabet in Devanagari script. ""Most international currencies have double strokes such as the Australian dollar, Korean yen, the Euro or the Lira. The feature pronounce its identity as a currency,"" he said.","Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin dropped the rupee symbol in the state budget on Thursday.

Pakistan blames India again for Baloch terror attacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blames-india-again-for-baloch-terror-attacks/articleshow/119026425.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan military and Balochistan provincial leadership on Friday accused India of orchestrating terrorism in the restive southwestern province, a day after the PM Shehbaz Sharif-led govt levelled similar allegations against New Delhi. However, they failed to offer any specific evidence -- such as intercepted communications or captured operatives -- to back the claims.Addressing a joint press conference in Islamabad, director general of inter-services PR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Balochistan chief minister Sarfaraz Bugti alleged that India's Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) is the chief financier and planner behind a surge in violent attacks, including the recent bombing of the Jaffar Express train.Chaudhry asserted that India is leveraging Afghan territory to wage a proxy war against Pakistan, targeting critical infrastructure like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , a multi-billion-dollar initiative central to Beijing's Belt and Road ambitions.Bugti echoed the military's stance, describing an ""intelligence-driven war"" unleashed by foreign powers, with India at the helm. He accused India of arming and funding the Baloch Liberation Army , a separatist group banned in Pakistan and blamed for the Jaffar Express attack. ""This is not just insurgency; it's a calculated assault on our sovereignty,"" Bugti said, vowing a robust response alongside federal and military efforts. He claimed a network of Baloch dissidents abroad actively collaborates with India.","Pakistan military and Balochistan provincial leadership on Friday accused India of orchestrating terrorism in the restive southwestern province.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: The Hundred Draft witnessed a notable absence of Pakistani cricketers , with none of the 50 players from the country receiving bids. This development has sparked discussions and raised questions about the potential factors contributing to this outcome.Among the Pakistani contingent, prominent names such as Naseem Shah , Saim Ayub, and Shadab Khan , who were placed in the top price brackets, failed to attract any bidders.Naseem and Shadab were listed in the highest category of GBP 120,000, while Ayub positioned himself in the GBP 78,500 segment. Similarly, the female cricketers from Pakistan , including Aliya Riaz, Fatima Sana, Yusra Amir, Iram Javed, and Jaweria Rauf, did not receive any offers.One potential reason cited for this lack of interest in Pakistani players is the involvement of Indian Premier League ( IPL ) owners in the Hundred teams.Currently, four IPL franchises hold stakes in various Hundred teams, including Mumbai Indians in Oval Invincibles, Lucknow Super Giants in Manchester Originals, Sunrisers Hyderabad in Northern Superchargers, and Delhi Capitals in Southern Brave.Additionally, Sanjay Govil, an Indian-American entrepreneur, has acquired a 50% stake in Welsh Fire, while Cricket Investor Holdings Limited, a consortium of Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurs, has purchased a 49% stake in London Spirit.While the influence of IPL owners cannot be discounted, another factor that may have contributed to the lack of bids for Pakistani cricketers is their modest form in white-ball formats.The recent performances of these players in limited-overs cricket might have played a role in deterring potential buyers from investing in their services.It is worth noting that last year, players like Naseem Shah and Shaheen Shah Afridi faced challenges related to obtaining No Objection Certificates (NOCs) from the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ), which ultimately curtailed their participation in the Hundred.Such administrative hurdles could also have impacted the decision-making process of the teams during the draft.",The Hundred Draft witnessed a notable absence of Pakistani cricketers.

Wayne Gretzky’s role and the impact of celebrity endorsements

What is the current status of the lawsuit

Wayne Gretzky, widely regarded as one of the greatest hockey players of all time, found himself at the center of a legal controversy in 2022 when he was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product. The lawsuit, filed by entrepreneur Steven Sparks in Los Angeles, alleged that Gretzky falsely promoted OMG Gum as a weight loss aid, claiming it helped him lose 35 pounds. Sparks, an investor in the product, argued that this statement artificially inflated the value of the company, leading to significant financial damages when the claim was revealed to be untrue.According to the lawsuit, Steven Sparks originally invested in OMG Gum because of its purported benefits and Wayne Gretzky's endorsement. The gum was marketed as a weight loss supplement, with Wayne Gretzky allegedly stating that he personally used it to shed excess weight. Sparks contended that this claim helped boost the product’s credibility and value, ultimately leading him to increase his financial involvement.However, Sparks later learned that Wayne Gretzky’s weight loss statement was false. As a result, he claimed that the company’s value plummeted, and he suffered substantial monetary losses. In response, Sparks filed a $10 million lawsuit against Gretzky, accusing him of fraud and deceptive business practices.While Gretzky was not the creator of OMG Gum, he was closely linked to its promotion. His status as a sports icon and public figure likely contributed to the product’s perceived legitimacy, demonstrating the significant influence that celebrity endorsements can have on consumer and investor decisions.This case highlighted concerns about the responsibilities of celebrities when endorsing products, especially those related to health and wellness. Investors and consumers often rely on such endorsements, assuming that public figures genuinely support and use the products they promote.As of now, there have been no major updates on the outcome of Sparks’ lawsuit against Wayne Gretzky. It is unclear whether the case was settled privately, dismissed, or remains ongoing. If proven, the allegations could serve as a cautionary tale for both investors and celebrities regarding the risks of false advertising and misleading promotions.Also Read: “A scumbag”: Brad Marchand a tongue-in-cheek answer when asked about coming back together with Sam Bennett Gretzky has not publicly commented in detail on the accusations, but the case remains an example of how endorsements, especially from high-profile figures, can have serious legal and financial consequences.","Wayne Gretzky was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product.

The investment scheme of Rs 5.7 crore, which promised high returns, turned out to be a scam that has left her and others with significant financial losses.The businesswoman was approached in 2019 by her brother and his wife, who promised her a 4% monthly return on investment.

"Facebook's ex-COO Sheryl Sandberg 'lied' about boarding flight that crash-landed, claims former employee Wynn-Williams' book",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebooks-ex-coo-sheryl-sandberg-lied-about-boarding-flight-that-crash-landed-claims-former-employee-wynn-williams-book/articleshow/118919496.cms,"What Sheryl Sandberg said about taking the San Franciso flight that crash-landed

What Wynn-Williams wrote on Sandberg’s post

Sheryl Sandberg , former COO of Meta, allegedly fabricated a story about narrowly escaping disaster by claiming she had planned to board Asiana Airlines Flight 214 , which crash-landed in San Francisco over a decade ago, killing three and injuring nearly 200 people. This accusation, according to a report in New York Post, comes from Sarah Wynn-Williams , a former subordinate who served as director of public policy under Sandberg for six years at Facebook (as the company was then called). Wynn-Williams makes the claim in her new memoir, Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, asserting that Sandberg, once Mark Zuckerberg ’s second-in-command, lied about almost being on the ill-fated flight.“Do people really lie about dodging plane crashes?” Wynn-Williams muses in her book. “Why would she? It’s not like Sheryl craves the spotlight.” She adds, “After that, I could never look at Sheryl the same way.”The flight in question departed from Incheon International Airport near Seoul, South Korea, on July 6, 2013, carrying 307 passengers and crew. During its approach to San Francisco International Airport, the Boeing 777-200ER descended too low and too slow, resulting in a catastrophic crash landing. Emergency crews responded swiftly, and most passengers evacuated before flames engulfed the aircraft. Tragically, three people perished—one killed by a rescue vehicle in the chaos — and 187 were injured, many with spinal or head trauma.Shortly after the incident, Sandberg posted on Facebook, claiming she, her family, and several Facebook colleagues had originally intended to take Flight 214. “We switched to United so we could use miles for my family’s tickets,” she wrote. “Our flight was due to arrive at the same time, but we landed about 20 minutes earlier.” In subsequent posts, she reassured followers of her safety and noted that Samsung executive David Eun, a friend who was on the flight, had survived. “Serious moment to give thanks,” she concluded. The post rapidly gained attention, amassing over 3,000 likes in its first hour.Wynn-Williams, however, disputes Sandberg’s account. In her memoir, she recalls seeing news reports suggesting Sandberg and other team members, including then-director of global communications Debbie Frost, were slated to be on the flight—information she says the staff only learned from Sandberg’s post. Skeptical, Wynn-Williams contacted Frost, who allegedly called Sandberg’s claim “totally weird,” pointing out that Sandberg “always flies United” and that Asiana was never an option. “I don’t know why she posted it or tagged us all,” Frost reportedly told her.Frost, when approached by The Post, directed inquiries to her Threads account, where she wrote, “Everyone’s got their own take, but a lot of these stories are blown out of proportion or just didn’t happen.” Wynn-Williams’ book also includes other provocative allegations, adding fuel to the controversy surrounding Sandberg’s tenure.","Sarah Wynn-Williams served as director of public policy under Sheryl Sandberg for six years at Facebook.

Sundar Pichai’s old video goes viral amidst Hindi-Tamil language row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/sundar-pichais-old-video-goes-viral-amidst-hindi-tamil-language-row/articleshow/118972356.cms,"Sundar Pichai’s journey from IIT Kharagpur to Google

Amid the ongoing debate over Tamil Nadu’s language policy, an old video of Google CEO Sundar Pichai has resurfaced online, adding fuel to the controversy. The video, which has now gone viral, features Pichai mentioning that he learned Hindi in school. A tweet accompanying the clip states: “Sundar Pichai, who comes from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, says—‘I learnt Hindi in school’. Sundar Pichai was born in 1972 and learnt Hindi during Congress rule. Clearly, Hindi was the third language in Tamil Nadu.”The resurfaced video comes at a time when DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran is facing backlash for claiming that Pichai studied under Tamil Nadu’s two-language policy and credited the system for his success.Sundar Pichai was born into a Tamil Brahmin family. His mother, Lakshmi, worked as a stenographer, while his father, Regunatha Pichai, was an electrical engineer at British conglomerate GEC. He pursued metallurgical engineering at IIT Kharagpur, where he excelled academically, earning a silver medal and securing a scholarship to study at Stanford University.Moving to the United States, Pichai completed his MS in engineering and materials science at Stanford. He briefly worked at Applied Materials before pursuing an MBA at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, which he completed in 2002.Pichai’s career at Google began in 2004, following a short stint at consulting firm McKinsey. He initially worked in product management and development, contributing to projects like Google Toolbar and playing a key role in developing the Chrome browser.His leadership quickly gained recognition, and by 2008, he was named vice president of product development. He was promoted to senior vice president in 2012 and, by 2014, became Google's product chief, overseeing the Android operating system along with other major services. His rise within the company set the stage for his eventual leadership at Google and its parent company, Alphabet.","An old video of Google CEO Sundar Pichai has resurfaced online.

Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg visits White House for second meeting with Donald Trump since taking office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-mark-zuckerberg-visits-white-house-meeting-with-donald-trump/articleshow/118959868.cms,"

Mark Zuckerberg's second meet after Donald Trump assumed office

Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg visited the White House on Wednesday for meetings with Trump administration officials, Reuters reported. “Mark’s continuing the meetings he's been holding with the administration on American technology leadership,” Meta spokesman Andy Stone told the news agency, though he did not confirm the White House visit.Zuckerberg’s meeting comes just weeks after he made headlines for showcasing Meta’s advancements in artificial intelligence and the metaverse . Last month, the Facebook founder demonstrated the latest AI-powered features integrated into Meta’s platforms, emphasizing the company’s commitment to staying at the forefront of technological innovation.The social media giant is reportedly testing its first internally developed chip designed for training artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Meta is partnering with Taiwan-based TSMC to manufacture the chip. Testing began after Meta completed its first “tape-out” - a critical phase in chip development that involves sending an initial design through a chip factory.This development holds much significance as the company joins other tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to create custom silicon and decrease dependence on external suppliers such as Nvidia.This is Zuckerberg’s second visit to the White House in two months. Last month, he met with officials to discuss Meta’s role in advancing U.S. technological leadership. Stone had then confirmed the February 6 visit, stating on X:“Mark Zuckerberg was at the White House today to discuss how Meta can help the administration defend and advance American tech leadership abroad.”Zuckerberg has been actively engaging with policymakers on AI regulations, digital infrastructure, and the role of U.S. tech firms in global competition. His interactions with the administration have also included two reported meetings with Trump at Mar-a-Lago before he took office.","Mark Zuckerberg visited the White House on Wednesday for meetings with Trump administration officials, Reuters reported.

A Sydney District Court jury on Thursday found former Australia spinner Stuart MacGill guilty on a reduced charge for being part of drug supply, but cleared him of involvement in a large-scale commercial drug transaction that occurred in April 2021.Evidence presented showed that MacGill's regular drug supplier and his brother-in-law Marino Sotiropoulos had arranged an exchange of $330,000 for a kilogram of cocaine.While the former cricketer facilitated a meeting at his restaurant, he maintained he was not aware of any deal. But the prosecution contended that MacGill's prior knowledge was essential for the deal to have taken place.The jury rejected the Crown's allegations regarding MacGill's involvement in a one-kilogram transaction, but nonetheless convicted him on a reduced charge related to participating in drug supply.The court adjourned his sentencing proceedings for eight weeks.MacGill played 44 Tests for Australia, taking 208 wickets. He was known for producing prodigious turn with his leg-spinners, but played in the same era that was dominated by leg-spin legend Shane Warne.","Stuart MacGill found guilty on reduced charge for being part of drug supply.
