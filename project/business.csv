"Government identifies 10 highway segments for zero-emission truck movement, the move to help India reach its climate goals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-identifies-10-highway-segments-for-zero-emission-truck-movement-the-move-to-help-india-reach-its-climate-goals/articleshow/121259365.cms,"India has picked 10 key highway routes for zero-emission trucks to cut freight pollution and push green logistics (Representative Image: AI-generated)

New Delhi: India has identified 10 high-impact highway segments where only zero-emission trucks (ZET) will be used for freight movement in the near future, as part of the country's larger goal for decarbonising the logistics sector, reducing air pollution, ensuring energy security and meeting the long-term climate goal of 'net zero' by 2070.These priority corridors, list of which was released by the office of the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) to the government early this month, will be used as pilots for early ZET deployment, laying the groundwork for a dedicated national infrastructure network focusing on electric and hydrogen-based fuel technologies across all highways in the country in due course.Despite comprising only 3 per cent of all vehicles, trucks are responsible for more than one-third of transport-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the country. This is particularly concerning given that road transportation accounts for a staggering 71% of overall freight movement in India.According to the Niti Aayog estimates, the number of trucks will be increased by more than four times, from 4 million in 2022 to around 17 million by 2050. It is, therefore, important to move fast towards ZET deployment for long-term benefits and that's why the Office of the PSA has undertaken the initiative to identify the top corridors for initial deployment of such trucks in India.“These (10) corridors serve not only as the best candidates for ZET pilots, but as blueprints for the future of freight movement,” said Ajay K Sood, PSA, in his foreword to the 56-page report on India’s priority corridors for Zero-Emission Trucking .He said, “The adoption of ZET in India will play a crucial role in decarbonising the logistics sector, improving public health, enhancing energy independence, and showcasing the country’s leadership in the global transition to a net-zero future.”ZET corridors are highway segments equipped with charging or refuelling infrastructure to facilitate seamless goods movement. ""Establishing ZET corridors can help ensure the use of truck and infrastructure assets, demonstrate ZET operational and financial feasibility, help manage risks and lower costs, and unlock private capital for ZET projects,"" said the report.Efforts are already under way to kick-start ZET adoption in India as the central government has allocated Rs 500 crore for the purchase of such trucks under the Prime Minister Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) scheme.The top 10 corridors are: Delhi - Chandigarh; Delhi -Jaipur; Pune - Nashik; Dhanbad - Kolkata; Kolkata - Haldia; Vijayawada - Visakhapatnam; Bengaluru - Chennai; Chennai - Viluppuram; Coimbatore - Salem; and Coimbatore - KochiThese corridors were identified through a three-phase process: quantitative and qualitative assessment of an initial list of 230 corridors using parameters such as toll traffic data and mapping of supply/demand centres, stakeholder consultations and detailed field research.Other factors such as high freight traffic, industrial activity, availability of ancillary services, grid infrastructure readiness, corridor length relative to battery range, and strategic stakeholder inputs for commercial and business viability were also taken into account while finalising the corridors.The report, identifying the high priority corridors, was prepared with the support of Centre of Excellence for Zero Emission Trucking (CoEZET) - IIT Madras, Rocky Mountain Institute, and pManifold as knowledge partners.",India has identified 10 high-impact highway segments where only zero-emission trucks (ZET) will be used for freight movement in the near future.

India’s port curbs threaten regional trade: Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-port-curbs-threaten-regional-trade-bangladesh/articleshow/121255685.cms,"Agency photo

DHAKA: Bangladeshi exporters are raising concerns over India’s newly imposed port restrictions on key export items such as readymade garments (RMG) and processed foods, warning that the move will lead to “delays, higher costs, and disruptions” in bilateral and regional trade. While experts view the restrictions as non-tariff barriers that could significantly impact Bangladesh’s export competitiveness, the interim govt has said that any issues arising from the new measures will be addressed through dialogue, expressing hope that trade ties will remain stable.Commerce adviser SK Bashir Uddin on Sunday said the govt has not yet received any formal notification on the restrictions. Expressing optimism that trade will continue, he said, “This is in the interest of consumers and production sectors on both sides.”Meanwhile, 17 trucks carrying food products were stuck at the Burimari border due to the restrictions. These truckloads of goods were scheduled to cross the border on Sunday morning and head to Siliguri (West Bengal).A former director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) said it will now take longer for Bangladeshi garments to reach their destinations than before, and costs will rise. “That means exports will decrease to some extent,” he added. “At a time when world trade is beset by various problems, such reciprocal trade restrictions will further increase the level of damage to both sides,” the exporter noted.The commerce adviser also said the govt has started assessing the potential impact of the Indian govt’s move. “We have initiated a preliminary review to determine the steps Bangladesh should consider,” he said.On Saturday, in a “retaliatory move”, the Indian govt restricted the import of several products from Bangladesh, including a ban on the entry of readymade garments through the land route.In a notification issued on Saturday, the directorate general of foreign trade, however, allowed garments, the mainstay of Bangladesh industry, to be only shipped via Nhava Sheva and Kolkata ports. While fish, edible oil, LPG and crushed stones have been spared, import of several products via all land customs stations and integrated check posts in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Changrabandha and Fulbari in West Bengal will be discontinued.","Bangladeshi exporters are raising concerns over India’s newly imposed port restrictions on key export items.

Supreme Court Criticizes Repeated PILs on Rohingya Deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-irked-by-repeated-pils-to-stop-rohingya-deportation/articleshow/121220210.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday was irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims within a fortnight and told senior advocate Colin Gonsalves that he can’t be filing PIL after PIL on the same issue without any new fact to seek modification of SC’s May 8 decision refusing relief.On May 8, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and N Kotiswar Singh had refused to grant interim stay on apprehended deportation of Rohingyas despite spirited arguments from Gonsalves and Prashant Bhushan. The bench had said Rohingyas, who are not Indian citizens, do not have a right to reside anywhere in the country.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had said India is not a signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees and disputed validity of UNHCR granting refugee status to Rohingyas, who are from Myanmar and had fled to other countries because of serious threat to their lives from the military.On Friday, Gonsalves said on May 8 itself the Union govt had deported 28 Rohingyas, who were handcuffed and taken to Andaman Island, given life jackets and pushed towards Myanmar. After somehow reaching Myanmar, they took help of fishermen to make phone calls to their relatives in Delhi to inform them that they faced imminent threats to their lives.The bench of Justices Kant and Singh said these are bald averments and who is there to verify these facts are true to his knowledge. “When the country is facing such a situation at present, you cannot come up with fanciful PILs like this. There is no material to support vague and sweeping allegations made in the petition. Unless the petitioner provides prima facie credible material, it is difficult to pass an interim order which is contrary to the one refused on May 8 by a 3-J bench.”Gonsalves cited a SC judgement on protection of Chakma refugees to seek similar relief for Rohingyas. He also cited a UN Report as well as an order of the International Court of Justice to claim that Rohingyas are not migrants but refugees whose protection of lives is mandated by the UN.The bench said, “We do not want to comment on the UN Report today. We will give an answer to that on July 31, when this petition along with the pending one would be taken up for hearing.” Gonsalves said this would allow govt to deport more Rohingyas, whose number exceed 8,000 in different parts of the country and 800 of them are in Delhi.","Supreme Court irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims.

BENGALURU: A resident at Prestige Sunrise Park in Electronics City phase 1 in Bengaluru has been paying daily penalties of Rs 100 for maintaining his shoe rack outside his flat.The residential complex, comprising 1046 units, launched an initiative to remove all personal items, including shoe storage units, plants in pots and storage cabinets from common areas. Nearly 50% of residents were found to have placed their belongings outside, violating established guidelines.The Residents' Association distributed notices and engaged in thorough communication with occupants, requesting removal of items. They provided a reasonable timeline of two months for compliance. Despite initial opposition, the majority of residents complied with the directive.Approximately four weeks later, all but two residents had cleared their belongings from the corridors. One resident eventually complied after continuous reminders. The second resident remained adamant about keeping the shoe rack outside.This resident even made an advance payment of rupees 15,000, requesting it be applied towards future penalties and asked to be left undisturbed.Despite escalating fines, the resident continued paying while refusing to remove the shoe rack.""He has paid a fine of Rs 24,000 over the last eight months,"" Arun Prasad, president of the association told TOI, adding the association is planning to raise the daily penalty from Rs 100 to Rs 200 to address this specific situation.Fire safety regulations stipulate that corridors in high-rise buildings must remain clear of obstacles to facilitate safe evacuation during emergencies.","A resident at Prestige Sunrise Park in Electronics City phase 1 in Bengaluru has been paying daily penalties of Rs 100 for maintaining his shoe rack outside his flat.

Short circuit turned get-together into tragedy

None of 17 Hyd fire victims taken to hospitals could be revived

HYDERABAD: A century-old three-storey Hyderabad building close to the iconic Charminar caught fire early Sunday, killing 17 members across three generations of a jeweller’s family that had assembled in their ancestral home for what was to be a weekend get-together.Patriarch Prahlad Modi , whose roots in Gulzar Houz go back to the Nizam era, and eight children were among the victims, ranging from 2 to 73 years old. They died either from burn injuries or asphyxiation, officials said.Four family members, two of whom were not at home, and some of their workers survived the 6am blaze, suspected to have been caused by an electrical short circuit. Fire engines needed more than two hours to douse the flames, by which time much of the residential-cum-commercial building had been gutted.Fire brigade officials identified the main electrical panel on the ground floor that houses three jewellery stores of the family as the source of the fire. One of the stores had been in business since 1906.“Sparks caused by the short circuit in the main electrical line spread through the wooden panel and triggered a blast in the compressor unit of one of the ACs, resulting in the blaze growing,” director general of fire services Y Nagi Reddy said. “Since the building has only one entrance and exit, and the staircase is very narrow, residents couldn’t escape. The smoke further made it difficult for them to navigate their way out.”Nagi Reddy said 11 fire engines, a firefighting robot, 17 officers and 70 personnel were deployed to rescue survivors and douse the flames. He contested allegations by relatives of the dead about a delayed response. “We received a call at 6.16am and immediately rushed our teams to the fire scene,” the DG said.Charminar police station registered a fire accident case based on a complaint by a relative of Prahlad Modi.None of the 17 victims who had been taken to different hospitals – Osmania General Hospital, Apollo Hospital and Yashoda Hospital – could be revived. They were all cremated in the evening.Residents of the Gulzar Houz neighbourhood recalled hearing ominous noises from the building where Prahlad Modi lived with his wife Munni and others soon after the fire broke out. “By the time we reached the site, the entire building was engulfed in flames. There was little hope of anyone surviving,” said Mir Zahid, a neighbour.PM Narendra Modi announced ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of each of the deceased from the PM’s National Relief Fund. “Deeply anguished by the loss of lives due to a fire tragedy in Hyderabad, Telangana. Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. May the injured recover soon,” he wrote on X.Telangana CM A Revanth Reddy, too, announced Rs 5 lakh in ex gratia to the victims’ immediate families.Prahlad Modi and his family migrated to Hyderabad from Rajasthan decades ago and have been based in Gulzar Houz since. The extended clan, now spread across the city, would often meet at the patriarch’s home, sources said.","Patriarch Prahlad Modi and eight children were among the victims, ranging from 2 to 73 years old.

India continues to stress there’s only a pause in

NEW DELHI: The understanding with Pakistan to cease cross-border military hostilities does not have an “expiry date”, Indian Army said on Sunday, rejecting reports from Islamabad that the “ceasefire” was being extended periodically.India has made it clear that the ongoing truce, which came into effect at 5 pm on May 10 after India’s deep precision strikes on nine Pakistani airbases as well as a few radar sites earlier that day, is conditional and depends on Islamabad’s behaviour.The Indian Army also said that no further talks were scheduled between its DGMO Lt-General Rajiv Ghai and his Pakistani counterpart, Major General Kashif Abdullah.Stressing that India has kept Pakistan “on probation” to ascertain whether it ceases cross-border terror, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said on Friday, “If Pakistan’s behaviour improves, it is fine. But if there is any disturbance, harshest punishment will be given.”“As far as continuation of the break in hostilities is concerned, as decided in the interaction between the DGMOs of May 12, there is no expiry date to it,” the Army added, in a brief statement on Sunday.The two countries have decided to continue their confidence building measures to gradually reduce the high alertness levels between the rival militaries ranged against each other all along the western front.“This is being done to ensure neither side fires or initiates any aggressive and inimical action,” an official said. On May 10, the two sides had also agreed to “consider immediate measures” to ensure troop reduction along the Line of Control as well as the international boundary.India, however, has repeatedly stressed that there is only a “pause” in Operation Sindoor, with the armed forces maintaining full operational readiness to respond to any misadventure from Pakistan. “Our actions were just a trailer, and if need be, we will show the full picture. Attacking and eliminating terrorism is the new normal of New India,” the defence minister had said at the Bhuj air force station on Friday.","India has made it clear that the ongoing truce is conditional and depends on Islamabad’s behaviour.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump ’s interest in Pakistan seems to go deeper than just the cryptocurrency venture his aides have been found pushing for recently with Islamabad for his family firm.It has now emerged that Gentry Beach , a hunting buddy and college friend of Donald Trump Jr , the US President’s son, visited Pakistan in Jan and later Bangladesh and Turkiye, and came back to brief Trump Sr and his close aides at Mar-a-Lago about the “amazing place called Pakistan” and a potential to cut deals worth billions of dollars in explorations of rare earth minerals , oil & gas, and real estate.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hosted him twice, first in Islamabad in Jan in the presence of his senior cabinet colleagues, including the ministers for finance and foreign affairs, and again in Dubai on Feb 11, on the sidelines of the summit of world govts.Beach was an exceptionally unknown face among hosts of foreign dignitaries and heads of state Sharif met and posted pictures with on his official twitter handle @PakPMO.In Bangladesh, where Beach met the country’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, a day after meeting the Pakistani PM (on Jan 29), Trump’s close associate promised Dhaka of bringing in huge FDIs in oil and gas exploration businesses and investments in aerospace, defence and real estate.Controversy is not new to Trump Jr and his association with his buddy Beach, a Texas hedge fund manager. In 2018, The Guardian wrote how Trump Jr’s hunting buddy had helped raise millions of dollars in the 2016 campaign funding for Donald Trump. This led him to gain access to Trump’s top administration officials, including the National Security Council officials “to push a plan that could curb US sanctions in Venezuela and open up business for US companies in the oil-rich nation”.Beach scouting for businesses in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Turkey brings in a similar concern that was raised when the Trump aide was seeking withdrawal of sanctions for Venezuela. In both cases, there was scant regard for national security concerns when it offered lucrative deals to Trump & Co in return. It is a well-known fact that Beach’s father, Gary, was convicted in a bankruptcy fraud.When Pakistan was busy conspiring the Pahalgam terror attack, Beach was signing a deal in Istanbul (on Apr 17) with a Turkish group Tera Holding for a joint venture to be set up in Dubai on oil and mining. In all three countries he was feted as Trump’s point person who meant business. While in Pakistan he noted the Islamic country had rare earth reserves of more than $50 trillion; to Turkey, he offered to turn the country into the next factory of the world, replacing China.On May 15, TOI had reported how Donald Trump’s attempt to be a broker in the conflict between India and Pakistan has the spotlight on a deal the hostile neighbour recently negotiated with World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture in which the family of the US President has 60% stake.The deal was signed between the hastily-launched Pakistan Crypto Council, which appointed early last month Changzpeng Zhao(CZ), the founder of Binance, world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, as its advisor with the ambitious objective of making Islamabad South Asia’s crypto capital.Though the Crypto Council was barely days old, World Liberty Financial sent its heavy guns , including Zachary Witkoff son of Trump’s golf buddy Steve, to Islamabad where they were feted by Sharif and, more crucially, army chief general Asim Munir who just days later “cleared” the mass killing in Pahalgam of tourists who were segregated on the basis of their faith.World Liberty Financial’s stakeholders include Trump's two sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr who, along with their brother-in law, Jared Kushner, have been scouring different parts for lucrative business deals and have attracted allegations of leveraging their links to the White House.","US President Donald Trump’s interest in Pakistan seems to go deeper than just the cryptocurrency venture his aides have been found pushing for recently with Islamabad for his family firm.

IMF to Pakistan

IMF lists 11 new riders for Pakistan to avail loan

NEW DELHI: Days after clearing fresh assistance despite India’s strong opposition, International Monetary Fund (IMF) has flagged that heightened tension with its neighbour could increase the “enterprise risk” for Pakistan’s agreed reforms, while also cautioning about “reputational risk” due to a perception of fund diversion.Setting out 11 new structural benchmarks for reforms under the bailout scheme, the multi-lateral agency warned “an intensification of political or social tensions” could also impact policy and reform implementation, in what was probably a reference to internal conflicts in Pakistan.India’s concern, however, has more to do with the way Pakistan is being provided assistance despite its strong links with terror, as pointed out by Rajnath Singh last week. He had sounded an alert about possible diversion of funds by Pakistan govt to rebuild terror bases destroyed by Indian forces, and called for a rethink of the IMF assistance.In the midst of Operation Sindoor , at the IMF board meeting on May 9, India had red-flagged disbursement of $1 billion loan to Pakistan, along with fresh assistance of $1.4 billion in the name of climate resilience, but the US and European countries backed the proposal and approved it.Reputational risks could also come from any perceived lack of even handed or if there was a perceived misuse of Fund disbursements. As mitigants, the Pakistani authorities have reiterated their strong commitment to the programme, which is designed to help restore economic stability, build resilience through stronger reserve buffers, and advance reforms to create stronger and inclusive growth,” the IMF documents noted.Amid strong criticism from India, it said, “Careful Fund (IMF) communication will be essential to underscore the Fund’s neutral role and avoid misperceptions about its lending activities.”Some of the international ratings agencies have also cautioned against an adverse impact on Pakistan of long-drawn tensions with India and the ceasefire is seen to have provided some relief to its fragile economy. The IMF documents sought to underline that the assistance to Pakistan has been given as it met the loan conditionalities.While reiterating three structural benchmarks for the 37-month programme, which started last Sept, the global body added 11 new parameters including parliamentary approval for FY26 budget in line with its prescriptions, tax reforms and a governance diagnostic assessment and phaseout of tax benefits for SEZs and industrial parks.Besides, it has underlined the need to move ahead with power and gas pricing reforms and phaseout of restrictions on automobile imports.",IMF lists 11 new riders for Pakistan to avail loan under bailout scheme.

NEW DELHI: Indian govt’s retaliatory move to restrict import of ready-made garments (RMG) from Bangladesh via the land route is expected to increase logistics costs and transit time for the products which account for around a third of shipments from India’s neighbour in the east.While it takes only two-three days for apparel produced in Bangladesh to move through land borders, now the transit time is going to be longer, depending on how long it takes for ships to sail to Kolkata and Nhava Sheva (Mumbai),, and clear customs before taking the land route to reach Indian warehouses.“The decision can hit Bangladesh apparel exports to India in multiple ways, particularly when a substantial proportion of apparel import into India is through land ports, 76% from Petrapole land port alone,” said Mithileshwar Thakur, secretary general of Apparel Export Promotion Council , whose members are rivals as well as exporters from Bangladesh.Several Indian companies had set up units across the border to take advantage of the lower cost of production, including lower wages and subsidised power, and tariff advantage that Bangladesh enjoys due to its status as a least developed country, something that will change as it has now graduated to middle-income bracket. “Indian manufacturers pay a 5% GST on locally sourced fabric, while Bangladeshi firms import fabric duty-free from China and receive export incentives for sales to India, giving them an estimated 10%-15% price advantage,” said trade expert Ajay Srivastava.For Indian retailers , as well as global chains operating in the country, switching suppliers is not an easy decision given the massive cost advantage Bangladesh enjoys. Besides, it produces at a scale which few Indian manufacturers have and have refused to add capacity despite wide-spread assessment political uncertainty will hurt Dhaka’s industrial mainstay, readymade garments.“If I have a large order, I prefer Bangladesh because one producer can meet my requirement, and on time,” the CEO of an Indian retailer said.India’s retaliation follows a series of restrictions imposed by Bangladesh, including a ban on Indian yarn imports, and import bans on dozens of Indian goods, including paper, tobacco, fish and powdered milk. “Adding to the friction, Dhaka introduced a transit fee of Taka 1.8 (Rs 1.25) per tonne per km on Indian goods moving through its territory. ,” said Srivastava.

DGCA tells flying schools to maintain updated sites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-tells-flying-schools-to-maintain-updated-sites/articleshow/121254861.cms,"Generative AI

NEW DELHI: Aspiring commercial pilots in India will now be able to make an informed choice for a flying training organisation (FTO) to learn the ropes.In a major reform, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Friday directed all flying schools in country to “maintain a dedicated website” with updated information on several parameters. These include, among other things, minimum and maximum time taken to complete 200 hours of flying; number of aircraft, instructors, designated examiners, availability of ground school and simulators.Apart from clearing DGCA exams and medical tests, completing 200 flying hours is a key requirement to earn a commercial pilot licence (CPL) in India. However, the long time it usually takes to do so due to multiple factors like availability of planes and instructors — apart from other concerns like safety and quality of training at many schools — sends a large number of aspiring Indians pilots abroad every year for CPL training.As reported by TOI on March 23, 2025, DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai decided to bring in transparency on FTOs. He sought to do so by requiring them to put information in public domain, based on which students choose them. The aim is to make them competitive, safer and student-friendly. Setting that plan in motion, DGCA wrote to all flying schools in country Friday. “FTOs advised to maintain a dedicated website… it must be updated regularly. Specified information must be prominently displayed and kept current,” DGCA’s letter states.",Aspiring commercial pilots in India will now be able to make an informed choice for a flying training organisation (FTO) to learn the ropes.

RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh high court (HC), citing a woman’s adulterous conduct, ruled against her plea for maintenance from her estranged husband.Justice Arvind Kumar Verma gave the ruling while hearing two criminal revision petitions challenging a Raipur family court order to the husband to pay Rs 4,000 monthly maintenance to his wife. Both the parties had challenged the decision — the husband sought complete annulment while the wife demanded it to be increased to Rs 20,000.The husband’s counsel argued the wife was not eligible for maintenance as she was in an adulterous relationship with his younger brother. This was established through a divorce decree granted by the family court on Sept 8, 2023, the counsel said.Family court overlooked this crucial evidence & disregarded CrPC section 125(4), which explicitly disallows maintenance for a wife living in adultery or leaving her marital home without a valid reason, the counsel said.The wife’s counsel refuted the adultery claim, arguing that any past extramarital affair was not a ‘continuous act’. The counsel stressed that “living in adultery” necessitates an ongoing illicit relationship, which they claimed was not the case as the wife was then living with her brother and sister-in-law. They argued that Rs 4,000 in maintenance was not enough, considering the wife’s lack of independent income and the husband’s alleged multiple revenue sources.HC observed that the divorce decree, granted on the grounds of the wife’s adultery, constituted legal proof of her disqualification under section 125(4) CrPC.HC allowed the husband’s revision petition and set aside the family court’s maintenance order. The wife’s petition seeking enhancement of maintenance was dismissed.","Justice Arvind Kumar Verma gave the ruling while hearing two criminal revision petitions challenging a Raipur family court order to the husband to pay Rs 4,000 monthly maintenance to his wife.

GANDHINAGAR: Union home and cooperation minister Amit Shah announced Sunday that Centre will introduce soon a new policy for speedy liquidation of defunct primary agricultural credit societies ( PACS ) and registration of new ones.He outlined a target to establish two lakh new PACS by 2029, with 22 designated business activities aimed at ensuring financial stability and long-term viability. “The work of connecting 22 different types of businesses with PACS was done by Union govt and I am sure arrangements have been made to ensure not a single registered PACS becomes financially sick,” he added. He was speaking at a “Sahakari Sammelan” held at Science City in Ahmedabad to mark International Year of Cooperatives . Over 4,000 delegates representing 800 cooperative institutions attended the event.PACS provide short-term and medium-term loans to farmers for agricultural activities, operating at village level. They promote financial inclusion, offer affordable credit, and support rural economic development by reducing dependence on informal moneylenders.Among the business avenues encouraged for PACS are cooperative-owned manufacturing units for products such as ice cream, paneer, and other cheese. Shah highlighted a plan to promote a circular economy in the dairy sector by forming cooperatives to process skin, bones, and horns of deceased livestock.The Union minister said India’s cooperative movement , born during the freedom struggle, had faltered in several regions but remained strong in Gujarat. “It is the responsibility of cooperative leaders in Gujarat to make the growth of the movement symmetric,” he said.Shah also reviewed progress of “cooperation among cooperatives” pilot project, initially launched in Banaskantha and Panchmahal districts and now expanded statewide. He reported that 60% of the project has been completed and that deposits in cooperative banks have risen by Rs 11,000 crore.“All members of cooperatives, dairies, agriculture produce marketing committees (APMCs), and PACS should have accounts in cooperative banks,” he said.","Amit Shah outlined a target to establish two lakh new PACS by 2029.

Here’s what Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath wrote on X (formerly Twitter)

""Here's something worrying from a recent earnings call of a beverage maker: Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever. Even Indian companies have said something similar. Remember, India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic.""

Diabetes is a ticking time bomb for India. We have the largest number of people with diabetes in the world.

There was a time when people used to call diabetes a rich person's disease. But that's no longer the case. According to a recent study, 21 crore Indians are living with diabetes.

Poll Do you believe increasing soft drink consumption is a significant health risk for India? No, I don't think so Yes, it's a serious concern

The scary part is the rate at which it's affecting young Indians. If you're a 20-year-old woman living in a city today, you have a 64.6% chance of developing diabetes during your lifetime. If you're a young man, your risk is also quite high at 55.5%.

But the sad part is there's a lack of awareness among people. About 27.5% of people with diabetes don't even know they have it. Even if they do know, very few people get treatment.

What makes this a serious crisis is that less than 20% of Indians have health insurance. Most Indians end up spending out of their pocket, which is a huge burden for poor and low-income households.

There's no magic bullet to solve this issue. We need multiple approaches, from public awareness campaigns, insurance coverage for the poor and vulnerable, to introducing early detection programs.

Simple lifestyle changes, like adding a few extra minutes of exercise each day or reducing time spent sitting, can make a big difference. Even small changes, such as walking or cycling for an extra five minutes a day, can lower the risk of diabetes.

We've been supporting founders and startups that are working on helping Indians become healthier, but this is a systemic challenge that needs all people involved—from individuals to the government—to take action.

Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to raise concerns about increasing soft drink consumption in India. In the post, Kamath cited a worrying trend from a beverage maker’s recent earnings. “Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever,” he wrote without naming the beverage company. Kamath linked the increased consumption of soft drinks to a broader health issue, pointing out that “India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic”. Notably, this is the second time when Kamath has warned against rising cases of diabetes in the country. He previously shared a post in November last year, calling Diabetes 'a ticking time bomb for India.'Kamath quoted his previous post which he shared in November last year. He then wrote:","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to raise concerns about increasing soft drink consumption in India.

US woman praises India’s 10 best traits on social media

1. Affordable healthcare

2. Extensive and cost-effective public transportation

3. Rich and diverse food culture

4. Strong community and family bonds



5. Culture of resourcefulness and sustainability

6. Affordable and high-quality education

7. Vibrant festivals and cultural celebrations



8. Hard work and resilience

9. Flexible and adaptive labor market

10. Strong social networks and community support



India, a nation known for its rich cultural heritage and rapid economic growth, often surprises foreigners with its unique blend of tradition and modernity. One such admirer is Kristen Fischer , an American expat living in India, who recently highlighted ten practical aspects of Indian life that she believes the country excels at, compared to other parts of the world. In an Instagram video titled ""Things India Does Better,"" Fischer shared her firsthand observations on why India stands out, praising its affordability, strong community support, and cultural vibrancy. Her insights provide a refreshing perspective on the everyday strengths of Indian society that often go unnoticed.India’s healthcare system stands out for its affordability and accessibility, a factor that Fischer highlighted as one of the country’s biggest strengths. Unlike many Western countries where medical treatments can lead to financial strain, India offers high-quality medical services at a fraction of the cost. This affordability extends to everything from routine check-ups to complex surgeries, making healthcare accessible to a larger section of the population.Additionally, India is known for its world-class hospitals and medical professionals, with cities like Chennai, Mumbai, and Delhi emerging as medical tourism hubs. Patients from around the globe often travel to India for treatments like heart surgeries, joint replacements, and cosmetic procedures, drawn by the combination of advanced technology and cost-effectiveness.India boasts one of the world’s largest and most cost-effective public transportation networks. Fischer praised the country’s extensive rail system, which spans over 68,000 kilometers, connecting even the remotest corners of the nation. This network is complemented by affordable buses, autorickshaws, metros, and app-based ride-sharing services, providing convenient travel options for millions every day.For instance, the Delhi Metro, known for its punctuality and cleanliness, has become a model for other cities, while local trains in Mumbai are the lifeline for the city’s bustling workforce. The affordability of these options makes daily commuting more economical compared to many Western countries, where public transport can be significantly more expensive.Indian cuisine is renowned worldwide for its vibrant flavors, rich spices, and immense variety. Fischer noted that India’s diverse food culture is not only delicious but also remarkably affordable. From street food like samosas and chaat to elaborate regional dishes like Rajasthani thalis and Hyderabadi biryani, India offers a gastronomic experience that caters to every palate and budget.Moreover, the widespread use of fresh, locally sourced ingredients and centuries-old cooking techniques contribute to the health benefits and distinct flavors of Indian dishes. India’s food culture also emphasizes hospitality and sharing, reflecting the country’s deeply rooted community values.One of the most distinctive aspects of Indian society is its emphasis on close-knit family structures and strong community ties. Fischer highlighted this as a key strength, noting that Indian families often live together, providing a robust support system for both emotional and financial well-being.In India, it is common for multiple generations to share a household, creating an environment where family members can rely on each other during tough times. This sense of togetherness extends beyond the family unit to include neighbors and local communities, fostering a deep sense of belonging and mutual support.Fischer also praised India’s culture of resourcefulness, where people often repair, reuse, and recycle items rather than discarding them. This mindset minimizes waste and promotes sustainability, reflecting a practical approach to everyday living.In rural areas, this resourcefulness is evident in the widespread use of traditional farming techniques, reliance on locally sourced food, and innovative approaches to water conservation. Urban households, too, are increasingly embracing sustainable practices, from composting to using solar power, driven by a growing awareness of environmental issues.India’s education system, while facing challenges, also stands out for its affordability and quality. Fischer noted that India is home to some of the world’s most prestigious institutions, like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), which offer top-tier education at a fraction of the cost compared to their Western counterparts.This affordability extends to primary and secondary education, where many public and private schools provide high-quality instruction at reasonable fees, making education accessible to a broader population.India’s festivals, known for their color, energy, and inclusivity, are among the most vibrant in the world. Fischer appreciated the way these celebrations bring communities together, fostering a sense of unity and shared joy.From the lights of Diwali and the colors of Holi to the spiritual fervor of Eid and the grandeur of Durga Puja , Indian festivals reflect the country’s deep-rooted traditions and diverse cultural heritage. These celebrations often include family gatherings, community feasts, and elaborate rituals, creating lasting memories for participants.Fischer also highlighted the hardworking nature and resilience of Indians, who show remarkable adaptability in the face of challenges. This resilience is evident in the country’s thriving startup ecosystem, its rapid economic growth, and the determination of its people to overcome adversity.India’s labor market is known for its flexibility, which has fueled the growth of industries like information technology, business process outsourcing (BPO), and manufacturing. This adaptability has made India a global outsourcing hub, attracting companies from around the world seeking cost-effective solutions.Finally, Fischer emphasized the importance of strong social networks in India, where communities often come together to support each other during difficult times. This sense of community is reinforced by cultural values that prioritize relationships and collective well-being.","US woman praises India’s 10 best traits on social media.

No, it's more about AI and automation. Yes, cost-cutting is the main reason.

Management layers targeted despite ""delayering"" claims



Microsoft's recent round of layoffs has hit software engineers hardest, with over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state belonging to coding professionals, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.The Microsoft announced Tuesday it would cut around 6,000 workers company-wide, representing less than 3% of its 228,000-person workforce. The Washington state data represents roughly one-third of the total layoffs.Project management roles were also significantly impacted, with product management and technical program management positions accounting for nearly 30% of Washington cuts, Bloomberg reports.AI tools reshaping developer workforce.The layoffs come as Microsoft invests heavily in artificial intelligence technology that's beginning to automate aspects of software development. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects.""We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.The company has been scrutinizing costs while simultaneously pouring billions into AI infrastructure, with approximately $80 billion allocated for data center spending this fiscal year.Although Microsoft framed the cuts as an effort to ""reduce management layers,"" Bloomberg's analysis shows only about 17% of those laid off in Washington were classified as managers—roughly equivalent to their representation in the company's overall workforce.The cuts also affected some AI project managers, according to a person familiar with the matter, while relatively few customer-facing employees in sales and marketing were impacted.Microsoft joins other tech companies reshaping their workforces around AI capabilities. Salesforce plans to reduce engineering hiring in 2025 due to AI usage, while Workday announced in February it would continue hiring in strategic AI areas despite broader cuts.Microsoft declined to comment on the specific distribution of layoffs across job categories.","Microsoft announced Tuesday it would cut around 6,000 workers company-wide, representing less than 3% of its 228,000-person workforce.

“As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles.”

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s plan to cut bureaucracy at company

Amazon has reportedly fired 100 employees within its Devices and Services division . According to a report by Reuters, the company said the jobs represented a small number of the total for the unit and were part of its regular business review. The Devices and Services unit is responsible for developing popular hardware products such as the Echo smart speakers, Fire TV devices, and Ring security systems. To recall, Amazon also laid off some employees from Alexa-related jobs in 2023.In a statement given to Reuters, Amazon spokesperson said,While the full scope of the layoffs remains unclear, reports indicate that a variety of teams within the Devices and Services unit have been affected. This suggests a broad restructuring effort rather than targeting a specific product line.The layoffs come as Amazon continues to navigate a challenging economic environment. Like many other tech companies, Amazon has been focused on cost-cutting measures to improve efficiency and profitability. These measures have included workforce reductions across various divisions. Amazon has not yet released an official statement specifying the reasons for this particular round of layoffs.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees that building large teams and personal fiefdoms is not the path to advancement at the company, emphasizing instead that the e-commerce giant rewards those who accomplish more with fewer resources. Jassy's comments came during a recent all-hands meeting as Jassy continues his push to reduce management layers and bureaucracy across the organization.The CEO highlighted Amazon's commitment to operating with the agility of ""the world's largest startup"" despite its size. This initiative includes a recently completed effort to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% across the company. Rather than massive layoffs, Amazon achieved this goal by combining teams and moving some managers into individual contributor roles.Jassy also stressed the importance of meritocracy over bureaucracy in Amazon's corporate culture. He mentioned reviewing more than a thousand employee emails sent to a dedicated ""No Bureaucracy"" alias, which has already resulted in 375 process improvements.",Amazon has reportedly fired 100 employees within its Devices and Services division.

PUNE: Gyanprasad Yadav, who had moved to Pimpri Chinchwad from Uttar Pradesh two decades ago, was in tears as he helplessly watched Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation officials pulling down his dream home on Saturday. Earlier this year, his furniture shop in Kudalwadi was among more than 4,000 illegal establishments demolished by the civic body.""I lost my business a few months ago, and now I have lost the roof over my head,"" the 60-year-old said, adding that he invested around Rs35 lakh — his entire life's savings — in constructing the house.Many of the 36 owners, whose bungalows were razed by the civic body as they were located in the blue flood line of the Indrayani river in Chikhali, alleged that civic officials promised no action against their houses in exchange for bribes.""We were betrayed. For a one-storey structure, people paid Rs50,000, while for a two-storey building, we paid Rs1 lakh each. We were given water and electricity connections and have regularly paid property tax for the last four years. How can they now claim the homes were illegal?"" Mahendra Vispute asked.His son, Shailesh, who claimed that he is still paying a monthly EMI of Rs44,000 on a home loan, said they were misled by the developer.""He told us that the plots were in a residential zone.""Municipal commissioner Shekhar Singh told TOI that the action was carried out in accordance with an NGT order. ""If residents submit a written complaint that they paid money to PCMC officials to avoid demolition, we will investigate the matter. If the allegations are proved, the officials concerned will be suspended, and we will lodge a police complaint against them.""Shashikant Chaudhary, 43, said he had no option but to send his family to stay with relatives. ""I sold two acres of farmland and cleared out all my savings to raise nearly Rs70 lakh which I spent in building my only home in the city with good interiors. Now, everything has been reduced to rubble,"" he said.The joy of living in his own house was short-lived for Rehbar Shaikh, who, days ago moved in after spending more than 20 years in rented accommodation.Mahesh Patil, another owner, said the municipal corporation should have marked the blue flood line to prevent constructions. ""We received the Supreme Court order on May 9 and the corporation on May 15 asked us to vacate.

Malhotra was reportedly in contact with a Pakistan High Commission staffer in Delhi.





CHANDIGARH: Security agencies have claimed that YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra and three others who have been arrested for spying for Pakistan, were in touch with their handlers even during the recent confrontation, when blackouts were being imposed across north India.""Even on May 6, a day before Operation Sindoor, Malhotra went to New Delhi and was in touch with [her handler] Danish, a staffer of Pakistan high commission in Delhi, and others for the next few days. The same was the case for other accused,"" said a source. Since May 13, Haryana Police have arrested Nauman Elahi, an Uttar Pradesh resident who worked as a guard at Panipat; Devender Singh Dhillon, a resident of Kaithal; Malhotra, a resident of Hisar; and Arman, a resident of Rajaka village in Nuh. All accused are being questioned by multiple agencies. All of them are accused of spying for Pakistani handlers and sharing important information related to vital installations.Referring to Malhotra, Hisar SP Shashank Sawan said: ""In modern warfare, the enemy tries to set a positive narrative in its favour. The involvement of Malhotra suggests she helped them in setting narratives. This is how influencers and YouTubers are being roped in.""Though the SP refrained from sharing details, sources said her income was disproportionate to travel expenses she could have incurred, and some of her trips abroad could be sponsored. Sawan said Jyoti had been on the radar of central agencies for long, and the agencies had also put another YouTuber from Odisha under scanner.Referring to Arman, agencies have established that he was in touch with Pakistani handlers through a terrorist and had also arranged Indian mobile SIM cards for officers of Pakistan intelligence operatives with his IDs. He specifically attended a defence expo and shared the details with Pakistani agencies. In his early 20s, Arman is a Class XII dropout and would carry a bag, claiming to be in search of a job in New Delhi.

PATHANKOT: Channi Beli , a village in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh (HP), bordering the Pathankot district of Punjab, has emerged as a major hub for the production of both traditional desi liquor made from jaggery (gur) and a more dangerous variant made with ethyl alcohol Startlingly, over forty percent of those involved in the brewing and distribution of this illicit liquor are women.In the wake of the devastating Majitha hooch tragedy that claimed 27 lives, the Pathankot police launched an aggressive campaign against the illicit liquor trade and uncovered a major operation centred in the Channi Beli village.""We received a tip-off about a major racket involving the brewing of illicit liquor using jaggery, and also produced by mixing with ethyl alcohol. A raid was then conducted in the village, where we discovered that nearly every second home was involved in the trade of making illicit liquor,"" said Senior Superintendent of Police, Pathankot, Daljinder Singh Dhillon.He said that the raid was carried out in collaboration with officials from the excise department. During the operation, they recovered 15 active working stills, 1.75 lakh litres of lahan, and 35 drums containing 7,000 litres of ethyl alcohol, which was being used to produce the illicit liquor.Dhillon said they informed the Nurpur, HP, police and asked them to take further action against those involved in the illicit liquor trade in the Channi Beli village. He said that they found nearly all the women in the households of those producing illicit liquor were involved in one or more aspects of the liquor-making process. Strangely, sixty-five percent of the illicit liquor recovered was made by mixing ethyl alcohol, he added.Sources informed that the village’s location in the Kangra district of HP, just across the Punjab border, has made it a strategic base for the illicit trade. When pursued by Punjab police, peddlers often flee into the hilly terrain of HP or blend into the plains of Punjab, taking advantage of the jurisdictional divide.Dhillon said that further investigations revealed that the majority of bootleggers, including forty percent of women, from the Majha and Doaba regions of Punjab, procure illicit liquor from Channi Beli and then distribute it in their respective regions.","Channi Beli is a village in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh (HP), bordering the Pathankot district of Punjab.

NEW DELHI: YouTuber and travel vlogger Jyoti Malhotra , arrested on Saturday for spying for Pakistan, had saved the phone numbers of her handlers under misleading aliases, one of them being ""Jatt Randhawa"", in an attempt to evade detection.This was not just a casual precaution but part of a pattern that points to her deep involvement with Pakistan’s intelligence network.Her digital trail, they say, reveals a methodically groomed 'asset' who had gradually transitioned from a content creator to a conduit of sensitive information.Jyoti, a 34-year-old graduate from Hisar and daughter of a retired official from Haryana’s power distribution department, had been in consistent touch with at least three Pakistani operatives.Her first point of contact was reportedly Ehsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish, a Pakistani High Commission official in Delhi, whom she met during an event in 2023.Danish facilitated the extension of her Pakistani visa, arranged accommodation in Lahore, and introduced her to other handlers, including one Shakir and a man identified as Rana Shahbaz.Officials say a Pakistani official, who was expelled from India on May 13 for espionage, was also in an intimate relationship with Jyoti.She had even accompanied him on a trip to Bali.Police sources said Jyoti’s communication with her Pakistani handlers was routed through encrypted apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Snapchat, and that she consciously used deceptive contact names like ""Jatt Randhawa"" to mask these interactions.This tactic, officials believe, was aimed at dodging any scrutiny of her phone by Indian authorities or acquaintances. She later admitted to sharing details considered sensitive—mostly related to Indian locations and events—with her Pakistani contacts, a clear violation of the Official Secrets Act.Jyoti’s arrest came just days after she returned from a trip to Delhi on May 6, during which she is said to have met Danish again. Notably, this meeting took place a day before Operation Sindoor, a national-level security drill involving blackout simulations across north India.Investigators say her continued contact with handlers during this sensitive time, mirrored by three other accused also arrested in Haryana—set off alarms across multiple agencies. Jyoti was remanded in five-day police custody and is currently being interrogated by central and state intelligence teams.Her social media profile—particularly her YouTube channel Travel with Joe and Instagram account—showcases picturesque travel vlogs, including her visits to Pakistan, which she had undertaken multiple times. She has 3.2 lakh subscribers on YouTube and over 13 lakh followers on Instagram.Her second pinned post on Instagram hails Lahore as “the cultural heart of Pakistan.” Police say these platforms were used not only to showcase travel but also to subtly promote pro-Pakistan sentiments. “This is modern-day warfare,” said Hisar SP Shashank Sawan.Further complicating the case, Jyoti had claimed to be part of a 'delegation' that visited Pakistan in 2023, a visit during which she deepened her links with Pakistani intelligence officials.During her second trip to Pakistan, on Danish’s advice, she came in contact with another operative, Ali Ahsan, who is believed to have formally introduced her to the country’s intelligence apparatus. Forensic teams are now examining her digital devices and financial transactions to trace possible funding routes that may have supported her frequent international travel.Jyoti’s arrest is the third in a series of espionage cases in Haryana this week. Police also nabbed Nauman Elahi, a security guard in Panipat; Devender Singh Dhillon from Kaithal; and Arman, a young man from Nuh’s Rajaka village.Arman, obtained Indian SIM cards using his own documents and passed them to Pakistani handlers.He reportedly attended a defence expo and shared material from the event. Agencies say he was in contact with operatives via a terrorist intermediary and often posed as a jobseeker while gathering information in Delhi.","Jyoti Malhotra, a 34-year-old graduate from Hisar, was arrested on Saturday for spying for Pakistan.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Election Results 2025: Why AAP Lost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-election-results-2025-aap-lost-reasons-arvind-kejriwal-new-delhi-manish-sisodia-bjp-modi-incumbency-corruptio-sheesh-mahal-liquor-freebies-congress-rahul/articleshow/118023276.cms,"Here are 10 reasons behind AAP's defeat:



Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Trump's big bill advances in rare weekend vote as conservative holdouts secure changes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-big-bill-advances-in-rare-weekend-vote-as-conservative-holdouts-secure-changes/articleshow/121258953.cms,"The bill includes tax cuts, increased border security spending and modifications to Medicaid and other programs (Image: AP)





Republicans advanced their massive tax cut and border security package out of a key House committee during a rare Sunday night vote as deficit hawks who blocked the measure two days earlier reversed course after gaining commitments on the package's spending cuts.Speaker Mike Johnson met with Republican lawmakers shortly before the meeting, telling reporters that the changes agreed to were ""just some minor modifications. Not a huge thing.""Democrats on the panel pressed for more details about the changes that Republicans had agreed to in the private negotiations. But Representative Jodey Arrington, the chairman of the House Budget Committee , said he could not do so.""Deliberations continue at this very moment,"" Arrington said. ""They will continue on into the week, and I suspect right up until the time we put this big, beautiful bill on the floor of the House.""The first time Republicans tried advancing the bill out of the House Budget Committee, deficit hawks joined with Democratic lawmakers in voting against reporting the measure to the full House. Five Republicans voted no, one on procedural grounds, the other four voicing concerns about the bill's impact on federal budget deficits.On Sunday evening, the four voicing concerns about the bill's impact on the deficit voted present, and the measure passed by a vote of 17-16.Johnson is looking to put the bill on the House floor before the end of the week.""This is the vehicle through which we will deliver on the mandate that the American people gave us in the last election,"" he said on "" Fox News Sunday.""The Republicans who criticized the measure noted that the bill's new spending and the tax cuts are front-loaded in the bill, while the measures to offset the cost are back-loaded. For example, they are looking to speed up the new work requirements that Republicans want to enact for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those requirements would not kick in until 2029 under the current bill.""We are writing checks we cannot cash, and our children are going to pay the price,"" said Representative Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the committee. ""Something needs to change, or you're not going to get my support.""Johnson said the start date for the work requirements was designed to give states time to ""retool their systems"" and to ""make sure that all the new laws and all the new safeguards that we're placing can actually be enforced.""Roy was joined in voting no by Representatives Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma and Andrew Clyde of Georgia. Representative Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania switched his vote to no in a procedural step so it could be reconsidered later, saying after the hearing he was confident Republicans would ""get this done."" Johnson said talks to deal with their concerns were continuing Sunday.Remarkably, the vote against advancing the bill came after President Donald Trump had called on Republicans in a social media post to unite behind it.""We don't need 'GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party,"" Trump posted. ""STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!""At its core, the sprawling package permanently extends the existing income tax cuts that were approved during Trump's first term, in 2017, and adds temporary new ones that the president campaigned on in 2024, including no taxes on tips, overtime pay and auto loan interest payments. The measure also proposes big spending increases for border security and defense.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group, estimates that the House bill is shaping up to add roughly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade.Democrats are overwhelmingly opposed to the measure, which Republicans have labelled ""The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act."" Representative Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called it, ""one big, beautiful betrayal"" in Friday's hearing.""This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,"" Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-SC, told CNN's ""State of the Union'' on Sunday. ""There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.""Johnson is not just having to address the concerns of the deficit hawks in his conference. He's also facing pressure from centrists who will be warily eyeing the proposed changes to Medicaid, food assistance programs and the rolling back of clean energy tax credits. Republican lawmakers from New York and elsewhere are also demanding a much large state and local tax deduction As it stands, the bill proposes tripling what's currently a $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction, increasing it to $30,000 for joint filers with incomes up to $400,000 a year.Representative Nick LaLota, one of the New York lawmakers leading the effort to lift the cap, said they have proposed a deduction of $62,000 for single filers and $124,000 for joint filers.If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republican lawmakers are also eyeing changes that could make final passage in the House more difficult.Johnson said: ""The package that we send over there will be one that was very carefully negotiated and delicately balanced, and we hope that they don't make many modifications to it because that will ensure its passage quickly.""","The bill includes tax cuts, increased border security spending and modifications to Medicaid and other programs. Five Republicans voted no, one on procedural grounds, the other four voicing concerns about the bill's impact on federal budget deficits. Speaker Mike Johnson is looking to put the bill on the House floor before the end of the week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121259136,imgsize-1620837,width-400,resizemode-4/121259136.jpg"
