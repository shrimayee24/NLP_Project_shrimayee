BJP-AAP vote share gap is quite small. So, what swung the election decisively in BJP’s favour? Some short takes:

Saffron's long march

Taking the middle out



‘Fakes’ among freebies

Brand Kejriwal loses sheen



Modi hai toh…

NEW DELHI: The national capital on Saturday witnessed a saffron tsunami with the BJP securing a resounding victory in all parliamentary constituency areas, winning 48 out of 70 assembly seats.Aam Aadmi Party, however, maintained a stronghold in Muslim- and Dalit-dominated constituencies.What seemed to have worked in favour of the BJP was the, middle class andfactor (excise policy case), along with the ""sheeshmahal"" attack on AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal during the poll campaign.What seemed to not have worked in AAP's favour were issues like poor roads, traffic congestion, Yamuna pollution, and poor air quality.BJP’s campaign for Delhi started much before polls were announced. Every bad headline against AAP was followed by a sustained BJP campaign, hurting the incumbent. Closer to elections, ‘sheesh mahal’, as BJP cleverly named the generously refurbished CM residence, hurt AAP’s image even more.After initially criticising AAP’s freebie game, BJP, too, made populist promises with gusto. BJP also talked up the idea of a double-engine sarkar, even as perceptions of govt dysfunctionality took hold, in part thanks to the LG-AAP fight. By the time polls were held, many voters had bought BJP’s argumentVote-share stats make it clear AAP has lost little of its core low-income vote. BJP would have always strategised with that assumption — and therefore it targeted Delhi’s neo-middle class and middle class, who were more upset with the state of roads, traffic, Yamuna, and air pollution than they were impressed by free water, power and primary health care.To that, BJP added the announcement of the 8th Pay Commission — Delhi voters include many govt employees and their families — and the Budget’s income tax cuts.BJP campaigned hard against some elements of AAP’s welfare policy regime. ‘Fake medicines’ and ‘ghost patients’ in free mohalla clinics was one such campaign. AAP contested these claims hotly.But some of those charges stuck when coupled with demonstrable failures like Yamuna ﬂowing as dirty as ever and desperate AAP claims like Haryana’s BJP govt ‘poisoning’ Yamuna water.That AAP suffered big losses in seats along the Haryana border tells this story powerfully.Kejriwal started as a ‘humble man of the people’ who didn’t want to stay in govt bungalows. But he came into these polls as a very different leader. He and his colleagues didn’t recognise that aside from anti-incumbency against AAP, there was anti-incumbency against Kejriwal himself.When things turned against AAP, Modi’s appeal, dormant in the last two assembly polls, came to the fore. He was front and centre in BJP’s campaign and his sharp attacks and promises of smooth coordination between the Centre and Delhi made an appreciable difference","The BJP secured a resounding victory in all parliamentary constituency areas, winning 48 out of 70 assembly seats.

KejriWall to KejriFall: How a crusader lost his way & vision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kejriwall-to-kejrifall-how-a-crusader-lost-his-way-vision/articleshow/118080246.cms,"Once upon a time, there was an Arvind Kejriwal . A crusader against corruption, he brought back forgotten words, such as integrity and idealism, into the political discourse and created immense possibilities of an alternative model of clean governance. His first swearing-in ceremony at Ramlila Maidan in the winter of 2013 didn’t feel like a momentary celebration of people’s power.It was more like the beginning of a movement for positive change in the way politics was conducted in the country. Thousands of ageing men and women had turned up from every corner of India Ignored, from distant states like Telangana and Tamil Nadu. Even his off-key rendition of, “Insaan ka insaan se ho bhaichara ” (film: Paigham), was no dampener.For them, in short, Kejriwal was an icon of hope for a new, fearless India.In the weeks and months that followed, Kejriwal grew in reputation as an individual and politician. Often dressed in a bush shirt, carrying a cheap ballpoint pen in his shirt pocket and wearing ordinary chappals, he became the perfect picture of austerity. And he kept his electoral promise of free water and electricity, schemes that endeared him to the city’s teeming lower-income class.When AAP , formed in 2012, returned a second time to office in 2015 with a crushing majority to stop the ModiShah juggernaut, Kejriwal became a hero of everyone opposed to BJP. And, yes, despite the ever-present cough and the comforting muffler around his head, he slept on the streets of Delhi in the winter cold as a protesting chief minister. Those days the former-IRS-of ficer-turned-activist-turned-politician — also a recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay award — walked the talk.But over the years, slowly but surely, the hallowed persona of a CM with a frugal lifestyle wore off. And, on Saturday, the after-effect was seen in the outcome of the Delhi assembly polls. Two full terms and 49 days since it first assumed office in 2013, AAP suffered a shattering and humbling defeat. And Kejriwal, the party’s founder and beating heart, who had once bested then formidable CM Sheila Dixit by over 25,000 votes, lost his own seat by more than 4,000 votes. AAP still managed a healthy 44% votes, but that’s 9 percentage points lower than the previous assembly polls.Journalist Ashutosh, formerly a prominent member of AAP, says that two things massively damaged Kejriwal’s image: the 2022 liquor case and the CM bungalow controversy. “Nobody expected a man, who used to say that ministers and CMs should be living in two-room flats, to spend over Rs 40 crore on his own bungalow. Kejriwal entered politics hoping to change it. In stead, politics changed him,” he says.The multi-crore liquor case, which is still in court, led to Kejriwal spending five months in Tihar. These developments, says Ashutosh, caused Kejriwal to lose his moral aura in the last five years. “It was his calling card in the first three assembly elections, the reason for AAP’s massive victories in 2015 and 2020,” he says.Social commentator Santosh Desai, too, talks about the chipping away of the AAP leader’s personal aura due to the liquor case and the house renovation controversy. But he also adds that BJP stymied Kejriwal and his party from any meaningful local government action. “Their hands were tied and the room to manoeuvre was dramatically reduced,” he says.Desai also says that Kejriwal’s situation was akin to someone who, to stay politically relevant, reaches a place unrecognisable from the original point of his journey. “He may not be communal personally, but to neutralise the right wing, he started practising a version of it, so that the party is not vulnerable on that front. Kejriwal lost clarity on who he was and what he represented, enabling the BJP to maximise on the situation to its advantage. Put together, it created a situation where the public felt that Kejirwal was no longer the figure he once was,” he says.Free electricity (200 units), free water (20 kilolitres), improved govt schools, better functioning of govt hospitals (including free medicine) — Kejriwal created a positive playbook for freebies that exhilarated the lower-income classes, making them his dedicated constituency. AAP also offered free bus rides to women, but the deteriorating condition of Delhi’s roads and the unchecked pollution underlined that the party wasn’t paying enough attention to its core jobs and the city’s middle class.Desai says that AAP took its eyes off the ball, from its main calling card, which is taking civic governance seriously. “They were just living off what was done in their early years. After that, it became much more about retention of power,” he says.Political scientist Dipankar Gupta offers a fresh angle to the list of explanations. He says that AAP emerged out of a movement but, over the years, lost the “movement dimension” — participatory, enthusiastic and goal-oriented — of the party. “Without the ‘movement’ element, it lost its raison d’etre and became a competitor of the established parties. Structurally, AAP was never an administration-oriented party,” he says.Hilal Ahmed of CSDS offers a similar view. He avers that AAP had lost its ideological uniqueness even before this election. “The cadres or leaders associated with it were relying heavily on the success of the party over the years. After this defeat they might not find any attraction in the party or the figure of Kejriwal,” he says.So what next for Kejriwal?“He must find a new language for democracy, not just representation and election. Otherwise, he will remain caught up in the numerical pathology of the welfare state,” says social scientist Shiv Visvanathan. In other words, Kejriwal needs to reinvent his politics. The question is: does the street-fighter of the past have the stomach for a scrap in a hopelessly slanted battle?","Arvind Kejriwal was an icon of hope for a new, fearless India.

"Day after governor rejection, Karnataka government says it'll tweak and send back microfinance ordinance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/day-after-governor-rejection-karnataka-government-says-itll-tweak-and-send-back-microfinance-ordinance/articleshow/118079921.cms,"BENGALURU: A day after Governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot rejected Karnataka Micro Finance (Prevention of Coercive Actions) Ordinance 2025, state government said it would address his concerns, rework and resend the proposal for approval within a day or two.Gehlot raised concerns over potential regulatory excesses and termed the proposed penal provisions - up to 10 years of imprisonment and Rs 5 lakh fine - disproportionate.He also suggested that state government introduce a comprehensive law in the upcoming budget session rather than rushing an ordinance.Home minister G Parameshwara, responding to governor's observations, said, ""He has made suggestions to take it up at upcoming legislature session beginning March 3 but we wanted to put a law in place urgently, as reports of suicides and harassment cases due to microfinance lending are increasing daily.""Parameshwara defended the stringent penalties, arguing they serve as a deterrent. ""The fine is imposed on those who commit wrong. I don't know in what context the governor made these observations, but our intent is to curb harassment in the larger public interest,"" he said.Gehlot, while rejecting the ordinance, had pointed out that the maximum loan amount under microfinance schemes is Rs 3 lakh, making a Rs 5 lakh fine excessive.He also suggested that existing legal provisions under Karnataka Money-Lenders Act, 1961, Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, Karnataka Debt Relief Act, 1976 and Karnataka Police Act already empower the authorities to curb coercive recovery practices. He stressed that better enforcement of these laws could regulate the sector more effectively.Parameshwara acknowledged differences in approach but emphasised the need for a dedicated law.Karnataka government is now set to address the governor's concerns and resubmit the ordinance, keeping its objective of preventing borrower harassment intact.","Governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot rejected Karnataka Micro Finance (Prevention of Coercive Actions) Ordinance 2025.

How Jodhpur's restored stepwells are becoming cultural hubs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-jodhpurs-restored-stepwells-are-becoming-cultural-hubs/articleshow/118079874.cms,"OLD SPACE, NEW USE: Surface, an exhibition at Toorji ka Jhalra, uses the heritage setting dating back to the 1740s to showcase the country’s rich textile traditions

On a typical afternoon at Jodhpur's Toorji ka Jhalra , an ancient stepwell within the walled part of the old city, one can spot local teens flinging themselves off its intricately carved ledges before vanishing into the cool, green water below only to surface seconds later, grinning. A few steps away, a photographer trains his camera on a young couple against its ancient carvings while a weary tourist lounges on another step with his headphones on.Nearby, a sarangi player keeps passersby entertained with familiar Rajasthani folk tunes appropriated by Bollywood.Watching them, it's almost impossible to believe that this 18th-century relic was a dumping ground, buried under decades of stagnant water, not too long ago.Commissioned in the 1740s by Maharaja Abhaya Singh's queen, Toor, in keeping with the tradition of royal women patronising public waterworks, these cisterns - shaped like upside-down pyramids - were a lifeline in the desert. Persian wheels, powered by oxen, once hauled up water from their sandstone recesses. But with modern plumbing, they fell into disuse. Until now.Toorji ka Jhalra too seemed destined for the same fate until it got a second chance. Today, it stands restored at the heart of Stepwell Square, an Insta-friendly hotspot with high-end boutiques, artisanal cafes, and a chic heritage hotel flanking its steps.The transformation began with a casual conversation between brothers Dhananjaya and Nikhilendra Singh, cousins of the Maharaja of Jodhpur. Fresh off their success restoring an 18th-century Rajput mansion into the luxury boutique hotel Raas, they wondered: ""Why can't we rejuvenate the whole neighbourhood?"" The idea birthed the JDH Urban Regeneration Project, an initiative using design, technology, fashion and culture to revive Jodhpur's gullies, havelis, and bazaars for contemporary creative use.Over the past fortnight, Toorji ka Jhalra and the havelis surrounding it have played host to Surface, an exhibition where Jodhpur's centuries-old architecture is in quiet conversation with textile traditions, with embroidered textile installations stretched, draped, and suspended across alcoves of old havelis.At Achal Niwas, one of the first things that catch your eye is the mehrab - the classic arch motif seen all over Jodhpur. Textile designer Chinar Farooqui reinterprets it in thread, deconstructed into embroidered panels filled with clusters of smaller arches, floral patterns, and jali screens - each a fresh take on an architectural silhouette that defined such homes.Inside Anoop Singh ki Haveli - a still-lived-in space where the family gathers for evening aarti, a patchwork of textiles tell a cross-country story - quilts from Bihar and Bhuj Lambani (Banjara) embroidery revived by the Porgai Artisans Association in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and even an Australia-India collaboration where aboriginal artists and embroiderers from Bengaluru have woven ancestral stories across continents.Curator Mayank Singh Kaul sees Surface as part of a larger effort to take exhibitions beyond institutional or sterile white cube spaces into communities. ""I've done similar projects at an old govt school in a weaving village in Andhra Pradesh, repurposing three heritage homes in Hampi's Anegundi and the 125-year-old Lakshmi Mills in Coimbatore for a show on khadi,"" he says."" These exhibitions, he says, act as ""mobile libraries,"" bringing textile archives to regions where such resources don't exist. ""They become reference points for designers, artisans and students who otherwise have no access.""To understand the scale of Jodhpur's stepwell revival, one has to look beyond Toorji ka Jhalra. Across the city, multipronged efforts are on to reclaim these subterranean marvels. ""Stepwells weren't just water sources,"" explains Anu Mridul, a Jodhpur-based architect leading several of the city's stepwell restoration efforts. ""They were community spaces. Merchants traveling on spice or silk routes would rest here and within cities, they served as gathering spots for locals. Sadly, most of them were abandoned once piped water became the norm,"" says Mridul whose team has restored several stepwells including the 300-year-old Mayla Bagh and Naulakha Bawdi, with work now underway at Tapi Bawdi, one of Jodhpur's oldest stepwells.Cleaning up a stepwell is just the first step, says Dhananjaya Singh. ""If you don't find a meaningful way to use a restored space, it fades into obscurity again."" One way is by turning them into cultural hubs, like Toorji ka Jhalra. At Mayla Bagh ka Jhalra, a 150-ft-deep stepwell built in 1775-76, Mridul has partnered with the non-profit Scwedia Foundation to maintain the space, provide Wi-Fi, and host public events. On any given day, students study its stones and architecture, locals lounge and play cards while some even bring their laptops to work.Sauryansh Singh of Scwedia has been at it for six months now. ""We've cleaned it up, added ambient lighting along the jharokhas and steps and are now building a transparent stage over the water, so performers will literally be floating while the audience watches from the perimeter,"" he says. Later this month, Mayla ka Jhalra will host a three-day festival of music, dance and talks. ""It's fascinating how a centuries-old structure can still supply water and generate revenue for the community,"" adds Mridul.","The JDH Urban Regeneration Project uses design, technology, fashion and culture to revive Jodhpur's gullies, havelis, and bazaars for contemporary creative use.

"NAAC adopts e-inspections, to start new accreditation models",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/naac-adopts-e-inspections-to-start-new-accreditation-models/articleshow/118079833.cms,"MUMBAI: In a decisive move to eliminate corruption and streamline the accreditation process, National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) has announced an immediate halt to physical inspections of colleges. Accreditation teams will now conduct evaluations entirely online, replacing on-campus visits with virtual assessments.For universities, though, the transition will be hybrid - most inspections will take place remotely, but a select number of reviewers will still visit campuses to maintain some level of direct oversight.The decision follows the recent Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrests in the case involving Andhra Pradesh-based Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation (KLEF), where members of the institution's management allegedly bribed NAAC peer visit inspectors to secure favourable ratings.""We decided to do all it takes to weed out elements of corruption. Cancelling physical visits will arrest the problem in a huge way,"" said NAAC executive committee chairman Prof Anil Sahasrabudhe. ""So many inspection visits take place every week, and it was very tough to monitor what transpired during these visits. Now, all this will be recorded.""NAAC director Ganesan Kannabiran called the shift to online inspection a ""surgical strike"" against corruption. ""NAAC's peer review system faced a challenging situation due to the recent CBI case. These are undesirable to the higher education system, and NAAC, being a quality assurance agency, is determined to eliminate such practices through definitive actions,"" he said.The long-anticipated basic (binary) accreditation model, recommended by the K Radhakrishnan Committee, was set for launch in July 2024 but did not take off. It has now been pushed to April-May 2025. The new timeline will also see the introduction of maturity-based graded levels (MBGL), a system designed to encourage institutions to enhance their academic and research capabilities. Special committees are finalising its framework.Around 650 institutions are in queue under the old grading system. Of these, nearly 50% are undergoing their second accreditation cycle and have been given the option to retain their current grade until the new system is in place. First-time applicants will have the choice to opt for the new basic accreditation model.

Delhi's Modi garden: BJP sweeps out AAP in big win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhis-modi-garden-bjp-sweeps-out-aap-in-big-win/articleshow/118079653.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi has once again proved that he can pull out big wins, this time by leading BJP to a historic victory in the Delhi assembly elections This triumph not only marks BJP's return to office in the Capital after a gap of 26 years, but it also shatters the ""myth"" that PM Modi's appeal is confined to national elections .The Delhi polls were seen as a litmus test for Modi's influence beyond the national stage as the saffron party didn't project any face and the PM was the sole mascot.His critics had long argued that while Modi could secure a landslide for BJP in national elections, his charm was less effective in state-level contests due to localised issues and regional identities. However, the results from Delhi tell a different story. BJP, under Modi's leadership, has not only won but has done so decisively, clinching 48 out of 70.Modi's campaign strategy in Delhi was multi-faceted, focusing on development, governance and a personal connection with the electorate. Unlike previous elections where regional leaders often took precedence, Modi himself became BJP's mascot for these polls.His rallies were not just about national achievements such as the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya or the abrogation of Article 370 but also addressed Delhi-specific issues like pollution, infrastructure gaps and the cleaning of Yamuna.This victory underscores Modi's ability to translate his national narrative into local victories, blending his overarching vision for India with the immediate needs of Delhi's residents. His speeches, particularly the one at the BJP headquarters post-victory, emphasised building Delhi as a ""modern city"" with a focus on urban infrastructure, mobility and heritage preservation, resonating with the urban voter's aspirations.The political narrative around Modi's electoral ""invincibility"" has been a subject of debate.In the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP under Modi swept all seven seats in Delhi, reinforcing his image as a national leader with strong voter appeal. However, the Delhi assembly elections of 2015 and 2020 saw AAP under Arvind Kejriwal clinch victories, fuelling the narrative that Modi's influence might not extend to regional politics. Saturday's result challenges that notion, showing that Modi's personal guarantees and BJP's campaign strategy can indeed sway voters at both levels.Moreover, this victory comes at a time when BJP's national popularity had shown signs of plateauing after the 2024 general elections, where it fell short of an outright majority.The Delhi win, coming close on the heels of Haryana and Maharashtra, is seen as a rejuvenation of Modi's political aura, proving that his leadership can still sway voters in regional contests.BJP's strategy also involved highlighting governance failures of AAP, especially when it came to allegations of corruption against its leaders, which played a significant role in swaying public opinion. Modi's promise to make Delhi a part of the 'Viksit Bharat' vision, aligning local governance with national development goals, was well-received.The Delhi outcome not only dispels the myth about Modi's limited regional appeal but also sets a precedent for how national leaders can engage with state politics.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh!

Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle.

NEW DELHI: Riding on the wave of recent successes in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections just a few months ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) registered a big win in the Delhi assembly elections. Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party suffered an embarrassing loss as most of its heavyweights lost the contest.The BJP secured a significant victory in Delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly.AAP , which had dominated the previous two terms with a substantial majority, managed only 22 seats. The Congress party failed to secure any seats for the third straight time.The BJP and its NDA allies celebrated the Delhi win, attributing it to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. The Congress, however, maintained that the results reflected a verdict on AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal rather than Modi's governance.The Congress defended its decision to contest against Aam Aadmi Party, criticising those who questioned their stance. They pointed out that similar concerns about opposition unity were not raised when AAP contested elections in Goa, Gujarat, Haryana and other states, potentially dividing the secular vote.The BJP, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept the Delhi assembly elections with a comfortable majority. This victory marks the third major electoral success for the BJP in the last four months after winning the states of Haryana and Maharashtra. With this, the 27 years exile of the BJP in Delhi also comes to an end. This major win also indicates approval by the middle class to Modi government’s big tax relief in the Union budget 2025 last week have got the approval of middle-class consumers.With this, PM Modi yet again proves to be the star campaigner for the BJP.In a high-stakes battle for New Delhi assembly seat, BJP leader Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant slayer by defeating former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal by 4,089 seats.Son of former CM Sahib Singh Verma, Parvesh was was entrusted to take on Kejriwal who has held in to the seat last three times. In 2013, Kejriwal had emerged as giant slayer by defeating then CM and Congress veteran Sheila Dixit.After dethroning the three-time CM, Verma is also in now a strong contender for the top post.BJP leader Tarvinder Singh Marwah emerged as another giant slayer as he defeated former deputy CM and AAP senior leader Manish Sisodia. Marwah defeated three-time MLA Sisodia to win Jangpura seat by 675 votes. Sisodia had switched seats from Patparganj to Jangpura this time hoping for a comfortable win.Marwah, who was in Congress for a long time and elected three-time MLA from Jangpura, had switched to BJP in 2022 after complaining of not getting time with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi for a meeting.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade As the heavyweights of Aam Aadmi Party fell one by one, Atishi stood tall and won the Kalkaji assembly seat. In a high-stakes contest, Atishi won by 3,521 votes defeating BJP's Ramesh Bidhuri and Congress's Alka Lamba.""I thank the people of Kalkaji for showing trust in me. I congratulate my team who worked against 'baahubal',"" Atishi said.""We accept the people's mandate. I have won but it's not a time to celebrate but continue the 'war' against the BJP,"" the 43-year-old said.Her victory is a standout for the AAP as its top leaders Arvind Kejriwal and former Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia lost their constituencies.With the defeat served to Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, Atishi may now also take charge as the leader of opposition in Delhi assembly.The Congress leader may have lost the contest today but he surely has emerged as the 'Baazigar' of this poll season. Son of veteran Congress leader and three-time CM Sheila Dikshit, Sandeep got his ultimate revenge against Arvind Kejriwal today.Though he did not win the New Delhi seat, he managed to eat in to Kejriwal's votes that eventually led to the AAP chief's defeat.It was a matter of prestige for Sandeep, who was finally given a ticket from New Delhi, his mother's bastion, which had been the stronghold of Kejriwal since 2013.It's no surprise there. The one at the top of this list is AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal. The politician, who rose to power as a anti-graft crusader found himself embroiled in corruption cases.After walking out of jail on bail, Kejriwal resigned from the top post seeking validation from the public of Delhi. The union territory, however, refused to give the stamp of 'Mr Clean' to Kejriwal.The AAP suffered a major blow this election and now will have to look at ways to reinvent itself.The former deputy chief minister of Delhi and second-in-command of AAP, Sisodia, also faced defeat against BJP candidate Tarvinder Singh Marwah in the Jangpura constituency.Having previously served as a three-term MLA from Patparganj in east Delhi, he chose to contest from Jangpura in this election.Following his arrest in 2023 over alleged corruption in the liquor policy case, Sisodia was imprisoned for approximately 18 months until he secured bail. Similar to Kejriwal's stance, he declined to accept a governmental position prior to receiving the ""people's verdict"".Delhi, however, decided to give him another chance this time.After governing Delhi for a decade, AAP faced significant anti-incumbency and lost the election to BJP. This is the first time since its inception that AAP will not hold power in Delhi.With the Delhi loss, AAP is now in power only in Punjab. With this, the national expansion plan of the party has hit a roadblock.The party will now have to regroup and reorganise itself as it now sits in opposition in Delhi.The Congress party has recorded its third consecutive blank in the Delhi assembly elections, marking a stark contrast to its earlier dominance when it governed the capital for 15 consecutive years from 1998 to 2013.Delhi's electorate has consistently rejected the party in three successive assembly elections.After snapping alliance with AAP for Delhi elections , Congress mounted an assertive campaign with former party president Rahul Gandhi spearheading the criticism against Arvind Kejriwal.Despite these efforts, the party failed to secure any constituencies in Delhi. Their sole minor comfort lies in achieving a modest improvement in vote share, rising by approximately 2% from its previous figure of less than 5% in the 2020 assembly elections.Omar Abdullah’s X post captured the mood of INDIA bloc today -- 'Aur lado aapas mein'. The jibe came as AAP and Congress fought against each other which eventually benefitted BJP.With the bitter and ugly fight and AAP’s eventual loss in Delhi, the focus now turns to if it's an end to INDIA bloc.The AAP defeat also comes as an embarassment to Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party who actively campaigned for AAP in Delhi.While Congress may have not been able to open its account in Delhi once again, Rahul Gandhi cannot be put in the list of losers. Rahul, who personally took charge to dent Kejriwal's image during the election campaign, was successful in his mission.The defeat also limits AAP within the INDIA bloc who had the capability to challenge Congress' position as a national party. The Delhi blow also gives Congress a little immunity within the bloc where allies SP, TMC, Sena (UBT) chose Kejriwal's party over Congress.","The BJP secured a significant victory in Delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly.

NEW DELHI: Delhi has given its verdict and its 'ghar wapsi' for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after 27 years. According to the Election Commission, the BJP has 47 of a total of 70 seats in its bag. Arvind Kejriwal's AAP, which has ruled the union territory for a decade, managed to get only 23 seats.This marks the third major win for the BJP in the last four months after Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections.The Aam Aadmi Party, established in 2012, secured governance in Delhi in 2013 and had maintained its administrative control since 2015.The Kejriwal/Atishi government, however, failed to fight anti-incumbency. AAP's recognition of public dissatisfaction was evident in its selection of candidates.Despite making eleventh-hour alterations to the list, these changes proved insufficient to address the negative perception of certain MLAs, who were criticised for being unreachable and distant from their constituents.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Union budget gambit seems to have paid off as Delhi decided to give BJP a chance after 27 years. With a focus on the middle class, the Union finance minister announced a big tax relief to middle class just three days before the Delhi elections.Kejriwal's AAP had emerged from middle-class dissatisfaction with existing political systems but is now largely perceived as an organisation focused solely on underprivileged sections, offering benefits like complimentary electricity units and free transport for women.Also read: Winners and Losers of Delhi assembly election 2025 Although Kejriwal attempted to address middle class issues during his pre-election addresses, these efforts appeared insufficient and delayed.Since 2013, Kejriwal's AAP government has been able to establish 'Delhi model' in which it implemented several freebies/welfare schemes for the underprivileged. The BJP, however, did an Uno reverse on AAP in Delhi and announced several freebies and incentives.The BJP leadership, including PM Modi, while previously criticising welfare programmes as 'revadis', took a notably different stance in Delhi. They explicitly assured voters that all existing AAP government schemes would continue under BJP rule. The PM's personal guarantee on this matter carried significant authority and effectively countered AAP's assertions that BJP governance would deprive the underprivileged of their current benefits.The party, in its three-part manifesto, promised financial assistance of Rs 2,500 monthly to women from poor families under 'Mahila Samriddhi Yojana', LPG cylinders for Rs 500 to women from poor families, and one free cylinder each on Holi and Diwali.After years of blame-game by the Kejriwal government, it seems people of Delhi have had enough. This time, Delhi decided to go for a ""double-engine sarkaar"", which promises effective governance with the BJP government in the state and at the Centre.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade During the elections led by PM Modi, the BJP went all out to attack Kejriwal for non-governance in the last decade. Kejriwal, on the other hand, had time and again blamed the Centre and the LG for creating hurdles. The AAP also attributed the deteriorating road conditions and inadequate civic infrastructure to project delays caused by the LG.The voters appear to have concluded that a BJP-led government would operate more effectively with the Centre-appointed LG.A big credit for the BJP's win in Delhi could also be given to Rahul Gandhi. The Congress leader took upon himself to personally roast and attack Kejriwal.During the campaign, he singled out Kejriwal and even equated him with PM Modi, alleging that they were two sides of the same coin. Taking a direct jab at the AAP supremo, Rahul had said, “Arvind Kejriwal WagonR mein aaye, sweater pehne aur khambe pe chadh gaye. Phir khambe se utre aur seedha sheesh Mahal mein gaye (Arvind Kejriwal came in a small car—a WagonR—wearing a sweater and climbed an electric pole. After coming down, he went straight to the 'Sheesh Mahal' (glass palace) with automatic doors and big TVs)"".The AAP had secured governance by pledging to eliminate corruption in Delhi. The party's reputation, however, faced significant challenges due to the liquor policy controversy and various corruption allegations against its leadership.Prominent AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh have been at the centre of corruption charges.After getting out on bail, Kejriwal resigned from the CM post and gave the charge to Atishi. He had sought validation as 'Mr. Clean' from the voters. Delhi, however, decided to not give him another chance.In 2020, reducing Delhi air pollution was one of the 10 “guarantees of Kejriwal”. However, this year, “Kejriwal’s guarantee” did not mention pollution anywhere. In the last 10 years, the AAP government has pointed fingers at neighbouring states and refused to take responsibility for air pollution.The BJP, however, vowed to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 levels by half in the next five years.Targetting Kejriwal, BJP also promised to clean Yamuna water in the next five years.Prime Minister Narendra Modi once again proved to be the star campaigner for the BJP. Despite having no CM face in Delhi, BJP registers yet another win in assembly elections riding on PM Modi's popularity. During the election campaign, PM Modi personally took charge of targeting Arvind Kejriwal.True to his style, PM Modi started calling Kejriwal's party an 'AAPda' (disaster) for Delhi. He also took 'Farziwal' jibes at Kejriwal accusing him of being fake and corrupt.In fact, PM Modi also focused on attacking Kejriwal during his Lok Sabha speech a day before Delhi elections.During the Delhi assembly elections, the BJP tailored its message and underplayed Hindutva this time. Focussing on the anti-incumbency of Kejriwal, BJP focussed on governance and middle class.Much of the BJP campaign targetted Kejriwal who, along with Manish Sisodia, was jailed in a corruption case relating to a now-scrapped liquor policy over the past two years. The relentless focus on Kejriwal’s ""sheesh mahal"" may have also helped the BJP sway public opinion in favour of the party.The BJP's comprehensive campaign strategy amplified the demand for transformation in Delhi, capitalising on AAP leader Kejriwal's diminishing reputation amidst corruption allegations and perceived deviation from his original principles, particularly highlighted by the 'sheesh mahal' controversy.BJP officials managing different regions in the capital noted that their extensive 2020 campaign failed to gain traction because voters associated AAP's initial five-year tenure with positive developments in education, healthcare, and popular welfare schemes including complimentary bus travel for women and free electricity.The absence of significant corruption allegations during AAP's first term contrasted sharply with the present scenario, with BJP strategists noting that the ruling party had few achievements to highlight from their second term.""Out vote share grew significantly even in 2020 but there was no serious erosion in AAP's vote share. This time we succeeded in chipping away at its support base while keeping our votes intact,"" a BJP leader said.The BJP has won Delhi elections, but it also has Congress to thank. Congress and AAP, allies under INDIA bloc, decided to contest the Delhi assembly elections individually. During the campaign, both AAP and Congress accused each other of being the B team of the BJP.Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi opened a personal attack on Kejriwal while the AAP chief also left no stone unturned to discredit Congress. Eventually, though Congress was not able to open its account in Delhi, the Gandhis definitely dealt a big blow to the credibility of Kejriwal.","Arvind Kejriwal's AAP, which has ruled the union territory for a decade, managed to get only 23 seats. According to the Election Commission, the BJP has 47 of a total of 70 seats in its bag. This marks the third major win for the BJP in the last four months after Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118061985,imgsize-1716105,width-400,resizemode-4/118061985.jpg"

AAP’s setback and Kejriwal’s challenges



AAP’s uncertain future



A shifting political landscape



What lies ahead?



NEW DELHI: In 2013, with a pen in his pocket, a muffler around his neck, loose sweater and blue WagonR, Arvind Kejriwal embodied the ""aam aadmi"" when he entered public life. His decision to name his political party after the ""aam aadmi"" resonated strongly with the public.After twelve years, the aspirations of establishing a nationwide party and emerging as a national leader are diminishing for the civil servant-turned-activist who ventured into politics by establishing his own party rather than joining an existing one.The Aam Aadmi Party , which governed Delhi for 10 consecutive years and established a government in Punjab, suffered defeat in the capital city's election on Saturday, securing 22 seats whilst the BJP won 48.In his statement, Kejriwal assured that AAP members would continue their social work, emphasising that politics was only a means to serve the people. However, his political future remains uncertain.Kejriwal’s loss after a decade in power, coupled with the defeat of several AAP heavyweights, raises crucial questions about the party’s governance, strategy, and long-term vision. The AAP, which once held a brute majority in the Delhi assembly, now faces an existential crisis, struggling to maintain its relevance.Adding to Kejriwal’s woes are multiple legal battles. He was jailed on corruption charges related to the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy and is currently out on bail. With ongoing investigations by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Kejriwal’s legal troubles are far from over. If convicted in the money laundering case, he could face a minimum of seven years in prison.Moreover, the Haryana government has filed a case against Kejriwal under the Disaster Management Act over his statement about ""poison"" in Yamuna water from Haryana. These legal entanglements make his political comeback even more challenging.Following the Delhi loss, AAP’s influence has been significantly curtailed. The party remains in power only in Punjab, and its expansion efforts in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Goa have yielded little success. With the party now leaderless in the Delhi assembly and its national ambitions derailed, AAP is at a crossroads.For Kejriwal, the road ahead may require a return to his roots—street-style activism, which first propelled him to prominence during the Anna Hazare movement. However, his biggest challenge will be keeping his party intact. AAP, once a force driven by volunteers and grassroots support, now risks fragmentation in the absence of political power.Nationally, Congress may see AAP’s weakening as an opportunity to reclaim lost ground in Delhi and beyond. Kejriwal’s diminished political standing could also make him a less favored ally among opposition parties, further isolating him in national politics.Speculation is already rife about Kejriwal potentially shifting focus to Punjab, where AAP still holds power. However, such a move could trigger further instability within the party and raise questions about its leadership structure.Kejriwal’s immediate focus will likely be on his legal battles. His political fate hinges on whether he can clear his name and rebuild his credibility. Meanwhile, AAP must reassess its strategies and find a way to stay relevant in the evolving political landscape.For now, both Kejriwal and AAP face their most challenging phase yet—navigating a period of political uncertainty, internal churn, and legal hurdles that could define their future trajectory.","The Aam Aadmi Party suffered defeat in the capital city's election on Saturday.

Delhi polls 2025: How good governance trumped freebies in assembly elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-polls-2025-how-good-governance-trumped-freebies-in-assembly-elections/articleshow/118070246.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi on Saturday joined a growing list of states where the lotus has managed to bloom with a vengeance. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which was struggling to even get double-digits in seat share in the past two assembly polls, won the election by securing a whopping 48 of 70 seats. Breaking the 27-year jinx, the BJP is again coming back to form the government in the national capital with the promise of development and good governance.The Aam Aadmi Party's defeat this time around has shown that freebie politics cannot hold its sheen for long if not coupled with on-the-ground development and infrastructure improvement.In this year's assembly election, BJP and Congress both followed the AAP's manifestos giving free electricity, water and bus services for women and even financial aid. This seemed like a freebies vs freebies contest where the BJP's advantage stemmed from two factors: voters' assessment of implementation records, with the BJP's performance in Madhya Pradesh outweighing AAP's shortcomings in Punjab; and the understanding that welfare schemes must be complemented by good governance.Reiterating the BJP's strategy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the party's historic win in Delhi, stating that ""development and good governance"" had won.""Jana Shakti is paramount! Development wins, good governance triumphs. I bow to my dear sisters and brothers of Delhi for this resounding and historic mandate to @BJP4India. We are humbled and honoured to receive these blessings. It is our guarantee that we will leave no stone unturned in developing Delhi, improving the overall quality of life for the people and ensuring that Delhi has a prime role to play in building a Viksit Bharat,"" he said in a tweet.Freebies, though a good strategy in the short term, failed to get votes for AAP this time. There was a lack of infrastructural development that raised questions among voters regarding AAP and its effectiveness in governance. In Delhi, AAP had promised to give clean tap water but there were many areas where the people didn't even have access to tap water. Long queues behind water tankers were a common sight across the city.For this year's elections, Kejriwal also promised to give financial support to priests, sparking a debate over whether the party's ideology revovled merely around ""revdi"" politics.In the last two elections, the AAP's main strong point was Mohalla clinics and municipal schools but one cannot fight only on the basis of these two pillars. Delhiites were looking for more evidence of developmental works that AAP had done in the last decade, and the party came up short.Another factor that lent itself to AAP's defeat was its frequent run-ins with the Lt Governor's office. Considering Delhi's governance structure under the National Capital Territory Act, the constant bickering created an impression of administrative inefficiency by AAP.Kejriwal's decision to retain his CM position whilst in custody over the excise policy scam case appeared to convince voters that administrative efficiency was being compromised for political advantage.This also resulted in postponed Cabinet sessions and administrative standstill. Saturday's results suggest that stepping down in March 2024 and maintaining ethical standards would have been a more prudent political strategy.",The Bharatiya Janata Party won the election by securing a whopping 48 of 70 seats.

NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party 's (AAP) loss in the Delhi assembly elections has sparked speculation about its political clout in Punjab, with opposition leaders in the state predicting a similar downfall.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured a decisive victory in Delhi, reclaiming power after 26 years and dealing a severe blow to Arvind Kejriwal 's AAP, whose senior leadership struggled to hold ground.This marks the second major setback for AAP following the 2024 Lok Sabha elections , in which the party secured only three of the 13 parliamentary seats in Punjab.In contrast, AAP had secured a sweeping victory in the 2022 Punjab assembly elections, winning 92 out of 117 seats.Before the Delhi polls, Punjab's AAP unit, including chief minister Bhagwant Mann , cabinet ministers, MPs, and MLAs, actively campaigned in the national capital.Mann, as the party’s key campaigner, conducted roadshows and highlighted the achievements of his government, such as providing 50,000 government jobs, offering 300 units of free electricity, setting up 850 'mohalla clinics,' and acquiring a private thermal power plant.With AAP now governing only Punjab, opposition parties in the state strongly criticised the party, asserting that the Delhi electorate has exposed its ""lies and deceit"".""It is a defeat of Arvind Kejriwal's lies, deceit and dishonesty. People of Delhi today showed that you cannot rule the state for long by making false promises,"" Punjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma told news agency PTI.He further claimed that AAP's governance had left Delhi in a ""miserable"" condition and warned that Punjab’s AAP leaders would face an even worse fate.Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa predicted internal strife within AAP’s Punjab unit, claiming, ""There would be an internal power struggle between Bhagwant Mann and Arvind Kejriwal.""He blamed the Delhi defeat on corruption, inefficiency, and arrogance within AAP's leadership.BJP leader Preneet Kaur expressed satisfaction over her party's victory, adding that AAP’s much-touted ""Delhi model"" failed to deliver on its promises.""We have seen that their ""Aam Aadmi clinics"" did not work here. What they had promised, they did not keep them,"" she said.Congress MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira described the outcome as a setback for ""fake revolutionaries"" who had failed to uphold their commitments on issues like VIP culture, Lokpal, Swaraj, and corruption.Punjab BJP vice president and former MLA Arvind Khanna called the Delhi mandate a rejection of AAP’s governance model, arguing that it signalled ""the beginning of AAP's downfall in Punjab as well"".He emphasized that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, India had experienced significant progress, making it crucial for Punjab to embrace BJP for real development.Union minister Ravneet Singh Bittu echoed similar sentiments on X, posting, ""History rewritten in Delhi! After 27 years, the people have given BJP a resounding mandate, embracing PM @narendramodi's vision of Viksit Bharat. This victory is a testament to trust, development, and a brighter future. Thank you, Delhi.""He further accused AAP of harbouring ""the most corrupt leaders"" and suggested that the party’s downfall in Punjab was imminent.With AAP facing a critical juncture, its future in Punjab remains uncertain as political opponents ramp up their attacks, sensing an opportunity to weaken the party’s hold on the state.","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured a decisive victory in Delhi, reclaiming power after 26 years.

NEW DELHI: 'Aur lado aapas mein' - J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah's tweet on Saturday said it all as the BJP ended the decade-long rule of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi. The decision of AAP and Congress, who were allies during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, to turn rivals in assembly elections may have played a big role in BJP's victory.Former chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, chose to contest independently, shutting down any possibility of an alliance with Congress even before the election dates were announced.According to the Election Commission of India (ECI), the BJP is set to form the government in Delhi after 27 years, with 47 seats, while AAP could secure only 23 seats. Congress, on the other hand, failed to open its account for the third consecutive time.The decision of AAP and Congress to go solo seems to have played a decisive role in splitting the anti-BJP vote.A closer analysis of the election data suggests that an AAP-Congress alliance could have altered the results in at least 15 seats. The combined vote share of the two parties in key constituencies like Rajinder Nagar, Chhatarpur, Sangam Vihar, Greater Kailash, and others shows that AAP could have emerged victorious had it contested with Congress’ support.With Congress failing to make an impact on its own, a partnership could have provided both parties with a stronger electoral footing.For instance, in Rajinder Nagar, AAP secured 45,440 votes while Congress got 4,015. If these votes were combined, AAP’s tally would have reached 49,455, enough to defeat the BJP. Similarly, in Chhatarpur, AAP’s 74,230 votes combined with Congress’s 6,601 would have pushed the total to 80,831, securing a win. The same pattern holds in other constituencies like Sangam Vihar, Greater Kailash, and Timarpur, where an alliance could have led to AAP’s victory.In seats like Badli and Nangloi Jat, Congress’s strong presence further underlines how a joint front could have been a game-changer. In Badli, AAP secured 35,668 votes while Congress got 31,130. Their combined tally of 66,798 would have comfortably beaten the BJP. Nangloi Jat tells a similar story, with AAP’s 48,907 votes and Congress’s 31,918 combining for a total of 80,825—enough to win the seat.Even in tight contests such as in Narela, where BJP barely edged ahead, an AAP-Congress alliance might have changed the final outcome.Beyond numbers, the election results signal a potential strategic miscalculation by AAP. While the party has governed Delhi for a decade, its recent friction with Congress over seat-sharing in other states might have influenced its decision to contest alone. The split in opposition votes ultimately benefited BJP, allowing it to regain control of Delhi after nearly three decades.","The BJP is set to form the government in Delhi after 27 years, with 47 seats, while AAP could secure only 23 seats.

AHMEDABAD: A wave of despair spread across many parts of Gujarat as 33 illegal immigrants, including 13 women and eight children, landed in Ahmedabad early Thursday from Amritsar after they were deported from US. Faces covered by masks, without any luggage and a few with backpacks, they were taken to Gujarat Police vehicles stationed at the airport and whisked away to their homes.Having paid Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore to chase their 'US dreams', all they were left with were shattered dreams and mounting debts.All of them were deported under the 'catch and release' policy of Trump administration and were part of a larger group of 104 Indians who were sent back from the US this week.""My sister was handcuffed during the deportation. She hasn't talked much with us. She had gone to US on a tourist visa . We have no idea why she was deported,"" said Varun, brother of 29-year-old Khushbu Patel of Luna village in Vadodara. Many deportees, including Khushbu, chose to go incommunicado to avoid the intense social scrutiny.Of the 33 deportees, 18 were caught just as Trump took oath as the US president. They stepped on US soil on Jan 19 and 20 and walked straight into the hands of American authorities, sources said.All 18 are from north Gujarat, a region known as a hub for human smuggling operations . ""They were smuggled into US through Mexico border,"" said a source connected with human smuggling network. ""The smugglers pushed them to enter US way before Trump took the oath, fearing stricter immigration policies. But for some reason, they could not cross over in time. They were caught and marked for deportation almost immediately,"" the source added.Sources said the remaining 15 Gujaratis had been in US for periods ranging from one month to four years. They did not get permission to stay even though they sought asylum, citing political persecution. Some deportees like Jignesh Zala, a native of Gandhinagar, said illegal immigration was a traumatic experience that should never be attempted. He had crossed into US with his wife and 11-year-old twin daughters four months ago. ""We went from Delhi to Paris to Madrid to Salvador before reaching Mexico and crossing the border. We were sent back with hands and legs in cuffs. It was a traumatic experience for our entire family,"" Zala said on Thursday.","33 illegal immigrants, including 13 women and eight children, landed in Ahmedabad early Thursday from Amritsar.

The unprecedented fall

NEW DELHI: Revolution. New politics. Political startup. That's all echoed ten years back as people, particularly in New Delhi, witnessed a ""glint of hope"" radiating from Ram Lila Maidan.When the ruling Congress at the Centre faced heat over the unravelling of corruption cases in 2011, the iconic ground in Delhi galvanised the people against what seemed indomitable dispensation.At the centre of the historic Ram Lila Maidan protest were Anna Hazare and his protege Arvind Kejriwal , leading the masses with a key demand -- Jan Lok Pal .The India Against Corruption movement peaked when the Congress-led UPA regime ordered cops to infiltrate the historic ground to disperse the crowd. The move backfired. It earned the protest nationwide sympathy and made the chances of the government leaner.Unable to make a big impact from apolitical movement and lack of legislative might, team Kejriwal decided to float a party to bring a ""real change"" in India's political landscape.Consequently, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came into existence on October 2, 2o12, which also marked the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.The political canvas was fresh and blank for Kejriwal to leave an indelible imprint in 2013 when he made his political debut against Sheila Dikshit-led Congress government.The promise of alternative politics served Kejriwal with a decent electoral dividend as he defeated Sheila Dikshit from the New Delhi seat by a whopping margin of 22,000 votes. However, the party failed to secure a majority as it won 28 seats, only 8 short of the magic mark.In a first surprise call, the AAP declared to form a government with Congress's support -- the same party protesting against which it had come to prominence. It was, however, seen as an arrangement to navigate through the deadlock the hung mandate had created.As expected, the government was short-lived as Kejriwal resigned in 49 days because the Lokpal Bill (anti-corruption law) was not passed due to alleged opposition from its ally Congress.In 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) decimated the BJP and Congress by recording a landslide victory as it won 67 of the 70 seats in the Delhi assembly elections , halting the Modi juggernaut in its tracks.The AAP won more than 90 per cent of the seats, a feat achieved only twice before in Sikkim and Bihar.Driven by its strong focus on governance and welfare policies, the Kejriwal-led government implemented several popular schemes, such as free electricity (up to 200 units), free water (up to 20,000 litres), improved government schools, and Mohalla Clinics for healthcare. These initiatives resonated with the common people, particularly the lower and middle classes, who saw direct benefits in their daily lives.The strategy of projecting Kejriwal as a ""work-oriented leader"" helped AAP secure a massive victory, winning 62 out of 70 seats in the 2020 Delhi Assembly.AAP transitioned from a local party in Delhi to a national party after its massive breakthrough in the 2022 Punjab assembly elections, where Kejriwal's party won a landslide victory with 92 out of 117 seats, forming its second full-fledged state government. This victory established AAP as a key contender beyond Delhi.The two controversies that put AAP and Kejriwal's credibility under serious scrutiny were the 'sheesh mahal' and the Delhi liquor policy case, with critics arguing that the party, which once promised clean politics did not walk the talk.While the Sheesh Mahal controversy has dented Kejriwal’s image as a leader of simplicity, the liquor policy scam has given the opposition fresh ammunition to attack AAP’s anti-corruption stance. The party, however, remained defiant, insisting that both controversies were politically motivated.This came after several of the founding members of the party left the AAP, accusing Kejriwal of functioning in a ""dictatorial way"" and taking unilateral decisions.Riding high on the anti-incumbency and on the back of the corruption charges, AAP lost its Delhi bastion in the 2025 assembly election. The BJP has managed to breach Kejriwal's Delhi fortress to regain power after a gap of 27 years. The saffron party won 48 seats in the 70-seat assembly.When it rains it pours, as the adage goes, the AAP not only lost the election but its chief Arvind Kejriwal was also trounced by BJP's Parvesh Verma by more than 4,000 votes from the same New Delhi assembly seat, which Kejriwal used for his political debut.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came into existence on October 2, 2o12, which also marked the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

Now these projects and a new Metro link from Indra Prastha to North Block would be expedited, they added.Addressing the party workers after BJP's poll sweep, Modi said, ""This is for the first time since Independence when every state in the NCR has BJP govts. All neighbouring states (of Delhi) - Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana - have BJP govts. This is a happy coincidence. This single coincidence will open numerous avenues for development. Our efforts will be to undertake a lot of work in this area with regard to mobility and infrastructure development.""Stating that Delhi being the country's capital ""deserves the best urban infrastructure"", Modi said the BJP govt will develop it as a ""modern city"", while asserting that people have seen the central govt's ""stellar"" performance in the housing and road sector.He also slammed the AAP govt's approach towards Metro Rail projects.TOI has learnt that the Delhi-SNB and Delhi-Panipat RRTS projects are at the appraisal stages. So far the Delhi govt, being a partner in the projects, had given in-principle approval while suggesting that though it supported them, the funding should come from Centre. However, complying with a Supreme Court direction it had submitted token amounts for these projects.In his address, the PM said while the earlier governments looked at urbanisation as a ""liability and concern"" and treated it as ""means for earning personal wealth, his govt sees it as an opportunity and a means to strengthen the urban poor.Just before the polls were announced, the seven Delhi MPs had sought construction of three major highway projects costing around Rs 12,000 crore to decongest Delhi.

"In Arvind Kejriwal's karmbhoomi, not a pretty picture",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-elections-in-arvind-kejriwals-karmbhoomi-not-a-pretty-picture/articleshow/118078035.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the narrow lanes of northeast Delhi's Sunder Nagri, the air crackled with conversations - not about the local election, but about Arvind Kejriwal's defeat . Though he didn't lose from this constituency, the people here - who once propelled him to political stardom - spoke of his downfall as if it were their own reckoning. This was, after all, where his political journey took root, the karambhoomi where his hunger strike against corruption and taxation in 2013 first captured national attention.But amid the post-mortem of his political loss , another name surfaced just as often - Santosh Kohli.Kohli's story remains a painful chapter in Sunder Nagri's history. The social activist, whose mother played a crucial role in helping Kejriwal establish his Parivartan NGO, was tragically killed in a hit-and-run incident in 2013. ""In this very house, Kejriwal staged his hunger strike. Now my daughter's picture still hangs on these walls. She introduced him to the very people he championed. But when she was taken from us, he turned his back,"" her mother Kalavati told TOI.Today, that very house - once the birthplace of Kejriwal's political career - now wears the colours of the BJP, a stark reminder of shifting tides. Kalavati, now 64, is resolute in her support for the saffron party. ""Not just us, but many former AAP loyalists feel betrayed. I have worked in the social sector for years, and I understand the struggles of my people. And now, almost everyone here supports the BJP-his biggest rival.""For some, his defeat is seen as poetic justice. ""He ignored Kohli's family when they needed him the most. Now, he is facing the consequences of his karma."" Others attribute his loss to his alleged involvement in the liquor scam. ""We once supported him because he stood against corruption. But then his name started surfacing in scandals. It feels like he has come full circle - his rise was built on fighting corruption, and now, corruption has led to his downfall,"" said Vinod Kumar Jain (50).As one wades through the weekly market crowd, the disenchantment is clear. ""What has he truly done for us? I wouldn't mind paying my bills if it meant we had safer roads, cleaner water, and proper sewage systems. But the worst part is how he abandoned the very people who once treated him like family. He didn't even visit after Santosh Kohli's death,"" said a frustrated resident.""We thought he would change the system, but in the end, he became just another politician,"" said another voter.Yet, some still stand by Aam Aadmi Party . ""We are grateful for free water, electricity, and better schools. That's why we continue to vote for AAP. We are sad he lost, but he will always be one of our own,"" admitted one voter.However, in Sunder Nagri's Muslim-majority pockets, Kejriwal's continued support comes with resignation rather than enthusiasm. ""We vote for AAP because we don't have better options. We can't afford to lose subsidies. We don't know how we will pay our bills now,"" said Mehfooz Khan, 52.Kejriwal's absence from Sunder Nagri in recent years has not gone unnoticed. ""Karmbhoomi nahi, karma-chhuti (Not a workplace, but a holiday),"" remarked RK Swamy, 44, emphasising how Kejriwal's detachment has cost him dearly.","Santosh Kohli's mother played a crucial role in helping Kejriwal establish his Parivartan NGO.

Remember the condition of Bihar before Nitish ji. Nitish ji got an opportunity in Bihar, change also came only when the NDA government came. Similarly, Chandrababu Naidu has proved his track record in Andhra Pradesh. All these examples show that NDA means guarantee of development, NDA means guarantee of good governance.""

Anna Hazare ji has been bearing the pain of the misdeeds of these people for a long time. Today he too must have got relief from that pain. The party born out of the movement against corruption got involved in corruption. It became such a party of the country whose Chief Minister and Ministers went to jail on corruption charges. Those who used to give themselves certificates of honesty, turned out to be corrupt. This was a big betrayal with Delhi. The liquor scam defamed Delhi. The scams in schools and hospitals troubled the poorest of the poor and on top of that, their arrogance was so much that when the world was dealing with Corona, these people were building 'Sheesh Mahal'...""

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that the voters have thrown the AAP-da (Aam Aadmi Party) out of Delhi politics.""Today's victory is historic. This is not an ordinary victory.

Has WWE released superstars as this week's SmackDown went on air?

Also read:

There has been a report of WWE releasing multiple superstars, some of them who were upcoming on the main roster show while others who had been kept off television for too long.WWE is the ultimate destination for many aspirants who wish to make a career in the professional wrestling world. However, making it to the company and staying in it are two different things.Over the years, the fans have seen many superstars fail to make an impact on the audience and in turn, lose their place in WWE.Moreover, at times, some talents are left unutilized on the main roster despite their impactful tenure in WWE’s developmental territory, NXT. The last round of WWE releases happened back in December 2024 and it seems some more names have been added to that list in recent memory.According to reports by Fightful Select and PWInsider, WWE has released a batch of superstars, with some names coming as a shock. The first name on the list was Sonya Deville. She was the first openly gay WWE superstar and had been in the company for almost a decade.Deville was regarded for her partnership with former WWE superstar Mandy Rose. Moreover, she recently took charge of Pure Fusion Collective alongside Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark. According to the report, Deville’s contract was approaching its end, and WWE decided not to renew it.The next names were WWE Hall of Famer Paul Ellering and The Authors of Pain. The trio had a good tenure in WWE back in NXT and a brief stint on the main roster. They came back to WWE in 2023 and were aligned with Karrion Kross to form ‘The Final Testament.’ With their release, it seems that Kross would now be going alone as a solo competitor.The final releases that happened in WWE recently were Cedric Alexander and Blair Davenport . Cedric was struggling to make a name for himself for years. The only time he was involved in major storylines was during his time as part of The Hurt Business. On the other hand, Davenport was not utilized much on SmackDown after being called up to the main roster last year. Moreover, the report stated that WWE had creative plans for either of them.In a follow-up report to their release by Fightful Select, the call for the releases was made right as the February 7th edition of SmackDown went live. With a wave of WWE releases hitting the roster, it remains to be seen if there could be more names let go from the company.","According to reports by Fightful Select and PWInsider, WWE has released a batch of superstars, with some names coming as a shock.

(The complete list of winners is updated as per the Election Commission of India (ECI) official results – eci.gov.in.)

The vote counting for the 2025 Delhi Assembly elections is currently in progress, revealing a fiercely competitive political landscape. According to the latest data from the Election Commission of India, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 48 seats, while the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won 22 constituencies.Voting was conducted across all 70 assembly constituencies in a single phase on February 5.This election has been marked by high voter turnout and spirited campaigning from all major parties. The current term of the Delhi Legislative Assembly is scheduled to end on February 23, giving the victorious party ample time—just over two weeks—to form the new government in the national capital.The 2025 Delhi Assembly elections were marked by a significant triangular battle between the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the resurgent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the Indian National Congress, each vying for dominance in the capital’s complex political landscape. The BJP made a strong comeback, winning 42 out of 70 seats, ending its long absence from power in Delhi.The AAP, despite its efforts, only secured 22 seats and faced a major blow when Arvind Kejriwal lost his seat in the New Delhi constituency to BJP’s Parvesh Verma. Meanwhile, Congress, once a dominant force in Delhi, was entirely shut out, failing to win any seats, marking a sharp decline in its political influence.The BJP’s victory reshapes the capital’s political scene, potentially altering the focus of governance, while AAP’s role as the opposition remains vital. Congress's absence in the assembly signals the need for a reassessment of its strategies moving forward. Check below the compiled list of BJP and AAP winners for Delhi assembly elections 2025.The BJP's victory is expected to influence Delhi's governance, potentially impacting policies related to infrastructure, education, and public welfare. The AAP, while no longer in power, is likely to continue its role as a constructive opposition, holding the new government accountable.Also read: Winners and Losers of Delhi assembly election 2025","Summarize: Poll What Are Your Thoughts on the 2025 Delhi Assembly Election Results?

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts.In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Nolan Arenado's Reported Interest in Joining the Boston Red Sox

""highly motivated""

Insights from MLB Insider on Arenado's Potential Red Sox Trade

Mets and Pete Alonso: Who Blinked First? Plus, Alex Bregman Rumors

""If I were the Red Sox, I would not pursue Nolan Arenado. I would not be involved in it. I would not even consider it because it just feels like it's going to do more harm than good, and you're blocking some prime players. Even the thought of having to move Tristan Casas or play him less in order to put Arenado in your lineup or defensively makes no sense. The Red Sox have had a puzzling offseason. It's been disappointing. Obviously, they made some good moves by acquiring Garrett Crochet and Wilyer Abreu, but they still have more to do. If the other moves they make include Arenado, that would make this offseason a failure in my eyes. I've been very straight-up about the fact that the Red Sox should not do it.”

The Boston Red Sox have been associated with a rumor that they are trading for St. Louis Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado . However, recent reports and expert opinions suggest that this deal is unlikely. While Arenado has shown interest in playing at Fenway Park, several factors indicate that Boston may not be seriously considering the trade.Rumors are coming that Nolan Arenado wants to be in Boston with the Red Sox.Reports indicate the star third baseman isto play at Fenway Park. Now, with Boston in need of a right-handed power hitter, Arenado becomes a good fit for their lineup. However, another potential target for the Red Sox is third baseman Alex Bregman of the Houston Astros.Although Arenado is interested, the Red Sox may be reluctant because of the existing constraints on their roster. Rafael Devers is already entrenched at third base, and Triston Casas is going to be a big part of the first base picture. Trading for Arenado could create an unnecessary positional logjam, making a move for him less practical.MLB insider Robert Murray has completely opposed the talk of the Red Sox going for Arenado. Recently, while speaking to this, he presented his skepticism and said that trade would not logically make sense on Boston's behalf.Murray's views indicate that trade for Arenado would disturb the development of important players and at the same time, not satisfy other urgent needs.The rumors about Nolan Arenado being interested in playing for the Boston Red Sox notwithstanding, the prospects of a trade look slim. The presence of Rafael Devers and Triston Casas alongside skepticism from within is likely to mean that the team will turn elsewhere to get some strength added to the roster. Alex Bregman, after all, is also a man on the wish list. A deal, which insiders feel makes no sense, might be skipped over and instead, something else done.Also Read: Padres star Manny Machado claims Roki Sasaki ‘had his mind set’ on signing with Dodgers","Rumors are coming that Nolan Arenado wants to be in Boston with the Red Sox.

Accenture is rolling back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) goals, citing changes in the US political landscape, according to an internal memo from CEO Julie Sweet.The decision follows recent executive orders issued by President Donald Trump targeting DEI programs across the federal government and private sector.As per The Guardian, Sweet stated that Accenture would start “sunsetting” its 2017 diversity goals, along with career development programs for “people of specific demographic groups.”The memo also mentioned that DEI policies would no longer be used to assess employee performance and that the company would stop submitting data to external diversity benchmarking surveys.Accenture joins other major companies, including Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, in scaling back their DEI initiatives. Google also recently rolled back its diversity hiring targets, citing compliance with Trump’s executive orders.Accenture, which employs around 799,000 people globally, had previously committed to gender and racial diversity targets. Women currently represent 48% of the company’s workforce and hold 30% of managing director positions, according to its latest annual report.Sweet also noted that Accenture would “evaluate external partnerships on diversity as part of refreshing our talent strategy.”The rollback aligns with broader corporate shifts as conservative activists and legal pressures challenge DEI-focused policies in the US.","The decision follows recent executive orders issued by President Donald Trump targeting DEI programs across the federal government and private sector.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Half-siblings to control Ratan Tata stake in group companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/half-siblings-to-control-ratan-tata-stake-in-group-companies/articleshow/118073994.cms,"MUMBAI: The boards of Ratan Tata Endowment Foundation (RTEF) and Ratan Tata Endowment Trust (RTET), which were bequeathed the late industrialist's shares in Tata companies, are set for restructuring. The three siblings of Ratan Tata - his half-sisters Shireen and Deanne Jejeebhoy and his half-brother Noel Tata - are preparing to join as trustees, indicating that the family will continue to exercise some degree of control over his stake in Tata group companies.RTEF and RTET were established as legal custodians of Ratan Tata's financial investments a couple of years before his demise in October 2024.Ratan Tata owned 0.83% of Tata Sons , the holding company of the group. He also owned stakes in Tata Digital, Tata Motors and Tata Technologies. These shares have been willed to RTEF. He also held considerable investments in startups which will either be sold with proceeds going to RTET or transferred directly to the trust. His estate is estimated to be over Rs 10,000 crore.RTEF functions as a section 8 company, while RTET operates under the Indian Trusts Act. Both organisations focus on supporting education and healthcare and uplifting vulnerable sections of society. They represent the causes closest to the late industrialist and the welfare activities he personally funded. The two trusts will enjoy voting rights proportionate to their stake in Tata group companies.The current two-trustee structure at both organisations will expand to six trustees for RTEF and seven for RTET. Tata Sons chairmanN Chandrasekaran is expected to become managing trustee for both entities, which makes him a guiding force. However, as the Tata Sons' articles of association restrict the chairman from becoming the chairman of any Tata Trust, he cannot chair either organisation.The existing trustees at RTEF are former Tata Sons executive Raghavan Shastri and ex-Tata Realty and Infrastructure director Burzis Shapur Taraporevala. RTET's current trustees include Tata Trusts ' trustees Darius Khambata and Pramit Jhaveri. Khambata and Jhaveri are expected to step down due to their existing commitments with Tata Trusts. Tata Sons legal head Sidharth Sharma will join RTET as a trustee. These are the financial and legal minds within the group.Jamsheed Poncha, from Chandrasekaran's office, is set to be the CEO of both entities. However, unlike Poncha who will receive compensation, Chandrasekaran will not receive payment as managing trustee. This structure represents the first instance of a Tata Trust having both positions simultaneously.The executors of Ratan Tata's will are Shireen and Deanne Jejeebhoy, Darius Khambata, and Tata Trusts trustee Mehli Mistry. Apart from Mistry, all will serve on either or both boards of RTEF and RTET.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes.Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.
