After two sharp oneliners by Air Marshal A K Bharti lit up social media following the May 10 India-Pakistan ceasefire, Adi Arora, a 34-year-old entrepreneur based in Parwanoo, Himachal Pradesh, quickly turned them into T-shirts. One bears director general air operations Bharti’s now-iconic line, “Our job is to hit the target, not to count the body bags.”Another reads, “I don’t know what’s there in Kirana Hills,” Bharti’s deadpan reply to whether the Air Force had struck Pakistan’s nuclear site. A third design — now a bestseller — has the emblems of the armed forces with the tagline ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ on Arora’s company Kadak Merch ’s website.Operation Sindoor not only marked a bold shift in India’s counter-terrorism stance, it also led to a surge in commerce with many keen to wear patriotism on their sleeve. Or carry it on their arm in the form of tote bags. TOI reported that even sales of sindoor powder surged in Bhubaneswar. There was even a controversial trademark registration of Operation Sindoor but a PIL has been ﬁled against it.For Prasad Narayan Kamkar, a handloom cotton saree wholesaler from Belagavi, Karnataka, this offered an unexpected ‘rebranding’ opportunity. His stock of unsold red and maroon sarees is now being sold as ‘Sindoor sarees’. “What else can I do? Ever since the war broke out, my market has been bad. My shopkeeper clients in Jodhpur and Udaipur, near the border areas, were not taking orders or responding to my calls,” says Kamkar, whose sindoor range of sarees featured in local news as well. “Now, there are new sindoor sarees in check patterns in production,” he adds.Anish Agarwal, commercial pilot and founder of Kolkatabased Aero Armour which has been selling military-inspired apparel for the last ﬁve years, has gone a step further with his Sindoor T-shirts. “On the tees, we have mapped the sites where India struck,” he says. The brand has previously created collections around defence operations such as Kargil, Meghdoot and Black Tornado. Aero Armour’s ﬂagship Kargil Collection is even sold at the Kargil War Memorial in Drass.Upcoming designs for its Operation Sindoor collection will include aerial views of the strike zones and illustrations of defence equipment like the BrahMos missile and Rafale jet, alongside video podcasts with ex-servicemen on Instagram. “We will map Pakistan’s terror HQs like Bahawalpur and Muridke,” says Agarwal. But isn’t this using patriotic fervor for proﬁt? “Yes, we are criticised occasionally. But the forces themselves have appreciated our work. That matters more.”Arora from Kadak Merch insists he is not doing this to monetise war. “I believe merchandise is the best way for civilians to support the armed forces. We want to continue this and build a fund to donate to the Indian armed forces ,” he says. Kadak Merch’s Operation Sindoor range — designed in under an hour on May 12— is selling fast, he claims. “I have already sold more than 1,000 units. Orders are coming from all over India,” says Arora, whose company usually riffs on memes and pop culture trends for its merch.Ad guru Piyush Pandey says brands selling merchandise under names like Operation Sindoor is insensitive. “At the end of the day, however successful we were, we also lost people — ﬁrst in Pahalgam, and even after that. Don’t turn it into a business,” Pandey adds.Navin Israni of Mansa Sarees in Kolkata’s New Market area had a change of heart and withdraw his special edition crepe saree featuring the phrase ‘Mera Bharat Mahan’ in 21 Indian languages, with motifs like the Ashoka Chakra, Tricolour and peacock printed. “We had made 50 pieces for sale, but there were second thoughts in the family. Some pointed out, ‘Our army men are out there sacriﬁcing their lives, and you want to mint money out of it?’ That hit home,” says Israni, who has decided to donate the sarees instead.",Operation Sindoor marked a bold shift in India’s counter-terrorism stance.

Desi diaspora set to take $1.6 billion hit as US plans bill to tax remittances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/desi-diaspora-set-to-take-1-6-billion-hit-as-us-plans-bill-to-tax-remittances/articleshow/121198369.cms,"Representative image

‘The One Big Beautiful Bill’ calls for tax equal to 5 per cent of remittance amount

Its official title is — The One Big Beautiful Bill — but it contains a sting for lakhs of Indians in the US, be they non-immigrant visa holders (like H-1B) or green card holders. Once this bill is enacted, anyone who is not a US citizen and who remits money outside the country will have to pay a remittance tax of 5 per cent.Lately, the US has emerged as the largest source country for remittances into India, attributed to both the size of Indian diaspora and their income levels in America. According to Indian foreign ministry, there are nearly 45 lakh overseas Indians in the US, including nearly 32 lakh PIOs.According to a remittance survey published by RBI in March, of the total remittances of $118.7 billion in 2023-24, nearly 28 per cent or $32 billion were from the US. If this bill is enacted, even if we assume the remittance figure from the US to be constant, the Indian diaspora will end up paying $1.6 billion as remittance tax.The bill is the proposed tax plan released recently by the US House Ways and Means Committee. Tucked away in page 327 of the 389 page document is a section on remittances, which calls for a ‘tax equal to 5 per cent of the amount of such transfer’. As no exemption threshold limit has been set, it would also impact transfers of small denominations. It adds that this shall not apply to any remittance-transfer where the remittance transfer provider is a ‘qualified remittance transfer provider’ and the sender is a ‘verified US sender’. The latter is then defined to mean a citizen or national of the US.In other words, if an H-1B holder or an L-1 (who is in US on an intra company transfer) or even a green card holder remits money to his family (say parents) in India, or remits money for the purpose of investments – say in Indian securities or real estate, the remittance will be subject to a 5 per cent withholding by the transfer provider (say US bank).The House of Representatives aims to pass this bill in May itself and it will then move to the Senate. According to cross-border investment experts, the bill is likely to sail through and may be law by June-July. They are advising the Indian diaspora to try and remit larger funds in the coming weeks to escape the remittance tax.","The bill is the proposed tax plan released recently by the US House Ways and Means Committee.

US shipments major driver

NEW DELHI: India’s goods exports rose 9.1%, the fastest pace in six months, to $38.5 billion in April, while the trade deficit widened to $26.4 billion, the highest since last Nov. Latest data released by the commerce department pegged imports at $64.9 billion in April, which was 19% higher than the corresponding period last year.“We have opened this year with a bang… I hope India will maintain this export momentum and it should be a good year despite global uncertainties,” commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal said.A part of the increase in exports may have been driven by front-loading of shipments to the US ahead of the deadline for reciprocal tariffs that kicked in on April 9, only to be paused for 90 days.Shipments to the US went up 27% to $8.4 billion, the latest numbers showed.Overall, electronics exports , a large part of which is through air cargo, shot up nearly 40% to $3.7 billion. Engineering goods, the largest item in India’s export basket, rose over 11% to $9.5 billion, while petroleum products (the second biggest group) were 4.7% higher at $7.4 billion.Some shipments into the country were also advanced, pushing up imports.“The merchandise trade deficit in April 2025 exceeded our expectations despite a healthy growth in exports, partly on account of a front-loading of crude oil imports amid softer prices, as well as a sharp increase in electronics,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency ICRA.Petroleum imports soared 25.6% to $20.7 billion, while chemical material more than doubled to $2 billion. Import consignments of metalliferous ores and other minerals zoomed 77% to go past the $1 billion mark in April and non-ferrous metal imports were 30% higher at $2.3 billion. Electronics shipments are estimated to have increased 31% to $9.5 billion.Gold imports were estimated to be 4.9% higher at $3.1 billion.China cemented its position as the top source of imports with a 27% increase to $9.9 billion in April, although Russia just about managed to stay at the second spot with overall shipments valued 18% higher at $6.2 billion. UAE, with an 89% jump, was just $540,000 short of Russia’s level. Imports from the US were also up 64% to $5.4 billion.","India's goods exports rose 9.1%, the fastest pace in six months, to $38.5 billion in April.

Won’t permit any challenge to 1995 Waqf Act: SC bench

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said it will on May 20 hear a limited number of advocates for several Muslim petitioners who have challenged the constitutional validity of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, only for the purpose of deciding the necessity and contours of any interim order required to be issued by the court.SG Tushar Mehta said govt has filed a comprehensive affidavit on the three issues flagged by the court in its April 17 order: nomination of non-Muslims to Central Waqf Council and boards, validity of waqf-by-user without valid documents, and the process for identification of govt land under waqf.Perturbed after seeing a number of senior advocates appearing for the Muslim parties and speaking in different voices, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih said if merely scheduling the hearing takes so much of time and if this there is so much confusion as to who all should be permitted to argue, then the hearing cannot commence.The bench asked lead counsel for the Muslim side, senior advocate Kapil Sibal , to coordinate with other counsels who are arguing against the amendments and file by Saturday a consolidated written submission on the need and shape of interim order. It asked Mehta to articulate his response and submissions by Monday.During the hearing, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said the court should allow him to argue a petition challenging the Waqf Act, 1995, as well as the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, both of which are discriminatory based on religion. The bench, however, asked, “How can you challenge the 1995 Act after 30 years?”Jain said the petition also challenges certain provisions of the new waqf law as it has not addressed the unequal situation created in favour of Muslims by the 1995 Act.The bench said, “Do not mix the issues. We will not consider any request for stay of any provision of the Waqf Act, 1995. Just because the Amendment Act, 2025 is challenged, no one can be allowed to jump in to challenge the 1995 legislation.”Sibal said the assurance of the Union govt through the solicitor general on certain aspects should continue till May 20. Mehta said it will continue till May 20.","Supreme Court will hear a limited number of advocates for several Muslim petitioners on May 20.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday slammed MP minister Vijay Shah for his disparaging remarks aimed at Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, who had briefed the media along with foreign secretary Vikram Misri and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh on ‘Operation Sindoor’.When Shah’s counsel Vibha D Makhija sought urgent hearing of his petition questioning high court’s suo motu order directing registration of FIR against the minister, a bench of Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice AG Masih asked whether such a comment behoves the constitutional post held by the petitioner.“When the country is going through a situation, he (Shah) should have been more careful in his speech. Persons holding constitutional office are expected to observe certain standards and exercise restraint in their public speeches,” the bench said.When Makhija sought stay of the HC order directing registration of FIR against Shah, the bench asked, “Why should he not approach the HC under Article 226 of the Constitution? Just because someone is a minister, should we entertain his petition under Article 32?”With persuasion, the bench agreed to list the petition for hearing on Monday but squarely refused to stay the HC order, saying nothing will happen between today and Monday. Makhija said the minister’s remarks were over-hyped by the media and that Shah has apologised publicly for remarks. In a video message on X, Shah had said he was “not only ashamed and saddened by my statement which has hurt the sentiments of every community but I also apologise from the bottom of my heart. Our country’s sister Sofiya Qureshi ji has worked rising above caste and society while fulfilling her national duty”.",Supreme Court slams MP minister Vijay Shah for his disparaging remarks aimed at Colonel Sofiya Qureshi.

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday decided to continue their confidence building measures (CBMs) to gradually reduce the high alertness levels between the rival militaries ranged against each other on the Line of Control as well as the international boundary on the western front.After Indian director-general of military operations Lt General Rajiv Ghai and his Pakistani counterpart Major General Kashif Abdullah reached the understanding on May 10 to cease cross-border hostilities , the CBMs are being strengthened to ensure neither side “fires or initiates any aggressive and inimical action”, an officer said.Follow live updates: Islamabad says Pakistan and India agree ceasefire until Sunday Pakistani foreign minister Ishaq Dar told the media that the Pakistan Army had agreed to extend the ceasefire with India till Sunday during a phone call between the two DGMOs on Thursday. There was, however, no clarification from the Indian Army on this.India has repeatedly stressed that Operation Sindoor has only been “paused” and the armed forces are maintaining full operational readiness to respond to any misadventure from Pakistan.Also read: Operation Sindoor: India and Pakistan agree to continue confidence-building measures, reduce alertness levels India had earlier asked Pakistan to desist from any further aggressive action along the western front and reduce the number of its troops and heavy weapon systems mobilised in forward locations.Both sides had agreed to consider immediate measures to ensure troop reduction from the borders and forward areas during the May 10 understanding.

NEW DELHI: In one of the most daring and technologically advanced operations, the Indian Air Force (IAF) used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to devastating effect during retaliatory strikes on Pakistani airbases in Round 2 of Operation Sindoor on May 10. According to sources quoted by ANI, approximately 15 BrahMos missiles were launched in precision attacks that targeted critical infrastructure across 11 of 12 key Pakistani Air Force bases, effectively paralysing its air defence and strike capabilities.The missile strikes came as part of Round 2 of India's counter-offensive following the terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, which was carried out by Pakistan-backed groups. On the night of May 9–10, as Pakistan tried to target civilian and military infrastructures in India, New Delhi escalated military response under the broader Operation Sindoor with the BrahMos missiles spearheading the IAF's multi-layered assault strategy.“This was the first time the BrahMos missile system was used in an active conflict,” sources in the defence establishment told ANI. “Its performance exceeded expectations, delivering high-precision strikes that crippled key Pakistani air assets and defence networks,” they said.The IAF’s plan began with the launch of dummy aircraft, designed to simulate an incoming fighter threat. This decoy tactic prompted Pakistan to activate its radar and air defence systems, including the HQ-9 missile batteries. Once these systems were exposed, Indian forces launched loitering munitions, such as the Israeli Harop drones, to neutralise the air defence grid.With the Pakistani radar network compromised, the IAF then followed up with long-range precision strikes. The BrahMos cruise missiles, alongside Scalp, Crystal Maze, and Rampage munitions, were used to devastating effect. These were launched from fighter aircraft operating under the Western and Southwestern Air Commands.“The BrahMos missiles played a central role in disabling runways, hardened shelters, and command centers, significantly degrading the Pakistan Air Force’s ability to launch counter-operations,” ANI reported, citing multiple defence sources.The aftermath of the strike forced the Pakistani military to relocate many of its aircraft to rear bases and reportedly resulted in the loss of several high-value assets, including long-endurance UAVs and an airborne early warning system destroyed in a hangar in Sindh province.According to ANI, the intensity of the BrahMos-led strikes forced Pakistan to abandon its plans for further retaliation. In a telling sign of the damage inflicted, Pakistan urgently sought a Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) level meeting to propose a pause in hostilities and explore an understanding with India.The operational use of BrahMos in this conflict marks a historic milestone for India's missile capabilities. Developed jointly by India and Russia, the BrahMos is known for its Mach 2.8 speed, precision strike capabilities, and versatility across land, sea, and air platforms.“This operation has not only validated the BrahMos missile’s deterrent value but also demonstrated its potency as a first-strike option in modern warfare,” a senior defence official told ANI.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to devastating effect during retaliatory strikes on Pakistani airbases in Round 2 of Operation Sindoor.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo has defended its tie-up with Turkish Airlines amid the anti-Turkiye mood in the country after Recep Tayyip Erdogan openly supported Pakistan.Besides, the partnership could face the heat after govt withdrew security clearance to Celebi for offering ground handling services at nine Indian airports.“The India-Turkey air services agreement (ASA or bilaterals) allows carriers of Turkey and India to operate a total of 56 flights per week between India and Turkey. Currently, IndiGo operates direct flights to Istanbul via leased 500 plus seater aircraft and offers codeshare seats to travellers to more than 40 points in Europe and USA supported by its domestic network. This arrangement provides multiple benefits to Indian travellers, and the country’s economy. The additional long-haul capacity has enabled availability of seats for Indian passengers at reasonable airfares, coming at a time when long-haul international airfares have increased substantially owing to the impact of Covid,” IndiGo said.The airline said before it commenced operations, Turkish Airlines was the sole carrier on this route. “The codeshare has enabled IndiGo to build its presence in long haul markets in Europe and USA, putting in place the foundation for self-sufficiency — its long-haul foray with the 40 A321XLR and 30 A350 aircraft ordered by the airline.This arrangement not only enhances the connectivity of Indian hubs like Delhi and Mumbai, but the additional revenue has also led to increased tax contributions to the Indian exchequer, supporting economic growth,” IndiGo said .",IndiGo has defended its tie-up with Turkish Airlines amid the anti-Turkiye mood in the country after Recep Tayyip Erdogan openly supported Pakistan.

The attempt was to both embarrass India and also extract sensitive information about its defence systems, including its missiles, they said.According to Interpol trainer and cyber forensic expert Pendyala Krishna Shastry, the attacks were part of a broader campaign waged by Pakistani actors against Indian digital assets.

LONDON: A high court judge in London on Thursday has refused fugitive Indian businessman Nirav Modi bail for the eighth time.Justice Fordham said: “There are substantial grounds for believing that if released by me on bail that applicant would fail to surrender and interfere with witnesses.”Nirav has been in prison in the UK for over six years since he was arrested on an extradition warrant in March 2019 charged with defrauding Punjab National Bank of over $1 billion.Nirav’s barrister Edward Fitzgerald KC argued that Nirav had been held as an undertrial a disproportionate length of time, that all his co-defendants in India, including one Shetty, who Fitzgerald described as “the main mover” in the scam, had got bail, and that there was no chance of Nirav absconding.“What the Christian Michel and Jagtar Johal and Latifa case, and countless others, show, including the murder and attempted murder in Canada and America, is that the reach of the Indian govt is practically limitless. The idea he could go to Vanuatu and there be safe from the govt of India is utterly ridiculous,” Fitzgerald said. “They will either send a hit squad to get him or kidnap him or lean on govt to deport him to India.”The judge questioned this, saying if the Indian govt’s power were limitless, couldn’t they get him in the UK?“He is safe in the UK as police give Osman warnings,” he said.Fitzgerald claimed Michel was “blindfolded, handcuffed and flown on private jet from the UAE to India”, that Johal was “kidnapped on the street”, and Latifa was “kidnapped” by the Indian authorities “These make the danger of extrajudicial retaliation or reprisals even greater,” he said.He said Nirav did not have the resources to flee as his assets had been depleted through being frozen and confiscated. He also said the alleged interference with witnesses was seven years ago, and since then there had been no further such incident even though he has a phone in prison.“Six years in jail is too long” he said, explaining a “confidential legal matter” that began in April 2018 was holding up his extradition.Nicholas Hearn, representing the Indian govt, said if his fears of state reprisals were genuine, what were the chances of him voluntarily surrendering to go back to India?",Nirav has been in prison in the UK for over six years since he was arrested on an extradition warrant in March 2019 charged with defrauding Punjab National Bank of over $1 billion.

‘Trump’s tariff remarks may be a negotiating tactic by White House’

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said he has asked Apple CEO Tim Cook to stop producing iPhones in India, and make them in the US instead.Apple has no smartphone production in the US — most of its iPhones are made in China while facilities in India produce around 40 million units per year (about 15% of Apple’s annual output). Cook had previously stated that Apple will source the majority of iPhones sold in the US from India in the June quarter while China will produce the vast majority of the devices for other markets.Speaking on Thursday at an event with business bigwigs in Doha, Trump also said India had “offered us a deal where basically they are willing to literally charge us no tariff” on US goods.Trump didn’t provide further details of the apparent offer, nor was there any comment from Indian officials. Trump’s comments came days after India threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs in response to higher US duties on steel and aluminium.Some analysts in New Delhi suggested that President Trump’s remarks could indicate either that India is close to finalising a deal, or that the comments are a negotiating tactic by the White House.While PM Modi and Trump share a strong personal rapport, there is growing frustration in New Delhi in recent days over the US president’s insistence he used trade as a bargaining tool to secure a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Indian officials have disputed that.Talking about his conversation with Tim Cook, Trump said, “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. I said to him, ‘Tim, you’re my friend. I treated you very well. You’re coming in with $500 billion (investment). But now I hear you're building all over India. I don't want you building in India.”The company had earlier this year pledged to spend $500 billion in the US over the next four years.As a result of discussions with Cook, Trump said Apple will be “upping their production in the United States”.Cheaper skilled labour and availability of precision-engineered product supply chains have driven Apple to China and India for manufacturing iPhones. American labour and manufacturing in comparison is expensive.Trump suggested that Apple could make its products in India for the Indian market. But made-in-India iPhones being sold in the US has to stop. “You can build in India if you want, to take care of India,” Trump said he told Cook.According to an analysis by S&P Global, iPhone sales in the US were 75.9 million units in 2024, with exports in March from India at 3.1 million units.The Apple ecosystem in India is one the biggest job creators in the country. It is estimated to have employed around two lakh people across various vendors in the country.Since returning to the White House, Trump has pledged to impose “reciprocal” tariffs of 26% on India. Those tariffs are currently on hold until early July.India has made several moves to satisfy Trump’s grievances this year, including overhauling its tariff regime to reduce import duties on prominent American goods like bourbon whiskey and high-end motorcycles made by Harley-Davidson Inc. As part of its trade negotiations, New Delhi has also proposed zero tariffs on some goods like auto components and pharmaceuticals on a reciprocal basis up to a certain quantity of imports.","US President Donald Trump said he has asked Apple CEO Tim Cook to stop producing iPhones in India, and make them in the US instead.

NEW DELHI: Reading the riot act to Telangana govt, Supreme Court on Thursday said it would hold the state chief secretary and other officials accountable and send them to jail if the part of Kancha Gachibowli forest adjacent to Hyderabad Central University that was levelled for an information technology centre is not restored with afforestation in two months.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih asked senior advocate A M Singhvi, who appeared for Telangana govt and attempted to persuade the court about the necessity of setting up the IT centre with protection of forests, whether any forest clearance was taken before trees were felled in a “tearing hurry on a long weekend knowing fully well that the SC’s forest bench would not be available for hearing the matter”.“Did you (Telangana govt) have environment clearance ? If you want to save yourself from contempt, take restoration measures. Otherwise, your chief secretary must get ready to go to jail,” the CJI-led bench cautioned. The bench was not moved when Singhvi said huge afforestation and plantation activities are being undertaken by the state. “Not in the area where the deforestation was carried out,” said Justice Masih . The CJI posted the matter, which the court had taken cognizance of suo motu, for further hearing on July 23.The CJI said, “If you try to defend your action, the chief secretary and dozen other officials responsible for deforestation will stand in danger of contempt.”“You took advantage of a long weekend and brought in a dozen bulldozers to cut down the trees and level the forest area. Prima facie it appears pre-planned. You did so knowing fully well that the bench was not available on the long weekend. Why didn’t you start work on a Monday,” the bench asked.Singhvi said he would like to persuade the court about IT and forest going together. CJI Gavai said, “We are for sustainable development but in this case the state must restore the land to its original shape during the monsoon period.”It was amicus curiae in forest matters, senior advocate K Parameshwar, who brought the illegal felling of trees in the forest patch, leading SC to send an HC registrar for an on-the-spot inquiry. In his report, the registrar informed court around 100 acres of forest land has been destroyed even though wildlife was seen in the area.SC had taken umbrage at Telangana govt’s audacity in carrying out deforestation when the state on March 15 had constituted the forest committee, as directed by SC on Feb 3, for identification of forest areas which have not been so notified. SC had barred all govts from diverting any forest areas for developmental projects till such enumeration of forest land was completed.",Supreme Court said it would hold the state chief secretary and other officials accountable and send them to jail.

NEW DELHI: Arbitration is hailed as the best way to settle commercial disputes , and efforts are being made to make India a global hub of arbitration. However, poor drafting of arbitration clauses in India often leads to parties litigating for years over the method of dispute resolution itself. SC Thursday said those responsible for such poor drafting — including lawyers — should be penalised, and that courts should reject shoddily drafted clauses at the very threshold.Taking note of the fact that a legal dispute between Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and three private contractors went on for a decade on the issue of whether the agreement allowed arbitration proceedings or not, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh said the courts must show an unwavering tendency towards rejecting shoddily drafted clauses and must be thrown out of the court.“The drafting of arbitration clauses in commercial agreements in India leaves much to be desired. Despite arbitration being introduced as a means of ensuring speedy and effective dispute resolution, it is evident and ironic that, in certain cases, the process has been misused to further complicate and prolong the resolution of disputes. The manner in which ambiguity is embedded into such agreements raises serious concerns,” SC said.The bench said it is high time arbitration clauses be worded with piercing precision and clarity, and not couched in ambiguous phraseology which is a responsibility of every legal counsel and advisor.In the present case, the court said the willful and wanton wastage of judicial time was highly deplorable.",Poor drafting of arbitration clauses in India often leads to parties litigating for years over the method of dispute resolution itself.

This direction could create ripples across states and for allottees who have manipulated rules to get forest lands.SC said, “This is a classic example as to how the nexus between the politicians, bureaucrats and builders can result in the conversion of precious forest land for commercial purposes under the garb of resettlement of people belonging to the backward class from whose ancestors, agricultural land was acquired for public purpose.”Writing the judgment, CJI Gavai said, “We hold that the allotment of 11.89 ha (30 acres) of reserve forest land in Survey No.21, Kondhwa Budruk in district Pune for agriculture purposes on Aug 28, 1998, and subsequent permission given for its sale in favour of RRCHS on Oct 30, 1999, was totally illegal.” It also quashed the Union forest ministry’s July 2007 clearance to the project terming it illegal.“We direct that the possession of the subject land, which is reserved as a forest land, but is in possession of the revenue department, should be handed over to the forest department within a period of three months,” the bench said.While adjudicating this case, SC noticed that vast stretches of notified forest land continue to be in possession of revenue departments.","SC cancels Maharashtra govt’s illegal allotment of 30 acres of reserved forest land in Pune, valued at more than Rs 200 crore, for just Rs 2 crore to Richie Rich Cooperative Housing Society (RRCH) in 1998-99.

India wants US to cut duties for labour-intensive sectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-wants-us-to-cut-duties-for-labour-intensive-sectors/articleshow/121196477.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Foreign minister S Jaishankar on Thursday asserted that a trade deal has to be mutually beneficial, and he expected that the proposed agreement with the US should help both countries gain from it.“These are very complicated negotiations, they are very intricate, and nothing is decided till everything is,” Jaishankar said. The comments come just ahead of commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal ’s meetings with US trade representative Jamieson Greer and US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.But any trade deal has to work for both the countries, and I think that would be our expectation from the trade deal, and until that is done, I think any judgment on it would be premature,” he said on the sidelines of an event.Besides, a team of officials led by India’s chief negotiator Rajesh Agarwal will hold detailed discussions on technical aspects of the proposed bilateral trade agreement , including tariff cuts , removal of non-tariff barriers and rules of origin.“The talks are continuing, they are progressing very well and a team is slated to go to the US to conduct further talks,” commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal told reporters.In the past, too, Trump is seen to have spoken out of turn to claim major gains in negotiations even when officials were still busy finalising the rules of engagement.While India is widely expected to lower tariffs on several products of interest to the US, it also wants duties for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles and leather lowered and EAM S Jaishankar’s comments may have been an indication of that.How much of India’s demands are accepted are unclear given that the UK managed to get just around 100 items while the US lowered tariffs in return for levies being slashed for nearly 2,500 American goods. Besides, the UK agreed to buy more planes and other goods from the US to narrow the trade gap.Many trade experts see that as the template for other trade deals as Trump keeps the sword of reciprocal tariffs hanging. Through the discussions, both sides are seeking to take advantage of the 90-day tariff pause that ends on July 9, with an “early deal” also on the horizon to cover a limited set of products.",Foreign minister S Jaishankar says a trade deal has to be mutually beneficial.

NEW DELHI: In the first political contact between India and the Taliban, external affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke to the acting Afghan foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, deeply appreciating the latter’s strong condemnation of the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack.The dramatic improvement in India’s ties with the Taliban in the past few years was on full display during the events that followed the attack, including India’s Operation Sindoor against Pakistani terrorist camps, as Kabul strongly denied Pakistan Army’s claims that India fired missiles at Afghanistan and, in a meeting with Indian officials on April 28, called for bringing the perpetrators to justice.Jaishankar said in a post on X he welcomed Muttaqi’s firm rejection of recent attempts to create distrust between India and Afghanistan through false and baseless reports. “Underlined our traditional friendship with the Afghan people and continuing support for their development needs. Discussed ways and means of taking cooperation forward,’’ said the minister. In its condemnation of the Pahalgam attack, the Taliban had said such incidents undermined efforts to ensure regional security and stability.In another attempt to sow discord between India and the Taliban, there was also a whispering campaign launched to link the Taliban with the Pahalgam attack. Close ties with Afghanistan are important for India also to deny Pakistan the so-called strategic depth it has always sought from the country in the event of a military conflict with India.India doesn’t formally recognise the Taliban regime in Kabul but senior foreign ministry officials have been regularly visiting the country since India reopened its embassy and deployed a technical team to oversee India’s aid distribution to Afghanistan. The embassy had been shut after the return of the Taliban to Kabul in August 2021. There was a dramatic upgrade in ties, even without formal recognition, in January this year as foreign secretary Vikram Misri visited Doha for a meeting with Muttaqi.Muttaqi has been pressing India for more visas to Afghan businessmen and patients, a demand he reiterated in the talks with Jaishankar along with the release and return of Afghan prisoners in India. Jaishankar was said to have assured prompt attention to the issue of Afghan prisoners and to have pledged to streamline the visa process.India had said recently it’s considering resuming work on Indian projects in Afghanistan and also looking at launching new infrastructure projects.According to an Afghan readout, Muttaqi focused on enhancing trade and diplomatic ties with India and stressed the development of the strategic Chabahar port in Iran. The port allows Afghanistan options for expanding trade and connectivity, while reducing its dependency on Pakistan.Referring to India as a key regional country, he expressed optimism that these ties will grow stronger and underlined Afghanistan’s commitment to a “balanced foreign policy and the pursuit of constructive relations with all nations”.“In the conversation, FM Muttaqi requested facilitation in issuing visas for Afghan traders and patients, and called for the release and return of Afghan prisoners currently held in India,’’ said the readout.According to Kabul, Jaishankar echoed Muttaqi’s view that India shares historic ties with Afghanistan and reaffirmed India’s intention to continue its cooperation with the country. He underlined the importance of collaboration in political and economic spheres.",India doesn’t formally recognise the Taliban regime in Kabul.

Amid disruption fears,

assures ‘smooth ops’

NEW DELHI: Citing the “interest of national security”, Modi govt on Thursday revoked security clearance to Turkish ground service provider Celebi and its associated companies, in a move that will impact the security-sensitive ground handling services provided by the company at nine airports, both passenger and cargo terminals.“Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has revoked the security clearance of Celebi and its associated companies on grounds related to national security . Nothing is above the security of our nation and our fellow citizens. National interest and public safety are paramount and non-negotiable. Efforts being made to ensure that employees working with Celebi are retained and continue to contribute and ensure seamless handling of passengers and cargo at all affected airports,” Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said.Celebi Airport Services India Pvt Ltd and two other Celebi companies in India provide ground handling in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Goa, Cochin and Kannur airports. The BCAS order, which is with immediate effect, is seen as a clear message from PM Narendra Modi that supporting Pakistan will have an economic cost for countries doing so.Pakistan had fired Turkish-origin drones on Indian cities during Operation Sindoor . Turkey is facing massive backlash for its support to Pakistan with tour operators reporting widespread cancellations. There are also protests against Turkish goods, such as marbles and apples, sold in India.In a statement, Celebi denied links with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s daughter Sumeyye, who, reports said, was part owner of the company. Sumeyye is married to Selcuk Bayraktar — chairman of BAYKAR, the company that makes drones that were used by Pakistan.Amid fears that operations at some of the airports may be impacted, Delhi airport assured “smooth operations and employee continuity”, while announcing it had ended ties with CASIPL. Most airports have more than one ground handler with Bird Flight Services (BFS) and Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS) operating in Delhi.Bengaluru has AISATS and GlobeGround India. Kochi has BFS, AI Airport Services Ltd (AIASL) and Agile (of IndiGo).Ground handlers provide multiple services to ensure efficient and safe operation of aircraft on the ground. They load and unload baggage, cargo and mail for airlines and airports. They also assist with passenger check-in, boarding and ground services like fuel delivery, aircraft maintenance, vehicles on tarmac, general aviation handling and cleaning of aircraft. They also guide aircraft into parking positions and ensure their safe movement on ground.Meanwhile, India Thursday postponed the credential ceremony for foreign ambassadors at Rashtrapati Bhawan because of “scheduling issues”. The new Turkish ambassador was among the senior diplomats who were slated to present their credentials to President Droupadi Murmu. The new ambassadors of Bangladesh, St Kitts and Nevis, Thailand and Costa Rica were also scheduled to present credentials during the ceremony.The ceremony is now expected to take place next week. The deferment came in the middle of the outrage on social media over the support Pakistan received from Turkiye, a longtime ally of Islamabad, after India launched Operation Sindoor.","Celebi Airport Services India Pvt Ltd and two other Celebi companies in India provide ground handling in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Goa, Cochin and Kannur airports.

Their letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio has already become a bone of contention as several MAGA supporters including Laura Loomer, Steve Bannon, think H-1B, the program that allows US companies to hire skilled immigrants, should be stopped in favor of America First.""The current system (of visa renewal), which requires most non-immigrant visa holders to leave the country for renewals, disrupts lives, strains consular resources abroad, causes undue financial burdens on workers, and creates uncertainty for UD companies relying on these talented individuals,"" the letter said.""By reinstating and expanding domestic visa renewals, this backlog can be alleviated, increasing efficiency and providing greater certainty for US employers, workers, and students,"" the letter said.Apart from the three Indian-origin Congressmen, Rich McCormick, Hank Johnson Jr, Don Bacon, Sanford D Bishop Jr signed the letter.""Every name on that letter is that of a traitor to this country, and we won't forget it.My American suburb is now almost entirely Indian. My home has been turned into a foreign land. We are being conquered, and these sellouts are enabling it. End H1B. End birthright citizenship,"" one wrote slamming the demand.""Hey #MAGA they're voting to import MORE foreign workers to take more American jobs. Is that what you voted for? These liars are all #AmericaLast,"" another wrote. ""Disgusting traitors need to be primaried,"" a third user wrote.The Domestic Visa Renewal Program is a Department of State initiative that allows certain nonimmigrant visa holders, such as those with H-1B visas, to renew their visas within the United States without needing to travel abroad to a US consulate or embassy for processing. This program marks a significant shift from the traditional process, which often requires visa holders to leave the US, attend an interview at a U.S. consulate abroad, and potentially face delays due to visa backlogs or travel restrictions. The program aims to reduce the burden on visa holders who need to renew their visas by allowing them to do so domestically, thereby avoiding international travel, potential delays at overseas consulates, and disruptions to their work or personal lives in the US.A pilot program on this ran from January 29, 2024 to APRIL 1, 2024 and catered to 20,000 H-1B visa applications.","Several Indian-origin politicians, including Ro Khanna, Suhas Subramanyam, Raja Krishnamoorthi, have pushed for doemstic H-1B visa renewal.

Kylian Mbappé's massive fortune and Real Madrid salary

Business ventures and endorsement portfolio

Kylian Mbappé, the sparkling footballer of French nationality, who fulfilled his dream move to Real Madrid in the summer of 2024, has not only become one of the best football players but also a huge financial force. The 25-year-old World Cup winner’s fortune keeps on expanding tremendously through his lucrative playing contracts, sound business investments, and lucrative endorsement deals. Although his on-pitch genius fascinates fans across the globe, Kylian Mbappé’s financial portfolio has also been as stellar, earning him a place amongst the richest in football at a very tender age.According to several financial tracking sources, his current net worth is about £140-200 million ($180 million). His recent transfer to Real Madrid came with a huge financial package, surprisingly a paycheck lower than his previous earnings at Paris Saint-Germain. The French attacker pockets an estimated £250,000 a week after tax, working at Los Blancos, equivalent to £12.8 million in a year.Nevertheless, the huge signing package between £85-128m spread out through his five-year contract makes this deal very profitable. This massive financial set-up is after his previous contract with Paris Saint-Germain, which reportedly was worth a staggering €630 million (£536 million), making it one of the most expensive contracts in sporting history.Apart from his playing salary, Kylian Mbappé has proved to be a great businessman with several investments and endorsement ties. The Frenchman has an 80% share in Ligue 2 club SM Caen through his company Interconnected Ventures, which is said to have injected £12.8 million in the venture. He has also launched the media company Zebra Valley and has invested in the electronics brand Loewe this year.The popularity of the star has led to sponsorship deals with such global brands as Nike (since 2017), luxury watchmaker Hublot (receiving about £1 million yearly), EA Sports (with him as the cover star for several FIFA video game releases), blockchain platform Sorare, and eyewear company Oakley. These endorsement deals collectively earn him about £16.5 million every year, and this is a considerable amount of money towards his total wealth.The footballer’s luxurious life is a representation of his financial state, with a rumoured £15 million mansion purchase in the exclusive La Moraleja or La Finca areas of Madrid. His impressive automobile collection includes two Ferraris that cost over $1 million in total, Mercedes-Benz V-Class, and several Volkswagen vehicles worth almost $200,000 altogether.Fans can watch Kylian Mbappé play when Real Madrid plays Sevilla FC at Estadio Santiago Bernabéu on Saturday, May 18, 2025, at 8:00 PM CEST (2:00 PM ET). The match will be televised live on LaLiga TV and other streaming services across the world.Also Read: Son Heung-min blackmail: Two arrested after Premier League star files complaint Though still not having net worth figures that are higher than those of Lionel Messi (£510 million) and Cristiano Ronaldo (£470 million), Kylian Mbappé’s financial trajectory shows he could be on course to eclipse these legends as his career keeps on thriving at Real Madrid, where the club aims to package him as their next","Kylian Mbappé has signed a five-year deal with Real Madrid worth £85-128m.

What Trump said

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Thursday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his ""total silence"" and sought an ""explicit answer"" from the government after Donald Trump claimed India has offered the United States a ""zero-tariff deal"" on a reciprocal basis.""The commerce minister is in Washington DC and President Trump has made yet another grand announcement from Doha. There is 'total chuppi' from our PM. What has he agreed to and what linkage is there between this and the stoppage of Operation Sindoor?""

Microsoft has introduced new rehire ban and performance management overhaul



Managment roles are being cut across the industry as tech giants push for efficiency

Microsoft has announced that it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, amounting to over 6,000 employees. The cuts at the Redmond giant, which employed 228,000 people as of last June, aim to reduce management layers and streamline operations.""We continue to implement organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.The latest round of job cuts Microsoft's largest reduction since eliminating 10,000 roles in 2023. Unlike January's smaller performance-based cuts, the company indicated these layoffs are structural in nature.These cuts may particularly impact the middle management roles, as the company seeks to create a more streamlined hierarchy by increasing each manager's ""span of control."" Microsoft, as reported by Business Insider previously, aims to prioritise engineering talent as it continues investing heavily in artificial intelligence initiatives.Sources told Business Insider that the laid off employees will stay on the payroll for the 60 days after their termination. Further, the affected staff will also be reportedly eligible for rewards and bonuses.The workforce reduction comes amid significant changes to Microsoft's performance management system. According to internal documents viewed by Business Insider, the company has implemented a two-year rehire ban for employees forced out due to performance issues.Microsoft has also introduced a ""good attrition"" metric to track desirable employee departures. This approach mirrors Amazon's controversial ""unregretted attrition"" system and signals Microsoft's intent to more aggressively manage underperforming staff.Under the new system, employees facing performance issues must either enter a performance improvement plan (PIP) with ""clear expectations and a timeline for improvement"" or accept a ""Global Voluntary Separation Agreement"" with 16 weeks of severance pay. Those who choose the PIP path have just five days to decide and will no longer be eligible for the severance package if they opt for the improvement plan.Microsoft's restructuring reflects a broader trend across the tech industry toward flatter organizational structures and higher engineering efficiency. The company is reportedly focusing on reducing its ""PM ratio,"" the proportion of managers to engineers, across teams.Similar strategies have been implemented at other tech giants, including Amazon and Google, where the top layer of the hierarchy were let go. Meta is also expected to let go off several thousand employees this year, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg pushes for a “year of efficiency.”The layoffs follow Microsoft's better-than-expected quarterly results reported in April, when CEO Satya Nadella indicated the company would make sales execution changes after lower-than-expected growth in non-AI Azure cloud revenue.","Microsoft has announced that it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, amounting to over 6,000 employees.

Mumbai Airport Slots: Transfer of 150 Take-Off/Landing Slots to Navi Mumbai Withdrawn,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-airport-withdraws-transfer-of-150-take-off/landing-slots-to-navi-mumbai-airport-after-talks-with-airlines/articleshow/121179693.cms,"



MUMBAI: In a major win for airlines operating out of Mumbai, the airport operator has decided not to transfer 150 take-off/landing slots from Mumbai airport to the upcoming Navi Mumbai airport, a decision that was supposed to be effected around the end of October this year.The airport also withdrew its earlier decision to ban freighter aircraft operations at Mumbai airport from 16 August.The two decisions were taken following discussions between airlines, Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL), and other stakeholders in the first slot committee meeting held recently. ""Both the decisions were unanimously agreed upon by all stakeholders,"" said a source.Last month, the Mumbai airport informed airlines that a percentage of their slots would be temporarily moved to the upcoming Navi Mumbai airport in October, the start of the winter schedule. This was to facilitate the demolition and reconstruction of Terminal 1 of the Mumbai airport. That would have meant airlines, both domestic and international, would have to move some of their flights to Navi Mumbai airport for the winter schedule, which runs from October to the end of March.The airlines' trade body, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), called the two decisions unilateral and sought govt intervention.In a statement issued last month, John Middleton, IATA's Head for Worldwide Airport Slots, conveyed surprise and deep disappointment at Mumbai airport's ""seemingly permanent withdrawal of historic slots for passenger airlines"" beginning next season. ""This is not what one would expect of a major hub airport in India, and will cause long-lasting damage to the airport's reputation and credibility,"" he said, adding that MIAL gave no details on how it would manage the capacity reduction and mitigate the impact.IATA had expressed serious concerns about the unilateral nature of this decision and its potential implications for Mumbai's air connectivity. ""We hope Adani Airports, as the operator of the two-airport system in Mumbai, is not using this situation to pressure airlines to move their operations to their upcoming Navi Mumbai Airport,"" Middleton has said.The association called for the immediate withdrawal of the proposed cuts and urged MIAL to engage in meaningful consultations with the airline industry. IATA had also recommended several measures, including delaying capacity reduction to October 2025, forming a coordination committee, and developing clear guidelines for the fair distribution of capacity reductions.","The airport operator has decided not to transfer 150 take-off/landing slots from Mumbai airport to the upcoming Navi Mumbai airport.

Yes, it’s important for awareness No, it’s a personal matter





BAREILLY: In a small temple not far from Bareilly's district court, two women stood side by side on Tuesday morning, surrounded not by family but by lawyers. There were no garlands or rituals steeped in tradition — only a shared decision to forge a new path together, one that diverged sharply from the ones they had once walked. Each had been married to a man who withheld the truth about his religious identity, a deception that unravelled not just the legal contract of marriage but their sense of personal trust. What followed for both women was estrangement — from their families, social norms, and certainty itself. What brought them together was that shared fracture.Asha, 27, who now goes by the name Golu, lives in Delhi and works at a baby care centre. Jyoti, 29, is from Civil Lines in Budaun and is the elder of two sisters. When they met at a factory in Delhi three months ago, their conversations were, at first, simply a form of survival — trading stories, finding solidarity in small truths. But soon they noticed parallels that extended beyond coincidence. Both had been misled at a fundamental level by men they were expected to trust implicitly. Both had walked away, unsupported.Both were trying, quietly, to rebuild.Their closeness deepened not through grand gestures but through the accumulation of smaller moments — workday chats, shared meals, evenings filled with the rare comfort of not having to explain. Eventually, they began to imagine a life together. ""We have lost trust in men,"" Jyoti said. ""We decided to marry when we felt we understood each other.""Theirs is not a legally recognised marriage, at least not under Indian law. But it is a declaration. ""If our families support us, that's fine,"" Golu said. ""Otherwise, we'll live together in Delhi. We plan to work, live well, and build a home when our budget allows.""While the Supreme Court decriminalised same-sex relationships in 2018 by reading down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, same-sex marriages still hold no legal standing in India. Lawyer Diwakar Verma, who witnessed the temple wedding, said, ""Two women approached us, expressing their desire to marry. The Constitution grants them the right to live together.""Their decision echoes similar stories emerging from parts of Uttar Pradesh, where women — pushed to the margins by marital betrayal or domestic abuse — have sought solace and stability in companionship outside convention. In Jan 2025, two women from Deoria—Kavita and Gunja alias Bablu — left behind abusive husbands and ""married"" at a temple after meeting on Instagram. In 2018, two women from Hamirpur who had once been in love reunited after years of separation forced by arranged marriages. They divorced their respective husbands and formalised their relationship, though without legal validation.","Asha, 27, who now goes by the name Golu, lives in Delhi and works at a baby care centre.

CHENNAI: The water resources department (WRD) is set to begin evicting more than 600 families living along the Adyar riverbank in Anakaputhur next week, nearly a year after notices were first issued.Despite constructing permanent structures illegally on the river's edge, the squatters had resisted eviction for months. The delay was further prolonged by legal challenges in the Madras high court, which have now been resolved. A senior WRD engineer confirmed that after prolonged negotiations, the department is ready to proceed.The families will be resettled in tenements built by the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board (TNUHDB) across three locations—Perumbakkam, Thailavaram near Perungalathur, and Keerappakkam—with 200 housing units in each.The encroachments in Anakaputhur include settlements in Thai Moogambigai Nagar, Quaid-e-Millath Nagar, Shanthi Colony, and MGR Nagar. With this round of evictions, WRD officials claim that nearly 75% of encroachments along the Adyar river have now been cleared.Four more major settlements remain—Mallippoo Nagar in Adyar, Annai Sathya Nagar on Greenways Road, Saidapet, and the remainder of Anakaputhur.Mallippoo Nagar is the largest, withmore than 1,200 families, followed by Saidapet with more than 500.The other two areas have a few hundred residents each.While the Adyar river restoration project was launched, WRD had identified 9,539 families for resettlement. Officials said the availability of new tenements and recent consent from residents have paved the way for smoother rehabilitation this time.""The rehabilitation drive is essential to prevent environmental degradation and protect lives,"" the senior engineer said.Additionally, as part of the project, desilting along 18 km and fencing across key stretches in Chennai, Kancheepuram, and Chengalpattu has been completed.

NEW DELHI: The accident involving top cyclist Esow Alben – India’s first World Championships medallist – has brought to light serious safety concerns over cycling on the Capital’s roads.It has once again again highlighted poor infrastructure and hazardous conditions faced even by champion cyclists, leave alone everyday ones in the city.Esow, along with his India teammates, was on his daily training routine when he was struck from behind by two speeding motorbikers on the road near to the Indira Gandhi (IG) stadium early Wednesday morning. He managed to escape with minor injuries to his hands and bottom, but the rear wheel of his customised cycle was completely damaged in the impact and now requires repair.According to data shared by Delhi Police, the city witnessed 28 road accidents involving cyclists in the first three months of 2025 alone, which claimed 10 lives. In 2024, 53 people lost their lives in a total of 149 accidents while 106 were injured. In 2023, 30 cyclists died and 118 were injured in 141 accidents. Esow, the 24-year old from Andaman and Nicobar Islands lives and trains at the Sports Authority of India (SAI)-run cycling academy inside the IG complex, which features a world-class velodrome. The academy accommodates the Indian sprint team, comprising 20-25 residential cyclists including top cyclists Ronaldo Singh, Rojit Singh and Jemsh Singh, primarily trains indoors but occasionally ventures outside the stadium.The endurance road racers train at NIS Patiala, where road conditions are considerably safer. Esow said he was lucly that he emerged from the accident unscathed.“I can call myself lucky. There could have been a major tragedy and I could have suffered career-threatening injuries.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"
