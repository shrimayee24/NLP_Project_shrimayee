Why it matters

Inputs from Shailvee Sharda & Intishab Ali

On returning from college recently, Kolkata-based Anusha (name changed) — a thalassaemia patient who contracted HIV through a blood transfusion a few years ago — read a headline that gave her pause.Two years after 14 children in Uttar Pradesh reportedly contracted HIV and hepatitis after blood transfusions, five children with thalassaemia tested HIV-positive after receiving blood at Jharkhand’s Chaibasa Sadar Hospital last month, with a sixth case emerging at another facility in the state.“At least I can afford treatment,” says Anusha. “Many who visit rural centres and govt hospitals can’t.”Opposition leaders have claimed that six more children in Ranchi and one child in Koderma have been affected.For thalassaemia patients — dependent on lifelong transfusions — the Jharkhand case has reopened an old wound.“We are sick and tired,” says lawyer Anubha Taneja Mukherjee. A thalassaemia patient herself, she is member-secretary of Thalassemia Patients Advocacy Group (TPAG), which has long been seeking a uniform national blood law and mandatory upgrade of screening technologies. “This isn’t just a system failure.It’s a violation of the right to safe, life-saving care.”Initial investigation indicates that the Chaibasa blood bank used fourth-generation ELISA tests, but not nucleic-acid amplification testing (NAAT), which can detect infections during the “window period” when ELISA may fail.Five cases have been traced to this facility, whose licence — according to local media reports — lapsed in 2023. While hospitals often operate under “deemed-continuation” rules during renewal, the case has raised questions about accountability, oversight and quality control.Jharkhand health authorities have suspended senior officers and ordered statewide inspections of blood banks, while the high court has taken suo motu cognizance, asking for data on monitoring, donor-camp protocols, and blood-availability practices.Following statewide inspections, the Jharkhand high court — on Nov 19 — noted that licences of 17 blood banks have been cancelled, and directed the state to set a clear timeline for adopting NAAT for blood screening. The court also found that although the inquiry into the Chaibasa incident is complete, the report has not yet been placed on record.“It’s not an isolated incident,” says Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretarygeneral, People’s Health Organisation (PHO), an NGO known for its work in HIV/AIDS awareness, prevention, and treatment advocacy. “They reflect policy paralysis and administrative collapse.”The tragedy comes even as some states have attempted to build stronger shields around vulnerable patients.In Rajasthan, a health official says the state follows a two-layer protocol for those needing frequent transfusions.“For patients requiring frequent transfusions, we first test by ELISA and then use NAAT to prevent transfusion-transmitted infections,” the official says.“We have been using NAAT for four years.” Rajasthan has begun extending NAAT to general patients in Jaipur and Udaipur, with phased expansion planned across districts still reliant only on ELISA. “NAAT must become universal for high-risk groups,” the official adds.In UP, transfusion oversight is managed by the State Blood Transfusion Council, led by Dr Geeta Agarwal. “No case of contaminated blood transfusion has come to the council’s notice in the past 10 years,” she says, adding that UP follows guidelines and SOPs issued by National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC, the central body that coordinates state blood transfusion councils) and cross-checks compliance.“We reinforce rational use of blood every three weeks across all blood banks, mandate testing for HIV, hepatitis B and C, malaria and syphilis, review data monthly, and conduct quarterly quality assessments.”UP has also created a digital monitoring tool with nearly 200 parameters, she says, adding that the Food and Drug Administration conducts at least one physical inspection a year.This is in stark contrast to the gaps exposed in Jharkhand.India’s fight for safe blood began in the late 1980s, when PHO’s public-interest petition spurred early HIV screening in Maharashtra and Goa. A landmark Supreme Court ruling in 1998 mandated national screening and empowered NACO (National Aids Control Organization, under the ministry of health and family welfare) to overhaul blood banks.The reforms worked: transfusion-linked HIV transmission in formal systems dropped from nearly 10% of infections to under 1%. According to NACO’s 2024 report, there are now 2.5 million Indians living with HIV.“While progress has been made, a blood market exists,” says Dr Sanghamitra Ghosh of the Indian Public Health Association. Informal networks, untrained staff and patchy supervision create unsafe pockets, especially in states with limited resources.Thalassaemics are the most vulnerable as they require regular transfusions. India has one of the world’s largest burdens of thalassaemia: of the 12,000 such patients born each year, nearly half don’t reach adulthood.A 2011-2018 study of 1,087 patients across five Indian centres found mortality up to seven times higher in children under five, with transfusion-transmitted infections significantly increasing risk.Globally, NAAT is a gold-standard test because it detects viruses during the earliest phase of infection. It is, however, expensive and requires trained personnel. ELISA is mandated in India; NAAT is optional: “Why is NAAT testing only mandated in certain hospitals in certain states when it should be available to all?” Anusha asks.This safety gap is particularly dangerous in Jharkhand, where tribals constitute over 26% of the population.Experts, as cited in a media report, note that the prevalence of beta-thalassaemia traits is alarmingly high (11%) in these communities because of genetic clustering, historical malaria prevalence, and intra-community marriages, making the need for advanced screening critical.“What we call technology gaps are also governance and capacity gaps,” says Dr Yazdi Italia, Padma Shri awardee and blood-safety advocate. “Machines are only as good as the people running them.”In June, TPAG convened transfusion experts, policymakers and patient groups in Delhi for a strategic dialogue on strengthening blood safety. The group released a white paper shared exclusively with TOI, noting that India’s blood-safety system remains “complex and fragmented”, with varied practices across states and institutions.“Despite its proven effectiveness, NAAT is not yet mandatory or uniformly implemented across India, especially in govt-run or rural facilities,” the paper states.Mukherjee calls the tragedy a wake-up call. “This is not merely a medical systems issue. It is about dignity, equity and the right to safe care.” Transfusion-medicine specialist Dr Sangeeta Pathak told the forum that safety isn’t only about screening: “Any lapse in the chain — from improper cold storage to outdated transport protocols — can waste units and endanger lives.”She called for real-time coldchain trackers, digitised inventories, and geo-tagged traceability from donor to recipient.Despite progress, a shadow market persists. In some pockets, up to 30% of blood still comes from paid donors, who often use false identities to bypass screening.“The blood market still exists,” says Dr Ghosh. “Donors must be traced in this case — otherwise, the chain of infection will continue.”Most banks test only for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and malaria. Donors aren’t always notified of positive results, enabling repeat donation elsewhere.Atul Gera, called the ‘Blood Man of Jharkhand’, told a media outlet that the only guaranteed way to prevent such incidents is to stop the acceptance of “replacement blood” (where a patient’s family must provide a donor) and mandate reliance solely on voluntary blood donation.Experts argue that universal NAAT is unrealistic for every small centre. Instead, they recommend a hub-andspoke model: centralised high-tech hubs that perform advanced screening, with peripheral centres handling storage and distribution.Countries like Canada and the UK already follow this model. “It removes dependence on local equipment or staffing,” says Dr Italia.India has the science, infrastructure and experience to build a safe transfusion system. What it needs, experts say, is political will and urgency. “We owe the kids in Jharkhand — and every citizen — a system where every drop of blood is safe,” Dr Gilada says.","Five children with thalassaemia tested HIV-positive after receiving blood at Jharkhand’s Chaibasa Sadar Hospital last month. The case has raised questions about accountability, oversight and quality control. Rajasthan has begun extending NAAT to general patients in Jaipur and Udaipur.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125578293,imgsize-370785,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-66.jpg"

Give deported people chance to prove their nationality: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Tuesday suggested to the Centre that it bring back the pregnant Sunali Khatun, and five others, including her husband Danish Sekh and their minor son Sabir, who were deported to Bangladesh on grounds of being illegal immigrants, as an interim measure and inquire about their nationality on their return, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. The court, however, called for tough measures against infiltrators.Appearing for the deportees, senior advocates Sanjay Hegde, Kapil Sibal and G Sankaranarayanan told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that Sunali, her husband and son have documents to prove citizenship and their deportation violated their fundamental rights. ""They must be brought back as per Calcutta HC's order,"" they said.Hearing the Centre's appeal against the HC order, the bench said, ""Now that certain material, including landholding records and relatives' statements, have come on record, why don't you bring them back and inquire about their nationality?

After their deportation, a missing person/s complaint was filed with West Bengal police and the gram panchayat issued them domicile certificates. Thereafter, HCs of Delhi and Calcutta were petitioned simultaneously, with the petition before Delhi HC being withdrawn without disclosing that another is pending before Calcutta HC.It said the Delhi Police's inquiry had established that the persons concerned were illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. In fact, they themselves had admitted to the fact. The deportation orders were passed after following due procedure, Centre said.

Udaipur’s High-Profile Wedding

UDAIPUR: All eyes were on Donald Trump Jr as he arrived in Udaipur for a high-profile wedding, but the families hosting the lavish celebrations are far from ordinary. At the centre of the glittering weekend is Rama Raju Mantena, an Andhra-origin US entrepreneur, whose daughter, Netra Mantena, married Vamsi Gadiraju on Sunday at the historic Jag Mandir Island Palace.Rama Raju Mantena — known to many as Raj — traces his roots to Vijayawada. A pharmacy graduate, he moved to the United States in 1984 and went on to build a remarkable entrepreneurial journey.Over the decades, he founded seven companies in the pharmacy and IT sectors, steadily creating value and selling these ventures after unlocking their true potential.His latest enterprise, Integra Connect, focuses on value-based, precision medicine and leads in real-world data, analytics, and AI capabilities for speciality care organisations.Rama Raju’s business instinct and success in the US have earned him the reputation of a powerful industry figure. He is also the nephew of Gokaraju Gangaraju, former BJP MP and entrepreneur.The celebrations began Friday with performances by Kriti, Madhuri, and Shahid, followed by high-voltage shows on Saturday featuring Jennifer Lopez, who flew in on a chartered flight from Ireland, and Justin Bieber.A grand reception is scheduled for November 24.The groom, Vamsi Gadiraju, a Columbia University alumnus and co-founder of the New York-based tech firm Superorder, also has Telugu roots and featured on Forbes’ Under 30 list. Netra, meanwhile, completed her undergraduate studies in pharmacology and works in New York.Trump Jr.’s visit has drawn international attention. After arriving with his girlfriend, he toured the Udaipur City Palace with Rama Raju and met Lakshyaraj Singh Mewar.The meeting reflected deep cultural traditions, with discussions on Mewar’s history. Singh presented symbolic emblems, which Trump Jr described as “special and memorable,” expressing admiration for Maharana Kumbha, Maharana Sanga, and Maharana Pratap.The lavish celebrations, the international guest list, and the layers of security have all drawn attention — but at the heart of it lies the story of Rama Raju Mantena, the Vijayawada-born entrepreneur whose American dream has led to one of Udaipur’s most talked-about weddings.","Rama Raju Mantena, an Andhra-origin US entrepreneur, married Vamsi Gadiraju on Sunday at the historic Jag Mandir Island Palace.

Ash Cloud From Ethiopia Hits India’s Airspace At High Speed, DGCA Issues Urgent Safety Advisory

Ethiopia’s ash cloud heads toward India

Here's the top 10 things to know:

DGCA issued an advisory on Monday asking airlines and airports to prepare for possible disruptions from the volcanic ash plume drifting from Ethiopia.

According to IndiaMetSky Weather the ash cloud entered Gujarat Monday evening before moving towards Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab. The service stated: ""Ash cloud is about to enter Gujarat (West side) and move towards Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab by 10 pm, and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions.""

The plume is travelling 100–120 km/h at altitudes between 15,000 and 45,000 feet, carrying ash, sulphur dioxide and microscopic glass and rock particles.

Akasa Air, IndiGo and KLM have cancelled flights, with routes to the Middle East and Europe particularly affected. Akasa Air said: ""Following recent volcanic activity in Ethiopia and the resulting ash plume in the surrounding airspace, our flights to and from Jeddah, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi scheduled for 24th and 25th November 2025 have been cancelled.""

DGCA instructed airlines to avoid ash-affected airspace, revise flight planning and immediately report any suspected ash encounter, including engine anomalies or cabin smoke/odour.

Airports have been told to inspect runways, taxiways and aprons and restrict operations until cleaning is completed if ash contamination is detected.

Mumbai airport warned passengers: ""A volcanic eruption in Ethiopia has affected airspace over parts of West Asia, which may impact some international routes.""

Authorities watched the plume’s movement towards Delhi and Jaipur, with early signs spotted near Jamnagar around 5.30 pm, leading to disruptions as the situation developed.

The explosive eruption, which began around 8:30 am UTC [1.30 pm IST] on Sunday, marks the first activity from the nearly 10,000-year-dormant volcano.

After the eruption, volcanic ash activity has been reported over parts of the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in airlines issuing cautionary notices for passengers flying through the Middle East, though no advisories have mentioned ash drift toward India.

NEW DELHI: Airline operations across parts of the country faced disruptions after volcanic ash from Ethiopia’s Hayli Gubbi eruption drifted toward western and northern regions, prompting the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Monday to issue a detailed advisory.The ash plume, travelling at high altitudes and significant speed, entered Gujarat and moved eastward through Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.With the cloud containing volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and fine glass particles, airlines have begun cancelling and diverting flights to avoid the dangerous plume.Airports have also been asked to remain vigilant and inspect surfaces for ash contamination that could affect aircraft engines and airfield operations.Multiple carriers, including IndiGo, Akasa Air, and KLM, have already modified schedules, while authorities continue monitoring the cloud’s trajectory. Disruptions are expected to evolve as the plume moves across northern India.IndiGo's Kannur-Abu Dhabi flight (6E 1433) diverted to Ahmedabad on Monday to avoid the affected corridor, while another Indian carrier operating into Abu Dhabi conducted extensive engine checks before beginning its return journey, reported news agency ANI.","Ash cloud from Ethiopia's volcano expected to reach North India by 10 pm.

Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

New Labour Codes: Why will your take home pay go down?

Mandatory retirement contributions, including provident fund and gratuity payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages.

and payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages. The new regulation requires that an employee's basic salary must constitute at least 50% of their total CTC, or meet the government-specified percentage.

This adjustment will lead to higher contributions as both PF and gratuity calculations are based on an individual’s basic pay .

. Whilst this change ensures enhanced retirement benefits for workers, it also means reduced take-home pay, as the increased contributions will come from the existing CTC.

The regulation concerning basic salary aims to stop organisations from intentionally maintaining low basic salary whilst increasing allowances to reduce their obligations towards retirement benefits and gratuity.

Currently, PF contributions are set at 12% of the basic salary, whilst gratuity payments are determined by the final basic pay and tenure at an organisation.

New labour Codes: Impact on Take-Home Salary

.

New Labour Codes: Top points to know

.

New labour codes 2025: The government has notified the new labour laws that may require companies to ensure that the basic salary makes up at least 50% of the total cost-to-company (CTC). This could potentially prompt changes in how pay packages are structured. As a result, for many employees, take-home pay could come down over time as contributions to retirement savings are likely to rise.The government has unified 29 labour-related central laws into four extensive Labour Codes: the Code on Wages (2019), Industrial Relations Code (2020), Code on Social Security (2020), and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code (2020). Starting November 21, 2025, these Codes seek to simplify regulatory compliance, enhance worker safeguards, and modernise India's workforce regulations in accordance with contemporary economic conditions.The Code on Wages became operational on Friday, with the government expected to announce detailed rules within the next 45 days. Companies will need to restructure their salary frameworks to comply with these new regulations.According to experts, employees might receive reduced take-home pay under the new rules, as both provident fund and gratuity contributions would increase within the existing CTC framework.""The new labour codes unify the definition of 'wages' under the Code on Wages and Social Security. This would mean better retirement security through higher gratuity and provident fund but a possible dip in take-home pay if employers restructure allowances downward to offset costs,"" Suchita Dutta, executive director of the Indian Staffing Federation was quoted as saying by ET.The standardisation of wage definitions across labour codes ensures uniformity in computing social security benefits.""Wages now include basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance; 50% of the total remuneration (or such percentage as may be notified) shall be added back to compute wages, ensuring consistency in calculating gratuity, pension and social security benefits,"" explains Anjali Malhotra, partner at professional services firm Nangia Group.According to Puneet Gupta, partner, People Advisory Services at EY India, the implementation of labour codes could result in increased gratuity payments since calculations will be based on ""wages"", encompassing basic salary and all allowances, excluding HRA and conveyance allowance.The new labour codes introduce universal minimum wages for all employees across organised and unorganised sectors, replacing the earlier system that covered only about 30% of workers.A statutory floor wage will be set by the government based on minimum living standards, and no state can fix wages below this benchmark.A uniform definition of wages now applies, where basic pay, dearness allowance, and retaining allowance together must account for at least 50% of total remuneration.The codes mandate gender equality, prohibiting discrimination in hiring, wages, or employment terms for similar work, along with universal wage payment coverage that ensures timely payments and prevents unauthorised deductions for employees earning up to ₹24,000 per month. Overtime compensation must be paid at twice the normal rate.Several compliance and enforcement reforms are included as well. Decriminalisation of offences replaces imprisonment with monetary penalties for first-time violations, and compounding of offences allows certain fines to be settled without prosecution.The threshold for government approval of lay-offs, retrenchment, or closure has increased from 100 to 300 workers, with states allowed to raise it further.Work-from-home is formally recognised in services sectors based on mutual agreement, while dispute resolution will be handled by two-member tribunals for faster outcomes.A mandatory 14-day strike notice aims to prevent sudden disruptions and includes mass casual leave within the definition of a strike.The codes extend social protections to new categories, requiring aggregators to contribute 1–2% of annual turnover towards gig and platform workers’ social security (capped at 5% of their payments).Fixed-term employees become eligible for gratuity after just one year of continuous service instead of five.The inspector-cum-facilitator system introduces randomised, technology-driven inspections to reduce harassment and improve transparency. Compliance is simplified through digitisation of records, as well as a streamlined one license, one registration, one return system.Employers must issue formal appointment letters detailing job roles, wages, and social security.The codes also expand labour flexibility and reduce burdens on small units.Night shifts for women are permitted in all establishments with their consent and safety measures. Contract labour rules include an all-India licence valid for five years.Factory thresholds have been raised to 20 workers for units using power and 40 for those without, reducing compliance requirements for smaller factories.Finally, working hours remain capped at 8 hours per day and 48 hours per week, with flexible weekly structures allowed through mutual consent.","The government has unified 29 labour-related central laws into four extensive Labour Codes: the Code on Wages (2019), Industrial Relations Code (2020), Code on Social Security (2020) Starting November 21, 2025, these Codes seek to simplify regulatory compliance, enhance worker safeguards, and modernise India's workforce regulations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125516988,imgsize-41896,width-400,resizemode-4/new-labour-code-impact.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice Surya Kant has said the growing backlog of cases - 5.4 crore in trial courts, high courts and Supreme Court put together - is a manifestation of deeper structural bottlenecks in the system.The CJI declined to elaborate on his efforts to ensure adequate representation of women and regional representation among SC judges as well as the issue of selective implementation of collegium recommendations for appointments and transfers by the government. ""I am working on these issues,"" he said.After taking oath as CJI on Monday, Justice Kant told TOI, ""A scientific and comprehensive approach is essential to address the challenge of pendency across all tiers of the judiciary."" As of Tuesday, 4.8 crore cases were pending in trial courts, 63.8 lakh in high courts, and more than 90,000 in SC.Batting for a healthy three-tier judiciary that expeditiously addresses citizen's grievances, the CJI said, ""Our judicial system operates as an integrated whole, with each tier serving a crucial purpose. The effectiveness of our democracy depends on the robust functioning of all three levels of the judiciary.""Attributing pendency mainly to acute infrastructural deficiencies, the CJI said, ""A coordinated effort by government and the judiciary is needed. What is urgently required to be done are - timely identification of land and resources for courts, equipping them with essential facilities and expeditious completion of judicial infrastructural projects,"" he said, adding that the emphasis on mediation and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms is expected to lessen the burden on courts in the future.Asked about the growing sense of disappointment among HC judges because of the 'big brother' approach of SC on the judicial side, the CJI said, ""The relationship between HCs and SC is one of constitutional complementarity, not competition. Both institutions serve distinct yet harmonious roles within our federal democracy.""He said the HC's power under Article 225 (jurisdiction of HCs) is in many aspects broader than SC's power under Article 32 (right to constitutional remedies). And, in many instances, SC has asked litigants to first approach HCs for ventilating their grievances, the CJI said. ""The real strength of HCs lies in their proximity to the people.

This made the bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi ask senior advocate Balbir Singh, appearing for SEC, to furnish details by Friday.SC sought by Friday details of the 57 civic bodies where the 50% quota limit is breached and also the percentage of OBC quota in those municipal councils and nagar panchayats. The SEC said the poll schedule for 32 zila parishads and 20 municipal corporations has not yet been finalised.SEC said if Banthia commission recommendations are to be followed, then the delimitation and prescription of reservation as per the percentage of backward and tribal population would be required to be worked out afresh for each civic body, which will take considerable time. The SC had directed the civic body polls, which have not been held for a considerable period, to be held based on reservation in vogue prior to the Banthia report.Appearing for the Maharashtra govt, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said discussions are going on to harmonise the reservations to the extent possible and sought two days' time to get back with response to the court.CJI Kant-led bench said, ""Ultimately if we find that reservation exceeds 50%, we will set it aside as it is constitutionally impermissible.

Airline issue warnings



NEW DELHI: An ash cloud from Ethiopia's Hayli Gubbi volcano hit parts of India Monday evening, according to IndiaMetSky Weather. The plumes first entered Gujarat from the west and then moved rapidly toward Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab by around 10 pm, and is drifting towards the Himalayas and other northern regions.Authorities watched the plume’s movement towards Delhi and Jaipur, with early signs spotted near Jamnagar around 5.30 pm, leading to disruptions as the situation developed.The ash plume is travelling at altitudes between 15,000-25,000 feet, rising up to 45,000 feet in some layers, and carries volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide, and tiny particles of glass and rock.IndiaMetSky Weather warned that skies could appear ""darker and hazier than usual"" and said that the plume may disrupt air traffic and lead to ""delays and longer travel.""The Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) said the explosive eruption began around 8:30 am GMT on Sunday, marking the first activity from the almost 10,000-year-dormant Hayli Gubbi volcano.Thick columns of ash rose up to 14 kilometres into the sky from the Afar region, located around 800 km northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border.The VAAC confirmed that while the eruption had stopped, ""a large ash plume is moving toward northern India.""The volcano sits within the geologically active Rift Valley, where two tectonic plates meet. After erupting, the ash swept across the Red Sea toward Yemen and Oman before drifting eastwards into India and northern Pakistan, according to VAAC and regional media outlets.The windborne ash cloud swept across vast stretches of northwest India on Monday night, passing over Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi-NCR and Punjab. Visibility dipped in several pockets as the plume drifted eastward.IndiaMetSky Weather said, ""Ash clouds moving towards North India. A large ash plume can be seen stretching from #HayliGubbi Volcano region upto #Gujarat. The eruption has stopped ever since the eruption, but this Ash plume has been sent up into the atmosphere, which is moving at a speed of 100-120km/h toward North India.”It added that the plume, containing volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and ""small particles of glass/rock,"" would likely darken the skies and impact flight routes. ""The Ash cloud is about to enter #Gujarat (West side) and move towards #Rajasthan NW #Maharashtra, #Delhi, #Haryana and #Punjab by 10 pm and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions,"" the agency said.By late night, the sulphur dioxide–rich plume was already moving over Delhi, NCR, Haryana and adjoining districts of Uttar Pradesh. IndiaMetSky Weather explained that although some pockets of ash could be seen over Rajasthan, chances of ashfall on the plains remained ""less.""Also read: 'Moving at a speed of 100-120km/h': Ethiopian volcanic ash drifts towards India — 10 things to know According to the meteorological service, the ash cloud’s altitude means that India’s surface-level AQI is not expected to deteriorate.It reiterated that the event was ""mostly safe"" and said it would ""not like to impact surface AQI levels as Ash clouds are in 25,000 to 45,000 feet above the surface.""The agency said the plume was stretching from the Oman–Arabian Sea region into northern and central India. ""Its will not impact AQI levels but it will impact So2 level at #Hills of #Nepal, #Himalayas and adjoining Terai belt of #UttarPradesh as some of the material will bump into the hills and later move into China,"" it posted on X.It clarified that the plume would drift over Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan, but the impact on the ground would be limited to darker skies and hazier conditions.While a few particles might fall to the surface, IndiaMetSky described the likelihood as ""low.”The agency also noted that residents might notice skies resembling a dust storm, though without harmful concentrations of particulate matter at ground level. People were advised to wear masks as a precaution, but officials stressed that the event was occurring at ""middle levels of the atmosphere.""Also read: Ethiopia’s volcanic ash cloud enters India: Is Delhi's already ‘very poor’ air at risk?

In India, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) released an advisory on Monday instructing airlines and airports to prepare for possible disruptions.It directed carriers to avoid volcanic-ash-affected routes and adjust flight plans, routing and fuel loads based on the latest advisories. The DGCA also said airports must immediately inspect runways, taxiways and aprons if ash contamination is suspected and restrict operations until cleaning is completed.Also Read: What is the new Ethiopian volcanic ash cloud speeding towards India?

'All 140 MLAs Are Mine': DK Shivakumar Amid Karnataka CM Speculation; Siddaramaiah Responds

Mallikarjun Kharge on Karnataka power tussle

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar on Tuesday remarked that he does not want to discuss the CM change issue “publicly,” describing it as a “secret deal” involving “four and five people” in the party.Shivakumar, who also heads the Karnataka Congress, explained that he does not want to cause any “embarrassment” to the grand old party.“I don’t know. I have not asked to be made CM. It is a secret deal between five and six of us. I don’t want to speak publicly on this. I believe in my conscience. We should work with our conscience. I don’t want to embarrass the party or weaken it. If the party is there, we are there. If ‘karyakartas’ are there, we are there,” he told reporters, according to PTI. He was visiting his home constituency, Kanakapura.“The chief minister ( Siddaramaiah ) has spoken. He is a senior leader, an asset for the party. He has completed 7.5 years as CM,” Shivakumar added, referring to Siddaramaiah’s earlier five-year term from 2013–2018.Asked about legislators backing him travelling to Delhi to meet the Congress high command with a demand to make him CM, Shivakumar responded that he was ""unaware"" of it, suggesting they might be making efforts to secure ministerial positions.“I have not telephoned or called any of them (legislators) or spoken to them. I’m not asking them why they went. I don’t need it,” he remarked.A batch of six Congress legislators supporting him had travelled to Delhi on November 23 to meet senior leaders, according to party sources, who added that a few more MLAs are likely to follow soon to push Shivakumar’s case.Last week, around ten legislators backing him had met Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge with the same demand.The power tussle within the ruling party has intensified amid speculation over a leadership change, after the state government reached the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, following talk of a “power-sharing” agreement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar in 2023.Meanwhile, Kharge, too, maintained that the issue of leadership change in Karnataka is not something to be taken up in public.The veteran leader, in Delhi to attend Constitution Day celebrations on Wednesday, told reporters: “This is not a subject to be discussed here and that too in public. I have specially come to attend an event related to Constitution Day. After the event, I have review meetings, after which I will proceed further.”Siddaramaiah has repeatedly maintained that he will remain chief minister for the full five-year term and will continue to present future state budgets.", DK Shivakumar says he does not want to discuss the CM change issue ‘publicly’ He says it is a ‘secret deal’ involving ‘four and five people’ in the party.

Bank fraud case: Sandesara bros may end up paying more than they owe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sandesara-bros-may-end-up-paying-more-than-they-owe/articleshow/125573493.cms,"The total recovery in the case is now set to touch Rs 10,000 crore



NEW DELHI: A fresh calculation by Enforcement Directorate shows that if fugitive Sandesara brothers - Nitin and Chetan - stick to their offer to pay Rs 5,100 crore to lender banks, they will have paid more than what they owe these financial institutions.Govt has already recovered Rs 4,700 crore from the Sandesaras' Sterling Biotech Ltd (SBL) since 2018, when the agency began its money laundering probe against the duo and attached more than Rs 14,500 crore worth of their assets in India and abroad, including oil rigs, ships and aircraft in Nigeria. With their fresh commitment, the total recoveries would now be over Rs 9,800 crore, sources said. This is much higher than the banks' earlier demand of Rs 6,700 crore as one-time settlement.A day after Supreme Court took on record the Sandesara brothers' commitment to pay Rs 5,100 crore - if they were allowed to return to India and run their business, and criminal proceedings against them were dropped - there was celebration in ED headquarters over the biggest recovery from accused since enactment of Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The total recovery in the case is now set to touch Rs 10,000 crore.Their offer will bring relief to an interesting cast that was found to have links with SBL and whose assets were treated as ""proceeds of crime"" and attached.The attached assets, which may now be released, include properties of actors Sanjay Khan (Rs 3 crore), Dino Morea (Rs 1.4 crore), DJ Aqeel (Rs 2 crore), Congress neta Sonia Gandhi's political secretary the late Ahmed Patel (Rs 2.5 crore) and his son-in-law Irfan Siddiqui's properties worth Rs 2.4 crore, besides 23 luxury vehicles of Sandesara brothers and their associates.The success in bringing the duo to the negotiating table is also being credited to the accused siblings being declared fugitive economic offenders in Sept 2020.""This declaration strengthened ED's position considerably because it enabled the agency to seek confiscation of all their properties, irrespective of whether they were proceeds of crime or untainted assets,"" sources said. This recognised that SBL's promoters had deliberately avoided the jurisdiction of Indian courts.""It is the continuous pressure created by ED and the coordinated approach of other agencies that compelled the group to eventually seek a resolution on terms acceptable to the lenders and the state. What appears on the surface as a concession is in reality the final step in a long process of enforcement, asset-tracing and legal action, much of it undertaken by ED, which ultimately brought the fugitives to the negotiating table,"" a senior official said.The Sandesara brothers and their SBL had already paid Rs 3,508 crore on various dates during legal proceedings before various courts. In addition, the insolvency proceedings against their group entities yielded another Rs 1,192 crore, the official said.""With this, the total realisation becomes significant. The amounts already recovered (Rs 4,700 crore) along with what is now being ordered by SC (Rs 5,100 crore) add up to Rs 9,800 crore. This is nearly double the figure alleged in the FIR and it shows that the enforcement and recovery process has resulted in a substantial net restitution to the banking system,"" the official added.CBI's FIR registered in 2017 had alleged diversion and defaults by the group amounting to Rs 5,383 crore. The lender banks had later proposed one-time settlement for all dues for Rs 6,761 crore. The recoveries of nearly Rs 10,000 crore exceeds even their expectations.","The total recovery in the case is now set to touch Rs 10,000 crore.

"Cannot monitor, entertain every hate speech case in country: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cannot-monitor-entertain-every-hate-speech-case-in-country-sc/articleshow/125572876.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday expressed its reluctance to take cognisance and interfere in cases of hate speeches brought before it from every nook and corner of the country, and said the aggrieved person should instead approach police or the concerned high court to raise their grievances.While hearing an application pertaining to alleged calls made by lawmakers of various states for the social and economic boycott of a particular community, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said it was not possible for the apex court to entertain every such incident. The bench said SC had already passed the order and it was for police to take action as per law.""How can this court continue to monitor all such instances all over the country? You approach the authorities. Let them take action, otherwise go to HC,"" the bench said.Advocate Nizam Pasha, appearing for journalist Qurban Ali, submitted that the state authorities were not taking action and the apex court order was being violated with impunity. He said the top court had itself passed an order directing that suo-motu action must be taken by police in case of hate speech, failing which contempt proceedings would be initiated.Opposing the plea, solicitor general Tushar Mehta submitted that only instances of hate speeches against a particular community are brought before the court and not all hate speech cases. He also questioned the motive behind the application. ""No one can indulge in hate speech - that is my stand. But while complaining, a public spirited person cannot be selective,"" Mehta said.But Pasha said hate speeches calling for social and economic boycott were made by MLAs and various organisations. He told the court an Assam minister made a controversial remark on ""gobi farming"" after the Bihar assembly poll result which allegedly referred to a gory incident during the 1989 Bhagalpur riots.""It is submitted that a call for boycott whether made by a public authority or a private citizen is in violation of Article 15 of the Constitution, particularly when the said boycott is based solely on religious grounds. It is pertinent to note that such calls for boycott based solely on religion are a threat to national unity and integrity and are also blot on the idea of India as envisioned by framers of our Constitution. The said instances of banishment have remained unchecked by the state authorities despite being duty bound to protect all the citizens of this country. It is further submitted that the major brunt of this gross discrimination is borne by the lowest income groups,"" the application said.The court, after a brief hearing, directed that the applications will be heard along with the main case and posted it for next month.Last month, the court had agreed to hear an application filed by former Patna HC judge Anjana Prakash and journalist Qurban Ali who brought to the court's notice a video circulated by Assam BJP in support of its claim that Muslims would take over the state if BJP goes out of office.","Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said it was not possible for the apex court to entertain every such incident.

Treat cricket betting profits as 'proceeds of crime': HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/treat-cricket-betting-profits-as-proceeds-of-crime-hc/articleshow/125572327.cms,"NEW DELHI: Profits from cricket betting will be treated as ""proceeds of crime"" under the money laundering law if the money is found to be linked to a criminal activity defined as a scheduled offence under PMLA, Delhi high court has ruled.Justices Kshetarpal and Shankar dismissed a batch of petitions filed by several individuals involved in an alleged Rs 2,400-crore international cricket betting racket, dating to 2015, who had challenged the provisional attachment orders issued over a decade ago by ED.In Sept 2015, ED attached movable and immovable properties valued at Rs 20 crore belonging to the accused and issued a show-cause notice in Oct 2015 for money laundering. The action was initiated in connection with large-scale hawala transactions and illegal international cricket betting operations conducted through a UK-based website, Betfair.com.ED alleged that the operations were run from a farmhouse in a village in Vadodara. The attachment followed a raid on the residence of one of the accused, who was allegedly acting as a conduit in the betting network. He had reportedly bought master and client login IDs for a betting platform at Rs 2.4 crore each and made payments abroad through unauthorised channels.The agency found these IDs were issued without the KYC process. ED recovered incriminating documents, valuables and Rs 10 lakh in cash. The petitioners challenged these actions in HC.The bench observed, ""If a person acquires any immovable property through acts of forgery, cheating, and criminal conspiracy, and thereafter utilises such property for a downstream activity - such as conducting an unlicensed real-estate business, which is not a scheduled offence - the proceeds generated from the latter activity nonetheless constitute 'proceeds of crime' under PMLA.""","Justices Kshetarpal and Shankar dismissed a batch of petitions filed by several individuals involved in an alleged Rs 2,400-crore international cricket betting racket.

SHAHABAD, KURUKSHETRA: India’s cooperation sector is set for major expansion as Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah has set a national target to establish 150 new sugar mills in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a Developed India by 2047, said Haryana Cooperation, Jails, Elections, Heritage and Tourism Minister Dr Arvind Sharma. He said that work has already begun to set up a cooperative sugar mill in Naraingarh, marking the state's contribution to this national initiative.Addressing the inaugural ceremonies of the 50th crushing season of the Karnal Cooperative Sugar Mill and the 42nd crushing season of the Shahabad Cooperative Sugar Mill through online mode, Minister Sharma highlighted that Haryana has taken significant steps to support sugarcane farmers. He said chief minister Nayab Singh Saini has announced the highest sugarcane procurement price in the country—Rs 415 per quintal for early varieties and Rs 408 per quintal for late varieties. Sharma said he would soon meet the chief minister along with public representatives to request special incentive schemes for sugarcane farmers.The events were attended by cabinet minister Krishna Kumar Bedi, MP Naveen Jindal, MLA Ramkaran Kala in Shahabad, and Chief Whip and Indri MLA Ramkumar Kashyap, along with Sugar Federation MD Shakti Singh and farmers in Karnal.Sharma emphasised that the cooperative sector will play a crucial role in fulfilling the nation’s development goals. He noted that the Haryana government has ensured timely payment to farmers and introduced an online token system, which has helped farmers save 10–12 hours in transporting cane to the mills.Thanks to last year’s efforts to reconnect former cane growers with the mills, Karnal Mill is expected to crush 3.9 lakh quintals more cane, while Shahabad Mill will receive an additional 2 lakh quintals this season. Both mills continue to win national awards and are progressing with the collective hard work of farmers and staff.Sharma said he would urge the CM to provide subsidised harvesting machinery to ease farmers’ workload and launch new incentive schemes to encourage continuous cane cultivation. He directed mill managements to prioritise farmers’ welfare, “win their hearts,” and ensure they face no difficulties.Reaffirming the government’s commitment, Dr Sharma said that both the Centre and the Haryana government are dedicated to strengthening farmers’ interests. He conveyed CM Saini’s greetings to the farmers and management teams on the commencement of the crushing season.Senior officials, including Shahabad Mill MD Pradeep Ahlawat and Karnal Mill MD Aditi, were also present on the occasion.","Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah has set a national target to establish 150 new sugar mills in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a Developed India by 2047.

PM Narendra Modi participated in the IBSA Leaders' Meeting on G20 margins, stressing that UNSC reform is imperative, and said that there should be no room for double standards while fighting terrorism.PM Modi joined the trilateral mechanism meet hosted by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and attended also by Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.While all three countries have had their share of problems with the US under Trump, diplomatic sources played down suggestions that the meeting was a response to the Americans as they cited the fact that a substantive IBSA summit meeting took place on the margins of 2024 G20 summit too in Rio.The US boycotted the G20 summit in South Africa because of alleged mistreatment of white Afrikaners.PM Modi said global institutions do not reflect the realities of 21st century. ""None of us is a permanent member of UN Security Council. This clearly demonstrates that global institutions no longer represent today's world. Therefore, IBSA must send a unified message to the world: institutional reform is not an option but imperative,"" he said.""Similarly, we must work in close coordination in the fight against terrorism. On an issue of such gravity, there can be no room for double standards. For the sake of global peace and prosperity, united and decisive action is essential,"" he added, calling for institutionalising the NSA-level meeting of the countries to strengthen security cooperation.Describing the meeting as timely, PM Modi noted it coincided with the first G20 summit on African soil and marked the culmination of four consecutive G20 presidencies by Global South countries, of which the last three were by IBSA members. This, he said, had resulted in several important initiatives focused on human-centric development, multilateral reform and sustainable growth. Modi emphasised IBSA is not just a group of three countries but an important platform connecting three continents, three major democratic nations and three major economies.""Highlighting technology's crucial role in ensuring human-centric development, the PM proposed establishing an 'IBSA Digital Innovation Alliance' to facilitate sharing of Digital Public Infrastructure like UPI, health platforms like CoWIN, cybersecurity frameworks and women-led tech initiatives among the countries,"" said an Indian readout, adding the PM also emphasised IBSA's potential to contribute to development of safe, trustworthy and human-centric AI norms. He invited IBSA leaders to the AI summit next year.""Appreciating IBSA Fund's work in supporting projects across 40 countries in sectors like education, health, women empowerment and solar energy, the PM proposed IBSA Fund for Climate Resilient Agriculture to further advance South-South Cooperation,"" said the Indian government.","PM Narendra Modi participated in the IBSA Leaders' Meeting on G20 margins.

Justice Surya Kant, Known For Article 370 Ruling And Pegasus Scrutiny, Takes Oath As India’s New CJI

Ex-HC CJ not in ambit of detailed in-house proceedings

NEW DELHI: Outgoing CJI B R Gavai disclosed Sunday that it was a high court chief justice who had attempted to influence a judicial member of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), Chennai, for a favourable order for a corporate entity, and that he narrowly escaped an in-house inquiry due to his retirement and other reasons.The CJI said he had sought a report from NCLAT judicial member Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma who had startled everyone by disclosing in open court on Aug 13 that ""one of the most revered members of the higher judiciary of this country"" had approached him to secure a favourable order and recused himself from hearing the case.The CJI said by the time Justice Sharma sent a detailed report, the HC chief justice in question had retired; thus, a formal in-house inquiry could not be ordered against the errant member of the judiciary.The CJI said that shortly after he initiated deliberations among his colleagues over the process or procedure to be adopted to weed out such attempts in future, the President appointed Justice Surya Kant as his successor to the post of CJI. ""That is why I thought it better to leave it to the new CJI to take appropriate action on the issue,"" he said.The retired HC CJ is out of the ambit of detailed in-house proceedings, an adverse finding in which could persuade the CJI to recommend govt to initiate a motion in Parliament for the judge's removal.However, he may not be completely out of the arc of accountability as the new CJI, Justice Surya Kant, could still recommend registration of FIR under Prevention of Corruption Act.On November 14, addressing the matter, a bench of CJI-designate Justice Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi had told advocate Prashant Bhushan, who was appearing for a petitioner, that ""action will have to be initiated at the highest level (of the judiciary, that is the CJI) against the one who attempted to interfere with the administration of justice. If Supreme Court takes up this issue on the judicial side, then it would run counter to the power vested in the highest authority. The highest authority cannot be guided by judicial orders to take a decision.""Noting the seriousness of the matter, the bench had said that under the existing legal framework for fixing accountability on constitutional court judges, the issue raised by the petitioner should be dealt with on the administrative side.","Outgoing CJI B R Gavai disclosed Sunday that it was a high court chief justice who had attempted to influence a judicial member of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.

Ishbia is a famous personality and according to a May 2024 Forbes estimate, his net worth is roughly $10.1 billion.

Fresh allegations deepen turmoil inside Mat Ishbia’s Phoenix Suns empire

Mat Ishbia, the owner of the Phoenix Suns, recently got into trouble. He reportedly made the news after two minority owners, Scott Seldin and Andy Kohlberg, filed a complaint against Ishbia. He was charged with financial manipulation, self-dealing, and fraud within the NBA team, according to a story published by the prominent media outlet The Athletic.In addition to being the chairman and CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM), he owns the Phoenix Suns and Mercury basketball teams.Another round of legal action within the Phoenix Suns ownership group apparently began on Monday when two minority owners filed an explosive complaint. It accused majority owner Mat Ishbia of fraud, self-dealing, and manipulating team finances for his own gain.Ishbia allegedly used the team as his ""personal piggy bank,"" according to Front Office Sports. The Suns swiftly denounced this as ""a shameless shakedown dressed up as legal process."" The latest filing stated, via ESPN:""Ishbia does not own the Suns to make money for the company but he does operate it as a personal fiefdom for his own personal gain and for the benefit of his other businesses, including his mortgage company United Wholesale Mortgage...The reality is that Ishbia is using the Suns as his personal piggy bank, including through a lengthy list of conflicted transactions—only some of which the minority owners are aware of. ""The June 2 capital call, which is a regular obligation for ownership groups to contribute funds, is at the heart of the issue, according to the document. Scott Seldin and Andy Kohlberg, the minority owners, claim that Ishbia failed to meet the deadline he set and then made a covert attempt to conceal the failure from the other members of the ownership group.Additionally, the lawyers of the other two owners claimed in a statement to ESPN:“[Ishbia] has repeatedly abused his position as manager of the franchise to benefit himself—not the Suns.. We look forward to moving forward on an expedited basis and presenting our case to the court.""Ishiba has been under investigation because it was alleged that he concealed his spending information from Scott Seldin and Andy Kolhberg, the co-owners. Ishbia and his source of income is now facing questions.Mat Ishbia amassed his wealth by expanding his father's business, United Wholesale Mortgage. Through rapid expansion, cutting-edge technology, and a policy prohibiting brokers from collaborating with specific rivals, UWM emerged as the biggest mortgage lender in the country.In 2023, Ishbia acquired a majority stake in the Phoenix Suns. After an investigation by ESPN's Baxter Holmes revealed claims of racism and misogyny within the organization, he bought the team from Robert Sarver, the previous owner. Nevertheless, Ishbia or his representatives are yet to comment on the whole thing.Also read: Phoenix Suns vs Portland Trail Blazers (11-18-2025) game preview: When and where to watch, expected lineup, injury report, prediction, and more","Mat Ishbia, the owner of the Phoenix Suns, recently got into trouble.

Fei-Fei Li’s education and early work experiences shape her AI breakthroughs





Fei-Fei Li combining science and perseverance to build AI





How early experiences shaped Fei-Fei Li’s AI work









Fei-Fei Li, often called the ""Godmother of AI,"" is the founder of World Labs, a rapidly growing AI startup valued at over $1 billion within its first year. Her journey, however, began far from the tech spotlight. Li immigrated from China to the United States at the age of 15. Her family faced financial difficulties, and they decided to open a small dry-cleaning business in Parsippany, New Jersey, to make ends meet.Li spent seven years running the shop alongside her parents. She handled customer calls, billing, inspections, and daily operations, joking that she was the ""CEO."" This early immersion in responsibility not only developed her resilience but also taught her critical problem-solving skills that would later guide her scientific career and influence her leadership approach in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence.Even while pursuing her education, Li remained closely connected to her family’s business. She attended Princeton University for her undergraduate degree, deliberately staying near the dry-cleaning shop. Later, during her Ph.D. at Caltech, she continued managing the business remotely. She credits this period with teaching her how to balance demanding responsibilities, reinforcing her work ethic and adaptability.Li first gained prominence through her work on ImageNet, a large-scale visual database that transformed computer vision. ImageNet provided AI systems with vast amounts of labelled visual data, enabling them to recognise objects and understand images with unprecedented accuracy. This innovation laid the foundation for modern AI research and demonstrated the potential of teaching machines to ""see"" and understand the world.At World Labs, Li is now focused on building world models, advanced AI systems designed to understand and interact with the physical world. Unlike current large language models, which primarily process text, world models integrate spatial and visual intelligence. This allows AI to perceive its environment, reason about complex situations, and make informed decisions. Li believes this approach represents the next phase of the AI revolution, moving beyond language-based intelligence toward machines capable of more human-like understanding.Li attributes her career achievements to two qualities: resilience and curiosity. Her experience as an immigrant managing her family’s shop taught her perseverance in the face of challenges, a mindset that is essential in scientific research, which is often non-linear and filled with trial and error. Her innate curiosity, fostered from a young age, led her to explore science passionately rather than pursue other distractions common among her peers.Li’s work in AI is closely connected to her personal history. Managing a business as a teenager and young adult required her to navigate complex problems, communicate effectively, and stay organised under pressure. These skills translated naturally into her research career, where problem-solving, adaptability, and persistence are paramount. She sees her AI work as an extension of this early foundation, striving to create systems that can learn, adapt, and act intelligently in the real world.","Fei-Fei Li, often called the ""Godmother of AI,"" is the founder of World Labs, a rapidly growing AI startup valued at over $1 billion.

Nvidia’s historic milestone



JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn’t sugarcoat AI impact on jobs





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has now hailed Nvidia as an unbelievable company and has also cautioned investors that some artificial intelligence stocks may be trading at an unsustainable levels. Speaking with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Dimon said that the US remains the ‘most prosperous’ economy in the world. He adds that the US economy is supported by diverse and deep capital markets including venture capital, private credit and hedge funds. “There’s no question some people will lose money,” Dimon said, drawing parallels to the dot-com era. “But mankind should benefit,” he added, emphasising that the underlying technology is real and transformative—even if valuations are currently inflated.Dimon emphasized that AI is a genuine productivity revolution, comparing its current stage to the early days of the Internet. “It’s almost at the beginning,” he said, noting that while not every company will succeed, AI will produce transformative winners just as the internet gave rise to Google, Facebook, and Amazon.Dimon acknowledged that valuations in the AI sector may be inflated, but stressed that the underlying technology will reshape industries and improve lives.“Mankind should benefit,” he said, even if “valuations today may be too high for some of these folks.”In October 2025, Nvidia became the first company in history to surpass a $5 trillion market valuation. Its market cap currently stands at $4.74 trillion, underscoring its dominance in the AI chip market. Dimon’s remarks came shortly after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted that China will win the AI race, a claim that drew sharp pushback from President Donald Trump, who vowed the U.S. would not allow other nations access to Nvidia’s most advanced chips.In another interview with Bloomberg TV, Dimon talked about the impact of AI on the job market. “People shouldn’t put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs,” he said. “AI will enhance some aspects of work, but also eliminate some jobs.” However, Dimon also stressed on the fact that JPMorgan is focused on retaining and redeploying employees whose roles are impacted by automation. “We’ll have more jobs, but there’ll probably be less jobs in certain functions,” Dimon added. “You’re better off being way ahead of the curve,” Dimon added.Dimon also added that the bank has invested about $2 billion as an annual investment in AI and is already making $2 billion in direct benefits. This includes the headcount reductions and operational savings. “We know about $2 billion of actual cost saves,” he said. “It’s the tip of the iceberg.”","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has hailed Nvidia as an unbelievable company.

Apple CEO Tim Cook may not be retiring anytime soon. Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Tim Cook is planning to step down as soon as next year. However, a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggests that Cook has no plans of stepping down in the near future. Apple has been preparing for a leadership transition for quite some time. In 2024, Bloomberg revealed that Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus was at the center of succession discussions. Ternus the youngest member of Apple’s executive team looks after the hardware division and is also widely respected by Apple CEO Tim Cook and former COO Jeff Williams.Then in October this year, Bloomberg suggests that the internal spotlight on Ternus was ‘intensifying’, making him the likely candidate to succeed Cook.Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook may step down from his position in between January and June 2026. As per the report, the current CEO Tim Cook is said to be succeeded by John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice-president of hardware engineering. However, no final decision has been made, sources told the publication. They also stressed that the transition plans are not tied to Apple’s current performance, as the company heads into what is expected to be a strong holiday season for iPhone sales.Taking about this upcoming transition, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman wrote, “Based on everything I’ve learned in recent weeks, I don’t believe a departure by the middle of next year is likely.” This means there are less chances of Tim Cook retiring anytime soon.Cook, who turned 65 this month, took over as CEO in 2011 after co-founder Steve Jobs died. Under his leadership, Apple’s valuation has climbed from around $350 billion to $4 trillion. Despite strong results last month, Apple’s roughly 12% stock rise this year trails rivals like Alphabet, Nvidia and Microsoft, which have surged on AI momentum.“Yes, Apple will eventually have a new leader. And, yes, it’s probably Ternus. But unless there is some unexpected event that forces Cook to step down sooner than planned, that moment is not at hand. But there still may be significant movement on Apple’s executive team. As I recently reported, silicon chief Johny Srouji is seriously evaluating his future at the company, while Apple has been on the hunt for a new AI leader,” said Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.While the retirement of Apple CEO Tim Cook is not imminent, Bloomberg reveals that the company will still witness some leadership changes in the coming weeks. As per the report,Apple’s silicon chief, Johny Srouji may be evaluating his future at the company. Also, Apple is actively looking for a new AI leader in order to strengthen its position in generative AI sector.","Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Tim Cook is planning to step down as soon as next year. However, a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggests that Cook has no plans of stepping down in the near future. Apple has been preparing for a leadership transition for quite some time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125533477,imgsize-19768,width-400,resizemode-4/apple-ceo-tim-cook-wishes-happy-diwali-shares-photo-taken-on-iphone-17-pro-max.jpg"

Despite concerns about slowing ChatGPT engagement, Altman remains optimistic about the company's long-term vision for superintelligence and its strategic partnerships, including one with Foxconn to bolster US AI infrastructure.

""catching up fast""

What Sam Altman said OpenAI employees about the company’s biggest rivals

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

“We have built enough strength as a company to weather great models shipping elsewhere competition... (so), having most of our research team focused on really getting to superintelligence is critically important,”

“It s**ks that we have to do so many hard things at the same time — the best research lab, the best AI infrastructure company, and the best AI platform/product company — but such is our lot in life. And I wouldn't trade positions with any other company,”

“This partnership is a step toward ensuring the core technologies of the AI era are built here [US],” and added that AI infrastructure production presents a

“generational opportunity to reindustrialise America.”

""is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure.""

""Congrats to Google on Gemini 3! Looks like a great model,"" he said after the launch. Pichai replied with 'folded hands' emoji.





ChatGPT maker OpenAI 's CEO Sam Altman is optimistic about Google 's recent successes in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In a recent internal memo to colleagues, Altman acknowledged that the AI startup rival's success couldHowever, Altman reassured that OpenAI isand anticipates emerging as the leader in the AI race. It's important to note that Altman's memo was written before Google's Gemini 3 was released, a model the tech giant has described as its most capable to date. Software developers have reported that the new model performed well on tasks such as automating website and product design and writing code, which is a lucrative revenue stream for OpenAI and its competitors, such as Anthropic.Concerns about OpenAI's slowing growth arose late this summer. During a recent quarterly earnings call with investors, the company’s CFO, Sarah Friar, confirmed that user engagement with the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT had cooled, despite the company's otherwise positive financial results.According to a report by The Information (as seen by The Economic Times), Sam Altman's memo noted that competitors such as Google and Anthropic are narrowing the gap in the AI raceAnthropic’s Claude model generates computer code for various tasks using conversational prompts.Meanwhile, Google has been integrating its Gemini AI chatbot into its search app, productivity tools and other services. However, recently, Claude gained a new challenger from OpenAI with the introduction of Codex.Google also holds an economic advantage. OpenAI’s growth has been rapid and the company now carries a valuation of around $500 billion as a for-profit entity. It is expected to bring in about $13 billion in revenue, but is estimated to burn roughly $100 billion in its push toward superintelligence.With a market value of about $3.5 trillion, Google reported free cash flow of over $70 billion in the past four quarters. A significant portion of this comes from providing cloud services to OpenAI, Anthropic and other competitors.Sam Altman also encouraged OpenAI employees to stay confident and focus on the company's larger goals.Altman wrote in the internal memo.Altman added.Recently, OpenAI partnered with Apple's biggest suuplier Foxconn to design and build AI data-centre components in the US. Under this partnership, OpenAI will help develop future server systems and may purchase Foxconn-produced hardware in the coming days. Altman noted that this collaboration can strengthen American manufacturing infrastructure.Commenting on the partnership, Altman said:Foxconn will join OpenAI’s supply chain to manufacture AI-related hardware in a more American way. The company, known for iPhone assembly, also manufactures AI servers and supplies components to Nvidia.Commenting on the partnership, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said that the companyIn September, Oracle also inked a $300 billion deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Since then, the company has shed more than $300 billion in market value, and Wall Street is starting to wonder if a partnership between the companies will bring returns or pose risks for Oracle.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledges Google's AI advancements, noting potential temporary economic challenges but expressing confidence in OpenAI's rapid progress.

Market watch: Asian shares rally as US rate-cut bets rise; oil edges up after Ukraine–Russia peace signals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-watch-asian-shares-rally-as-us-rate-cut-bets-rise-oil-edges-up-after-ukrainerussia-peace-signals/articleshow/125579108.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AP)

Asian markets climbed on Wednesday as softer US data strengthened expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month, while crude prices steadied after touching one-month lows.Asia followed Wall Street’s upbeat momentum after a run of weaker-than-expected US figures boosted confidence in a December rate cut.According to news agency AFP, several Fed policymakers have backed a third consecutive reduction, citing labour market concerns even as inflation remains elevated.Fresh data — some delayed by the US government shutdown — reinforced that outlook.Payroll firm ADP reported that private employers shed an average 13,500 jobs per week in the four weeks to 8 November, while retail sales growth slowed and consumer confidence fell to a seven-month low.Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management was quoted by AFP as saying that although the backlog of data was “extremely stale”, markets desperate for macro signals were interpreting it as dovish.He noted that Goldman Sachs economists had trimmed Q3 GDP tracking to 3.7%, supporting the view that growth is cooling ahead of the December meeting.Risk appetite also improved after Bloomberg reported that Kevin Hassett, a close ally of President Donald Trump, is seen as the frontrunner to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell next year.Analysts said his appointment would likely support Trump’s push for lower rates.Asian stocks rose sharply in response. Tokyo and Seoul gained around 2%, while Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Taipei and Wellington also traded higher, as per AFP.The advance followed a pullback earlier this month over concerns about high valuations in the tech sector. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba slipped more than 1% after reporting a profit decline due to increased consumer subsidies and AI-related investments.MSCI’s Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index rose 1%, while Japan’s Nikkei added 1.8%.Analysts at Westpac said sentiment improved as traders priced in an 80.7% probability of a 25-basis-point cut at the Fed’s 10 December meeting, compared to even odds a week earlier.Meanwhile, oil prices saw a mild rebound after falling sharply on Tuesday. As per Reuters, Brent rose 0.3% to $62.67, and WTI gained 0.24% to $58.09, following indications that Ukraine is close to agreeing to a US-backed peace plan with Russia.IG’s Tony Sycamore was quoted by Reuters as saying that a completed deal could “rapidly dismantle Western sanctions on Russian energy exports”, potentially pushing WTI towards $55 unless talks break down.US President Trump has instructed his representatives to meet both Russian and Ukrainian officials, while Zelenskiy may visit the US soon to finalise a deal.Recent sanctions remain tight, though Russian oil shipments to India are expected to hit a three-year low in December, Reuters reported.Hopes of a Fed rate cut have also lent support to crude, as lower borrowing costs typically boost economic activity and demand for oil.Gold traded 0.2% higher at $4,131.78, while Bitcoin rose 0.5% to $87,438.53.",Asian markets climb on Wednesday as softer US data strengthened expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Private Beach Access: Unlike many of Dubai’s developments, Naïa Island offers a limited collection of branded residences and estate plots, and every single one is designed with private beach access, ensuring maximum seclusion and direct contact with the Arabian Gulf.

Low-Rise Design: The masterplan deliberately employs low-rise architecture. This unique feature guarantees unobstructed sea views and views of iconic Dubai landmarks, differentiating it from the city's vertical landscape and emphasizing space and tranquility.

Maritime Luxury: A crucial amenity is the dedicated private marina with yacht berthing facilities, catering directly to the maritime pursuits of global elites.

Who is Lakshmi Mittal?

The Cost to Naïa Island

Looking ahead





Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal has stepped back from full-time UK residency and will spend far more time in Dubai and Switzerland as Britain tightens tax rules for the super-rich. The move follows Labour’s package of wealth and inheritance tax changes that have prompted several high-net-worth individuals to rethink their tax residency.The exodus of Lakshmi Mittal from the UK, where his family owned the legendary ""Taj Mittal"" mansion, is fundamentally driven by economics. The billionaire is moving away from the UK’s impending tax reforms, which include a proposed 20% exit tax, a potential mansion tax, the abolition of the non-domicile tax regime, and high 40% inheritance taxes.Dubai’s financial landscape is the polar opposite. By making Dubai his main residence, Mittal benefits from a system built on certainty and growth, most crucially offering zero inheritance tax. This stability allows him and his peers to manage and protect their immense global wealth, making it the preferred destination for a growing list of individuals seeking to secure their assets from high tax levies and policy unpredictability in their home countries. This financial security, in turn, allows for investment in Dubai’s most exclusive residential projects.Reports say Mittal has cemented his commitment to the UAE by acquiring property on Naïa Island, an ambitious new luxury enclave developed by Shamal Holding, in addition to an existing residence.This island is engineered specifically to attract the UHNW segment, offering unmatched privacy and prestige off the Jumeirah coastline.The specialty of Naïa Island lies in its unique, low-density features:Naïa Island is positioned as a legacy investment, a timeless retreat where exclusivity, natural beauty, and sophistication converge, with the project expected to reach completion around 2029.Lakshmi Niwas Mittal is one of the world's foremost figures in the steel industry, known for his relentless consolidation of the fragmented global market. Born in Rajasthan, India, his career trajectory led him to become the founder and Executive Chairman of ArcelorMittal, the world’s leading steel and mining company outside of China. Mittal built his empire through a series of bold and often aggressive acquisitions throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including a landmark merger in 2006 that created the current global giant.His company is critical to the construction, infrastructure, and renewable energy sectors globally, reflecting his influence on modern industrialization. Previously one of Britain's wealthiest residents, his move from the UK to Dubai signifies a major shift in the global financial landscape for this steel magnate.Lakshmi Mittal's future residence on Naïa Island will be a custom-built, ultra-low-density estate leveraging the island’s exclusive design. His property, likely on one of the large 21,000 to over 48,000 square foot estate plots, will feature mandatory private beachfront access and seamless access to the private residents' marina for yachting, while benefiting from integrated, hotel-standard services provided by the nearby Cheval Blanc Maison (LVMH).For those aspiring to buy a piece of this luxury, the cost is immense: while small 4-bedroom villas are estimated to start around AED 45 million (INR 109.3 crores), a custom estate plot requires substantially higher capital. The purchase process is strictly managed as an off-plan development (completion expected around 2029), necessitating an Expression of Interest (EOI), adherence to a structured payment plan, and the payment of a 4% DLD fee, though the investment qualifies the owner for the coveted 10-year Golden Visa.For Dubai, the arrival (or increased presence) of well-known billionaires notably brings headline value, increasingly potential local spending and faster growth in the ultra-luxury property and services sectors. For the UK, these departures are however politically sensitive, and they highlight how tax policy discreetly influences where mobile wealth ultimately chooses to liveThe broader pattern is already visible: bankers, industrialists and investors are weighing residency options as fiscal rules change. Policymakers on both sides will watch whether the trend is temporary or a sustained reshaping of where global capital and wealthy families choose to base themselves.","Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal has stepped back from full-time UK residency and will spend far more time in Dubai and Switzerland as Britain tightens tax rules for the super-rich. The move follows Labour’s package of wealth and inheritance tax changes that have prompted several high-net-worth individuals to rethink their tax residency. Mittal's future residence on Naïa Island will be a custom- built, ultra-low-density estate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125534852,imgsize-1107002,width-400,resizemode-4/laxmi-mittal.jpg"
"Trump Gold Card: $15,000 application fee to buy US residency for $1 million, draft petition ready ahead of December 18 deadline",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-gold-card-15000-application-fee-to-buy-us-residency-for-1-million-draft-petition-ready-ahead-of-december-18-deadline/articleshow/125549023.cms,"New details on Trump Gold Card visa program have been released.



New details on Gold Card visa program

The application is to be filed with the Department of Commerce

The $15,000 fee per application is non-refundable

The petition is to be filed with USCIS, following which USCIS would assess the applicant's eligibility for the new visa category.

The vetting process also includes a check on whether the fund originated from a lawful source.

Once the petition is approved and when an immigrant visa number is available, then the applicant has to complete the consular processing at the embassy.

The applicant would then get an immigrant visa to travel to the US and be admitted as a lawful permanent resident.

What is the $5 million visa program?





In a major update of Donald Trump's Gold Card visa program, which is to be implemented by December 18, the Department of Homeland Security and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services prepared the draft of the petition that an applicant has to submit. Form I-140G, also known as Immigration Petition for the Gold Card Program, have been submitted for clearance with the Office of Management and Budget. Bloomberg reported that the department has already got an emergency approval from White House.An individual would be eligible for permanent residence under this visa program after a donation of $1 million and for corporate petitioners, the amount is $2 million. The application fee would be $15,000 per applicant. After creating a ripple when the president launched the program and the administration officials claimed that they would be selling 1,000 Gold Cards a day, the program took a backseat amid the administration's hard approach to immigrants. But now things have started rolling ahead of the December 18 deadline, announced by Trump earlier.The donation would make the foreign nationals eligible for permanent residence under the EB-1 preference category for individuals of extraordinary ability or the EB-2 National Interest Waiver category.The $5 million visa program is Trump's Platinum Card though initially Gold Card was said to be priced at $5 million. The price which is being called a donation to the US government was revised and now the $5 million card is Trump's Platinum Card. This will give applicants the ability to spend up to 270 days in the US without being subject to US taxes on non-US income. No further details of this program have been released yeat and there is an option to join the waitlist for this card.","The $15,000 fee per application is non-refundable.
