Foreign students in India at record high after Covid tumble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/foreign-students-in-india-at-record-high-after-covid-tumble/articleshow/115951966.cms,"NEW DELHI: A flagship initiative towards internationalisation of Indian education , Study in India (SII) Portal, received a record 72,218 students from 200 countries for the academic year 2024-25. After a significant jump in numbers which started in 2014-15, followed by a significant decline due to Covid, the renewed multi-pronged effort of govt seems to have made its impact this year.In 2011-12, the number of foreign students in India was 16,410, which rose to 34,774 in 2014-15. In 2016-17, it recorded 47,575 and in 2019-20, the pre-Covid numbers were over 49,000. However, according to govt sources, during Covid-19 and after the pandemic, the numbers declined to around the 2014-15 mark.Launched in 2018 by ministry of education as a flagship project, the Study in India programme sought to project India as a prime education hub for international students. However, these initiatives appeared to have had limited success and the scheme appeared to be falling short of its goals. ""Covid had its major impact on education worldwide. Impact on India was no different,"" said a senior official with the MoE. Thereafter, the Centre in Aug 2023 launched Study in India (SII) Portal, a centralised platform for foreign students to apply for admissions and visas.""India is actively reclaiming its historic role as a global education hub, reminiscent of ancient institutions like Takshashila and Nalanda. With National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 at its core, govt is driving the internationalisation of education by aligning curricula with global standards, fostering research collaborations, and facilitating academic exchanges to position the country as a global knowledge leader,"" said Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan to TOI.Thereafter, the Centre in August 2023 launched the Study in India (SII) Portal, a centralized platform for foreign students to apply for admissions and visas.“India is actively reclaiming its historic role as a global education hub, reminiscent of ancient institutions like Takshashila and Nalanda. With the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 at its core, the government is driving the internationalization of education by aligning curricula with global standards, fostering research collaborations, and facilitating academic exchanges to position the country as a global knowledge leader,” said union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan to the TOI.According to the official, the portal has attracted over 72,218 students from 200 countries for the academic year 2024–25. Featuring more than 8,000 courses across 638 institutions, including 310 public universities, “it represents a significant step toward making India a preferred global education destination. Students registered on the portal are also facilitated with an e-Student Visa, streamlining their transition to Indian HEIs.”Apart from the portal, a multi-pronged approach was taken to build an ecosystem. To bolster India’s appeal, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has enacted regulations to allow foreign universities to establish campuses in India which resulted in three foreign universities -- Deakin University and University of Wollongong from Australia and University of Southampton from England starting their India operations.Simultaneously, Indian HEIs are making their presence abroad. In November 2023, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras inaugurated a campus in Zanzibar, Tanzania, and IIT-Delhi opened a campus in Abu Dhabi in September 2024. These developments align with UGC regulations permitting Institutions of Eminence (IoEs) to establish offshore campuses.Pradhan led India’s educational diplomacy which resulted in key partnerships including the Australia-India Education and Skills Council, India-US Working Group on Education, and numerous bilateral agreements with nations like Germany, Singapore, and the UAE. Latest of which include Pradhan recently holding discussions with officials from India Johns Hopkins University, Maryland, USA, on establishing its campus in India.As part of the other academic collaboration between Indian and foreign HEIs, UGC’s 2022 guidelines have also enabled joint, dual, and twinning degree programmes, with 49 Indian universities now partnered with international institutions. Additionally, the Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC) has approved 787 research proposals across 28 countries, focusing on 12 strategic themes such as artificial intelligence, disaster management, and sustainable cities.","In 2011-12, the number of foreign students in India was 16,410, which rose to 34,774 in 2014-15.

He also confirmed that ""the offer will available from 2026-27 academic year once NCERT textbooks are out"".The system aims to provide flexibility and reduce academic pressure.

New textbooks for Classes IV, V, VII and VII are under development for implementation in 2025-26 academic session.Students will likely receive a designated period to choose between advanced and standard levels, with flexibility to switch within this timeframe.Singh added, ""The exact shape of the framework is yet to be worked out.

NEW DELHI: Delhi's air quality remained in the 'poor' category on Tuesday morning, with a thin layer of smog enveloping several parts of the city as reported by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 274 as of 8am.As per the data collected by CPCB at 8am, the Air Quality Index (AQI) reported in Anand Vihar was at 294, 235 at ITO, 256 at IGI Airport (T3), 250 at Chandani Chowk and Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, 277 at Okhla Phase-2, and 298 at both Punjabi Bagh and Wazirpur, all falling under the 'poor' category.The AQI scale categorises readings as follows: 0-50 as good, 51-100 as satisfactory, 101-200 as moderate, 201-300 as poor, 301-400 as very poor, and 401-500 as severe.On Monday, the Supreme Court declined to ease GRAP-IV measures aimed at reducing Delhi's air pollution, scheduling the next hearing on this matter for a later date.Justices Abhay S Oka and AG Masih highlighted that NCR states—Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh—failed to compensate construction workers as directed. They mandated virtual attendance of these states' Chief Secretaries at the next hearing, noting that action typically begins only when top officials are summoned.The court stated it would consider relaxations only after seeing consistent improvement in air quality, scheduling the next hearing for Thursday to discuss potential GRAP IV modifications.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati presented AQI data and suggested GRAP IV relaxations, but the court remained unconvinced due to unstable AQI readings.The court instructed CAQM to communicate mitigation measures to relevant authorities and coordinate implementation efforts. It noted concerning findings from court commissioners' reports, highlighting poor coordination between MCD, Delhi police, DPCC and other authorities, emphasising CAQM's responsibility in coordinating these entities.The court also ordered Delhi police to ensure protection for court commissioners who are members of the bar.","The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 274 as of 8am.

Changed Mahayuti dynamics? Ajit Pawar's NCP seeks parity with Shinde's Shiv Sena,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/changed-mahayuti-dynamics-ajit-pawars-ncp-seeks-parity-with-shindes-shiv-sena-citing-partys-strike-rate/articleshow/115939740.cms,"Ajit Pawar (left) and Eknath Shinde

NEW DELHI: Has the dynamics within Maharashtra's ruling Mahayuti changed? Ajit Pawar 's NCP , which had come under intense attack from several quarters, including the RSS, after Mahayuti's dismal performance in Lok Sabha elections, seems to have moved closer to the BJP after the assembly elections.With the Shiv Sena playing hardball over the CM's post attributing the spectacular 'Maha' results to Eknath Shinde 's performance as chief minister, Ajit Pawar threw his weight behind Devendra Fadnavis and helped the BJP counter Sena's pressure games.The NCP has openly sought parity with Shiv Sena arguing that their strike rate in assembly elections is better than Shinde Sena and hence they deserve the same number of seats in the new government.""If we look at the strike rate in our alliance, the BJP is number one, followed by Ajit Dada's group in second place and the Shinde group in third place. So, our strike rate is also good and we demand that we get as much representation as they do,"" senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal said as the three allies sit together to decide power sharing in Mahayuti 2.0.Bhujbal's claim is contrary to the facts as Shiv Sena's strike rate of 70.4% (57/81) is slightly better than NCP which owns 41 of the 59 seats it contested at a strike rate of 69.5%. The BJP, meanwhile, was way ahead of its allies with a strike rate of 88.5% - winning 132 of the 149 seats it contested.The BJP and the Shiv Sena had come together in 2022 - after Eknath Shinde led a successful revolt against Uddhav Thackeray leading to the fall of the opposition's MVA government. The BJP then gave the CM's post to Shinde and made Fadnavis work as his deputy in a move that surprised everyone.Ajit Pawar joined the NDA government almost a year later after leading a successful revolt against his uncle Sharad Pawar and became the second deputy chief minister of the Mahayuti government. Both Shinde and Pawar eventually got complete control of their parties, including the official names and symbols.However, after the Lok Sabha elections, Ajit Pawar, who could win only one seat, stared at a tense future in Mahayuti while Eknath Shinde consolidated his position as a Hindutva ally of the BJP. The RSS openly attacked the BJP for including NCP in the alliance.The assembly elections marked the reversal of fortunes for Ajit Pawar as he decimated rival Sharad Pawar's faction of NCP and won an impressive 41 seats. When the Shiv Sena, with 57 seats, demanded the chief minister's post again for Eknath Shinde, Ajit Pawar played the spoilsport as he openly backed BJP's Devendra Fadnavis who led the saffron party to a record performance of 132 seats.In the last 10 days, while Eknath Shinde sulked and his Shiv Sena bargained hard, Ajit Pawar, who is sure of deputy CM post again, played his cards well and backed the BJP. One of the Sena leaders admitted that Ajit Pawar's NCP had reduced his party's bargaining power vis-à-vis the BJP.The BJP has given Shinde Sena a long rope despite being only 13 seats short of majority in the 288-member assembly. When it comes to a numbers game, the BJP perhaps could do without either of the two allies.However, the BJP, which made a bold statement in 2022 by making junior partner Shinde the chief minister, may not want to do away with the accrued gains by riding roughshod over its Hindutva ally in the state. By unilaterally announcing December 5 as the oath-ceremony date, the BJP has already given a strong signal that it will be calling the shots in Mahayuti 2.0.","Ajit Pawar's NCP had come under intense attack from several quarters, including the RSS.

LUCKNOW: On Tuesday morning, the cargo bay authorities of Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport intercepted and halted the shipment of a fetus destined for Mumbai via flight.The fetus was dispatched by a city-based IVF centre for a Mumbai-based laboratory. However, the IVF centre had not disclosed the presence of the fetus in the consignment package to the courier company who had sent the package to cargo bay for expedited delivery.Upon scanning at the airport cargo bay, the fetus was detected, prompting immediate notification to the courier company representatives.Speaking to TOI, the courier company staff, requesting anonymity, said, ""The fetus consignment has been returned to the IVF centre, as they never informed us about it.""According to specialists, a deceased specimen must be properly embalmed before air transport, otherwise it risks substantial deterioration during transit, predominantly due to swift decomposition triggered by fluctuations in pressure and temperature during flight, potentially resulting in fluid seepage and subsequent damage to the container or coffin.","The fetus was dispatched by a city-based IVF centre for a Mumbai-based laboratory.

However, according to junior external affairs minister Kirti Vardhan Singh, the fast-tracking process involved meeting specific requirements like paying one year's tuition fee in advance, providing a mandatory Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) worth $20,635 as proof of funds, and meeting language proficiency levels.On Nov 8, 2024, Canada ended the SDS programme. ""The Canadian govt conveyed that its objective in doing away with the SDS programme is in line with its efforts to strengthen the programme's integrity, address student vulnerability, and give all students equal and fair access to the application process, as well as a positive academic experience. Following the cancellation of the SDS scheme, all international students would now have to apply for 'regular study permits' for studying in Canada,"" said Singh, in response to a written question in Lok Sabha on the likely impact of Canada's move on Indian students.""Under the regular route, students are no longer required to pay full one-year tuition fee upfront, but only for six months and demonstrate that they have sufficient funds to cover their living expenses. This makes the admission process more affordable for students, particularly those who were previously unable to meet the more costly SDS requirements,"" he added.According to the ministry of external affairs, there are approximately 4,27,000 Indian students in Canadian colleges and universities.

'No justification for such actions': Jama Masjid Shahi Imam condemns injustices against Hindus in Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justification-for-such-actions-jama-masjid-shahi-imam-condemns-injustices-against-hindus-in-bangladesh/articleshow/115941926.cms,"Syed Ahmed Bukhari (Picture credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. He urged Muhammad Yunus , the head of Bangladesh 's interim government, to take immediate action against these injustices.In a letter, Bukhari stressed the close ties between India and Bangladesh. “Since the establishment of Bangladesh, our national leadership, media, civil society, and influential circles have maintained close relations with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajid, and their party, the Awami League. In diplomacy, regional matters, international affairs, and issues concerning the Muslim world, Bangladesh has always stood by us as a close ally,” he said, according to an ANI report.Bukhari expressed concern over the unrest following Sheikh Hasina's departure to India, which has affected both Muslim and non-Muslim supporters of the Awami League. He specifically condemned the violence targeting the Hindu minority.“Until now, this remained an internal matter of Bangladesh. However, the ongoing injustices, assaults, and unilateral actions against the Hindu minority are condemnable and must stop immediately. There is no justification for such actions. The government must always acknowledge the role we have played in their establishment and development process, as well as our unparalleled history of supporting and caring for millions of refugees. We were the first to stand by them during every natural disaster,” he wrote.Bukhari also referred to the UN's declaration on minority rights, calling on Yunus to intervene. “As a credible neighbour, a close ally of Bangladesh, and a custodian of shared cultural heritage, I expect the current head of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate, to take immediate steps to address the injustices against the Hindu minority. He should ensure that his international reputation remains untarnished. As a Muslim-majority country, Islam and Islamic jurisprudence inherently leave no room for any form of prejudice or injustice against minorities in Bangladesh,” Bukhari added.Over the weekend, more than 60 monks were reportedly stopped from entering India at the Benapole land port in Bangladesh, according to an ANI report citing an ISKCON Kolkata spokesperson. Additionally, a Bangladesh court has set January 2, 2025, as the hearing date for Hindu spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das , who was arrested on sedition charges. Das is currently in custody in Bangladesh.","Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh.

More recently, the Dollar Index touched 108.07 on November 22, 2024, its highest in more than a year, exerting pressure on emerging market currencies,"" he said.Additionally, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the uncertainty surrounding the results of the US elections further contributed to the challenges.Despite this, the MoS emphasized, ""INR remains one of the best-performing Asian currencies.""As of November 19, 2024, major Asian currencies such as the Japanese Yen and South Korean Won had fallen by 8.8 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively. Notably, all G10 currencies, with the exception of the British Pound (GBP), had depreciated by more than 4 percent during CY 2024.""The relative stability of the INR bears testimony to India's sound and resilient economic fundamentals, macroeconomic and financial stability,"" he said.A depreciating currency is likely to increase prices of imported goods by is expected to boost export competitiveness, resulting in a positive outlook for the economy.The total impact on domestic prices, and consequently on citizens because of exchange rate depreciation, depends on the extent to which international commodity prices are passed through to the domestic market.He stated that the RBI closely monitors global developments that could impact the USD-INR exchange rate . These developments include monetary policy actions by major central banks, key economic data releases globally and their impacts, decisions made at OPEC+ meetings, the tracking and analysis of geopolitical events, as well as daily movements in G10 and emerging market currencies.The apex bank also regulates the foreign exchange market with ensuring its orderly functioning and development, intervening only to curb undue volatility in the INR.The Mos stated that in the FY22 Budget, the centre set a target to reduce the fiscal deficit to below 4.5 percent of GDP by FY26 to maintain sufficient flexibility in managing public finances prudently while ensuring adequate resources for social welfare and development projects.He added that the Ministry of Finance continuously assesses the impact of the fiscal deficit.Chaudhary explained that FDI inflows are influenced by various factors, including the availability of natural resources, macroeconomic stability, foreign investors' decisions, the global investment climate, central bank interest rates, and tax regulations, among others.Since last 5 financial years, he noted, the FDI has fallen from $43 billion in 2019-20 to $ 10.1 billion in 2023-24.","Rupee has maintained its position as one of the best performing Asian currencies.

Kharge cites widening inequalities

Party spokesperson flags economic concerns

Inflation and savings under pressure

'Real challenges ignored'

NEW DELHI: The Congress intensified its criticism of the government on Tuesday, blaming Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "" voodoo economic policies "" for India's GDP growth hitting a near two-year low of 5.4% in the July-September quarter. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accused the government of creating a ""vicious cycle"" of low growth, high unemployment, shrinking incomes, and rising prices.In a post on X, Kharge said, ""The growth rate is declining. There are no jobs for the youth. Inflation has drained the pockets of the common people. The gap of economic inequality is widening."" He also highlighted the rupee's depreciation to 85 against the dollar, calling it the ""second weakest currency in Asia,"" and accused the government of favoring billionaires over small businesses.Kharge shared an old audio clip of PM Modi criticizing GDP trends during Congress' tenure, remarking, ""You will not listen to the voice of the people; listen to your own voice!""At a press conference, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate described the GDP figure as a warning of economic distress. She emphasized that GDP reflects jobs, investments, consumption, and trade, all of which have suffered.""Private consumption growth has slumped to 5.9%, exposing weak demand in both urban and rural India. Manufacturing growth is at a mere 2.2%, undermining the 'Make in India' narrative,"" Shrinate said, adding that government expenditure fell from Rs 4.15 lakh crore in Q1 to Rs 4.01 lakh crore in Q2.Shrinate pointed out that inflation remains stubbornly high, with vegetable prices soaring by 42%—the steepest rise in five years. ""Amid high unemployment, stagnant wages, and back-breaking prices, families are forced to dip into their savings, which have nearly halved over the past five years,"" she said.""Thanks to Narendra Modi and his voodoo economic policies, India is in the middle of a vicious economic cycle -- low growth, no jobs, low income, high prices, drop in savings and rise in loans,"" she said.The rupee's depreciation, coupled with declining foreign reserves, signals deeper issues, Shrinate argued. ""From inheriting the rupee at Rs 58 to the dollar, it is now dangerously close to Rs 85,"" she noted.Accusing the government of being in denial, Shrinate questioned its focus on propaganda over policy. ""When will the Modi government address rising economic inequality, low growth, low wages, and high prices?"" she asked.While India remains the fastest-growing major economy globally, with China’s growth at 4.6% in the same quarter, the Congress asserted that the real per capita impact and worsening inequality demand urgent attention.","India's GDP growth hit a near two-year low of 5.4% in the July-September quarter.

NEW DELHI:A soldier, who was part of ' Operation Rakshak ' and deployed near LOC in J&K lost his life in extreme climactic conditions, while discharging his duty in the wee hours of a chilly Jan morning in 2013 but his widow was denied Liberalised Family Pension (LFP) despite getting order in her favour from armed forces tribunal in 2019 as Centre moved SC and the litigation went on for five more years.Rejecting the plea of Centre and defence ministry and ordering them to grant her LFP, SC Tuesday took strong exception of govt for not taking a sympathetic view and dragging the widow in court for protracted legal proceedings to deny her rightful and imposed a cost of Rs 50,000 to be given to her.LPF is given in case of death of an armed forces personnel under certain circumstances and eligible family is entitled to pension equal to reckonable emoluments last drawn. Govt denied LFP on grounds that it was a case of 'physical casualty' and not ' battle casualty ' where LPF is granted to the family. The commanding officer in this case had categorised the death as a 'battle casualty', and later it was changed to a 'physical casualty' which was challenged by the family.After examining records and rules, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih said govt had wrongly denied the widow the pension as the death happened as a result of war-like situations and it comes within the ambit of 'battle casualties'.""Thus, the death can be attributed to illness caused by extreme climatic conditions. Hence, as per clause 1(g) of Appendix A of the Army Order 1 of 2003, the case will fall in 'battle casualties'. The reason is that the deceased was operating near LOC in extreme climatic conditions. He was part of 'Operation Rakshak'. The casualty caused by illness due to climatic conditions is covered by clause 1(g). In this case, the respondent's husband was a victim of illness caused by extreme climatic conditions,"" the bench said.","A soldier, who was part of'Operation Rakshak'and deployed near LOC in J&K lost his life in extreme climactic conditions, while discharging his duty in 2013.

Adjusted for inflation, the value of Rs 1,000 now is just over Rs 540 per month 15 years back. The actual money they get depends on how much the state govt is willing to enhance this. While Kerala pays Rs 12,000, in many like Delhi, Goa and several northeastern states it remains just Rs 1,000.National Floor Minimum Wage, below which no state can fix its minimum wage, is Rs 5,340 per month, about Rs 178 per day. However, since cook-cum-helpers (CCH) are not recognised as workers, govt is not bound to pay minimum wages. The honorarium of Rs 1000 works out to be just Rs 33 per day. "" CCHs are honorary workers who have come forward for rendering social services,"" govt has repeatedly maintained in answers to questions in Parliament.The honorarium expenditure of Rs 1,000 is shared between the Centre and states and UTs as per an approved sharing pattern of 90:10 in Northeastern states, Himalayan states (Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh) and Jammu & Kashmir, 100% in UTs without legislature and 60:40 for other states as well as Delhi and Puducherry. In effect, for most states the Centre pays just Rs 600 towards the honorarium of each CCH.""With the price of everything rising, how can you possibly survive on Rs 1,600 per month?

The entry level pay for govt employees went up from 2,550 to Rs 7,000 by the sixth pay commission in 2008 and then to Rs 18,000 by the seventh pay commission in 2015.Though govt treats CCH's work as part time, they actually work almost eight hours or more. ""Headmasters or teachers ask us to make tea for them, wash utensils, do sweeping and mopping along with cooking for 150-200 students and so we end up being in the school all day.

Ladakh disengagement has set stage for ties to improve: Jaishankar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ladakh-disengagement-has-set-stage-for-ties-to-improve-jai-shankar/articleshow/115948201.cms,"S Jaishankar (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Disengagement with China in eastern Ladakh, including at the remaining and contentious friction points of Depsang and Demchok, has been fully achieved through a step-by-step process, setting Sino-Indian ties in the direction of ""some improvement"", said foreign minister S Jaishankar in Lok Sabha on Tuesday as he briefed MPs about the Oct 21 agreement with China that has sparked hope of a rapprochement in bilateral relations.The minister, who has stressed in the past that aggressive deployment and not land grab was the problem in the stand-off, said India will now prioritise de-escalation - to address the amassing of troops along the LAC - and effective management of activities in the border areas. He also said that the disengagement allows India to consider other aspects of engagement in a calibrated manner, keeping ""our nationalWhile complimenting the defence and diplomatic wings for working in lock-step to ensure that India's national interests were preserved, Jaishankar also acknowledged the role played by improved border infrastructure that ensured effective counter-deployment.On the wider border issue, Jaishankar said India remains committed to engaging with China to reach a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable framework for a boundary settlement.On India's expectations from ties with China, the minister said that govt is clear that maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas is a prerequisite for development of ties. ""In all of this, we were and we remain very clear that the three key principles must be observed in all circumstances: both sides should strictly respect and observe the LAC, neither side should attempt to unilaterally alter the status quo, and agreements and understandings reached in the past must be fully abided by in their entirety,"" he said.On the Oct 21 understanding, the minister said India's objective was to ensure patrolling, as in the past, to the relevant points, as well as resumption of access to grazing grounds by Indian civilians as per the long-standing practice. ""This is indeed what we have agreed upon in regard to Depsang and Demchok,"" he said.While concerns have been raised about buffer zones that were created to defuse the situation, Jaishankar said in a few other places where friction occurred in 2020, steps of a temporary and limited nature were worked out, based on local conditions, to obviate the possibility of further friction. ""This, I must stress, applies to both sides and can be revisited as the situation demands. In that sense, our stance has been resolute and firm and serves our national interest fully,"" he said.""The combination of a firm and principled stance on the situation in the border areas as well as our clearly articulated approach to the totality of our ties have been the foundation of our engagement with China for the last four years,"" added the minister.According to Jaishankar, the situation in Depsang and Demchok pertained primarily to obstructions of long-standing Indian patrolling activity but in Demchok, there was also the question of access for nomadic Indian population to traditional grazing grounds, as well as to sites of significance to the local people.""As a result of this recent understanding arrived at after intensive negotiations, resumption of patrolling to the traditional areas is under way. It was initially tested by sending out patrols for verification of disengagement on the ground and is being followed up by regular activities as per the agreed understanding,"" said the minister.""The ensuring of our national security in this manner is the result of cumulative and coordinated endeavours of many parts of the govt, obviously centred around our defence and security forces. The competence and professionalism of our services in this period was displayed in our speedy and effective counter-deployment,"" he added.",S Jaishankar briefed MPs about the Oct 21 agreement with China that has sparked hope of a rapprochement in bilateral relations.

"Iran and proxies responsible for IMEEC delay, says Israel minister",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iran-and-proxies-responsible-for-imeec-delay-says-israel-minister/articleshow/115945759.cms,"Amid concerns in India and elsewhere about the future of the India-Middle-East-Europe Economic Corridor , Israel’s visiting minister of economy and senior leader of the ruling Likud party, Nir Barkat , hit out at Iran and its “jihadi proxies” for working to destroy businesses in the West Asia region and said Israel won’t stop in Gaza till it achieves its twin goals – release of hostages and end of Hamas . Barkat spoke to TOI’s Sachin Parashar about the West Asia situation and related issues. Excerpts:

How confident are you that the ceasefire with Lebanon will hold, given that both sides are already accusing each other of violating it?

US and others are working for a ceasefire in Gaza too. Can we hope to see a similar truce in Gaza? Can India play a role in facilitating peace?

What about the delay in work on IMEEC that was seen even by Israel as an initiative that could change the face of the Middle-East?

Are you ready to restart talks with Saudi Arabia for normalization of ties?

Is the US indictment of Adani, whose company is working on the Haifa port, a concern for Israel?

What does the return of Trump mean for West Asia?

PM Netanyahu was expected to visit India last year before October 7 happened. Is the visit still on the cards?

Hezbollah joined the war unfortunately and fired 25,000 rockets at Israel since October 8 last year. This was unacceptable to Israel. It became important to dismantle their terrorist infrastructure. We will react with a lot of force if they violate the ceasefire. I think this is also an opportunity for the Lebanese people to free themselves from Hezbollah, the proxy of Iran. Beirut could become the Paris of the Middle-East. Unfortunately, the Lebanese people have so far not fulfilled that vision.Lebanon is different from Gaza. The goal of the war from the Israeli side in Lebanon was to eliminate the Hezbollah threat and enable the 60,000 evicted Israeli citizens (from northern Israel) to return home. We are in the process of doing that. In Gaza, there are 2 major goals of the war. The first is to make sure Hamas doesn’t survive either militarily or in civil form. The second is to get the hostages back. We need to fulfil the goals of the war. There’s still work to do. If and when it's possible to have a deal to get the hostages back, I’m sure the Israeli government will consider it. India is a great partner for Israel. Let’s do more business. Let’s improve the economy and let’s create more win-win deals. We are very well aligned on political issues and on the economic side we have some work to do. We are very optimistic we can take that relationship between the governments and the people forward.The war may have delayed it but it was the goal of Iran and its jihadi proxies to destroy Israel and disrupt businesses in the region and all of West Asia. Our goal is exactly the opposite. We want to collaborate. Iran tried to derail the peace process and relationship developing with Saudi Arabia. We would like to see Saudi Arabia join the Abraham Accords and expand peace. Our goal is exactly the goal of India. To create more partnerships and have collaboration. People trying to delay it are the jihadi alliance of Iran and its proxies.Most certainly, yes. I think it’s very clear that it’s in the best interests of both countries. We hear it again and again. Our friends in the US are saying so. Even here, our friends are talking about it. We have to finish the war and in parallel develop relationships with modern Arab states. It’s a classic win-win for West Asia.This is not an issue for us. We welcome Adani and other players to invest in Israel.It's going to be meaningful. Trump is aligning his economic power with his geopolitical strategy. I think that distinction is very clear and that’s how the Israeli government also sees it. We have to align our interests against Iran which is the biggest destabilizer in West Asia and expand relations with friends like India. I think it’s very smart and prudent if you can align economic issues, like tariffs and other things that he’s trying to do, with geopolitical challenges. It will be good for countries like India and Israel.My recommendation to him would be that this should be one of the first important trips he should undertake. India is a good friend of Israel. The fact that Modi on October 7 supported Israel is very meaningful for us. It will be a good opportunity to thank Modi and the people of India for their support. We don’t take it for granted.",Nir Barkat is the visiting minister of economy and senior leader of the ruling Likud party.

The move gains importance considering that there have been cases of seizure of contraband items and the need for a uniform security protocol .Sources said the strategic move is aimed at enhancing coordination among the stakeholders, including enforcement agencies, port authorities, and maritime security establishments. “Currently, there is uniform security protocol for 12 major ports under the Central govt and CISF is deployed. But minor ports (under state and private players) are now handling more cargo and these deploy private security personnel for internal access. A uniform system will ensure quicker responses to security issues and incidents,” said an official.The Merchant Shipping Bill, which will be introduced during the current session of Parliament envisages the setting up of the Bureau of Port Security, which will function under the control of a designated authority. “As we expand our facilities and increase maritime trade , ensuring safety of ports and shipping routes is vital.

We oppose the imposition of Hindi:

NEW DELHI: A heated debate over language imposition unfolded in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that she was mocked in Tamil Nadu for attempting to learn Hindi during her school years.Recalling her student days, Sitharaman said she faced ridicule on the streets of Tamil Nadu for pursuing Hindi. ""I was mocked for wanting to learn Hindi in Tamil Nadu. I was told, 'You live in Tamil Nadu and want to learn Hindi, North India's language?' These words still echo in my ears,” she said.""Learning Hindi and Sanskrit are perceived as learning some other foreign language and words that they used is people who have come over to this land. Is Tamil Nadu not part of India. So what's wrong in my learning Hindi,"" the finance minister said.She added that she was called—a Tamil term meaning outsider.Sitharaman said that her ""fundamental right"" to learn the language of her choice was denied. She accused the state of fostering a culture where Hindi and Sanskrit were perceived as foreign languages. ""Is Tamil Nadu not part of India? What is wrong in learning Hindi?"" she asked, adding, ""It's fine to oppose the imposition of Hindi, but why impose restrictions on those wanting to learn it?""Her remarks drew sharp criticism from the DMK, with Thoothukudi MP K Kanimozhi rejecting the allegations. ""It has never been the case that anybody was stopped from learning any language in Tamil Nadu. We oppose the imposition of Hindi, not the learning of it,"" she said.Sitharaman also defended the BJP’s respect for regional languages, citing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to elevate Tamil on global platforms, including the UN.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said she was mocked in Tamil Nadu for attempting to learn Hindi during her school years.

Mamata Banerjee condemns Centre's inaction



BJP's Amit Malviya responds to Mamata's comments



NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday voiced her concerns over prevailing situation Bangladesh and urged the Centre to seek United Nations ' intervention in the neighbouring country.She proposed the deployment of an internationl peacekeeping mission to restore normalcy and called on PM Modi to take decisive action to rescue and rehabilitate persecuted Indians from Bangladesh.Speaking in the West Bengal assembly , Banerjee demanded the external affairs minister to make a statement in Parliament during the ongoing winter session on India’s stance regarding the situation in Bangladesh. ""If the Prime Minister is unavailable to address this issue, the EAM must step up and provide clarity,"" she stated.Bengal CM pointed out that as a state leader, she had limited jurisdiction over bilateral matters, but recent developments, including interactions with International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) representatives and families affected by the situation in Bangladesh, compelled her to raise the issue.""If necessary, the EAM should engage with Bangladeshi authorities and the UN to consider deploying peacekeeping forces,"" the CM said.Banerjee also proposed that West Bengal could offer shelter to persecuted Indians if needed. “We have no problem sharing our resources with those in need. There will be no shortage of food for them,” she added.The CM stressed the importance of maintaining harmony and fostering cordial relations among communities in Bangladesh. Referring to the arrest of 79Indian fishermen detained in Bangladeshi waters, she highlighted the need for their immediate release, recalling India’s swift return of Bangladeshi fishermen in similar circumstances.Banerjee targeted the Union government for its silence over the past ten days despite rising tensions in Bangladesh. She also indirectly questioned the BJP for calling for the closure of goods movement along the India-Bangladesh border. “As per international agreements, such actions are not within our jurisdiction and can only be enforced by the Centre,” she clarified.Meanwhile, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya criticised Banerjee’s comments, particularly her omission of the term “Hindus” while discussing the persecution of Indians in Bangladesh.In a post on X, Malviya wrote: “Mamata Banerjee says, ‘If required, we can rehabilitate Indians attacked in Bangladesh. We have no problem sharing our ‘one roti’ with them.’ She doesn’t use the word Hindus. This explains her opposition to the CAA, which was meant to give dignity to Bengali refugees, most of them Hindus, fleeing religious persecution. India will take care of all Indians around the world.

A ‘Culture Win’ for Conservatives?



Washington agrees to bring back the REDSKINS name! WOKE CENSORSHIP in the NFL is OVER!

The NFL’s balancing act



The Washington Commanders could be on the brink of a historic identity reversal. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and the team’s ownership are meeting with Senate leaders , including John Thune, to discuss a potential return to the controversial “Redskins” name and logo. This bold move has reignited debates over tradition, cultural sensitivity, and the shifting tides of public opinion. Could this decision mark a new chapter in the culture wars?For conservative voices, the possible reinstatement of the Redskins name is being hailed as a symbolic triumph over what some see as the excesses of “woke culture.” Senator Daines described this potential move as ""the most significant cultural victory conservatives have achieved this generation."" To them, reversing the name change represents a broader pushback against what they perceive as unnecessary political correctness.The debate over the team’s name and logo dates back decades, but the decision to retire them was largely influenced by mounting public pressure and calls for social accountability. However, in recent years, some fans, politicians, and cultural commentators have advocated for the restoration of the name, arguing that it honors tradition and the team’s storied legacy rather than promoting insensitivity.Also Read: Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair opens up following his hard hit on Trevor Lawrence The NFL finds itself in a delicate position, balancing a fanbase that is deeply attached to the team’s historic identity and a broader audience advocating for inclusivity and sensitivity. The potential renaming raises critical questions about the league’s future direction. Would this decision alienate certain fans while re-energizing others? Could it set a precedent for revisiting other controversial changes in sports history?While the final decision remains unclear, the discussions alone have reignited a national conversation on tradition, representation, and the intersection of sports and culture. Whether it’s seen as a bold reclamation or a controversial rollback, one thing is certain, the Washington team’s identity continues to be at the center of America’s cultural landscape.As the debate over the Washington team’s name heats up, all eyes are on the NFL and its next move. Will the league embrace a return to tradition or hold firm on its commitment to cultural progress? The outcome could reshape not just the team’s identity but also the broader conversation about sports, society, and the power of nostalgia.

List of unsold player in IPL mega auction

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn. Notable names like David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, and Kane Williamson , who have been cornerstones in the IPL for years, found themselves without bids.Each had a base price of Rs 2 crore, but despite their immense experience and proven track records, none of them attracted offers. Their absence from the auction table raised questions, particularly given their global stature in T20 cricket. It’s a stark reminder of how the dynamics of the auction can sometimes overshadow established stars in favour of fresh talent.In addition to these marquee international names, other seasoned players like Shardul Thakur Ajinkya Rahane , and Glenn Phillips also went unsold. Rahane, a reliable middle-order batsman, and Thakur, an all-rounder with vast IPL experience, both entered the auction with a base price of Rs 1.5 crore, but failed to secure a contract.Similarly, Phillips, known for his explosive batting and wicketkeeping skills, and Thakur, a consistent bowler, were left out despite being integral parts of their national teams. This reflects the fierce competition in the auction, where franchises appear to be banking on younger, more explosive talent rather than experienced hands.Perhaps the most surprising snub was former U-19 captain Prithvi Shaw , who had once been considered one of India’s brightest young talents. With a modest base price of Rs 75 lakh, Shaw was expected to generate significant interest.However, despite his impressive domestic performances, Shaw failed to attract any buyers. This highlights a growing trend in the IPL, where franchises are increasingly looking for players who can deliver immediate impact, while the burden of expectation weighs heavily on players like Shaw, who have not yet lived up to their early promise.The unsold list also includes several uncapped players, such as Yash Dhull, Kartik Tyagi, and Piyush Chawla, who could have added value to any team. With base prices ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, these players were considered potential investments, but their inability to secure deals underscores the auction's unpredictable nature.As franchises continue to focus on emerging talent from India and abroad, the auction results serve as a reminder that the IPL is not just about star power but also about fitting the right players into the right roles, irrespective of their past achievements.","IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn.

Sundar Pichai and 4 other technology CEOs whose companies spend highest on their security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sundar-pichai-and-4-other-technology-ceos-whose-companies-spend-highest-on-their-security/articleshow/115919278.cms,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tops the chart

Meta explains why it spent so much on Zuckerberg’s security

How much Google, Apple spent on their CEO’s security

Big tech companies are investing heavily in the protection of their CEOs, with some paying significantly more than others. This includes everything from personal security teams to advanced surveillance systems, underscoring the risks tied to their high-profile roles. Among the top spenders are Meta , which spent $23.4 million on Mark Zuckerberg's security in 2023, and Google, which allocated $6.8 million for Sundar Pichai . Here's a look at the top five tech CEOs whose companies spend the most on protecting them,Meta spent a total of $23.4 million for CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s personal security in 2023, significantly surpassing the security expenses of other tech giants. Approximately $10 million of this was allocated for high-profile security services to ensure the safety of him and his family. An additional $14 million was provided as an annual allowance to cover other security-related expenses.By comparison, Google spent $6.8 million on safeguarding Sundar Pichai, while Tesla’s outlay for Elon Musk’s security was $2.4 million, according to Fortune. This highlights Meta's heightened focus on Zuckerberg's protection amid his high-profile role and the company's prominent public presence.In an Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Meta said that the company paid these large security payments, “for the company’s benefit because of the importance of Mr. Zuckerberg to Meta,”. Zuckerberg is especially at risk because of his position, the company argued. “We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg’s role puts him in a unique position: he is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” the company stated.In 2023, Google allocated $6.8 million for Sundar Pichai’s personal security, according to an SEC filing. Additionally, Pichai benefited from other perks, including access to a company car and the use of “non-commercial aircraft,” such as a private jet, for his travel needs.While Apple spent $820,309 on security measures for CEO Tim Cook, in addition to the $1.6 million Apple paid for Cook’s private jet usage. Tesla, on the other hand, allocated $2.4 million to a security firm owned by CEO Elon Musk for personal protection services. According to an SEC filing, the company reported an extra $500,000 spent on security-related expenses through February 2024.Chipmaker Nvidia spends relatively modestly on security for its CEO, Jensen Huang. The company allocated approximately $2.2 million for residential security and consultation fees for Huang, as detailed in an SEC filing."," Meta spent $23.4 million on Mark Zuckerberg's security in 2023.

Raiders-Chiefs game outperformed the 2023 Dolphins-Jets game by 41% on Prime Video

The NFL's Black Friday experiment is gaining momentum, as the Raiders-Chiefs game outperformed the 2023 Dolphins-Jets game by 41% on Prime Video, with an average audience of 13.51 million. NFL games draw a huge live audience together, starting at 3:00 p.m. ET, thanks to the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961. This act allows the NFL to sell TV rights in exchange for not televising games after 6:00 p.m. ET on Friday or anytime on Saturdays during September through December, under an antitrust immunity for the sale of TV rights.The NFL's second consecutive Black Friday game on Prime Video experienced a 41% increase in viewership with the Las Vegas Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs as opponents. The Dolphins-Jets game on Prime Video averaged 13.51 million viewers, peaking at 17.43 million at 6 p.m. ET. That's significantly higher than the Thanksgiving games, which drew just over 9 million viewers last year. As predicted by Deadline executives last year, Prime Video has successfully created a new annual pop culture event on the day after Thanksgiving.Amazon will include a live entertainment component on Black Friday to strengthen its retail presence. The reason behind the growth in Black Friday games is probably because the Chiefs have an 11-1 record and their biggest attraction this season, coming off back-to-back Super Bowl wins. The win of the Chiefs over the Raiders is expected to add to the year-over-year growth. For the third consecutive year, Prime Video's NFL viewership has increased; Thursday Night Football outpaces all competitive telecasts on broadcast and cable.The Steelers-Browns on Thursday Night Football attracted a significantly bigger audience of 13.72M viewers, a 24% rise from the game of Thanksgiving Day last year 2022 that attracted 11.03M viewers. That growth was not like that of the previous Thursday game. So far, seven matches have managed to record above 13M viewers, surpassing the five games that had 13M+ viewers in the last season, 2023. Only one TNF game recorded such an audience in its debut season. With multiple weeks to go in the regular season.Also Read: Kansas City Chiefs superstars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce aren't doing well in the polls of Pro Bowl voting According to Amazon, data indicates that Thursday Night Football (TNF) is up 38% compared to the inaugural season of 2022, averaging 13.25M viewers, and ahead of the previous year by 8% not counting the game played on Black Friday, based on Amazon's data. Pro football has emerged as one of the top viewing programs for streamers, since it draws more than 10 million viewers for a single telecast, thus a favorite live entertainment program.","Raiders-Chiefs game outperformed the 2023 Dolphins-Jets game by 41% on Prime Video.
