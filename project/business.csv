Budget 2024: How TCS is set to become less TDS for salaried class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-how-tcs-is-set-to-become-less-tds-for-salaried-class/articleshow/111970089.cms,"Top Picks For You Budget 2024: Out with old, new makes news

Individuals miffed at tax collection at source ( TCS ) proposals have now been offered a small relief - provided they have salary income .At present, a salaried employee may declare income, such as bank interest and rent, to their employer, who factors this and, accordingly, deducts a higher tax against the monthly salary. The employee then does not have to worry about paying advance tax as adequate tax has already been withheld.A similar norm comes into effect from Oct 1.The salaried employee will be able to declare TCS and the employer will factor this in, resulting in a lower TDS against salary income. Thus, it will avoid cash-flow issues. Further, if a refund was due, owing to TCS, the individual taxpayer will no longer have to wait for it as it is adjusted against TDS on salary income.TCS applies to a wide range of remittances made under Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of Reserve Bank of India. It permits an individual to remit up to $2.5 lakh per year, without seeking prior approval.Thus far, purchase of an overseas tour package pinched the pocket - it meant a 5% TCS for a remittance of up to Rs 7 lakh; if the expenditure was higher, TCS was 20%. Or for that matter, sending a child overseas meant that TCS at 5% was deducted for any remittance above Rs 7 lakh (the rate was lower for remittances via education loans).In short, the Budget has added a sweetener to TCS provisions for salaried individuals.","The salaried employee will be able to declare TCS and the employer will factor this in, resulting in a lower TDS against salary income.

PM Modi to launch construction of 'world's highest tunnel' today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-launch-construction-of-worlds-highest-tunnel-today/articleshow/112024982.cms,"NEW DELHI: The “first blast” to launch the construction of the strategically-crucial Shinkun La tunnel for alternate all-weather connectivity and swifter troop mobility to Ladakh will be conducted “virtually” by PM Narendra Modi on Friday.The project to construct the 4.1 km long twin-tube tunnel at an altitude of 15,800-feet, under the forbidding Shinkun Pass (La means pass) on the Nimmu-Padam-Darcha road by the Border Roads Organization ( BRO ) at a cost of Rs 1,681 crore, was approved by the PM-led cabinet committee on security in February last year.Construction of tunnels along the northern borders with China remains a top priority despite harsh weather and terrain conditions, amid the continuing military confrontation in eastern Ladakh, which is into its fifth year now.The Sela tunnel, built at an altitude of over 13,000-feet on the Balipara-Chariduar-Tawang road in Arunachal Pradesh for Rs 825 crore, for instance, was inaugurated in March. Tunnels, of course, can also be used for underground storage of ammunition, missiles, fuel and other supplies. “Several more tunnels are under-construction or in the planning stage,” an officer said.The Shinkun La tunnel, which will have cross-passages every 500 metres, will take at least two years to be completed. “It will then be the highest such tunnel in the world, bypassing the Mi La tunnel in China at 15,590-feet. It will not only ensure swift and efficient movement of troops and heavy weapon systems but also foster economic and social development in Ladakh,” he added.Modi, accompanied by defence minister Rajnath Singh and the military brass, will conduct the ground-breaking ceremony for the tunnel virtually during his visit to the Kargil war memorial at Drass on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the conflict with Pakistan. During the Kargil conflict, 527 Indian soldiers laid down their lives and 1,363 were injured while evicting well-entrenched Pakistani intruders from the heights against all odds.The construction of the Shinkun La tunnel comes after the BRO in March established “connectivity” on the 298-km Nimmu-Padam-Darcha road in Ladakh, which will be the third axis to the strategically important region.“The Nimmu-Padam-Darcha road derives its strategic importance from the fact that it’s not only shorter vis-a-vis the other two routes (Manali-Atal tunnel-Sarchu-Leh and Srinagar-Zojila-Kargil-Leh), but also crosses only one pass, the Shinkun La at 16,700-feet,” another officer said.“The Shinkun Pass remains snow-bound for around five months every year thus cutting off this route. The tunnel under it will ensure all-weather connectivity,” he added.India has to some extent reduced the huge “infrastructure differential” with China along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control, stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, in terms of roads, tunnels, bridges, troop habitats, permanent defences, helipads and airfields over the last four years.But a lot still remains to be done, with China setting a frenetic pace in building border infrastructure and dual-use `Xiaokang’ villages, strengthening military positions and deploying additional aircraft at its air-bases facing India, as reported by TOI earlier.","The project to construct the 4.1 km long twin-tube tunnel at an altitude of 15,800-feet was approved by the PM-led cabinet committee on security in February last year.

NEET-UG scam: Number of toppers set to drop from 61 to 17 in revised list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-ug-scam-toppers-number-set-to-drop-from-61-to-17-in-revised-list/articleshow/112024237.cms,"NEW DELHI: The number of toppers in the NEET-UG exam is set to come down to 17 from 61 when National Testing Agency ( NTA ) announces the revised merit list , most likely on Friday.Revision of the merit list was necessitated after IIT-Delhi , working at Supreme Court's instance, recommended that only one of the options in a question in the physics paper was correct.Several students had complained that two of the four options could be held to be correct going by different NCERT books. With only one answer being deemed correct, those who had chosen the other option lost five marks (four marks for wrong answer and one negative mark), in what was sure to have a cascading effect on the ranks of all those who took the exam.This decision will primarily impact the scores of 4.2 lakh candidates, including 44 who achieved perfect scores of 720, because they had opted for the answer deemed incorrect by IIT-Delhi and for which they had been awarded four marks earlier by NTA. “The number of toppers, which stands at 61, will come down to 17, post the deduction of marks,” an NTA official said.The change in ranking could prove to be crucial for many students considering that over 24 lakh aspirants took the NEET-UG for the 1.08 medical seats up for grabs in the country. Of these, 56,000 seats are in govt institutions, which are much sought after for their better infrastructure and lower fees.According to sources, the biggest impact will be on candidates ranked between 50,000 to 1 lakh as over 16,000 candidates, who were earlier likely to earn a seat in a medical college, are likely to go out of the cohort.Sources said the impact on the 44 students, who will no longer be toppers, will not be much as they would still feature in the rank cohort of 33,000 to 50,000 but change in their ranks will impact their chance of securing seats in govt medical colleges of their choice.",The number of toppers in the NEET-UG exam is set to come down to 17 from 61 when National Testing Agency ( NTA ) announces the revised merit list.Revision of the merit list was necessitated after IIT-Delhi recommended that only one of the options in a question was correct.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112024337,imgsize-98584,width-400,resizemode-4/112024337.jpg"
"LAC standoff: S Jaishankar, Wang Yi seek 'strong guidance' to end border impasse",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jaishankar-wang-seek-strong-guidance-to-end-border-impasse/articleshow/112024562.cms,"For the second time in 3 weeks, foreign ministers of India and China, S Jaishankar and Wang Yi respectively, met Thursday agreeing significantly on the need for a “strong guidance” to complete the disengagement process in eastern Ladakh, an issue blocking return of normalcy to bilateral ties.Jaishankar’s remark stating the same in a post on X seemed to improve upon the outcome of their previous meeting in Kazakhstan earlier this month where he called for redoubling efforts to achieve complete disengagement and both leaders agreed prolongation of the border situation was not in the interest of either side.The ministers met on this occasion on the margins of an ASEAN event in Vientiane.However, even as they agreed to work with urgency for full disengagement, Jaishankar reiterated India’s position - that peace and tranquillity on the borders and respect for LAC are essential for normalcy in bilateral relations - as he said the state of the border will necessarily be reflected on the state of our ties.“Agreed on the need to give strong guidance to complete the disengagement process. Must ensure full respect for the LAC and past agreements. It is in our mutual interest to stabilize our ties. We should approach the immediate issues with a sense of purpose and urgency,” said Jaishankar after the meeting.He also told Wang in his opening remarks at a time the world is faced with conflicts and disruption to the global economy, it is in the mutual interest of India and China to stabilise ties and focus on development. “Our ability to ensure that they are stable and forward looking is essential both for the prospects of Asia and that of the multipolar world,” he said, adding Sino-Indian ties today have an exceptional significance.Separately, the Indian government said in a statement that the talks focussed on finding an early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC to stabilize and rebuild bilateral relations and that both ministers agreed on the need to work with purpose and urgency to achieve complete disengagement at the earliest.“Both sides must fully abide by relevant bilateral agreements, protocols, and understandings reached between the two governments in the past,” said the Indian readout. Like in the last meeting, Jaishankar stressed the importance of the three mutuals - mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity - to ties. Ministers also again agreed to hold another round of diplomatic talks to address the issue.While the Chinese readout didn’t specifically mention the need to expedite disengagement in the remaining areas, it did say the 2 sides agreed to work together to maintain peace and promote “new progress” in border affairs consultation “It is hoped that the two sides will meet each other halfway, actively explore the correct way for the two neighbouring major countries to get along, and guide all sectors to establish a positive understanding of each other,” said the Chinese statement, adding Wang stressed normalcy in Sino-Indian ties is also a common expectation of the Global South.Interestingly, the strong guidance formulation is also a throwback to the India-China joint statement after the first informal summit in Wuhan in 2018 where PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping agreed to issue “strategic guidance” to their respective militaries to strengthen communication in order to build trust and mutual understanding.India and China have achieved disengagement at 4 points in the western sector, since the ongoing standoff erupted in May 2020, but the same has remained elusive in Depsang and Demchok areas even after 21 rounds of military and 15 rounds of diplomatic talks. China sees these as legacy issues that predate the current standoff.","India and China have achieved disengagement at 4 points in the western sector, since the ongoing standoff erupted in May 2020.

Supreme Court: States can take royalty on minerals & tax mineral land,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-states-can-take-royalty-on-minerals-tax-mineral-land/articleshow/112024240.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a landmark verdict which will spell a double bonanza for mineral-rich states featuring low on the prosperity index, a nine-judge bench of Supreme Court , in a majority 8:1 verdict, ruled on Thursday that states can collect royalty, which is not a tax, on minerals extracted from their territories, and also impose additional tax on mineral-bearing land.Justice B V Nagarathna dissented and said only the Centre had the power to levy tax on minerals.If the judgment becomes operational retrospectively, mineral-rich states like Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka would be richer by thousands of crores. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocates A M Singhvi and Arvind Datar pleaded with the court to make the judgment operate prospectively, but senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, who had argued for mineral-rich states, objected. SC said it would hear the parties on Wednesday on this issue.However, in an important clarification, SC said this ruling would not be applicable to oilfields, mineral oil resources, petroleum and petroleum products as the Union govt contended that these petitions did not question the Centre's exclusive jurisdiction, as defined by Entry 53 of List I of Seventh Schedule, over these assets. Dwivedi and other counsel for states also did not address arguments on the issue.In the eight to one ruling, CJI D Y Chandrachud wrote the main judgment with the consent and agreement of Justices Hrishikesh Roy, A S Oka, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, Satish C Sharma and A G Masih.This judgment settles a 25-year-old question raised by a bunch of petitions, which grew in numbers over the years and sought enforcement of states’ right to collect royalty on extracted minerals as also levy tax on mineral-bearing land. This was opposed by the Union govt, which cited the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act provision to argue that royalty was also a tax which could not be levied by the state on minerals which fall under central jurisdiction.The majority judgment settled the issue by ruling that “royalty is not a tax”. “Royalty is a contractual consideration paid by the mining lessee to the lessor for enjoyment of mineral rights. The liability to pay royalty arises out of the contractual conditions of the mining lease. The payments made to the govt cannot be deemed to be a tax merely because the statute provides for their recovery as arrears,” the CJI said in his 200-page judgment.Accepting Dwivedi’s arguments on behalf of states and after examining the interplay of entries in the Union and State Lists in the Seventh Schedule, SC said, “We hold that both royalty and dead rent do not fulfil the characteristics of tax or impost.”While overruling a large number of past constitution bench judgments of SC, the nine-judge bench gave another significant relief to states to tax mineral-bearing land, which, too, was opposed by the Centre: whether a state has the power to tax mineral-bearing tracts in its jurisdiction. “State legislatures have legislative competence under Article 246 read with Entry 49 of List II to tax lands which comprise of mines and quarries. Mineral-bearing land falls within the description of ‘lands’ under Entry 49 of List II,” the court said.“The yield of mineral-bearing land, in terms of the quantity of mineral produced or the royalty, can be used as a measure to tax the land under Entry 49 of List II (state subject). Entries 49 and 50 of List II deal with distinct subject matters and operate in different fields. Mineral value or mineral produce can be used as a measure to impose a tax on lands under Entry 49 of List II,” it said.SC said though Entry 50 of List II allows Parliament to impose by law any limitation, restriction which can even be prohibition, relating to mineral development, the MMDR Act as it stands has not imposed any limitation as envisaged in Entry 50 of List II.","If the judgment becomes operational retrospectively, mineral-rich states like Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka would be richer by thousands of crores.

He cautioned that loans from institutions like the World Bank would be disbursed in dollars, potentially increasing the debt burden due to fluctuations in the dollar-rupee exchange rate.To mitigate this risk, Sarma advised the state finance department officials to assess the potential increase in debt burden and negotiate with the central finance department officials to determine the appropriate grant and loan components within the Rs. 15000 crore allocation.Furthermore, Sarma pointed out that loans from institutions such as the World Bank are often linked to environmental considerations . He reminded the state government that the World Bank and other institutions had previously prepared a plan based on discussions with the AP government and had also gathered information from displaced persons who had lodged complaints.An inspection team appointed by these institutions had submitted a report, which Sarma believes the state government possesses. He advised CM Naidu to address the issues raised in the report and prepare a new project plan to be sent to the bank, which could facilitate easier permissions.Lastly, Sarma highlighted that the World Bank might question the implementation of the National Green Tribunal 's (NGT) orders issued in November 2017 regarding the Amaravati plan. The NGT had ordered the implementation of certain rules and the appointment of a committee to monitor the issue, with reports to be submitted to the NGT every six months.However, no such committee has been appointed to date, violating the order. Sarma urged CM Naidu to appoint the committee immediately to ensure compliance with the NGT's directives.","EAS Sarma is a former secretary to the central finance department and one of India's Board of Governors at the World Bank.

New NPS Budget 2024 Benefits Explained: In the Budget 2024, the government has announced significant changes to the National Pension System (NPS) contributions, allowing for greater tax savings. The contribution limit for employers in the private sector has been raised from 10% to 14% of the employee's basic salary. This new limit applies to both private and public sector employees, exclusively under the new tax regime.Shalini Jain, Tax Partner, People Advisory Services at EY India, emphasises that this increase will enable employees opting for the new tax regime to save more taxes and build a larger pension pool for social security.According to an ET report, the Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, highlighted in her Budget 2024 speech that the deduction for employers' contributions towards NPS will be increased from 10% to 14% of the employee’s salary. This deduction applies to employees in the private sector, public sector banks, and undertakings who opt for the new tax regime.The tax benefits on investing in NPS depend on the tax regime chosen by the taxpayer in the relevant financial year. Under the current income tax laws, the old tax regime allows for three deductions under the Income-tax Act, 1961, while the new tax regime allows only one deduction.Under the old tax regime, an individual can claim up to Rs 9.5 lakh in deductions through three routes:Under the new tax regime, an individual can claim a deduction of up to Rs 7.5 lakh under Section 80CCD (2).Upon withdrawal, an individual must use at least 40% of the NPS corpus to purchase an annuity plan from an insurance company. The remaining 60% can be withdrawn as a lump sum.On October 27, 2023, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) announced that NPS subscribers can withdraw up to 60% of their pension corpus via a systematic lump sum withdrawal (SLW) method. Subscribers can withdraw the lump sum in a phased manner (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually) up to the age of 75 years.However, there is still a lack of clarity among tax experts regarding the tax-free status of money withdrawn via the SLW method.On January 12, 2024, the PFRDA issued a master circular on partial withdrawals from the NPS Tier-I account. Partial withdrawals are allowed for specific reasons such as:Other conditions for partial withdrawal include:","Tax benefits on investing in NPS depend on the tax regime chosen by the taxpayer in the relevant financial year.

'I am an athlete'

Princess Kalina of Bulgaria is aware of the attention that her ripped physique garners and said that a woman's physical form should not be worthy of news in the 21st century. In an interview to a Spanish publication , the Bulgarian royal said she does not feel well if she does not train. ""The only reason I do it is to be healthy and feel good,"" the 52-year-old princess said.The princess has stunned the world by her recent photos but the muscles are the results of a fitness regime that she has been following for more than two decades.Princess Kalina follows a mix of cardio and weight training with each day dedicated to different parts of the body.Abs, leg, back, triceps and glutesAbs, pectorals, shoulder, biceps and gluteus30-minute run.""I do four sets of 12 reps. I pull 70 kilos of back (back pull), 30 kilos of shoulder (15 in each hand) with dumbbells, and 20 kilos of biceps curls,"" says Princess Kalina, as quoted by the publication.Apart from these, she leads an active life which includes taking her dog for a mountain walk of up to four hours every day. She also snow skis, kitesurfs and goes for horse riding,""When your body and mind say 'enough' your spirit must push and say: 'But in the end, it always pays off,'"" she said.Princess Kalina's recent photo when she attended a funeral ceremony on May 29 this year along with her husband Antonis Jose (Kitin) Munoz went viral as she looked all pumped up with the nerves of her arms prominent. She said she did not expect the buzz. ""I just wore a sleeveless dress. In the 21st century, a woman's physical form shouldn't be newsworthy,"" Princess Kalina said.Princess Kalina of Bulgaria earlier addressed her viral photo and explained the transformation as she said she is an athlete. But these activities are not something she introduced to her lifestyle all of a sudden. She had been skiing from an early age. Growing up in France, she used to go on hikes with her father in the Alps for six to eight hours.After her married to Kitin, it became their combined passion as they started working out together. They have been training together for 24 years now, the princess said. As mentors, the princess got Olympic athlete Bernardino Lombao who trained them on distance-based and speed-based running routines.Princess Kalina's key to fitness is consistency and doing it right. A bad lifestyle, drinking alcohol, smoking, overeating, and sleeping little, leads to a day with less energy and to poor or premature ageing. Good nutrition, eight hours of sleep, and good training are the keys to a healthy lifestyle and being in shape,"" she said.",Princess Kalina of Bulgaria has stunned the world by her recent photos.

Wildfires have wreaked havoc in the Canadian town of Jasper, destroying up to half of the community and prompting mass evacuations . Officials report that the blazes have leveled entire streets in Jasper, located in Alberta’s Jasper National Park, according to the BBC.Triggered by a lightning storm and fanned by powerful winds, the fires have left the once-bustling tourist destination in ruins.Smoldering rubble and charred vehicles now mark the site of what were once homes and businesses. Approximately 20,000 tourists and 5,000 residents have fled the mountainous area.Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, tearful during a news conference on Thursday, struggled to convey the scale of the destruction . She estimated that ""potentially 30 to 50 percent"" of buildings may have been lost. ""There is no denying that this is the worst nightmare for any community,"" Smith said, adding that Jasper National Park had been ""a source of pride"" for many generations.Local business owners are feeling the impact profoundly. Karyn Decore, owner of the Maligne Lodge, was on holiday when she received a photograph of her hotel in flames. ""I was horrified and devastated when I saw that photo,"" she told the BBC. ""It's really hard for everyone to comprehend that we lost one of our properties.""Efforts to combat the blaze have drawn in hundreds of firefighters from around the world, including teams from Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and South Africa. Pierre Martel, director of the national fire management program at Parks Canada, described the extreme difficulty in containing the fire. ""It [was] just a monster at that point,"" he said. ""There are no tools we have in our toolbox to deal with it.""The flames, reaching heights of up to 100 meters (328 feet) in some areas, spread rapidly. Alberta's Minister for Public Safety, Mike Ellis, recounted how the fire advanced from being 5 km (three miles) outside of Jasper to engulfing the town in less than 30 minutes. ""Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that,"" Ellis said. ""Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large, and so quickly.""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his gratitude towards the emergency services, saying, ""As the heartbreaking images from Jasper emerge, I want to thank the brave first responders who are in Alberta right now, fighting to save every home and every community they can.""Despite some rainfall overnight, officials from Jasper National Park reported that it had ""no significant impact"" on the wildfire. ""While the rain helped reduce fire activity slightly, it is not enough to have made a meaningful impact on the overall wildfire situation, which remains out of control,"" read a post on the park's social media account.The wildfires in Jasper are part of a broader pattern of severe fire conditions in the region. Last year, a record 2.2 million hectares burned in Alberta between March 1 and October 31. In addition to the fires in Alberta, there are over 45 active blazes in British Columbia, and fires are burning in several US states, including California, Oregon, Washington, Montana, and Utah.","Wildfires have destroyed up to half of the town of Jasper, Alberta, prompting mass evacuations.

Skywalk Construction: Chhattisgarh: Skywalk construction will be completed in Raipur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/chhattisgarh-skywalk-construction-will-be-completed-in-raipur/articleshow/112022976.cms,"Chhattisgarh chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai during an event on completion of six months of the state government under his leadership, in New Delhi. (Picture credit: PTI)

RAIPUR : The Vishnu Deo Sai govt on Thursday decided to complete the construction of the unfinished skywalk standing tall in the midst of the state capital since the previous BJP regime.The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai and opinions were sought from deputy CM Arun Sao , MLAs, former MPs and other public representatives.The skywalk will be completed according to the pre-approved drawing and design, a govt statement said.During the meeting, it was informed that based on the directives of the former chief minister, a pedestrian count survey was carried out at Shastri Chowk in Raipur. It was found that in October 2016, 14,000 pedestrians passed through Bhimrao Ambedkar Hospital Chowk and 27,000 through Shastri Chowk and the numbers increased in May 2019, with 25,095 pedestrians crossing through at Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar Hospital Chowk and 35,920 at Shastri Chowk.The previous govt had formed a suggestion committee regarding the incomplete work of skywalk which was recommended for completing the construction.However, the present govt on Thursday had a detailed discussion and with agreement from the deputy chief minister who is also the department minister Arun Sao, it was unanimously decided to complete the skywalk as per the previously approved design.“As far as long-awaited road widening work from Sharda Chowk to Tatyapara Chowk, a committee will be formed under the Raipur Collector to assess compensation and the need for land acquisition,” Sao said adding that the committee will provide a detailed report within 30 days, on total land required for acquisition and encroachment removal, the number of affected landowners and encroachers, complete details of government and private land (including properties), and recommendations for providing the necessary land for widening. The urban administration and development department will form this committee.Sky-walk is a 1.5 km elevated pedestrian lane in the state capital and had become the subject of a political feud between the previous Congress govt and BJP.While it was escalated as a landmark project with an estimated cost of Rs 50 crore, the skywalk stood abandoned and remained an incomplete project after the Congress wrestled power in the 2018 elections.","The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai.

MUMBAI: Two days after this paper published photographs of huge potholes on the BKC-LBS Marg flyover arm which is part of the Santacruz-Chembur Link Road (SCLR) extension project, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority ( MMRDA ) has imposed a fine of Rs 50 lakh on the contractor J Kumar Infraprojects , along with an additional Rs 10 lakh for each day the flyover arm remains closed for pothole repairs .The photos published in TOI on Tuesday highlighted the deplorable condition of the flyover arm and underscored the urgent need for repairs and maintenance .Sources said that MMRDA has not only issued notices to the contractor but has also included the project consultants PADECO in the disciplinary action. Additionally, a show-cause notice has been served to a deputy engineer of MMRDA.The problematic 1.25 km-long and 8-meter wide ramp was opened to the public on Feb 10, 2023. This is the second instance of MMRDA imposing penalties on J Kumar Infraprojects for issues concerning this particular flyover arm. In 2022, the contractor was fined Rs 1 crore for inadequate safety measures which resulted in the collapse of the under-construction elevated section of the SCLR extension project on Sept 17, 2021. The consultant was also penalized with a fine of Rs 20 lakh for their role in the incident.An MMRDA official stated, ""The total penalty imposed on the contractor and consultant for this arm of the SCLR extension project has now exceeded Rs 1.5 crore.""This is also not the first time J Kumar Infraprojects has faced criticism for pothole-related issues. In July 2023, the MMRDA faced a significant backlash after potholes appeared on the 3.8 km east-west elevated stretch of the SCLR extension, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi just two months earlier in April.The contractor has also been casual in executing the under-construction SCLR extension project, which has been opened in phases, officials stated. The work order for the project was issued in 2016 with the target of completing the entire corridor by 2019. The original cost of the project was Rs 450 crore, but it has now increased to Rs 650 crore due to various factors, officials said.Meanwhile, amid heavy rain in the city and suburbs, motorists on Thursday were seen navigating their vehicles through pothole-riddled roads in parts of the city. The BMC said that efforts to fill potholes were on and action was being initiated proactively and on receiving complaints as well. The civic body has asked 227 sub-engineers to tackle pothole-related complaints across city wards. Over the last fortnight, 13 sub-engineers have been given showcause notices for not paying attention to potholes. For monsoons this year, the BMC has proposed to give Rs 1 crore to each of the 24 administrative wards for filling of potholes on roads that are below nine metres in width, while the central agency is allocated Rs 2 crore for filling potholes on roads which are above six metres.","Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority ( MMRDA) has imposed a fine of Rs 50 lakh on the contractor J Kumar Infraprojects.

Earthquakes: Texas rocked by multiple earthquakes: What’s causing the shaking?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-rocked-by-multiple-earthquakes-whats-causing-the-shaking/articleshow/112028957.cms,"A series of earthquakes , including a notable magnitude 4.9 quake, struck Scurry County in West Texas on Monday night. Experts have confirmed that these quakes are linked to local oil production methods, according to USA Today.The seismic activity began at 10:38 pm local time with a magnitude 4.9 earthquake, marking it as one of the state's most significant quakes on record.This was followed by two additional tremors: a magnitude 4.4 quake at approximately 10:46 pm and a magnitude 3.1 quake at 11:56 pm. The area, which is sparsely populated, reported no injuries or significant damage from the quakes.“We can say with confidence that these are related to oil and gas extractions,” said Justin Rubinstein, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey (USGS) in Menlo Park, California. Rubinstein noted that this recent seismic activity highlights growing concerns over induced earthquakes in Texas, a state traditionally not known for its seismic activity.Until now, the largest earthquake linked to enhanced oil recovery in Texas was a magnitude 4.6 quake in the Cogdell Oil Field area, near Snyder. The recent quakes represent a significant escalation in seismic activity in the region.The increase in earthquake frequency is attributed to new oil production techniques, particularly enhanced oil recovery. This process involves injecting water or carbon dioxide into oil fields to push out remaining oil and gas. “Say you have 100 wells in one oil and gas reservoir,” explained Rubinstein. “You take half of the field out of production, inject a bunch of water into those wells, and the water pushes the oil over to the other side where it can be extracted.”Rubinstein emphasized that while the exact cause of the recent earthquakes cannot be pinpointed with certainty, the link to enhanced recovery methods is highly probable. The Permian Basin, a major oil and gas-rich area in West Texas and southeast New Mexico, has experienced a notable rise in earthquake activity since 2019, coinciding with increased oil and gas operations in the region.Other recent quakes in Texas include a magnitude 4.4 earthquake reported on April 10 in Martin County, about 68 miles southwest of Scurry County, and a magnitude 4.2 earthquake near Whites City, New Mexico, on Tuesday, which followed an earlier magnitude 3.2 tremor in the same area.These earthquakes are often linked to fracking and saltwater disposal practices. Fracking involves injecting a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals into oil fields at high pressure to create microfractures in rock formations, facilitating the extraction of oil and gas. The process produces significant amounts of wastewater, known as produced water, which must be disposed of via injection wells due to its high salt content and other dissolved materials.“The advent of new drilling technologies has led to an increase in the amount of wastewater that must be disposed of,” said Rubinstein. “Now you can make money even though you’re pulling out a lot more salt water.”","A series of earthquakes struck Scurry County in West Texas on Monday night.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public. Musk has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-96413764,imgsize-26192,width-400,resizemode-4/96413764.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals.

Largest wildfire in California this year started by a burning car pushed into a gully; 1 arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/largest-wildfire-in-california-this-year-started-by-a-burning-car-pushed-into-a-gully-1-arrested/articleshow/112028889.cms,"NEW DELHI: Authorities in California have arrested a suspect believed to be responsible for starting the Park Fire, which has grown into the largest wildfire in the state this year. The fire began when a burning car was pushed into a gully, leading to flames that have already scorched over 188 square miles near Chico.Evacuations have been mandated in Butte and Tehama counties, with containment at a mere 3% by Thursday evening.Meanwhile, firefighters in the Pacific Northwest also contended with multiple blazes.Another fire outbreak in California, this time near the Nevada border, led to the displacement of around 1,000 people following evacuation orders on Monday night. The Gold Complex fires, caused by lightning , have devoured more than 4 square miles of land within the Plumas National Forest, about 50 miles northwest of Reno.According to Adrienne Freeman, a spokeswoman for the Forest Service, there have been no reports of structural damage or serious injuries from these fires.""We've made some really good progress on the fires,"" said Forest Service operations section chief Tom Browning on Thursday. ""But it's hot, it's dry, and it's very windy. With the wind and the heat, we don't have great containment on all these lines.""Over at the Park Fire, fire crews are battling not just the flames but also gusty winds that cause new spot fires up to a mile away from the main fire lines. Tim Fike, the incident commander at the Gold Complex fires, pointed out that these conditions are posing severe challenges.""That's been a big, big problem on the Park Fire right now,"" Fike noted.In Oregon, residents of Huntington were allowed to return home following a thunderstorm that brought both much-needed rain and lightning—elements that both aided and threatened the firefighting efforts. The Durkee Fire in Oregon, the nation’s largest active blaze, along with another nearby fire, has burned nearly 630 square miles.Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash described the rain as a ""godsend."" The Oregon State Fire Marshal emphasised the advantage the weather change offered firefighters.Lightning strikes have also led to 15 new fires in Idaho overnight, with several already extinguished by Thursday afternoon, according to the US Forest Service in Boise. The National Weather Service in Boise detected more than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes in southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday.Overall, the Pacific Northwest has seen nearly 1,562 square miles of land burned this summer. In Oregon alone, there are 34 large fires, mostly in the central and eastern regions.The rise in wildfire incidents across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada is tied to climate change, which has increased occurrences of lightning strikes. Record-breaking heat and dry conditions are exacerbating the situation. For the first time, Idaho Power initiated a pre-emptive power outage to prevent the start of new fires by downing power lines.In northern California, fire crews are prioritising evacuations and protecting structures while constructing containment lines using bulldozers in anticipation of further fire spread. CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department reported no deaths or structural damages related to the Park Fire.A smaller but rapidly moving fire in southern California has also necessitated evacuation orders. The Grove Fire near the border of San Diego and Riverside Counties expanded to 1.4 square miles overnight and had 10% containment by Thursday afternoon. The topography of the land is reportedly making it particularly difficult for firefighting efforts.Montana is under a fire warning due to high temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds. Missoula experienced hurricane-force winds, which toppled trees and downed power lines, causing officials to warn the public about the potential dangers of electrified rivers.In Canada, a quick-moving fire hit the town of Jasper in Jasper National Park, causing thousands to evacuate and inflicting significant damage. Like their US counterparts, these wildfires have led to air quality alerts and advice as thick smoke blankets the sky.","Authorities in California have arrested a suspect believed to be responsible for starting the Park Fire.
