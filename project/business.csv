"Centre nods for UPS, assures 50% of basic pay as pension",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-nods-for-ups-assures-50-of-basic-pay-as-pension/articleshow/112770370.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bringing significant benefits to 23 lakh central govt employees , the central government on Saturday announced an overhaul of the 20-year-old National Pension System , including a higher contribution by govt for a guaranteed payout of 50% of the average basic pay drawn during the last 12 months of service.With the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS), the govt sought to bring the benefits on a par with the old pension scheme (OPS) and blunt the opposition's bid to revert to the earlier regime in the states governed by them, and mop up electoral dividends in the ensuing assembly polls.The decision also opens the doors for states to offer UPS, a contributory scheme, which will take the count of beneficiaries to 90 lakh employees. The scheme - which employees will get a one-time option to switch to - introduces inflation adjustment through dearness relief.Those opting for UPS will be assured of 50% payout if they complete 25 years of service, information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced. The payout proportion will be lower for those who put in fewer years in any govt job. Cabinet secretary-designate TV Somanathan, who chaired the committee that reviewed NPS, told reporters that following the announcements, govt's contribution towards UPS will rise to 18.5%, against 14% currently.On their part, employees are required to chip in with a contribution of 10% of their basic pay and DA. Cabinet secretary-designate T V Somanathan said that there will be an actuarial calculation every three years to ensure that the liability does not remain unfunded, as was the case with OPS where govt had to bear the entire liability without the employee contributing anything.Elaborating on the ""five pillars"" of UPS, which will be implemented from April next year, Vaishnaw said a minimum pension of Rs 10,000 will be offered to those who work for 10 years, with family pension to the spouse pegged at 60% of the deceased govt employee's pension.In addition, a lump sum payment at time of retirement - 10% of the pay and dearness allowance (DA) for every six months of service - is also provided for. ""For 30 years of service, around six months of emoluments will be given as a lump sum amount at the time of retirement,"" the minister said, adding that the payment will be in addition to gratuity.The scheme, which will be extended to those who have retired, will result in an additional cost of Rs 6,250 crore due to higher contribution and another Rs 800 crore towards payment of arrears, Somanathan said. ""It is fiscally prudent... It is a funded, contributory scheme. The only difference in the changes made today is to give an assurance to govt employees and not leave it to market forces,"" he added.UPS - which was under review for 18 months - has sought to address key concerns of employees, especially the risk of lower payout due to market fluctuations as the over Rs 11 lakh crore pension corpus of govt employees who joined after 2004 is invested in govt securities (up to 65%), equities (15%) and corporate bonds.""Govt is ensuring that there is adequate money to pay pension, which was not the case under OPS. This is yet another fiscally prudent move, which also takes care of employees' interest,"" said Balram Bhagat, CEO and whole-time director, UTI Pension Fund, among the largest fund managers.At the press conference, Vaishnaw hit out at the opposition. ""Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan have announced OPS but have not implemented it. Congress has merely announced and kept them under illusion. In contrast, PM Modi has implemented a scheme after extensive consultations, which also ensures inter-generational equity,"" he said.Though the scheme comes days after govt took back its plan to induct 45 mid-level officers through the lateral entry route amid criticism for not providing quotas to SCs and STs, Vaishnaw dismissed suggestions that it was politically motivated and could have helped BJP if it was announced ahead of the general elections. ""PM has always gone beyond electoral politics. Decisions are taken in public interest. It is a well thought out decision after extensive consultations. It has got nothing to do with elections. Govt employees, whether central govt or state govt, have seen the work over the last 10 years and we have received a lot of support from them,"" the minister said.","The Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) will bring significant benefits to 23 lakh central govt employees. The decision also opens the doors for states to offer UPS, a contributory scheme, which will take the count of beneficiaries to 90 lakh employees.

"Pakistan invites Modi for SCO meet, PM likely to skip",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-invites-pm-modi-for-sco-chg-meet-hes-likely-to-skip/articleshow/112770161.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan has invited PM Narendra Modi along with other Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) leaders for the Council of Heads of Government (CHG) in-person meeting it will host in October this year. While there is no question of Modi travelling to Islamabad, it will be of interest to see if he deputes a minister to represent India at the event, as he has done in the past, given the troubled relationship with Pakistan.Pakistan will host the meeting on October 15-16 as it holds the rotating chairmanship of the CHG, the second highest decision-making body in the Eurasian group after the Council of Heads of State.Modi has been a regular at the heads of state summit, although he skipped the same in Kazakhstan this year apparently because it clashed with the Parliament session in early July.In the CHG, the practice has been to nominate a minister to represent India. Foreign minister S Jaishankar participated last year in the CHG meeting in Bishkek. It’s not clear yet if the leaders will be allowed to address the event in Pakistan virtually, if they are unable to participate physically. Both India and Pakistan are full members of the Russia and China-led group which New Delhi sees as crucial for regional security and cooperation with Central Asian countries.However, it remains wary of Chinese dominance in SCO and efforts to position the group as an anti-West platform. Unlike all other member-states, India has never endorsed China’s BRI in SCO joint statements and last year, at the heads of state summit Modi hosted virtually, it refused to join a long-term economic strategy that the bloc announced because it seemed designed to cater to Chinese interests.Significantly though, SCO is perhaps the only multilateral forum where India and Pakistan have managed to work together, despite the hostilities that have plagued the relationship since their abortive attempt to relaunch the dialogue process in 2015 and the terror attacks that followed. While Indian delegations have travelled to Pakistan for participation in SCO exercises and vice versa, Pakistan’s then foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India last year for a meeting of SCO foreign ministers. This cooperation has been made possible by the SCO Charter that doesn’t allow member-states to raise bilateral issues.The Indian government is yet to take a decision on the invite, which was extended as per SCO protocol, for the CHG meeting. The recent terror attacks in Jammu will likely act as a deterrent against any high-profile minister-level visit to Pakistan. In his Kargil Vijay Diwas message last month, Modi had named Pakistan to say it had not learnt anything from history and was trying to remain relevant through terrorism and proxy war. The last Indian foreign minister to visit Pakistan was Sushma Swaraj in 2015.Despite Modi’s rapport with his counterpart Shehbaz Sharif’s brother Nawaz Sharif, chances of a rapprochement in India-Pakistan relations remain slim. While Pakistan wants India to reverse the decision to abrogate J&K’s special status, India maintains that there’s nothing left to discuss with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue except its illegal occupation of PoK.","Pakistan will host the meeting on October 15-16 as it holds the rotating chairmanship of the CHG.

"61% Lok Sabha MPs possess assets of Rs 5 crore and above, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/61-lok-sabha-mps-possess-assets-of-rs-5-crore-and-above-says-report/articleshow/112770044.cms,"NEW DELHI: A new report highlights that nearly 61% of 543 MPs in the 18th Lok Sabha possess assets valued at Rs 5 crores or more and nearly 32% of members have a dynastic background , indicating entrenched familial ties in politics. Of these dynasts, 20.9% are first-generation, 72.1% are second-generation, and 6.4% are multi-generational politicians.This report titled “Who Enters The Parliament?” by a non-profit organisation ‘Prajatantra’ analyzes the composition of the 18th Lok Sabha, focusing on how MPs enter politics and the barriers they face.It also examines gatekeeping practices and representation of women.The data analysis shows that in the non-privileged methods of entry, party organizational politics (16.2%) is the most prominent method, followed by local politics (14.4%) and student politics (9.2%). While in the BJP, the most prominent method of non-privileged entry is local politics (16.8%), whereas in INC, it is through party organizational politics(12.1%).According to the report, in the 18th Lok Sabha elections, for instance, the BJP fielded 110 (24.8%) candidates with dynastic backgrounds, of which 62 successfully won seats, resulting in a strike rate of approximately 56.36%. Meanwhile, the Congress fielded 99 (30.3%) candidates from dynastic backgrounds, with 43 securing seats, yielding a strike rate of approximately 43.43%.Overall it comes through that money is the predominant barrier to entry as the data shows that nearly 61% of MPs possess assets valued at Rs 5 crores or more. This is followed by MPs from dynastic backgrounds, who make up 32%, and MPs with declared serious criminal cases, who make up 31%. Only 8.1% of the newly elected MPs successfully overcame all three barriers to entry.Party organizational politics is the most chosen path of entry for self-made politicians, with 25.2% coming from this pathway, followed by local politics at 20.7% and student politics at 14.4%.In a separate section in the report on women MPs it highlighted that 797 women contested the elections but only 74 were elected to Parliament. Among these MPs, 63.5% come from a family legacy or dynastic background, 14.9% emerged from local politics and 8.1% had celebrity status.Data also shows that out of the 74 MPs 63.5% have assets worth Rs 5 crore or more and 18.9% had declared serious criminal cases against them.“The analysis of the 18th Lok Sabha reveals a starkly limited presence of self-made politicians in parliament, with only a fraction overcoming significant entry barriers. Despite some MPs entering through non-privileged paths like local and student politics, these avenues remain predominantly gatekept by crorepatis and individuals with criminal antecedents—evidenced by over 90% of MPs being crorepatis,” the report concludes.","Nearly 61% of 543 MPs in the 18th Lok Sabha possess assets valued at Rs 5 crores or more.

Tamil Nadu-based space startup launches India’s first reusable hybrid rocket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-based-space-startup-launches-indias-first-reusable-hybrid-rocket/articleshow/112769989.cms,"TOI

NEW DELHI: A day after the country celebrated the first National Space Day, Tamil Nadu-based startup Space Zone India launched India’s first reusable hybrid rocket , Mission RHUMI-2024, on board a mobile platform from the TTDC Ground in Thiruvidandhai, East Coast Road, Chennai on Saturday. RHUMI-1 rocket launched three Cube satellites and 50 PICO satellites to a suborbital trajectory and the aim of these satellites is to collect data for research purposes on global warming and climate change.Elon Musk-owned SpaceX is the only company in the world that has the technology to reuse the same rocket for multiple launches. Space Zone India attempted to emulate the same technology but on a small scale. The company has built an innovative, cost-effective, and eco-friendly descent mechanism that will ensure the safe recovery of rocket components. Reusability enables space companies to refly the most expensive parts of the rocket. This, in turn, will lower the cost of launches.Equipped with a generic-fuel-based hybrid motor and electrically triggered parachute deployer, the rocket is 100% pyrotechnic- and TNT-free. “The demand for small satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is increasing in India. This prompted the company to focus on capturing the small satellite market while employing a hybrid propulsion system to ensure cost-effectiveness,” said Anand Megalingam, founder and CEO of Space Zone in a company post. Space Zone India launched the reusable rocket in collaboration with Martin Group, which is funding the startup.Mylswamy Annadurai, the former project director of Isro's Chandrayaan-1 mission, is the startup’s mentor.Speaking to, Annadurai, who witnessed the launch, said, “Happy to see that the next generation is ready to take the path less travelled and has the courage to explore the unexplored.” He also said, “The launch of the hybrid rocket through our hydraulic mobile launchpad is a first-of-its-kind initiative that sets a new benchmark in aerospace technology. This innovative system is designed to provide unparalleled flexibility and efficiency, allowing us to adapt to various launch scenarios with ease.”The RHUMI-1 rocket combines both liquid and solid fuel propellant systems, which will not only improve efficiency and reduce operational costs but will also ensure environmental safety.In February 2023, Space Zone India made history by launching India’s first hybrid rocket, witnessed by Isro scientists, from the Atomic Research Centre in Kalpakkam. The company has developed various rockets like RHUMI-1, RHUMI-2, and RHUMI-3, each tailored for altitudes ranging from 1 km to 500 km. Additionally, the company also designed and developed its own ground-supporting equipment for rocket launches, creating portable launch systems that can easily be moved from one location to another.",Rocket launched three Cube satellites and 50 PICO satellites to a suborbital trajectory.

Workforce of 400 million women is what India needs to steer it towards becoming a $30 trillion economy by 2047,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/workforce-of-400-million-women-is-what-india-needs-to-steer-it-towards-becoming-a-30-trillion-economy-by-2047/articleshow/112769923.cms,"NEW DELHI: India will need to brace up to double its 'Female Labour Force Participation Rate' (LFPR) to 70% by 2047 if it wants to achieve the goal of becoming a $30 trillion economy by 2047. This comes through in a new report that shows that achieving this goal will require $14 trillion to be contributed by women, which in turn requires as many 400 million women in the workforce .It also comes through that increasing female labour force participation to 50% can boost India’s growth rate to 9.9% and raise the country’s GDP significantly. What lies ahead is clearly a herculean task and urgent measures are required, the data analysis shows. “In 2023, the LFPR for women was 37%, far below the global average of 47% and starkly lower than the 77% for men. At current trajectory, only 110 million women are expected to join the labour force by 2047; an additional 145 million women need to be brought into the labour force to achieve the goal,” highlights the ‘Labour Force Participation Distillation Report’ launched by non-profit ‘The/Nudge Institute’ at a collaborative livelihoods summit - ‘Charcha 2024’ in the national Capital.While the report asserts that India's economic future hinges on women in the workforce, it also draws attention to the factors contributing to the vulnerability faced by women. For instance, it is stated that women were 7 times more likely to lose their jobs and 11 times more likely to not recover from their lost jobs. It also comes through that women are employed in a few gendered, low productivity sectors. “In agriculture and manufacturing, they face limited advancement, while in construction, they make up just over 12% of the workforce, earning significantly less than men in unskilled roles,” the report highlights.The report also reflects on the interplay of gender, family dynamics and income. For instance, it shows that married women are less likely to work as their husband’s income increases. Similarly, compared to households where there is no mother-in-law present, married women living in households where the mother-in-law is present but not employed are 20% (rural) to 30% (urban) less likely to be employed. However, if the mother-in-law is employed herself, daughters-in-law are 50% (rural) to 70% (urban) more likely to be employed.The analysis also reflects on the pandemic phase to draw attention to the fragility of female employment as it was that phase of crisis that pushed many rural women into or back into work due to income loss or job loss by the primary earner in the family.It comes through that a drop in rural household incomes drove women to distress employment. As incomes fell due to Covid-19 pandemic, households all over the country took on additional work to alleviate their distress. While there were cases where men took on multiple jobs to maintain their family’s sustenance, the trend was largely driven by women joining or rejoining the workforce. This included women who were previously employed in casual labour that was now unavailable, as well as those who were never or no longer a part of the labour force.“The female labour force participation rate increased, but it wasn’t accompanied by an increase in the availability of jobs for women, especially in rural areas,” the report highlights. It turns out that the vast majority of the women who joined the workforce were self employed with a majority of these women being either their own account workers or unpaid helpers. “They operate primarily in agriculture and trade (household enterprises, street vending, etc.) - two sectors that are known for being fallbacks in times of economic distress due to their low barrier of entry. This type of employment is not aspirational in its current state as incomes are low and underemployment is high,” the report states.According to the analysis in normal conditions, women who indulge in distress employment are highly likely to exit the workforce once household incomes stabilise, but that looks unlikely today. This means that they are likely to remain in the workforce for the long run, and need support to improve their incomes.On the way forward, Kanishka Chatterjee, Director, ‘The/Nudge Prize’ highlights that India’s demographic dividend cannot be realised without boosting the participation of women in the workforce. He calls for measures to address “the multifaceted barriers - economic, social, and cultural, which requires both urgent action and the patience to achieve large-scale disruption.”The report also highlights three pathways to increased labour force participation. “First would be to activate fractural employment - redefining work for women through platform jobs and digital microwork. Second would be invigorating entrepreneurship avenues through digital commerce infrastructure. Lastly, would be targeting bottlenecks like mobility and digital access that could inhibit the supply of women to labour markets,” it is stated.","India will need to double its 'Female Labour Force Participation Rate' (LFPR) to 70% by 2047 if it wants to achieve the goal of becoming a $30 trillion economy. A new report shows that achieving this goal will require $14 trillion to be contributed by women, which in turn requires as many 400 million women in the workforce.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112769964,imgsize-17438,width-400,resizemode-4/112769964.jpg"
"With majority of rape victims in 18-30 age group, a new report calls for safety measures for working women",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-majority-of-rape-victims-in-18-30-age-group-a-new-report-calls-for-safety-measures-for-working-women/articleshow/112769318.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the country rages over the brutal rape and murder of a resident doctor in a govt-run hospital in Kolkata, the recently released ‘Men and Women in India 2023’ report shows that majority of rape victims as per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data are in the age group of 18-30. Given that a large number of women in this age group are stepping out to work, the report calls for greater sensitisation and safety measures to secure women’s fundamental right to “work and earn”.The NCRB data for 2022 has been stated in a chapter on ‘Impediments to Empowerment’ in the report released earlier this month by the ministry of statistics and programme implementaiton. The data show that in 2022 rape victims in the age group of 18-30 years accounted for 66% (21,063) of the total victims (31,982); 8,644 vicitms (27%) were in the 30-45 years age group; 1,171 (nearly 4%) between 45-60 years and 87 (0.3) above 60. Data from the past too reflect the same trend with NCRB 2021 report showing that of the 31,878 rape victims, 20,065 (63%) were between 18-30 years.According to the MoSPI report, the likely explanation for the elevated numbers in the 18-30 years age group may be attributed to women within this range falling under the ‘labour force’ category, requiring travel between the workplace and home. While noting that the prevalence of late working hours and onsite work locations could contribute to these statistics, the report states that “nevertheless, it is crucial to emphasise that such conditions should not serve as burdens or barriers impeding women's fundamental right to ‘work and earn’”.“The govt has already implemented various measures, including an act to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace and women helpline numbers. Despite these efforts, there remains a need for further action in the realm of gender sensitisation ,” it is stated.The analysis also highlights that the lower percentage in the less than 16 years age group might be due to under-reporting stemming from the fear of social stigma. the NCRB 2022 data for rape vicitms show that 32 victims were below six years accounting for (0.1%) of total victims; there were 88 victims (0.3%) in 6 to 12 years bracket; 370 (1.2%) between 12-16 years; 570 (1.6%) between 16-18 years.The report also dwells on the worrisome issue of domestic violence as it cites data to say that it indicates that “the compromise of women’s safety often begins within the confines of their own homes”. Citing NCRB data from 2017 to 2022, the report states that three major crimes — cruelty by husband and relatives, assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty and kidnapping and abduction constituted more than 70% of the total crime committed against women. The rate of cruelty by husbands and relatives faced by women in their own house accounted for one-third of all crimes.“To effectively reduce the rates of violence and crime, it is crucial that perpetrators face swift and timely punishment,” the report states.The data also shows that the total cases of crime against women for trial in 2022 were 23.67 lakh of which 1.43 lakh cases (6.05%) have been disposed off. During the year 1.6% cases were convicted and 4.4% acquitted. These clearly indicate the high pendency in courts and the need for quicker disposal,” the report states.","The report calls for greater sensitisation and safety measures to secure women’s fundamental right to ‘work and earn’ The data show that in 2022 rape victims in the age group of 18-30 years accounted for 66% (21,063) of the total victims (31,982)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112769306,imgsize-109658,width-400,resizemode-4/112769306.jpg"
"Amit Shah: Time has come for ruthless, final blow to finish Maoists by 2026: Amit Shah says in Chhattisgarh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/time-has-come-for-ruthless-final-blow-to-finish-maoists-by-2026-amit-shah-says-in-chhattisgarh/articleshow/112768662.cms,"RAIPUR: The time has come to deal a “ruthless final blow” to left-wing extremism and liberate the country from this scourge by March 2026, Union home minister Amit Shah said in Raipur on Saturday.Shah, who arrived in the Chhattisgarh capital on a two-day tour to review security operations and development strategy in Maoist-affected states, said: “Between 2019 and 2024, many states have been liberated of the LWE tag -- Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and, to an extent Maharashtra.Only one district in Maharashtra is still affected. This is a massive achievement for Govt of India.”He said it was “particularly satisfying” to see Chhattisgarh home minister Vijay Sharma visiting Maoist commander Hidma’s village (Puwarti, Sukma district) and distributing Aadhaar cards and Ayushman Bharat cards to villagers.Due to PM Narendra Modi ’s strategy, people in Madhya Pradesh’s Chandameta village and six villages in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma could vote in the elections for the first time in 40 years, he said. “This is a victory for security forces and for democracy. Today, central forces are not only fighting Maoists but also monitoring development activities ,” Shah added.Despite August being part of the period under review, 189 Maoists have been “neutralized” in Chhattisgarh, which accounts for 90% of LWE-affected area, Shah said, adding that the setting up of police camps in areas where Maoists are still active helped fill the security vacuum.Chhattisgarh is the best performing state in tackling Maoists this year, he said. Praising Chhattisgarh CM Vishnudeo Sai and his deputies Vijay Sharma and Arun Sao, he said ever since BJP formed govt, they have worked in a determined manner to root out Maoist insurgency. Apart from the Maoists eliminated, 559 have been arrested and 540 surrendered this year, he said, adding that 47 special forces camps have been set up.Sixteen more camps will be set up in the coming months as the distance between police and locals has decreased. The credit for this should be given to the better implementation of the policies run by the Sai govt,” Shah said.While only 219 Maoists were killed in five years during the tenure of the previous govt, the continuous encounter and surrender of Naxalites in just eight months is being considered a major achievement of the Vishnu Deo Sai govt, the Union home minister said.Shah said that the Niyad Nellnar scheme in the state is being considered a milestone for development in the Maoist-affected area. Under this scheme, the availability of 53 public welfare and 28 community schemes of 17 departments is being ensured.Shah urged Maoists to take up the “new-look surrender policy” that will be unveiled by Chhattisgarh govt in one or two months.The DGPs and chief secretaries of all states that share a border with Chhattisgarh are attending the review meeting with the home minister. “States connected to Chhattisgarh are part of this because neighbouring states also need to have an equally strong ecosystem to tackle Maoists and speed up development,” Shah explained. Heads of all paramilitary forces also attended the discussions.The aim is to have 100% saturation of welfare and development programmes of the state and Centre in areas affected by Maoist insurgency, and to remove hurdles, he added.“I believe the time has come to deal a ruthless final blow to Maoists with a strong battle plan,” Shah said, adding: “We all agree that LWE is the biggest challenge to India’s democratic system... The battle is in its final stages. Under PM Modi’s strategy, it will be eradicated completely by March 2026.”The Union home minister said that 17,000 people have been killed due to the insurgency in the last four decades. “Ever since BJP formed govt at the Centre under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, this problem was taken up as a challenge. Our aim was to establish rule of law in these areas by getting Maoists to give up arms, and engaging those who don’t,” he said.The objective was to ensure that development activities saturate the regions that had fallen behind due to Maoist insurgency so that they can be brought on a par with the rest of India, Shah said, adding that he is very happy with the development on both fronts.“The Centre is committed to developing the region, from Bastar to Bijapur, and Dantewada to Dhamtari, and liberating them from Maoist extremism,” he reiterated. A State Investigation Agency (SIA) has been set up on the line of NIA and it will be strengthened, he said.Listing the achievements of the anti-Maoist operations, he said that in 2022, the number of deaths dropped below 100 for the first time in four decades. “The 2014-2024 period saw the least acts of Maoist violence and 14 top Maoist leaders were neutralized. We succeeded in generating people’s trust in ‘vikas’ (progress),” Shah added.Putting the govt’s success in numbers, the Union home minister said that there were 16,463 incidents of violence from 2004-14, which dropped by 53% to 7,444. In the earlier period, 6,617 security personnel lost their lives, which has been reduced by 70%, he added.“In 2010, 96 districts reported violence. Eleven more districts were created since then, but now only 42 districts report such cases. In 2010, 456 police stations registered acts of Maoist violence. Around 100 new ones were set up. Out of these 565 police stations, only 171 now have such cases,” he said.“Since 2019, 277 new police camps have been set up, filling the security vacuum, 90 cases have been registered under a new NIA vertical, 64 chargesheets have been filed and a severe blow has been dealt by Indian agencies to LWE finance ecosystem. ED played a big role in this,” the home minister added.In the past year, home ministry has strengthened its air wing by adding 14 pilots solely for LWE areas, Shah said.The Chhattisgarh administration, collectors and SPs have a huge role in 100% saturation of welfare schemes in Maoist-affected areas, the home minister said.“In the last 10 years, central govt has improved lives in all LWE-affected states. With funds of Rs 21400 crore and 15,300 telephone towers, the connectivity problem has been resolved. To solve road connectivity issues, Rs 21000 crore was sanctioned to build 17,500km of roads, of which 11,500km has already been completed,” Shah said.To promote financial inclusion in 25 worst-affected districts, 2,796 bank branches have been opened, along with 2,061 ATMS.

Proportionate for lesser service up to a minimum of 10 years of service

UPS vs Old Pension Scheme:

Unified Pension Scheme: Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Cabinet has on Saturday approved the Unified Pension Scheme for government employees. The decision was announced by Information and Broadcasting and Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw in a press briefing. Vaishnaw said that the new Unified Pension Scheme will benefit 23 lakh central government employees.The state governments will also be given the option to opt for the Unified Pension Scheme. If state governments opt for UPS, then the number of beneficiaries will be around 90 lakh. According to the government, the expenditure for arrears will be Rs 800 crore. The annual cost increase will be around Rs 6,250 crore in the first year.The scheme will be effective from April 1, 2025. Central government employees will be given the option of choosing between National Pension Scheme (NPS) and UPS. Existing central government NPS subscribers will also be given the option to switch to UPS. At the press briefing, government officials said that most central government employees will benefit from opting for the UPS over the NPS. The NPS applies to government employees who started their service on or after April 1, 2004. Unlike the defined benefit scheme available to employees hired before this date, the NPS is based on a contribution model.""Today the Union Cabinet has approved Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for government employees providing for the assured pension...50 per cent assured pension is the first pillar of the scheme...second pillar will be assured family pension...About 23 lakh employees of the central government would benefit from the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS)...There will be an option for the employees to opt between NPS and UPS,"" Vaishnaw said.Announcing the decision, Vaishnaw said that new pension schemes have been a topic of concern for government employees, who have called for certain modifications. In response to these demands, Prime Minister Narendra Modi formed a committee, led by Cabinet Secretary TV Somanathan, to address the issue. The committee conducted a thorough investigation, engaging in over 100 meetings with various organizations and nearly all the states.The committee sought input from a wide range of stakeholders, including the Reserve Bank of India and the World Bank, to ensure a well-informed decision-making process, Vaishnaw said.Based on the extensive deliberations and recommendations put forth by the committee, a Unified Pension Scheme has been cleared. The Unified Pension Scheme aims to address the concerns raised by government employees and streamline the pension system for enhanced efficiency and effectiveness, he said.Several non-BJP states have opted to return to the DA-linked Old Pension Scheme (OPS) and employee organizations in other states demanding the same.OPS provided retired government employees with a monthly pension equal to 50 per cent of their last drawn salary, with the amount increasing in line with DA rates. However, OPS is not fiscally sustainable as it is non-contributory, leading to a growing burden on the exchequer.""The benefits of the Unified Pension Scheme will apply to those who are retired or retiring under the NPS till March 31, 2025. They will be eligible for arrears,"" Somanathan said.Employees opting for UPS will not face any additional financial burden. The employee's contribution will remain at 10 per cent, while the government's contribution will increase from 14 per cent to 18.5 per cent.According to Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors, the move is likely to cheer the central government employees as UPS provides for an assured pension for both the employees and their families and is also supported with the indexation benefit for the inflation factor.After January 1, 2004, Central Government employees are covered under the NPS which provides for annuity/lump sum payment based on the market earned return over the corpus accumulated through contributions by the Government and the employees.“This is the return of the defined benefit pension scheme era and which has been the demand of several government employees who were not happy with the NPS. This may put pressure on the government as its liability to pay pension will not be limited merely to the corpus built by the employees over the service period,” Kuldip Kumar told TOI.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Cabinet has on Saturday approved the Unified Pension Scheme for government employees. The scheme will be effective from April 1, 2025. Central government employees will be given the option of choosing between National Pension Scheme (NPS) and UPS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112766573,imgsize-57530,width-400,resizemode-4/112766573.jpg"

"Dhaka blames India for flooding, Delhi hits back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dhaka-blames-india-for-flooding-delhi-hits-back/articleshow/112724351.cms,"NEW DELHI/DHAKA: The Indian government on Thursday strongly denied claims in Dhaka that flooding of districts on the eastern borders of Bangladesh had been caused by the opening of Dumbur dam upstream of the Gumti river in Tripura, saying that floods on cross-border rivers is a shared problem on both sides. Indian govt sources also warned the interim govt against any official backing of ""misplaced"" narratives.The warning came in the wake of allegations by one of the advisers to the interim govt, Mohammad Nahid Islam, that India's ""non-cooperation"" was the reason for the flooding.""Without any prior warning and without giving us time for preparation, the dam was opened. Through this India showed an inhuman approach and is demonstrating non-cooperation with Bangladesh,"" Islam said after a meeting of the advisory council with chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.Amid cross-border acrimony, there were rumours in Dhaka that Yunus had summoned Indian envoy Pranay Verma. Sources in Delhi, however, said that the request by Verma for a call was lodged several days ago and before the events related to the floods.Nahid, one of the coordinators of the protests against ousted PM Sheikh Hasina, who is supervising information and broadcasting affairs, hoped that India will come out from this ""anti-Bangladesh policy"".""Any official backing of such misplaced narratives is unhelpful to bilateral ties and the use of the word 'summon' is clearly an attempt at disinformation,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.In a statement, the foreign ministry said this problem requires close mutual cooperation, adding India continues to provide real-time flood data to Bangladesh as per a bilateral protocol.With the two countries sharing 54 common cross-border rivers, river water cooperation is an important part of their bilateral engagement. Looking to allay concerns in Bangladesh about India's alleged role in the floods, which followed the political crisis in the country, Indian govt said it remained committed to resolving issues and mutual concerns in water resources and river water management through bilateral consultations and technical discussions.India pointed out that the catchment areas of the Gumti river that flows through India and Bangladesh have witnessed the heaviest rains of this year over the past few days and the flood in the neighbouring country is primarily due to waters from these large catchments downstream of the dam.""Dumbur dam is located quite far from the border - over 120km upstream of Bangladesh. It is a low-height (about 30m) dam that generates power that feeds into a grid and from which Bangladesh also draws 40MW power from Tripura. Along the about 120km river course, we have three water level observation sites at Amarpur, Sonamura and Sonamura 2,"" said MEA .""Heavy rainfall has been continuing since Aug 21 in whole of Tripura and adjoining districts of Bangladesh. In the event of heavy inflow, automatic releases have been observed,"" it added, while recalling that the Amarpur station is in part of a bilateral protocol under which India is transmitting real-time flood data to Bangladesh.""Data showing a rising trend has been supplied to Bangladesh up to 3pm on Aug 21, 2024. At 6pm, due to flooding, there was a power outage, leading to problems of communication. Still, we have tried to maintain communication through other means created for urgent transmission of data,"" said govt.Heavy rainfalls have caused heavy flooding, the worst since 1956, in Tripura with more than 80% of the state capital, Agartala, waterlogged. The situation worsened in the city after it received 233mm rain on Wednesday that could not be pumped out as the Haora river was overflowing.Eight districts of Bangladesh have been flooded due to heavy rains and onrush of water from the upstream, said the ministry of disaster management and relief on Wednesday. The eight districts are Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Feni, Chattogram, Noakhali, Comilla and Khagrachhari. At least 1,796,248 people have been affected, the ministry said on Thursday.(With inputs from AKM Moinuddin in Dhaka)","India strongly denies claims in Dhaka that flooding of districts on eastern borders of Bangladesh had been caused by the opening of Dumbur dam upstream of the Gumti river in Tripura.

A rare and deadly equine virus, capable of infecting humans with a staggering mortality rate of 30%, has been detected across multiple counties in the Hudson Valley and surrounding states. This menace, largely unknown to the public until now, has already infected its first victims—a horse in Orange County, New York, and an elderly man in Massachusetts.The virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito, has health officials on high alert.In response to the growing threat, four towns in Massachusetts—Douglas, Oxford, Sutton, and Webster—have taken the unprecedented step of implementing a voluntary evening lockdown to curb the spread of this potentially fatal disease, the New York Post reported.The Oxford Board of Health voted on Wednesday to urge residents to stay indoors after 6:00 pm, a precautionary measure effective immediately until September 30. As the chill of October sets in, the recommendation will shift, with residents being advised to remain inside after 5:00 pm until the season’s first hard frost brings an end to the mosquito threat.This advisory, shared with Fox News Digital, highlights the critical period from dusk through dawn as ""peak mosquito hours,"" during which the risk of contracting the virus is highest. The four towns have been designated as ""critical-risk"" areas.Eastern Equine Encephalitis is not just another mosquito-borne illness . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes EEE as a ""rare but serious disease,"" one that, while infrequent, carries devastating consequences.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Barry Wilmore

Sunita Williams

Two veteran Nasa astronauts , Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore and Sunita ""Suni"" Williams, who together have more than 500 days of spaceflight experience , became the first crew to launch aboard Boeing's Starliner space capsule on a test flight from Florida on June 5.Initially scheduled to return to Earth after about eight days, their mission has now been extended until early next year.Nasa decided to delay their return after deeming the Starliner's propulsion system issues, including leaks and thruster failures, too risky. The astronauts will instead return on a SpaceX vehicle.Due to leaks and thruster failures on the Starliner capsule, the mission of the two astronauts at the International Space Station (ISS) has been extended by several months.Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore, 61, is a retired US navy captain who served as a fighter pilot, completing four operational deployments, including 21 combat missions during the first Gulf War in the 1990s.Before joining Nasa's astronaut corps in 2000, Wilmore worked as a Navy test pilot and flight instructor.His space career began in 2009 when he first flew to the International Space Station (ISS) as a pilot on a Nasa space shuttle mission. He returned to the ISS in 2014 on a long-duration mission aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, spending several months as the station commander.Prior to his current mission on the Starliner, Wilmore had accumulated 178 days in space and completed four spacewalks.A native of Tennessee, Wilmore played college football at Tennessee Tech University and holds advanced degrees in electrical engineering and aviation systems. He is married and has two daughters.Sunita ""Suni"" Williams, 58, is a former US navy helicopter pilot with extensive experience flying over 30 different rotary aircraft.In the first Gulf War, she was part of a helicopter combat support squadron and later supported disaster relief operations in Florida following Hurricane Andrew. She returned to the naval test pilot school as a rotary aircraft instructor before joining Nasa's astronaut program in 1998.Williams first travelled to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a space shuttle and returned for a long-duration mission as a Soyuz passenger with two cosmonauts. Her two ISS tours, in 2006-2007 and 2012, were focused on science expeditions.During her time aboard the ISS, Williams set a world record for the most time spent by a woman in orbit outside a spacecraft, totalling 50 hours and 40 minutes across seven spacewalks.However, her record has since been surpassed by Peggy Whitson, Williams remains notable for her achievements. In 2012, she became the second woman to serve as ISS commander.An enthusiastic athlete, Williams became the first person to complete a marathon in space in 2007, virtually participating in the Boston Marathon and finishing in four hours and 24 minutes using the space station's treadmill.In 2012, Sunita Williams completed the first triathlon in space, using the space station's treadmill, stationary bicycle, and a resistance machine.Before her Starliner mission, she had spent 322 days in space and was the first woman on the inaugural crewed flight of a new spacecraft. Originally from Massachusetts, Williams now resides in Houston with her husband, a former helicopter pilot and current federal police officer.","Two veteran Nasa astronauts Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore and Sunita ""Suni"" Williams have more than 500 days of spaceflight experience.
