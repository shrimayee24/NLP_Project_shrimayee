Delhi-NCR wakes up to toxic smog: AQI hits ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ levels; flights impacted due to low visibility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-ncr-wakes-up-to-toxic-smog-aqi-hits-very-poor-to-severe-levels-flights-impacted-due-to-low-visibility/articleshow/126087878.cms,"From Work-From-Home To Vehicle Ban- Delhi Rolls Out Fresh Pollution Curbs

NEW DELHI: Thick smog blanketed the Delhi-NCR on Saturday morning, with AQI being 380 in the 'very poor' category as recorded at 7am by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), while large stretches of the region recorded 'severe' levels. Visibility remained severely impacted, affecting the residents' commute and overall health.Several parts of Delhi continued to witness severe air pollution levels, with multiple monitoring stations recording AQI levels well above 400.According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Sarai Kale Khan and Anand Vihar both recorded an AQI of 428, while the ITO area touched 429. Akshardham reported an AQI of 420, Ashok Vihar 407, and Rao Tularam Marg 403. The Barapullah flyover area registered an AQI of 380, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category.In response to the concerning situation of deteriorating air quality, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) enforced Stage-IV measures of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR.The restrictions include a ban on non-essential construction activities, curbs on the entry of certain diesel vehicles, and stricter enforcement to rein in pollution sources.Earlier in the day, Delhi Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa carried out surprise inspections at petrol pumps, including those at the Delhi-Gurugram border and Janpath, to assess compliance with the ‘No PUC, No Fuel’ directive.As per official categorisation, an AQI between 401 and 500 is considered ‘severe’, while readings above 300 indicate conditions that pose serious health risks.","Several parts of Delhi continued to witness severe air pollution levels, with multiple monitoring stations recording AQI levels well above 400.

Parliament debate on SIR

What is SIR

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief electoral officer Archana Patnaik on Friday said the draft electoral roll, after the Special Intensive Revision (SIR), for the state now includesvoters, comprising 2.66 crore women and 2.77 crore men.She said that prior to the SIR, the poll-bound state had around 6.41 crore registered voters, and the exercise led to the deletion ofnames from the rolls.According to Patnaik, the deletions included 26.94 lakh voters who had died, 66.44 lakh voters who had permanently shifted or migrated, andduplicate entries where individuals were found to be registered in more than one place.She added that among those marked as migrated,persons were found not residing at their registered addresses after three rounds of door-to-door verification conducted across the state.The SIR in the DMK-ruled state was conducted amid vehement opposition by chief minister MK Stalin , whose party filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the major roll-revision exercise in the southern state.“To prevent this anti-democratic move, we convened an all-party meeting and passed a resolution condemning the SIR. The Election Commission’s decision to carry out a full revision of the electoral roll just months before the election is part of a well-planned strategy to delete legitimate voters,” CM Stalin said while criticising the Election Commission's electoral roll sanitisation exercise.Also read: Nearly 74 lakh names deleted from Gujarat rolls; EC opens window for objections CM Stalin added that the same tactic was used earlier in Bihar, where lakhs of genuine voters were allegedly ""removed from the list"".He also pointed out that opposition to this controversial process had first emerged from Tamil Nadu, after which the Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who also happens to be the Lok Sabha leader of opposition, raised strong objections.“Even after a legal case was filed, the Election Commission did not give a satisfactory explanation,” CM Stalin said.Taking aim at AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami, CM Stalin accused him of “playing a double game” and being “afraid of the Election Commission due to his ties with the BJP.”He added that while migrant workers from Bihar had found livelihood and respect in Tamil Nadu, the Prime Minister was “playing political drama in Bihar for electoral gain.”Nearly 74 lakh voters have been removed from Gujarat’s draft electoral rolls following the completion of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise, reducing the state’s total electorate to 4.34 crore from 5.08 crore earlier, officials said on Friday.The Election Commission published the draft electoral rolls on Friday, after which 73.73 lakh names were omitted as part of the roll-cleaning exercise, Gujarat Chief Electoral Officer Hareet Shukla said.“Before the publication of the draft rolls, Gujarat had 5,08,43,436 registered voters. After the revision, the number stands at 4,34,70,109,” Shukla said.According to the CEO’s office, the deletions included 18,07,278 deceased voters, 9,69,662 absent voters, 40,25,553 voters who had permanently migrated, 3,81,470 duplicate entries, and 1,89,364 names removed under other categories.On Tuesday, the Election Commission published a draft list of deleted voters after the SIR of the electoral rolls in West Bengal. The list features voters whose names were included in the state’s electoral rolls in 2025 but were deleted from the draft rolls of 2026.This came after the first phase of the SIR exercise ended on December 11. The second phase, which began after December 16, will involve the filing of claims and objections.The notice phase, which includes issuance, hearings, verification and decisions on enumeration forms, as well as disposal of claims and objections, will be carried out concurrently by Electoral Registration Officers (EROs).The SIR issue was also debated and discussed at length during the Winter Session of the parliament, with the Leader of the Rajya Sabha JP Nadda and other key minister in the NDA government urging the opposition parties to come together to back the SIR of the electoral roll, while pointing out how West Bengal has seen a massive spike in its electorate from 4.8 crore to 7.6 crore since the last SIR in 2002.Nadda, citing ECI data during the debate in Rajya Sabha on electoral reforms, said the minimum increase in voters' list of the 9 West Bengal districts bordering Bangladesh was 70 per cent since 2002, while the maximum had crossed 100 per cent.He shared that Uttar Dinajpur has witnessed the highest spike in electors at 105.5 per cent, Malda at 94.8 per cent, Murshidabad at 87.6 per cent, 24 Parganas at 83.5 per cent and Jalpaiguri at 82.3 per cent.The Election Commission of India (ECI) conducts a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls to ensure the accuracy and completeness of voter lists ahead of major elections. The exercise involves a detailed door-to-door verification to identify and remove duplicate, shifted or deceased entries while enrolling new and first-time voters.Carried out under the Representation of the People Act, 1950, the SIR aims to maintain the integrity of the electoral rolls by updating demographic details and correcting inaccuracies.During the revision, booth-level officers visit households, verify electors’ details, and facilitate claims and objections. The process is a key part of the Commission’s voter roll management, ensuring that every eligible citizen is included and the rolls reflect the most current and authentic data before elections."," Tamil Nadu chief electoral officer Archana Patnaik on Friday said the draft electoral roll, after the Special Intensive Revision (SIR), for the state now includes 2.66 crore women and 2.77 crore men.

Parliament on Thursday passed the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025, a landmark law that opens the country's tightly controlled civil nuclear sector to private and foreign investment for the first time since Independence.The Rajya Sabha approved the bill by voice vote, defeating opposition demands to refer it to a standing committee. The Lok Sabha passed it a day earlier. Once the President gives assent, the bill becomes law.""It marks a transformational moment for our technology landscape,"" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi , linking the bill to India’s clean energy ambitions and global leadership in AI and green manufacturing.PM Modi added in his post on X: ""My gratitude to MPs who have supported its passage. From safely powering AI to enabling green manufacturing, it delivers a decisive boost to a clean-energy future for the country and the world. It also opens numerous opportunities for the private sector and our youth. This is the ideal time to invest, innovate and build in India!""The SHANTI Bill aims to supercharge India’s clean energy transition. It also enables India to scale from 8.9 GW of nuclear capacity to 100 GW by 2047, requiring investments worth Rs 19.3 trillion ($214 billion), as Bloomberg reported.“This (nuclear energy) will be the most reliable, steady 24x7 source of energy, unlike some other renewable sources,” said Jitendra Singh, minister of state for Atomic Energy, defending the bill in Parliament.At a time when power demand is exploding-driven by industrial growth, data centers, and urban expansion-the bill aims to ensure a firm, carbon-free power source, unlike solar or wind, which are intermittent.This isn’t just about inviting private capital. The bill overhauls the entire nuclear governance architecture, combining safety, licensing, regulation, liability, and dispute resolution into one statute.Indian private firms are now permitted to construct, possess, and manage civil nuclear facilities. Foreign entities can also get involved through partnerships or joint ventures.The Atomic Energy Act of 1962 and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act of 2010 are both being repealed, making way for a single, updated regulatory structure.Operators' liability is capped (for instance, Rs 3,000 crore for large reactors), and the government can establish a Nuclear Liability Fund to cover any claims that exceed this limit. Suppliers are generally protected from liability, unless their contracts specify otherwise.The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) is now a statutory body, gaining legal independence as a safety regulator. This grants it the power to inspect, halt, or even shut down operations.A dual authorization system is being implemented. Nuclear plants will require both an operating license and a safety authorization. Every single action, from building to waste management, will need official approval.""The standard operating procedure explicitly states: 'safety first, then production,'"" Singh noted, emphasizing that India's safety protocols remain firmly grounded in the Nehru-era approach.Plants will now need two clearances-a licence to operate and a safety authorisation. Every activity-from construction to waste storage-requires approval.“The SOP in place clearly mentions: ‘safety first, second production’,” said Singh, asserting that India’s safety standards are still rooted in the Nehru-era framework.The bill is not just about clean energy-it’s about unlocking stalled mega-projects and repositioning India geopolitically.India’s 2010 liability law scared off global suppliers. Companies like GE, Westinghouse, and EDF shelved projects worth billions because of Section 17(b) of the CLND Act, which allowed victims to sue suppliers in case of a nuclear accident.That’s now gone.SHANTI removes this statutory risk, aligning India with global conventions like the Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC) and signalling to Washington, Paris, and Tokyo that India is open for business.Meanwhile, opposition MPs raised concerns in the Rajya Sabha, questioning the Centre’s decision to allow private players into the nuclear sector, warning it could affect the country’s sovereignty.“We are seeing profits being privatized, and risks being socialized,” warned Manoj Kumar Jha of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, referring to taxpayer-backed safety nets for private players.“The bill dismantles the liability framework established after the Bhopal gas tragedy,” said IUML’s Haris Beeran, adding, “Posterity will judge us very badly”.“The government comes up with an acronym first and then a policy,” said Congress’ Jairam Ramesh, accusing the BJP of rewriting history and ignoring contributions made before 2014.“It’s a milestone. We are now a first-line nation, not followers,” Jitendra Singh told Rajya Sabha, adding India’s global role in energy and climate has changed significantly.Participating in the debate, Trinamool Congress MP Sagarika Ghose described the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill as not just flawed but ""fundamentally dangerous.""""This Bill brings neither Shanti nor security... we are not debating whether India should pursue nuclear energy, India has always pursued nuclear energy responsibly for decades..."" she said.""But as a country, are we now prepared to abdicate our sovereign responsibility, gamble with public safety and place one of the most sensitive sectors of the nation at the mercy of crony capitalism and government-friendly oligarchs as well as foreign pressure?""""This Bill is not reform, it is recklessness. This Bill is not for the public, it's for profit,"" she added.DMK MP P Wilson said the Bill is a ""nuclear bomb which threatens the country's peace and security"". He also demanded that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee of Parliament.AAP MP Sandeep Pathak questioned BJP-led Centre and pointed out that the saffron party had opposed India-US civil nuclear deal due to foreign involvement.""Do you accept the opposition at that time was political not ideological? If it was ideological, do you accept that you have changed your ideology?"" he said.""Is it for money? Or do you think they will bring technology? We are importing a foreign model without importing their regulatory spine,"" he added.India is betting on nuclear while the world is rediscovering it as a climate-friendly baseload power source.Global nuclear capacity could potentially exceed 860 GW by 2050, a projection fueled by AI, data centers, and the push for clean technology, as highlighted by Morgan Stanley Research in August.Nations such as China, South Korea, and Japan are actively increasing their nuclear power capabilities. The US and EU are also showing interest in small modular reactors (SMRs), a trend the SHANTI Bill supports.India's plans are in step with this global shift:The Department of Atomic Energy reports that India's nuclear energy budget has seen a significant increase, nearly tripling from Rs 13,879 crore in 2014 to Rs 37,483 crore in 2025.The safety-liability issue remains a point of contention.Critics argue that SHANTI weakens accountability standards.No strict criminal liability for suppliers.Operators face capped compensation.Victims have limited recourse.G Sundarrajan, an anti-nuclear activist, told the AP that the bill ""takes away essential safeguards,"" making it ""nearly impossible"" for radiation victims to seek legal redress.""This also provides little recourse for any Indian citizen to claim damages from nuclear companies,"" he added.Union minister Singh, however, countered those concerns, stating, ""Wide consultations were held... with industry leaders, scientific experts, startups, and ministries.""""We took more than a year, and the bill was framed with safety and global benchmarks in mind.""SHANTI's strategic vision hinges on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). These compact, factory-assembled reactors, each under 300 MW, are designed to power industrial hubs or remote areas.Consider these possibilities:The legislation's framework permits private ownership, licensing, and safety approvals for these installations, providing a competitive advantage in clean energy for heavy industries.According to Bloomberg, L&T is already exploring SMR technology.The geopolitical implications are significant.The SHANTI Bill extends beyond energy; it's also a tool of foreign policy.By adhering to global standards for liability and safety, India is:Reviving the Westinghouse project in Andhra Pradesh, which had previously stalled.Reengaging in agreements with EDF, GE, and Rosatom.Strengthening strategic relationships with the United States, France, and Japan.This also positions India as a climate-conscious global leader, particularly in the lead-up to G20 follow-up meetings and COP summits.How quickly are licenses granted? What are the specific safety requirements? Who will be the first to apply – Tata? Adani?Who's going to take on the nuclear risk? And are the premiums even realistic?How does the funding work? What's the process for payouts?Will it actually enforce the rules, or will it cave to political influence?Places like Kudankulam have seen protests. Could land acquisition and health concerns spark fresh conflicts?","Parliament on Thursday passed the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025. The bill opens the country's tightly controlled civil nuclear sector to private and foreign investment for the first time since Independence. It also enables India to scale from 8.9 GW of nuclear capacity to 100 GW by 2047, requiring investments worth Rs 19.3 trillion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126080027,imgsize-651630,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Opposition's midnight protest outside Parliament

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha adjourned sine die on Friday, ending the 19-day Parliament Winter Session, which was marked by a series of moments that went viral, capturing the chaos, confrontation and occasional absurdity that unfolded inside Parliament.Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla announced the adjournment for an indefinite period, noting a productivity of 111 percent of the house during the session.Over 15 sittings, several key Bills were passed, including legislation opening up the civil nuclear sector to private companies.The session was dominated by the passage of the Viksit Bharat–Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, which replaces MNREGA and guarantees 125 days of employment for rural households, amid loud Opposition protests.Debates also covered election reforms and 150 years of ‘Vande Mataram,’ reflecting both the legislative and dramatic moments of the session.Controversy arose after BJP MP Anurag Thakur accused a Trinamool Congress MP of vaping inside the Lok Sabha. BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya later identified the lawmaker as TMC leader Kirti Azad.Malviya wrote on X, “For people like him, rules and laws hold no meaning. Hiding an e-cigarette in his palm inside the House is unacceptable.Smoking may not be illegal, but using it in Parliament is.” He also called on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee to comment on the alleged misconduct.Earlier, Thakur had submitted a written complaint to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, seeking action against the TMC MP for using an e-cigarette, though he did not name the lawmaker at the time.Former Union minister and Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury brought a puppy into Parliament on the first day of the session. She said she had rescued it after seeing it near the site of a road accident while on her way to the House. Concerned for its safety, she carried the puppy in her vehicle.Taking a jibe at the BJP, Chowdhury said, ""The real ones (dogs) who bite are sitting in Parliament. They run the government. We take care of a mute animal, and this has become a big issue and a topic of discussion. Does the government have nothing else to do? I sent the dog home and told them to keep it at home... We don't talk about those who sit in Parliament and bite us every day,"" she said.When asked about a possible privilege motion, she barked at reporters. “Bhow, bhow… aur kya bolun?” she said, adding that serious issues like pollution-related deaths, suicides of booth-level officers, and labour laws were being ignored while the focus remained on her dog.Unruly scenes erupted during the passage of the VB-G RAM G Bill, which replaced the 20-year-old MGNREGA. Opposition MPs, mostly from the Congress, stormed the well of the House, shouted slogans, and tore copies of the Bill after their demand to refer it to a parliamentary committee was rejected.The disruptions continued as the government pushed the legislation through, prompting repeated warnings from the Chair.Rural Development Minister Shivraj Chouhan criticised the Opposition, calling the tearing of pages and MPs climbing onto tables a “murder of Bapu’s ideals.”""The behaviour of the opposition in the Lok Sabha today, including members of the Congress and the INDIA Alliance, has undermined the integrity of our democracy. Parliamentary decorum has been thoroughly disregarded. Democracy has been transformed into mobocracy. We listened carefully to the opposition. I said I would answer each question, but I should be heard. But pages were torn, and they got onto the tables. Isn't it a murder of Bapu's (Mahatma Gandhi) ideals?""Tempers flared during a debate on the Special Intensive Revision when Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi challenged Home Minister Amit Shah to an open debate over allegations of “vote chori.”Rahul insisted on answers about immunity granted to election commissioners and alleged the presence of 19 lakh fake voters. “""My question yesterday was that for the first time in history, full immunity was given to the election commissioner. I wanted to know the reasoning behind this decision. Secondly, about Haryana, he [Amit Shah] took one example of fake voters, but there are 19 lakh fake voters,” Rahul said.He added, “Let us have a debate on my press conference. Amit Shah ji, I challenge you to have a debate.”Shah responded sharply, saying Parliament would not function according to Rahul Gandhi’s wishes and that he would decide the sequence of his speech.Shah responded sharply, saying Parliament would not function according to Rahul Gandhi’s wishes. “I will decide the sequence of my speech. Parliament will not work like this,” he said. He asked Rahul to have patience and said he would answer every question.Rahul called Shah’s response “defensive” and “scared.”Opposition protests over the G RAM G Bill culminated in dramatic walkouts, as members accused the government of rushing the legislation through without proper debate and scrapping a flagship rural employment scheme that supported crores of households.Despite repeated warnings from the Chair, Opposition MPs continued shouting slogans before walking out of the House in protest. They condemned the Bill for undermining rural livelihoods and bypassing parliamentary scrutiny. The walkouts underscored the tense atmosphere in the House, which persisted until the legislation was ultimately passed.Amid the acrimony in Parliament, a lighter moment unfolded during Question Hour when Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra sought a meeting with Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari to discuss landslides on the Chandigarh–Shimla highway and road projects in her Wayanad constituency.Gadkari responded promptly, saying no appointment was necessary and invited her to his chamber. During their discussion, Priyanka noted the recurring landslides on the Chandigarh–Shimla highway, pointing out that low retaining walls were failing to prevent slope collapses. She also raised concerns about six road projects passing through Kerala, including some under the Centre’s purview.Gadkari assured her that he would look into the issues. At one point, he humorously remarked, referencing her brother Rahul Gandhi, “Bhai ka kaam kar diya, behen ka nahin karunga toh aap bolenge ki nahi kiya” (“You’ll complain that I addressed your brother’s concerns but not yours”), drawing laughter from Priyanka and others present.Eyewitnesses also noted a quirky culinary moment: Gadkari offered Priyanka a rice dish he had prepared after watching YouTube videos, which Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda was seen tasting while chatting with the minister.The protest over the Bill spilled beyond Parliament hours, with Opposition parties staging a 12-hour overnight dharna in the Parliament complex on Thursday night.As Rajya Sabha cleared the legislation after midnight by a voice vote, following its earlier approval in the Lok Sabha, Opposition MPs renewed demands for the Bill’s withdrawal and referral to a parliamentary panel, but the government rejected their appeals.Trinamool Congress leader Sagarika Ghose accused the Centre of “bulldozing” the legislation, calling it an insult to India’s poor and alleging that MPs were given barely five hours’ notice without a proper debate.","Lok Sabha adjourned sine die on Friday, ending the 19-day Parliament Winter Session.

The invisible crisis beneath our feet



Behind this lies a darker reality, an informal and often illegal groundwater trade.

In a narrow lane of India, men and women wait quietly with plastic drums lined in rows. Some squat, some sit, with eyes fixed on the bend ahead.Suddenly, the silence breaks. A water tanker reverses into the alley, its engine drowning out the waiting. Young men rush forward, climbing atop the truck, lowering pipes into the tank. Within moments, quiet order unravels into chaos.Hundreds of kilometres away, in rural India, women walk long distances to empty wells, dried-up tubewells and shrinking water bodies, hoping to find a few litres of water.Just because some cities suffered floods doesn’t mean you have water. For a country that supports nearly 17% of the world’s population with just 4% of its freshwater resources, water scarcity has become a daily reality, and not just a distant threat.With India’s population expected to rise from 1.3 billion to nearly 1.7 billion by 2050, the question is no longer whether India is facing a water crisis.But how soon parts of the country will run out!A water crisis occurs when the availability of safe, usable water falls short of demand. The World Bank defines water scarcity as a situation where annual per capita water availability drops below 1,000 cubic metres.India is steadily moving towards this threshold.Despite supporting 17% of the world’s population, India has access to only 4% of global freshwater resources. According to NITI Aayog's Composite Water Management Index (CWMI), the country is facing the worst water crisis in its history, with nearly 600 million people experiencing high to extreme water stress.India’s per capita water availability stood at 1,486 cubic metres in 2021, placing it in the water-stressed category (below 1,700 cubic metres). Government estimates suggest this could fall further to 1,341 cubic metres by 2025 and 1,140 cubic metres by 2050, pushing large parts of the country closer to scarcity.Globally, freshwater reserves have declined sharply over the last two decades, with losses estimated at 324 billion cubic metres every year, enough to meet the annual water needs of 280 million people.According to the Union minister of Jal Shakti releases Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment Report of the Country for the Year 2025, “Groundwater assessment units across India are categorised as safe, semi critical, critical and over exploited, based on the ratio of annual groundwater extraction and replenishment in the phreatic aquifer. The assigned categories aid in planning, management, and regulation of the country's groundwater resources. ”Water consumption worldwide increased by 25% between 2000 and 2019, with nearly a third of that growth occurring in already water-stressed regions, the report stated.Northern India figures prominently among these drying zones, alongside parts of northern China, Central America and the southwestern United States. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, worsening droughts and unsustainable land and water use have accelerated the decline.For India, the implications are stark. Agriculture, livelihoods, urban growth and ecological sustainability all hinge on groundwater, the country’s most heavily used and least regulated water source.Groundwater forms the backbone of India’s water security. According to the 2019 NITI Aayog report, the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) stated that the contribution of groundwater is nearly 62% in irrigation, 85% in rural water supply and 45% in urban water supply.Yet this invisible lifeline is being drawn down faster than it can be replenished. As per the Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment 2025, India’s total annual groundwater recharge stands at 448.52 billion cubic metres (bcm).After accounting for natural discharge, the annual extractable resource is estimated at 407.75 bcm. Current extraction has reached 247.22 bcm, pushing the national stage of groundwater extraction to about 60.6%.While the national average may suggest moderate stress, the reality on the ground is far more uneven.Out of the total 6,762 assessment units, around 25% have been categorised as Overexploited, Critical, or Semi-Critical. These are areas where extraction is approaching or exceeding natural recharge, a warning sign that aquifers are under severe stress.States with the highest proportion of over-exploited and critical units include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. In Punjab, groundwater extraction stands at over 156% of annual recharge. Rajasthan follows closely at 147%, while Delhi’s extraction level exceeds 90%, placing it in the critical category.Urban centres are not immune.Chennai already experienced ‘day zero’ in June 2019, when all four major reservoirs of the big city reservoirs ran dry. People had to line up for hours to wait for a small allocation of water brought in by trucks from other areas.A BBC report, citing UN projections, ranked Bengaluru second after Brazil’s São Paulo, among 11 global cities at risk of running out of drinking water. As water levels drop and summer temperatures rise, cities are imposing restrictions.Lakhs of residents across the 'city of dreams,' Mumbai are too grappling with acute water scarcity. In Bengaluru, authorities have banned the use of potable water for non-essential activities such as washing cars and watering gardens. Yet questions remain over whether fines and regulations alone can avert a full-blown crisis.In rural areas, the crisis manifests differently, in longer walks for water, abandoned wells and failed crops.Experts point to multiple, interconnected causes:India is the largest user of groundwater in the world, accounting for over 25% of global groundwater extraction. The consequences are severe:Groundwater extraction in India is assessed using data from the Minor Irrigation Census and sample surveys conducted by State Ground Water Departments. According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, the country’s total annual groundwater extraction is estimated at 247.22 billion cubic metres (bcm).The agriculture sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 87% of total extraction, or 215.10 bcm. Domestic use contributes 11% (27.89 bcm), while industrial use accounts for the remaining 2% (4.23 bcm).Water-intensive cropping patterns, such as paddy cultivation in Punjab and Haryana, and it continues to strain aquifers, even in regions where rainfall is relatively adequate. As India’s population grows and incomes rise, food demand is expected to surge.According to the NITI report, India’s population is expected to increase to 1.66 billion by 2050. At the same time, per capita income is estimated to increase by 5.5% per annum. With increasing population and purchasing power, the annual food requirement in the country will exceed 250 million tons by 2050. The total demand for grains will increase to 375 million tons including grain for feeding livestock by 2050.”“This will increase the demand for food. The surge in demand for these water-intensive crops will, ceteris paribus, multiply our current agricultural consumption of water,” it added.Despite a national average that masks local crises, groundwater stress is highly concentrated. More than 25% of administrative units fall under over-exploited, critical or semi-critical categories in nine states and UTs: Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Puducherry.These regions face the highest risk of aquifer depletion, underscoring the urgent need for targeted groundwater management, crop diversification and demand-side interventions.Rainfall remains the primary source of groundwater recharge in India, but its distribution varies widely across regions and seasons. Most of the country receives rainfall during the southwest monsoon, while long dry spells dominate the rest of the year.Groundwater levels typically fall before the monsoon and recover partially during and after it. However, CGWB data shows that in 2024, more than 57% of monitored wells recorded a fall in water levels compared to the previous year, with significant declines observed in states such as Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.Geology further complicates the picture.According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, Karnataka’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 19.27 bcm, while extractable resources stand at 17.41 bcm. While recharge and extractable resources have increased marginally from 2024, extraction has also risen slightly. Overall, the state has seen a modest improvement, with extraction levels dropping from 68.44% in 2024 to 66.49% in 2025.Central Maharashtra, a drought-prone region receiving only 400–700 mm of rainfall annually, remains heavily dependent on groundwater. The state’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 33.89 bcm, with extractable resources of 31.99 bcm. Extraction stands at 16.57 bcm, translating to a stage of extraction of 51.79% — a slight improvement from 2024.Punjab remains among the most over-exploited states. Its annual groundwater extraction (26.27 bcm) far exceeds its extractable resource (16.8 bcm), pushing the stage of groundwater extraction to 156.36%.Although extraction has marginally declined from 2024, the state continues to draw far more water than it replenishes, largely due to water-intensive agriculture.Rajasthan’s groundwater situation is similarly alarming. With an annual extraction of 17.10 bcm against extractable resources of 11.62 bcm, the stage of extraction stands at 147.11%. Despite slight improvements in recharge, over-extraction remains entrenched.Delhi’s groundwater extraction stands at 92.10%, placing it in the critical category. While extraction has reduced slightly since 2024, the city remains heavily dependent on groundwater to meet domestic demand.address India’s growing water crisis, the government has rolled out a series of initiatives aimed at conservation, recharge, and equitable access to water. One of the key programmes is the Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), launched in 2019 as a nationwide movement to promote water conservation, groundwater recharge and rainwater harvesting.Another major intervention is the Atal Bhujal Yojana, which emphasises sustainable groundwater management through community participation, improved recharge and regulated extraction.In urban areas, the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0 supports rainwater harvesting through stormwater drainage systems and promotes groundwater recharge via aquifer management plans.The Centre has also launched the Amrit Sarovar initiative, under which 50,000 water bodies, each roughly one acre in size, are being developed across the country to enhance local water storage and recharge.To improve transparency and monitoring, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has developed a GIS-based public platform called the India Groundwater Resource Estimation System (IN-GRES). The portal visualises groundwater recharge, extraction, rainfall and categorisation at the level of individual assessment units, allowing comparisons with previous years.Yet, even as policies and programmes expand on paper, a parallel and troubling reality persists.India’s water crisis is not just about scarcity, but governance. Groundwater ownership laws dating back to the Easement Act of 1882 allow landowners to extract water beneath their land with few restrictions.Fragmented water management, weak enforcement and limited public awareness have allowed overuse to continue unchecked.While government initiatives, from the Jal Shakti Abhiyan and Atal Bhujal Yojana to large-scale rainwater harvesting and aquifer mapping programmes, aim to reverse the trend, experts may warn that without behavioural change and strict regulation, these measures may not be enough.Water budgeting, which treats water like a financial account, balancing availability against demand is also increasingly being seen as a crucial tool to identify stressed regions before they reach breaking point.Tankers extract water from over-exploited aquifers, frequently without regulation or quality checks, accelerating depletion while raising concerns over contamination.For now, the scenes of tankers, queues and dried wells serve as a warning. India may not be out of water yet, but in many places, it is running out of time. This underground trade, operating largely unchecked risks pushing India towards a long-term groundwater collapse tomorrow.","NITI Aayog has warned that 21 major Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai, face the risk of depleting their groundwater reserves. The most vulnerable regions are concentrated in three broad zones: Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126059201,imgsize-112698,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The India Meteorological Department has issued a red alert for the next 24 hours, warning of dense to very dense fog across large parts of north India, even as air quality in the national capital and surrounding regions remained in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ category on Friday.According to the IMD, very dense fog is likely to prevail over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with Uttar Pradesh also expected to witness a very cold day. Dense to extremely dense fog has been forecast across Punjab, Uttarakhand and Bihar on December 19 and 20, and over Uttar Pradesh and Haryana during the early morning hours. The weather agency said fog conditions are likely to persist for the next two to three days, raising concerns over reduced visibility, travel delays and road safety.Airport authorities said flight operations were impacted through the day, with 79 departures cancelled, including two international flights, and 73 arrivals cancelled, including two international services. Passengers have been advised to check with their respective airlines for the latest updates before heading to the airport.In Delhi, hazardous air conditions continued, with thick smog blanketing several areas, including Anand Vihar.The Commission for Air Quality Management activated all measures under GRAP Stage IV across Delhi-NCR to curb rising pollution levels.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed the Air Quality Index at 442 in Ghazipur, 409 in ITO and 447 in Palam, placing these areas in the ‘severe’ category. The city’s overall AQI stood at 330 at 7.47 am, while earlier readings showed levels as high as 358 during the morning hours. At around 8 am, Delhi’s overall AQI was recorded at 387, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category.Authorities advised residents, particularly children, the elderly and people with respiratory ailments, to limit outdoor exposure as pollution continued to pose serious health risks.Dense fog also disrupted aviation operations at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, with flights being operated under CAT III conditions, leading to multiple delays. Delhi International Airport said low visibility was affecting flight schedules.“Dense fog is impacting flight schedules, and operations are currently under CAT III conditions. Our on-ground teams are working in close coordination with all stakeholders to assist passengers and provide necessary support across all terminals. For real-time flight updates, please reach out to your respective airlines.

NEW DELHI: The string of landmark judgments on gender equality could not help Shyla Joseph get an equitable 1/9th share of the property of her father N S Sreedharan, who had nine children but in his will disinherited her for marrying outside the community.A Supreme Court bench of Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and K Vinod Chandran reversed the concurrent findings of the HC and the trial court which had doubted the will and allowed equitable partition of Sreedharan's property among the nine children, including Shyla.Writing the judgment, Justice Chandran said, ""There can be no interference to the will which stands proved unequivocally. The judgment and decree of the high court and that of the trial court stands set aside. The plaintiff (Shyla) is found to have no claim over the properties of her father, which by a will have been bequeathed to the other siblings of the plaintiff.""Once the SC doubted the claim, senior advocate P B Krishnan, appearing for Shyla, requested the bench that her entitlement at best was just 1/9th share of her father's assets which is a negligible portion of the properties.The bench said the question of equality does not arise in a case relating to the wish of a man about division and inheritance of his properties.It said, ""We are not on equity, and the wish of the testator assumes pre-eminence. The last will and testament of the testator cannot be digressed from or frustrated."" While allowing the appeal of her siblings, the bench ordered dismissal of the suit she had filed for equitable partition of her father's properties.It said the rule of prudence cannot apply to the contents of a will, which is the wish of the individual who has absolute discretion to divide his properties. If all siblings had been divested of their inheritance through a will, then the rule of prudence could have been applied by the courts, the bench said.Referring to the reason for which Sreedharan had disinherited Shyla, the SC said, ""There is a reason stated for such exclusion, the acceptability of which to our minds, is not what the rule of prudence dictates. We cannot put the testator in our shoes... We cannot substitute our opinions in place of that of the testator; his desire prompted by his own justifications.""",Shyla Joseph was disinherited by her father N S Sreedharan for marrying outside the community.

The high court order came on petitions by owners of private forest lodges/resorts which had challenged the findings of the expert committee headed by former judge K Venkataraman.The committee was set up by the SC after the district collector of Nilgiris had informed the apex court that there was a total of over 800 constructions, including 39 resorts and 390 houses, inside Sigur elephant corridor.The authorities sent demolition notices to 35 resorts last year.Senior advocates Salman Khurshid and Shoeb Alam argued that owners of these resorts/forest lodges had bought the properties much before the elephant corridors had been notified and that they should be allowed to continue with their eco-friendly business with a rider that they must not expand their business ventures.The bench said, ""The finding of the committee is clear - all of you are there for commercial purposes and on the elephant corridor. This definitely interferes with elephant movement. If at any time there is any doubt where the benefit should go, it must go to these silent victims (elephants and wild animals) of commercial development.""

Green funds not charity but constitutional obligation : SC



NEW DELHI: In an important decision to nudge the corporate sector to play an active role to protect the environment, Supreme Court on Friday brought the issues of ecology and environment within corporate social responsibility and passed a slew of directions to protect the Great Indian Bustard, which is on the verge of extinction and faces threat from operation of non-renewable power generators in Rajasthan and Gujarat.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Atul S Chandurkar asked the non-renewable power generators operating in priority and non-priority areas in Rajasthan and Gujarat to remember they share the environment with the GIB and must undertake their activities as if they are guests in its abode.Elaborating on the role of the private sector in the issue of environment, the bench said the corporate definition of social responsibility must inherently include environmental responsibility. “Companies cannot assert to be socially responsible while ignoring equal claims of the environment and other beings of the ecosystem. The Constitution, under Article 51A(g), imposes a fundamental duty on every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment. ... A corporation, as a legal person and a key organ of society, shares this fundamental duty. CSR funds are the tangible expression of this duty. Consequently, allocating funds for the protection of environment is not a voluntary act of charity but a fulfilment of a constitutional obligation,” Justice Narasimha, who penned the judgment for the bench, said.SC said CSR provision codifies the principle that corporate profit is not solely the private property of shareholders, but is partly owed to society that enables its generation. The bench accepted the recommendation of a court-appointed committee for preservation of GIB despite opposition from power generators. It approved revised priority conservation areas of 14,013 sq km in Rajasthan and 740 sq km in Gujarat. It also approved panel recommendation on blanket ban on the installation of solar projects over 2MW capacity or the laying of overhead transmission lines. The court said survival of GIB is a shared cultural responsibility, as the bird represents not just a species but the unique natural heritage and resilience of the arid landscapes.",The Great Indian Bustard is on the verge of extinction and faces threat from non-renewable power generators in Rajasthan and Gujarat.

The court said that it maybe a reflection of Indian society where men often try to dominate and take charge of the finances but cannot be a basis to initiate criminal proceedings.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said courts have to be extremely careful in dealing with matrimonial complaints and must take pragmatic realities into consideration while dealing with such cases as many of them are because of daily wear and tear of marriage which can in no way, be categorised as cruelty.Allowing the plea of husband for quashing of criminal case which was initiated after various allegations were made against him including that he was sending money to his parents, asking her to maintain account of daily expenses, constantly taunting her about afterbirth weight etc, the bench said that none of them amounted to cruelty and quashed the case.""The act of the accused of sending money back to his family cannot be misconstrued in a way that leads to a criminal prosecution.The allegation that accused forced complainant (wife) to maintain an Excel sheet of all the expenses, even if taken on the face value, cannot come under the definition of cruelty. The monetary and financial dominance of the accused, as alleged by her, cannot qualify as an instance of cruelty, especially in the absence of any tangible mental or physical harm caused. The said situation is a mirror reflection of the Indian society where men of the households often try to dominate and take charge of the finances of the women but criminal litigation cannot become a gateway or a tool to settle scores and pursue personal vendettas,"" the bench said.""Furthermore, other allegations of complainant such as lack of care on part of the husband during pregnancy and postpartum and constant taunts about her afterbirth weight, if accepted prima facie, at best reflect poorly upon the character of the accused but the same cannot amount to cruelty so as to make him suffer through the process of litigation,"" the bench said.SC accepted the plea of advocate Prabhjit Jauhar, who appeared for husband, alleging that it was misuse of law and no case was made out against his client. It said a bare perusal of FIR shows the allegations made by her are vague and omnibus and she did not provide any evidence or specific details of any particular instance of harassment.""Courts have to be careful and cautious in dealing with complaints and must take pragmatic realities into consideration while dealing with matrimonial cases where allegations have to be scrutinised with greater care and circumspection in order to prevent miscarriage of justice and abuse of law.

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties staged a 12-hour overnight dharna in the Parliament complex on Thursday night to protest the passage of the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, or VB-G RAM G Bill, which replaces the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.The protest came hours after Parliament cleared the Bill amid noisy scenes and walkouts. The Rajya Sabha passed the legislation post midnight by a voice vote, following its approval by the Lok Sabha earlier in the day, even as opposition members demanded its withdrawal and sought its referral to a parliamentary panel.Opposition MPs accused the government of rushing the Bill through without adequate debate and of scrapping a flagship rural employment scheme that, they said, supported crores of poor households. Several members walked out of the Upper House, raised slogans against the government and tore copies of the Bill, prompting repeated warnings from the Chair.Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha deputy leader Sagarika Ghose alleged that the government had “bulldozed” the legislation. “This is an insult to India's poor, it is an insult to Mahatma Gandhi, it is an insult to Rabindranath Tagore. With just five hours' notice, this bill was given to us.We were not allowed a proper debate,” she said.“Our demand was such an important bill should be sent to the Select Committee and let the opposition parties examine it, let the opposition parties discuss it, let all stakeholders discuss it, but no, in a display of tyranny, in a murder of democracy,” Ghose said, announcing the overnight protest. “We are now going to sit on a 12-hour dharna, 12-hour dharna against the manner in which the Modi government has brought this black law against the people of India, against the poor of India, against the rural poor of India. ”Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala described the development as a “sad day for the country's labour force” and alleged that the government had hit the livelihoods of millions. “This is perhaps the saddest day for the labourers of India. BJP government has attacked the livelihood of 12 crore people by repealing the MGNREGA . They have proved that the Modi government is anti-farmer and anti-poor,” he said.Congress leader Mukul Wasnik said the original law was framed after extensive consultations. “When MGNREGA was drafted, consultations were held for 14 months. It was passed by Parliament with consensus. The scheme would put an extreme burden on states. As a result, this scheme will collapse,” he said.DMK leader Tiruchi Siva accused the government of erasing Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy. “Likewise they have removed Mahatma Gandhi's name himself. Without Gandhi there is no freedom, that is the total belief in this country. Even in Britain parliament we are having Gandhi statue, but here in Indian parliament his statue is hidden somewhere, and now the scheme which bore his name, his name has also been removed,” he said.Defending the legislation, Rural Development Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the new law was necessary to address shortcomings in the old scheme and to boost rural development. “This Bill is very necessary as it will help provide employment opportunities, help development of rural India and take the country forward,” he said while replying to the debate in the Rajya Sabha.Chouhan accused the Congress of misusing Mahatma Gandhi’s name for political gains and of disrupting parliamentary proceedings. “I heard the opposition with patience all these hours and expected the opposition to hear my response to the discussion. Making their points, making allegations and running away is like murdering the dreams and ideals of Mahatma Gandhi,” he said.“The entire nation is watching their 'goondagardi' and the opposition is committing the sin of insulting democracy. House 'dadagiri se nahin chalega',” the minister added.He also cited funding figures to defend the government’s record, claiming that while the previous UPA government released Rs 2.13 lakh crore for MGNREGA, the NDA had released nearly Rs 8.53 lakh crore. The opposition, however, maintained that the passage of the Bill without detailed scrutiny set a dangerous precedent and said it would take its protest against the law to the streets across the country.",Opposition parties staged a 12-hour overnight dharna to protest the passage of the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday launched a sharp attack on the Modi government a day after Parliament cleared the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill, calling it “anti-state and anti-village by design” and accusing the Centre of dismantling the core of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( MGNREGA ).In a post on X, the LoP in Lok Sabha said the government had “demolished twenty years of MGNREGA in one day”, arguing that the new law was being falsely presented as a reform. “VB–G RAM G isn’t a ‘revamp’ of MGNREGA. It demolishes the rights-based, demand-driven guarantee and turns it into a rationed scheme which is controlled from Delhi,” he wrote, adding that “it is anti-state and anti-village by design”.Rahul said MGNREGA had fundamentally shifted power in rural India by giving workers genuine bargaining leverage. “With real options, exploitation and distress migration fell, wages increased, working conditions improved, all while building and reviving rural infrastructure,” he said.According to him, that leverage was precisely what the government now wanted to weaken. “By capping work and building in more ways to deny it, VB–G RAM G weakens the one instrument which the rural poor had.”Pointing to the Covid-19 crisis, Gandhi said the original scheme proved its value when livelihoods collapsed.“When the economy shut down and livelihoods collapsed, it kept crores from falling into hunger and debt,” he wrote, noting that women had consistently accounted for more than half of all person-days under MGNREGA. He warned that rationing employment would hit the most vulnerable first. “When you ration a jobs programme, it is women, Dalits, Adivasis, landless workers and the poorest OBC communities who get pushed out first. ”The Parliament on Thursday passed the Bill amid noisy protests from the Opposition. While the government insists the legislation will strengthen rural livelihoods, opposition parties, including the Trinamool Congress, have staged demonstrations, accusing the Centre of pushing the Bill through without consensus.","The Parliament on Thursday passed the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill.

Paul Heyman’s estimated net worth in 2025 and income sources

Marla Heyman’s financial profile and the combined net worth question

Paul Heyman has been one of wrestling's most influential people, shaping eras in ECW and WWE. With his consistent presence both on-screen and behind the scenes on WWE programming, interest in his finances has been rekindled in 2025, raising questions regarding his own wealth and whether or not he even has a combined net worth with his previous wife, Marla Heyman.While entertainment finance outlets regularly estimate Paul Heyman’s earnings, his wife, Marla Heyman, has been able to keep her life quite private, and there are no financial records available to review. Therefore, any conversation about a joint net worth is based on confirmed reporting for Paul Heyman, and the lack of available information is not representative of Marla.According to entertainment finance trackers like Celebrity Net Worth, Paul Heyman's net worth is around $10 million. While not officially verified by WWE or Heyman himself, these numbers are frequently referenced in wrestling media circles.That fortune he has accumulated is largely down to his deep ties to WWE. Wrestling observers associated outlets have covered the subject of Heyman's WWE salary, which was recently reported to be as high as about $2 million per year based on both his onscreen character as well as his offscreen creative prowess.His association with The Bloodline storyline over the past few years has increased this company's cash cow status.Part of Paul Heyman's legacy includes his earlier years with Extreme Championship Wrestling, but not in a good way. Quotes about ECW from court records and wrestling business historians have reported that ECW had declared bankruptcy in the early 00s while also holding a large sum of debt. Though WWE would subsequently purchase ECW's video library and intellectual property and later reinstate the brand's historical significance, this did not equate to a massive paycheck for Heyman personally at the time.Marla Heyman is still not prominent in public financial disclosures. Biographical databases and celebrity background websites have never made clear what her career entailed and what her sources of income were, so assigning an accurate net worth is not possible.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Therefore, any assertions of Paul and Marla Heyman's net worth in 2025 should be taken with a grain of salt. Given the reporting available, the only reasonable conclusion is that Paul Heyman has an independently estimated net worth of around $10 million in addition to whatever Marla Heyman has.Also Read: Paul Heyman reveals his new WWE nickname","According to entertainment finance trackers like Celebrity Net Worth, Paul Heyman's net worth is around $10 million.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta. However, Huang told Rogan that scale hasn't changed his mindset: ""The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""","Jensen Huang, CEO of $4.4 trillion AI chip giant Nvidia, lives in constant fear of bankruptcy.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Oracle takes control of data security and algorithm oversight

Deal resolves years of regulatory uncertainty over Chinese ownership





TikTok has secured a rescue deal with American investors, signing binding agreements to create a new US entity that keeps the wildly popular app operational while satisfying national security requirements. The transaction, set to close January 22, comes just two days before a federal ban would have forced TikTok offline for its 170 million American users.CEO Shou Zi Chew announced the agreement in an internal memo, confirming partnerships with Oracle Corporation, investment firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi's state fund MGX. Together, these managing investors will control 45% of the new joint venture, with another 5% going to unnamed new investors. Existing ByteDance investor affiliates hold 30.1%, while ByteDance itself retains just 19.9%.The restructured TikTok will operate under a seven-member, majority-American board with final authority over content moderation and policy decisions within the United States. Oracle assumes responsibility as the ""trusted security partner,"" storing all sensitive US user data in American cloud servers while auditing compliance with national security terms.Critically, TikTok's prized recommendation algorithm—the engine behind its addictive content feed—will be retrained exclusively on US user data to eliminate potential foreign manipulation. Oracle will oversee this process and validate ongoing compliance, though industry observers note questions remain about whether the algorithm has been fully transferred or merely licensed from ByteDance.The agreement caps more than six years of questions about TikTok's future in the United States, driven by concerns that Beijing could access Americans' sensitive data or use the platform to spread propaganda. Congress passed legislation in April 2024 requiring ByteDance to divest its US operations or face prohibition, a law the Supreme Court upheld in January.The deal marks a significant expansion for Oracle beyond traditional enterprise software, positioning the company at the center of one of the world's most influential social media platforms.","TikTok has struck a deal with American investors, including Oracle and Silver Lake, to form a new US entity.

Why Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis thinks the AI startup valuation model is breaking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-thinks-the-ai-startup-valuation-model-is-breaking/articleshow/126055448.cms,"Big tech vs early-stage hype

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"Tamil Nadu voter rolls revised: 97.37 lakh names deleted, political parties raise concerns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-voter-rolls-revised-97-37-lakh-names-deleted-political-parties-raise-concerns/articleshow/126087828.cms,"By: Anantha RamanathanCHENNAI: The special intensive revision (SIR) has removed 97.37 lakh voters from Tamil Nadu’s draft electoral rolls bringing down the total electorate from 6.41 crore to 5.43 crore. The deletions account for 15.9% of the total voters. Now, eligible voters and political parties can file claims or objections for inclusion from Dec 19 to Jan 18.Urban constituencies had more deletions with Chennai district recording 14.25 lakh deletions, accounting for 35% of its electorate. Chennai was followed by neighbouring Chengalpet and Tiruvallur districts where seven lakh (25%) and six lakh votes (17%) were removed, respectively.The trend was seen in other urban centres such as Coimbatore (15%), Madurai (13%) and Trichy (14%) too, while Tirupur with a high population of guest workers had 23% of its voters removed. Rural Ariyalur recorded the lowest number of deletions accounting for only 4% of its electorate. DMK has said it would take steps to include genuine voters who have been left out in the list.Chief electoral officer of Tamil Nadu, Archana Patnaik, said 26.94 lakh electors were identified as deceased and removed from the rolls.However, the largest share of deletions fell under the “permanently shifted or absentee” category, which accounted for 66.44 lakh voters — about 10.36% of the state’s electorate. As many as 3.98 lakh voters were deleted for having enrolled in more than one constituency.Election officials said Chennai and three neighbouring districts — Tiruvallur, Chengalpet and Kancheepuram — together accounted for 31% of the total deletions in the state.At the assembly segment level, Sholinganallur recorded the highest number of deletions, with 2.18 lakh voters removed, while Jayankondam reported the lowest with 11,382 names struck off the rolls. Patnaik said around 12,000 voters were “unwilling to return enumeration forms” during the exercise. Election Commission received more than 5.19 lakh Form-6 applications seeking inclusion of names, she said.The SIR exercise began in the state on Nov 4 and was conducted amid severe criticism from political parties particularly DMK and its allies. Though ECI extended the deadline for submission of enumeration forms to Dec 14, the election authorities said they had achieved 100% digitisation of enumeration forms on Dec 11.As per ECI, 5.43 crore (84.81%) of the distributed enumeration forms were collected from electors during the exercise. The process was marked by complaints of extreme work pressure from booth level officers (BLOs).“Not a single voter, as per procedure, can be dropped from the electoral roll without valid reasons,” Patnaik said. She added that lists of electors reported as deceased, permanently shifted, migrated, untraceable, or whose forms were not received had been shared with booth-level agents (BLA-2) for verification. The lists would also be displayed at the offices of block development officers (BDOs), village panchayats and urban local body officials.Patnaik said the booth-level voters’ lists had also been shared with recognised political parties and made available on http://www.elections.tn.gov.in/ . Eligible voters and political parties can file claims or objections for inclusion during the claims and objections period from Dec 19 to Jan 18. “We have engaged 234 electoral registration officers (ERO) and 1,776 assistant EROs to scrutinise such cases from today (Dec 19),” she said.","The special intensive revision (SIR) has removed 97.37 lakh voters from Tamil Nadu’s draft electoral rolls bringing down the total electorate from 6.41 crore to 5.43 crore.
