When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained","For a Rs 1 crore loan at current interest rate of 8.75%, the EMI will come down from Rs 84,450 to Rs 82,630. For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315. The cut will take effect from April 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118010397,imgsize-101606,width-400,resizemode-4/118010397.jpg"
'Don't erase data': Supreme Court to poll body on EVM verification plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-erase-data-supreme-court-to-poll-body-on-evm-verification-plea/articleshow/118149975.cms,"File photo

Poll Should Paper Trails Be Used More In Elections? No, EVMs Are Enough Yes, Adds Accountability

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought the Election Commission of India 's (ECI) response to the pleas seeking verification of the burnt memory and symbol loading units in Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in compliance with its judgement.A special bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta asked the poll panel to avoid erasing or reloading data during the verification process.The pleas sought a direction to the ECI to check and verify burnt memory/micro-controllers and the symbol loading unit (SLU) of the EVMs.The SC bench asked the poll panel to file its response within 15 days and explain the procedure adopted and posted the matter in the week commencing March 3.NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), in a new plea, had argued that the Election Commission’s standard operating procedure for EVM verification did not align with the court's ruling in the EVM-VVPAT case .In its April 26, 2024, judgment, the top court had dismissed the demand for a return to paper ballots, affirming that EVMs were secure and had helped eliminate booth capturing and fraudulent voting.However, the ruling provided an opportunity for candidates who finished second or third in the elections to request verification of micro-controller chips in 5 per cent of EVMs per assembly constituency.This verification could be sought through a written request and by paying a prescribed fee to the Election Commission of India.On Tuesday, the bench sought clarification from the Election Commission regarding the erasure and reloading of polling data.It emphasized that the court’s ruling did not require such measures but only called for verification of EVMs by an engineer from the manufacturing company.""What we intended was that, if after the polls somebody asks, the engineer should come and certify that, according to him, in their presence, there is no tampering in any of the burnt memory or microchips. That's all. Why do you erase the data?"" asked the CJI, according to news agency PTI.""We didn't want such a detailed process that you reload something. Do not erase the data, do not reload the data - all you need to do is have someone verify and examine,"" he further said.The top court also refused to entertain a fresh petition from former Haryana minister and five-time MLA Karan Singh Dalal, expressing displeasure over the concealment of details regarding a similar plea that had been withdrawn earlier.The court also directed that, starting May 1, 2024, the symbol loading units be sealed in a container and stored alongside EVMs in a strongroom for at least 45 days after the election results were declared.The bench also raised concerns over the cost of verification set by the EC after being informed that Rs 40,000 was charged for verifying one EVM.""Reduce the cost of 40,000 - that's too high,"" it said.Seeking the poll panel's response, the bench recorded its assurance that no modification or correction of EVM data would take place during the verification process.""Mr Singh (ECI counsel) states that they will clarify the position by filing a short affidavit explaining the procedure adopted by them. He also states they won't be doing any modification/correction of the data,"" it said.","The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought the Election Commission of India's response to the pleas seeking verification of the burnt memory and symbol loading units in Electronic Voting Machines.

PM Modi addresses the Plenary Session during the AI Action Summit in Paris, France

US Vice President JD Vance gave a shoutout to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s views on the role of artificial intelligence in economic growth at the AI Action Summit in Paris. The summit was co-chaired by French President Emmanuel Macron and PM Modi.Vance, representing the Trump administration, reiterated a commitment to a "" pro-worker growth path "" for AI, ensuring it serves as a tool for job creation in the United States. Acknowledging PM Modi’s stance that AI won't take away jobs, Vance said, “I appreciate Prime Minister Modi’s point. AI, I believe, will facilitate and make people more productive. It is not going to replace human beings. It will never replace human beings.”Further criticizing concerns within the AI industry about mass job displacement, Vance argued that such fears overlook AI’s true potential. “Too many leaders in the AI industry, when they talk about this fear of replacing workers, miss the point. AI, we believe, is going to make us more productive, more prosperous, and more free,” he asserted.Meanwhile, PM Modi, in his address at the summit before Vance, called for an unbiased and democratic artificial intelligence. ""We must develop open-source systems that enhance trust and transparency. We must build quality data sets free from biases,"" he said. Further talking about concerns around loss of jobs, PM added, ""Loss of jobs is AI’s most feared disruption. But, history has shown that work does not disappear due to technology. Its nature changes and new types of jobs are created. We need to invest in skilling and re-skilling our people for an AI-driven future.""Read more: What PM Modi said on 'job loss' fear due to artificial intelligence Prime Minister Modi arrived in France for a two-day visit, where he was welcomed by President Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée Palace for a formal dinner ahead of the AI Summit.

Delhi University on Tuesday argued in the Delhi High Court that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BA degree did not fall under ""public interest"" under the Right to Information Act while defending its refusal to share the document.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing DU, told Justice Sachin Datta that something of ""interest to the public"" was not the same as ""public interest"".""Mere curiosity that 'I want to know about it what is your objection' cannot be an argument. The public may get interested in something but it may not be public interest..Is there any public interest in this matter?

NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday accused the Trinamool Congress (TNC) administration of fostering systematic corruption and weakening governmental institutions.During her reply to the debate on Union Budget 2025-26 in the Lok Sabha she said, ""It is ironical that Trinamool Congress, a party which prides itself on being rooted in the grassroots (Trinamool), now symbolises harassment and denial of rights to the people living at the grassroots.""""Trinamool Congress has institutionalised corruption, gutted institutions and Trinamool has become a by-word for exploitation,"" she added.The finance minister also alleged issues in the implementation of PM Awas Yojana and MNREGA execution. ""Like every other state, PM Awas Yojana is being implemented since 2016-17. The government has released Rs 25,798 crore towards central share. However, complaints of irregularities in PM Awas Yojana (Gramin) including selection of ineligible households were received,"" she said. Additionally, ""There have been similar complaints about MNREGA and the Ministry of Rural Development is engaging with West Bengal for satisfactory reply,"" she said. As many as 25 lakh fake job cards in MNREGA, funds meant for people at the grassroots have been looted by TMC cadres,"" claimed Sitharaman.Then, discussing West Bengal's economic performance, the FM stated that capital formation had reduced from 6.7 per cent in 2010 to 2.9 per cent in recent times. The state's contribution to industrial production diminished from 24 per cent in 1947 to 3.5 per cent in 2021, with below-average per capita income growth spanning two decades.Further praising her government for working of the development of Bengal, the finance minister referred to several Union government initiatives in West Bengal, including the recently opened AIIMS Kalyani in February 2024. She noted the significant railway infrastructure funding of Rs 13,955 crore and mentioned the country's first Gati Shakti Cargo Terminal , which began operations in the Asansol Division.She further stated that since 2014, the Modi government has developed 38 km of metro lines, investing Rs 23,050 crore, alongside constructing more than 2,309 km of National Highway across West Bengal.Additionally, she announced that in August 2024, the CCEA gave its approval for establishing a New Civil Enclave at Bagdogra Airport in Siliguri, with a projected expenditure of Rs 1,549 crore.Apart from her jab at TMC, Sitharaman also talked about the state of India's economy. She highlighted that India is experiencing a ""speedy rebound"" from slower GDP growth, with the economy projected to grow at 6.4% in the current fiscal year.Sitharaman also emphasized inflation management, noting that retail inflation remains within the 2-6% tolerance band, and food inflation appears to be moderating. She also addressed the concerns around depreciation of the Indian rupee, which has fallen 3.3% against the US dollar, highlighting that this decline is less than some Asian peers.Additionally, regarding GST, Sitharaman dispelled concerns about rate hikes, asserting that no items have seen an increase since GST's implementation. She explained that GST rates have been reduced, with the average rate falling from 15.8% to 11.3%. She urged state finance ministers to engage with the public and emphasized the GST Council's role in recommending rates.","Nirmala Sitharaman accused Trinamool Congress (TNC) administration of fostering systematic corruption and weakening governmental institutions.

Examining various amendments made in the Finance Act, the bench said, ""We find that at each stage, the amendments made to the Finance Act, 1994, in order to impose service tax on the sole distributor/purchaser of the lottery tickets (respondents-assessees herein) have been unsuccessful.

Donald Trump pauses US foreign bribery law; relief for Adani Group?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/donald-trump-pauses-us-foreign-bribery-law-relief-for-adani-group/articleshow/118158253.cms,"Adani stocks took $55 billion hit after indictment

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing enforcement of a 48-year-old law, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), that prohibits US companies from bribing foreign government officials to get or retain business contracts.The move could potentially bring relief to Adani Group, which was indicted by the department of justice (DoJ) and US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) last year. The order signed by Trump directs attorney general Pam Bondi to pause FCPA actions until revised FCPA enforcement guidance is issued, which ""promotes American competitiveness and efficient use of federal law enforcement resources"".The order said past and existing FCPA actions will be reviewed and future FCPA actions must be approved by the attorney general. TNNThe order addresses a long-held grievance of the American business that the anti-bribery law leaves them hamstrung vis-a-vis their competitors who don't have to contend with similar restraint.The action taken by the US DoJ against billionaire Gautam Adani and his nephew, former executives of Canadian pension fund CDPQ and Azure Power for their alleged role in a $265 million bribery case to secure solar power supply contracts in India, was termed by some quarters as arising out of the FCPA.The case stoked a massive controversy and led to a significant slide in the group company shares, which have since recovered sharply. The Adani Group had said since the indictment, it had suffered a loss of nearly $55 billion in its market capitalisation across its 11 listed companies. However, in late November, Adani Green Energy Ltd had informed the stock exchanges and clarified that Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain had not been charged with any violation of the FCPA on the counts mentioned in the criminal indictment of the US DoJ or the civil complaint of the US-SEC.In a significant coincidence, a group of six US Congressmen have written to newly appointed attorney general Bondi, calling for a review of what they said were ""some questionable decisions"" made by the DoJ under the Biden administration, and cited the case against Adani group.""One such decision involves the questionable pursuit of a case against the Adani group, an Indian company whose executives are situated in India. The case rests on the allegation that preparations were made by members of this company in India to bribe Indian officials, also exclusively located in India,"" said the letter signed by Lance Gooden, Mat Fallon, Mark Haridopolos, Brandon Gill, William R Timmons and Brian Babin.The letter endorses the grouse of the Adani Group that they were targeted for extraneous considerations and that the DOJ under the Biden administration overplayed its hand. ""Instead of deferring the case to appropriate Indian authorities, the Biden DoJ pushed forward and indicted the company's executives without any real injury to the US interests being present,"" said the February 10 letter to Bondi. The Congressmen said there was no compelling reason to pursue a case in a manner that could complicate relations with an ally like India unless some external factors were at play. They said some of these decisions involved pursuing and abandoning cases, often against America's interest at home and abroad, jeopardising relationships with close allies like India.On Tuesday, the stocks of Adani group companies had a mixed day despite the broader market witnessing strong selling pressure since the start of the session due to weak global cues. After an initial euphoria about news related to the pausing of the FCPA in the US, the rally across the 11 group stocks fizzled out and only two stocks, group flagship Adani Enterprises and Adani Power, closed higher.The FCPA of 1977 was enacted for the purpose of making it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business, according to the DoJ definition. Initially, the US business, reeling under the embarrassment of the Lockheed bribery scam where the American aviation major was accused of bribing the Japanese government for a hefty order, had welcomed the law, saying it would help them with their business. Originally, it applied to only Americans and certain foreign issuers of securities before it was expanded during the Clinton presidency to apply to foreign firms which do business with the US.The admiration turned to the disappointment and complaint that it had tied their hands against competition and tilted the field in latter's favour. Trump had promised to change the law in his first term. His order completes what was an important unfinished business.""It was a Jimmy Carter concept, and it sounds so good, but it's so bad. It hurts the country and many, many deals are unable to be made because nobody wants to do business,"" Trump said, dumping on a recently passed former president whom he disdained, having also blamed him for ceding the Panama Canal to Panama.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing enforcement of a 48-year-old law.

His remarks questioning the PSU's efficiency have stirred a row.Although this isn't the first time the IAF chief has slammed HAL over not adhering to timelines, his remarks questioning the defence PSU's efficiency have stirred controversy. HAL has attributed the delays to sanctions clamped on India after the 1998 nuclear tests. CMD D K Sunil said the PSU would catch up with the timelines set for the project, initiated in 1984, and the additional orders it is anticipating.HAL, which came in for criticism from previous IAF chiefs too, said Tuesday it was confident of ""delivering at least 11 Tejas-Mk1A aircraft to IAF by March-end"". This is part of an 83-aircraft contract. Multiple people associated with the project have hinted that HAL views the aircraft as being the Aeronautical Development Agency's baby. The argument is that the latter designed and developed the fighter while HAL began working only after a push for Make-in-India post-2014.On how the HAL leadership viewed repeated criticism from the air chief, Sunil said, ""I have to put it in context. You know that we (India) faced sanctions after our nuclear test in 1998, so we had to build things from the ground up. A lot of work has gone into it. The delays are not simply attributable to, you know, laziness."" He said technical issues had been resolved. ""The concern of the air chief is understandable as his squadron strength is reducing. We have promised that we will have all these structures ready. And we have conveyed this during multiple meetings at different levels,"" the CMD said.He said HAL was pushing American firm GE to consider an 80% transfer of technology (ToT) deal for the GE-414 engine that will power the upgraded variants of the Tejas, and probably India's fifth-generation aircraft AMCA, which is under development.Sunil said HAL had seen significant growth in its order book, which stands at more than Rs 1.3 lakh crore as of Dec 2024, thanks to several major contracts in the past year, including orders for 12 Su-30MKI aircraft for IAF, 240 AL31FP engines, and multiple helicopter orders for various defence forces.",Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh has said his confidence in defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd continues to erode. His remarks questioning the PSU's efficiency have stirred a row. HAL has attributed the delays to sanctions clamped on India after the 1998 nuclear tests.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118158185,imgsize-997162,width-400,resizemode-4/118158185.jpg"

Modi announced India will host the next AI summit as he welcomed the decision to set up an AI Foundation and endorsed a leaders’ declaration that focused on promoting inclusivity, sustainability, accessibility and ethics in AI uses.While India, Japan, China and Australia were among the 60 odd signatories, the US and UK did not endorse the joint communique again highlighting differences in approach to the technology. US Vice President J D Vance, who led the US delegation, said AI could be strangled by excessive regulation.In his address, the PM called for the global AI partnership to be more inclusive of the Global South and its priorities, concerns and needs.“Governance is also about ensuring access to all, especially in the Global South. It is where the capacities are most lacking - be it compute power, talent, data, or the financial resources,” said the PM, as he spoke about the need to address biases as AI reshapes society, economy and security and even writes the codes for humanity in this century.Modi said AI can help transform millions of lives by improving health, education and agriculture. He soughtpooling together of resources and talent to develop open-source systems that enhance trust and transparency.“We must build quality data sets, free from biases. We must democratise technology and create people-centric applications. We must address concerns related to cyber security, disinformation, and deep fakes. And, we must also ensure that technology is rooted in local ecosystems for it to be effective and useful,” he said.While talking about India’s own development of AI applications for public good, the PM said that the world is at the dawn of the AI age that will shape the course of humanity. “Some people worry about machines becoming superior in intelligence to humans. But, no one holds the key to our collective future and shared destiny other than us humans. That sense of responsibility must guide us,” he said.Looking to allay fears of job losses that AI might cause, the PM said history has shown that work does not disappear due to technology and there’s a need to invest in skilling and re-skilling our people for an AI-driven future.Modi called for democratizing technology and its people-centric applications so that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals becomes a reality, according to a press statement.Highlighting India’s success in building a Digital Public Infrastructure for its 1.4 billion citizens based on open and accessible technology, Modi noted that India, considering its diversity, was building its own Large Language Model for AI. “He underlined that India was ready to share its experience to ensure that the benefits of AI reach everyone,” said the statement.According to Modi, AI models must be efficient and sustainable in size, data needs and resource requirements. “After all, the human brain manages to compose poetry and design space ships using less power than most lightbulbs,” he said.","PM Narendra Modi underlined the positive potential of AI and the unprecedented scale and speed of its development.

En route to India aboard the British ship Morea, he slipped through a porthole, swam ashore and briefly evaded capture before French authorities returned him to the British. His extradition sparked a diplomatic dispute, with France arguing the process violated international law. The controversy led to international legal debates over asylum and extradition, drawing attention to colonial legal frameworks and their influence on political prisoners.Savarkar was sentenced to life imprisonment in Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, enduring harsh punishment but continuing to inspire the independence movement through his writings.

India to cite recent duty cuts in bid to escape Trump tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-cite-recent-duty-cuts-in-bid-to-escape-trump-tariffs/articleshow/118129430.cms,"25% steel tariff won't hit India's shipments to US

NEW DELHI: As President Trump issued fresh threats of 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports into the US (on top of existing metal duties), India is getting ready to unbracket itself from countries he has called ""worst tariff manipulators"", citing its recent duty cuts to point to a reduction in average duties in recent years.On Monday, Trump's economic adviser Kevin Hassett said India has high tariffs that lock out imports, and added that Modi had a ""lot to discuss"" with Trump as they meet later this week.Following Budget announcements on tariff cuts for bikes, including the iconic Harley Davidson, and other products in the run-up to PM Modi's meeting with Trump, officials said they have prepared the ground for the PM to point to Trump that his govt is sensitive to White House's concerns and has undertaken a comprehensive look at tariffs to bring them down to Asean rates. They also pointed out that the reduction was a signal to the world that tariff rates were not high as perceived by some trading partners.The reduction in the Union Budget is estimated to have lowered the average duty by a percentage point to 10.6%. Average tariffs on imports from US have also come down over the years. In fact, for the top 30 imports from the US, including oil, gas, diamonds and airplanes, the levy is going up to 7.5% at the most, officials have said.Officials are also laying store by US' strategic requirement to have good strategic ties with India, that Trump may not breach New Delhi's pain barrier on threshold.Though Modi and Trump have enjoyed a good rapport since the latter's first term, the govt recognises that nothing can be taken for granted while dealing with a US president who sees himself as a transactionalist with an unrivalled capability to get the best deals for the US.While the proposed 25% tariff on steel and aluminium has rocked the world, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on India's shipments to the US. During the last fiscal year, India's export of iron and steel was estimated at $475 million, with iron and steel products adding up to another $2.8 billion. Export of aluminium and articles made of this metal were estimated at just under $950 million in 2023-24. The largest sources of US steel imports are Brazil, Canada and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to govt and American Iron and Steel Institute data.In 2018, the previous Trump administration had imposed 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium, citing national security concerns. These tariffs covered most primary steel products, except stainless steel, and included steel pipes and tubes. The tariffs applied to most countries, triggering a wave of retaliatory measures and escalating tensions in global trade. This had also prompted American auto companies to slash production.Trump had clubbed India, along with China, Brazil and Mexico, as a high-tariff country and threatened action. So far, however, India has not faced any specific action and both sides have spoken about strengthening trade and economic relations. Modi's meeting with the US president is expected to only smoothen the process, given the close bond that the two leaders share.Trump's announcement pushed up gold prices, seen as a safe haven during turbulent times, while the dollar inched higher. While the sensex closed 550 points lower on Monday, global stocks seem to have shrugged off the threat. Global markets have been on the edge, wary of a possible trade war. The prospect of higher tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium in particular is, however, not good news for India as the domestic industry is already complaining of cheap imports flooding the markets. This could get worse if Trump goes ahead with his plan, likely Monday, as China would look at the vast Indian market to cover some of the probable losses in the US.The domestic steel industry has petitioned govt to impose 20-25% safeguard duty on steel to shield domestic players from predatory imports. Small businesses and exporters are, however, wary of these levies and have sought a ""balanced response"" so that Indian consumers do not end up paying more. An analysis by GTRI showed that India's iron and steel imports have grown from $10.4 billion in FY2018, when the US-China trade war began, to $18.6 billion in FY2024.","President Trump issued fresh threats of 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports into the US.

"Ahead of Modi-Trump meet, India backs Chabahar port",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-modi-trump-meet-india-backs-chabahar-port/articleshow/118126924.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the Trump administration threatens to roll back the sanction waiver that allowed India to develop the strategic Chabahar port in Iran, the Indian government Monday strongly backed the port saying it has provided a much-needed alternative route to Afghanistan for its reconstruction and economic development, while boosting trade linkages with Central Asia.The remarks by a senior MEA official follow the US restoration last week of its “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran to deny it all paths to a nuclear weapon and to counter its “malign influence” abroad. It saw US President Donald Trump signing a memorandum that calls upon the Secretary of State to modify or rescind sanction waivers, particularly those that provide Iran “any degree of economic or financial relief, including those related to Iran’s Chabahar port project”. The remarks - at an event to mark the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution of Iran – also came days before PM Narendra Modi’s bilateral meeting with Trump in Washington on Thursday.""Regional connectivity has been an important pillar of India, Iran relations. The development of the Chabahar port in southeastern Iran reflects our joint vision for connectivity for mutual benefits,"" said MEA secretary (east) Jaideep Mazumdar, while describing the signing of the long-term contract for the development of Chabahar port in May last year as a significant milestone in India-Iran ties.The port has proven its strong potential. It has emerged as the connecting point for the region in delivering deliver humanitarian assistance, especially during the Covid pandemic, added the official, while listing the amount of assistance delivered to Afghanistan through the port.India and Iran had in 2015 signed an MoU to facilitate India’s partnership in developing the port. Last year, the 2 sides signed a contract that will have India equipping and operating the Shahid Beheshti terminal of the port over the next 10 years. The port opens up opportunities for India in trade and commerce with Afghanistan and Central Asia, while providing an alternative and reliable access route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan.As the Indian government maintains, the port’s location in Arabian Sea means it won’t be vulnerable to dangers posed by developments in the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz. The previous Trump administration had in 2018 exempted Chabahar from US sanctions , acknowledging its role in facilitating reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.The memorandum also called upon the Secretary of State to modify or rescind existing sanctions waivers and cooperate with the Secretary of Treasury to implement a campaign aimed at driving Iran’s oil exports to zero. India has not been importing crude from Iran for many years now.""Our economic ties are growing in many fields. Last year, Iran and India signed a long-term agreement to run the Chabahar port, known as the ""golden gateway"" to connect nations along the Indian Ocean with Central Asia and the Caucasus. Cooperation through the International North–South Transport Corridor is another key example of the strong partnership between our countries,"" said Iranian ambassador Iraj Elahi, speaking on the occasion.",US threatens to roll back the sanction waiver that allowed India to develop the strategic Chabahar port in Iran. Indian government Monday strongly backed the port saying it has provided a much-needed alternative route to Afghanistan for its reconstruction and economic development. The remarks by a senior MEA official follow the US restoration last week of its “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118126929,imgsize-1217743,width-400,resizemode-4/118126929.jpg"

MLB Rumors - The Mets’ plan to offload their $78 million liability to the Padres,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/mlb-rumors-the-mets-plan-to-offload-their-78-million-liability-to-the-padres/articleshow/118137962.cms,"Starling Marte via Instagram

Are the Mets planning to release Starling Marte to reduce the team's financial crunch?

Why the Mets NEED to Trade Starling Marte RIGHT NOW

The New York Mets might trade Starling Marte for Wandy Peralta

“In other news, the Mets discussed trading Starling Marte to the Royals for righty reliever Hunter Harvey around the time of Winter Meetings, sources told Mets On SI. NYM was willing to pay down a portion of Marte's salary in the deal but it wound up going nowhere.”

The New York Mets created waves in the sports industry after signing the Dominican star Juan Soto for $765 million. The record-breaking contract not only brought the talented fielder to the front page of MLB but also created a huge financial crunch for the Mets.After re-signing Pete Alonso and roping in the list of other athletes in order to improvise the roster for the upcoming season, the Mets’ luxury tax payroll has reached around $324 million. According to the rumors, the monetary burden has diverted attention to Starling Marte .With Spring training just around the corner, the New York Mets are struggling with a monetary challenge. The luxury tax payroll has reached a staggering amount of $324 million, which is the second highest after the Dodgers.According to the rumor mill, the Mets are looking forward to releasing a few prominent faces in order to reduce their financial burden and all the fingers are pointing towards the 36-year-old center fielder Starling Marte. With increasing age, a $78 million salary spanning over four years, and around $20.75 million for the upcoming season, Marte might have become a burden for the Mets.Based on the rumors in the MLB world, this is not the first time the Mets are in talks to move Starling Marte. Back in December 2024, the Mets even discussed trading Marte for Hunter Harvey with the Kansas City Royals. Even though the Mets were ready to pay for the Dominican outfielder, the discussion was stalled.Based on an update by the Mets’ Pat Ragazzo on Sports Illustrated, there is a strong possibility that Starling Marte can be traded to the San Diego Padres . The Padres are looking forward to improving their fielding segment for the upcoming season. After Jurickson Profar was traded off to the Atlanta Braves, the Padres have a vacant spot for a starting left fielder in the team. Ragazzo posted on X-MLB trade analysts believe that the trade for Starling Marte for Wandy Peralta might benefit both major league teams. Reportedly, the Mets might consider paying a significant part for Starling Marte’s deal in return for the Padres pitcher.Despite being in his mid-30s, Starling Marte is still one of the most productive hitters in the MLB currently. His salary has become the talking point in the baseball fraternity with respect to the skyrocketing cost burden on the New York Mets.","The New York Mets' luxury tax payroll has reached a staggering amount of $324 million.

""Suddenly free to sign with any team in the NBA except for the Clippers, Mo Bamba could join the Lakers, fill a reserve roll on the court for 20 or so minutes a night, and hopefully prove to be more of a positive than a negative with his on-court play,""

The’ pursuit of a reliable center took an unexpected turn when the proposed trade for Charlotte Hornets ’ Mark Williams fell through. ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that the deal was rescinded after Williams failed his physical, leaving the Lakers scrambling for alternatives. With the trade deadline passed, the team now looks to free agency and the buyout market to bolster their frontcourt.One name emerging as a potential solution is former Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Clippers center Mo Bamba .

Bamba briefly donned the purple and gold in 2023 before being traded to the 76ers.Breisch added.Bamba’s skill set aligns with the Los Angeles Lakers’ needs. Standing at 7 feet tall, he brings rim protection, rebounding, and the ability to stretch the floor with his three-point shooting. While he may not match the potential of Mark Williams, Bamba offers a cost-effective and available option for a team in desperate need of frontcourt depth.The Lakers’ front office has limited choices as the postseason approaches.

"In implicit relief to Adani group, Trump pauses anti-bribery law saying it harms US interests",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-implicit-relief-to-adani-group-trump-pauses-anti-bribery-law-saying-it-harms-us-interests/articleshow/118152120.cms,".

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asserting that a 50-year old US anti-bribery act is inhibiting American global competitiveness, US President Donald Trump has paused enforcement of the law, implicitly providing relief to India's Adani group , whose executives were being prosecuted under the law by the Biden administration.In an executive order he signed on Monday, Trump argued that ""overexpansive and unpredictable enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act against American citizens and businesses — by our own Government — for routine business practices in other nations not only wastes limited prosecutorial resources that could be dedicated to preserving American freedoms, but actively harms American economic competitiveness and, therefore, national security.""""The President’s foreign policy authority is inextricably linked with the global economic competitiveness of American companies. American national security depends in substantial part on the United States and its companies gaining strategic business advantages whether in critical minerals, deep-water ports, or other key infrastructure or assets,"" the EO said.Although the Trump EO, coming 36 hours before Prime Minister Modi's visit to Washington to meet him, made no explicit reference to the Adani group, the Biden administration's Justice Department and Security and Exchange Commission last November charged its Chairman Gautam Adani , his nephew Sagar Adani, and Cyril Cabanes, a former executive of US-listed firm Azure Power Global Ltd, under the FCPA, alleging payoff to Indian officials to secure solar energy contracts. The Adani Group had called the allegations ""baseless"" and vowed to pursue all legal options.The Adani group has interests in several projects of strategic importance to the US and its allies, from Africa to Australia to the Middle-East, including acquisition of 70 per cent of the Israel's Haifa port, considered a gateway to West Asia.On Monday, Trump came out swinging against the law after he signed the EO, telling reporters in the Oval Office, “It sounds good on paper, but in practicality, it’s a disaster. It means that if an American goes over to a foreign country and starts doing business over there, legally, legitimately or otherwise, it’s almost a guaranteed investigation indictment, and nobody wants to do business with the Americans because of it.”The FCPA became law during the Carter presidency, and its anti-bribery statutes originally applied to only Americans and certain foreign issuers of securities before it was expanded during the Clinton presidency to apply to foreign firms which do business with the US.“It was a Jimmy Carter concept, and it sounds so good, but it’s so bad. It hurts the country and many, many deals are unable to be made because nobody wants to do business,” Trump said, dumping on a recently-passed former president whom he disdained, having also blamed him for ceding the Panama Canal to Panama.In the EO in which he directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the FCPA for 180 days and lay out new guidelines for enforcing it, Trump asserted that it would be the policy of his administration to preserve the Presidential authority ""to conduct foreign affairs and advance American economic and national security by eliminating excessive barriers to American commerce abroad.""Separately, Trump also offered a get-out-of-jail card to two prominent US politicians under the gun for corruption, even as his MAGA principals raged about purported fraud and misuse in USAID and other government departments.On Monday, Trump's Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors to drop the corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who fell out with the Biden administration and decamped to the Trump orbit. Trump also pardoned former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of trying to sell a US Senate seat vacated by former President Barack Obama, saying ""he was set up.""","US President Donald Trump has paused enforcement of a 50-year-old US anti- bribery act.
