Interpol issues first silver notice at India’s request against ex-French embassy officer in visa fraud case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/interpol-issues-first-silver-notice-at-indias-request-against-ex-french-embassy-officer-in-visa-fraud-case/articleshow/121453280.cms,"File Image

NEW DELHI: Interpol, for the first time, has issued a Silver notice at India's request to monitor former French embassy officer Shubham Shokeen, who is involved in visa fraud.The Silver notice, introduced in January, is designed to track illicit assets globally. Italy's request initiated this pilot programme, which India has joined.Interpol utilises nine different colour-coded notices for specific information requests from member countries. These include Red for fugitive detention, Blue for additional information, Black for unidentified bodies and Yellow for missing persons.India participates alongside 50 other nations in the initial phase of Silver notice implementation, continuing until November. Each participating country is permitted to publish nine Silver notices during this pilot phase.The CBI stated on Tuesday that Silver notices and Diffusions enable member countries to request information about assets connected to criminal activities, including fraud, corruption, drug trafficking and environmental offences.This notice system helps locate and identify information about laundered assets, including properties, vehicles, financial accounts and businesses.Countries can use this information for bilateral engagement, including asset seizure and confiscation, within their legal frameworks.I t is pertinent to mention that the CBI has secured two Silver notices: one on May 23 against Shokeen, who served as Personnel Visas and Local Law Officer at the French Embassy in Delhi, and another on May 26 against Amit Madanlal Lakhanpal, sought by the Enforcement Directorate.From September 2019 to May 2022, Shokeen allegedly facilitated Schengen visa issuance by collecting illegal payments ranging from ""Rs 15,00,000 to Rs 45,00,000"" per applicant. He reportedly used these proceeds to acquire Dubai properties worth 7,760,500 dirhams (""Rs 15,73,51,250"").The CBI, India's nodal agency for Interpol matters, had previously obtained a Blue notice to locate Shokeen. All Indian law enforcement agencies coordinate their Interpol requests through the CBI.Meanwhile, Lakhanpal allegedly created an unrecognised cryptocurrency, MTC, collecting ""Rs 113.10 crore"" from investors without proper authorisation. He reportedly misappropriated funds and falsely claimed to represent the Ministry of Finance.India has submitted additional Silver notice requests for cases under investigation by the CBI, Enforcement Directorate, and Narcotics Control Bureau.","Interpol has issued a Silver notice at India's request to monitor former French embassy officer Shubham Shokeen.

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns for the assessment year 2025–26.

Made in India 5th-gen fighter jet: Government clears indigenous stealth fighter jet project as China arms Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/made-in-india-5th-gen-fighter-jet-india-clears-indigenous-stealth-fighter-jet-project-as-china-arms-pakistan/articleshow/121442084.cms,"Pakistan's JF17 Aircraft Runs Into Russia Trouble?

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday green-lighted the 'Made in India' fighter jet programme to produce a fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).India has been working on the ambitious AMCA project to develop a medium-weight, deep-penetration fighter jet with advanced stealth capabilities to bolster its air power.The AMCA, along with the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), is expected to form the backbone of the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the coming decades.""In a significant push towards enhancing India's indigenous defence capabilities and fostering a robust domestic aerospace industrial ecosystem, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has approved the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) Programme Execution Model,"" the ministry of defence said.The ministry added that private sector companies are invited to participate in the project.""They can bid either independently or as a joint venture or as consortia. The entity/bidder should be an Indian company compliant with the laws and regulations of the country,"" the ministry said in a statement.The development also comes amid heightened tensions with Pakistan following Operation Sindoor which claimed over 100 terrorists.The government has focused on enhancing India’s air power, especially in light of China's rapid advancements in the domain.Meanwhile, China now accounts for over 80% of Pakistan's arms imports.A recent US intelligence report claimed that Pakistan is the ""primary recipient"" of China’s economic and military generosity and foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan's armed forces are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China.""Foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan’s WMD programs are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China, and sometimes are transshipped through Hong Kong, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. However, terrorist attacks targeting Chinese workers who support China Pakistan Economic Corridor projects has emerged as a point of friction between the countries; seven Chinese nationals were killed in Pakistan in 2024,"" it added.Also read: Why India is fighting a Pakistan armed by China ""Pakistan primarily is a recipient of China’s economic and military largesse, and Pakistani forces conduct multiple combined military exercises every year with China’s PLA, including a new air exercise completed in November 2024,"" the report said.Last year, the Cabinet Committee on Security, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, granted in-principle approval to the AMCA programme. The indigenous fifth-generation fighter jet project is expected to play a pivotal role in strengthening the IAF’s combat capabilities.The estimated development cost of the AMCA project stands at approximately Rs 15,000 crore.The IAF has long advocated for the AMCA programme, given its long-term strategic requirements and the absence of a fifth-generation fighter jet in its current fleet. In contrast, China has already inducted its Chengdu J-20 jets, which it claims to be fifth-generation air superiority fighters with precision strike capabilities.India’s confidence in the AMCA initiative received a major boost following the successful development of the LCA Tejas.Developed by state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the Tejas has proven to be a capable platform for air combat and offensive missions, with secondary roles in reconnaissance and anti-ship operations.Meanwhile, the IAF is also in the process of acquiring 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) to enhance its operational readiness. In April 2019, the IAF issued a Request for Information (RFI) for the procurement, estimated at around USD 18 billion. The MRFA deal is considered one of the largest military procurement programmes globally in recent years.","India has been working on the ambitious AMCA project to develop a medium-weight, deep-penetration fighter jet.

NEW DELHI: In a temporary reprieve for Turkish aviation firm Celebi, the Bombay high court on Monday directed Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) to hold off on awarding new contracts for ground and bridge handling services at the city's international airport.The interim order was passed by Justice Somasekhar Sundaresan, who said that no conclusive steps should be taken on the tenders until Celebi’s petitions are heard after the court’s summer recess in June, reported news agency PTI.The legal dispute stems from the recent revocation of security clearance for Celebi Airport Services India, a subsidiary of Turkey-based Celebi, by India’s Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS). The security clearance was rescinded earlier this month, citing national security concerns, prompting airports across the country to terminate contracts with Celebi’s Indian affiliates.The move followed diplomatic tensions after Turkey expressed support for Pakistan during India’s Operation Sindoor, a military offensive conducted in response to cross-border terrorism. In the aftermath, Celebi’s Indian operations, including those at key airports like Mumbai and Delhi, came under scrutiny.In Mumbai, Celebi Nas Airport Services India, which handles bridge and ground services, filed three separate petitions challenging both the BCAS's decision and MIAL’s termination of contracts. The company contended that the government’s actions were arbitrary and legally unsustainable. Celebi holds a 59 per cent stake in the joint venture operating at the Mumbai airport.The petitions request the high court to annul the BCAS’s order cancelling its security clearance and to reverse MIAL’s termination of key agreements, including the Bridge Mounted Equipment Service Agreement, Ground Handling Services contract, and the Concession Agreement. The firm also asked the court to suspend the tender process initiated by MIAL on May 17 for selecting a replacement agency.Meanwhile, two other group companies, Celebi Airport Services India and Celebi Delhi Cargo Terminal Management India, have approached the Delhi high court seeking similar relief following cancellation of their airport contracts in the capital.","The Bombay high court on Monday directed Mumbai International Airport Limited to hold off on awarding new contracts for ground and bridge handling services.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday strongly criticised the Uttar Pradesh government for intervening in a private legal dispute over the management of the iconic Shri Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan, accusing it of “hijacking” the case.A bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma questioned the state’s involvement, stating, “If states start entering private disputes, it will lead to a breakdown of the rule of law. You can’t hijack litigation between private parties.”The court was hearing a plea seeking modification of its earlier order that cleared the way for the UP government’s temple redevelopment plan.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal , representing petitioner Devendra Nath Gooswami, argued that Rs 300 crore was allocated to the state for the project without making his client, linked to the temple’s original founders, a party to the case, news agency PTI reported.“How can earnings of a private temple be handed over to the state through an order in an unrelated petition?” Sibal questioned.In response, the state's counsel said the government had created a trust to oversee the redevelopment and manage temple affairs, and that the funds would vest with the trust, not the government—under a specific ordinance.The bench directed the state to share a copy of the ordinance with the petitioner and asked the relevant principal secretary to file an affidavit by July 29.Earlier on May 15, the court had allowed the state to use temple funds for purchasing five acres of land around the shrine to develop facilities such as parking, toilets, and accommodation for devotees.However, on May 19, Gooswami—who claims to be a direct descendant of temple founder Swami Haridas Goswami—challenged the redevelopment plan, arguing it was unfeasible without consultation with those historically involved in the temple’s functioning. He warned it could disrupt the temple’s religious and cultural fabric.The Supreme Court’s earlier ruling had modified a November 2023 Allahabad High Court order that accepted the state’s development plan but barred use of temple funds.","The court was hearing a plea seeking modification of its earlier order that cleared the way for the UP government’s temple redevelopment plan.

KOLKATA: Three senior resident (SR) doctors who were the prominent faces of the RG Kar movement have allegedly been given 'punishment' postings in Bengal, sparking a row.A large section of the medical community has accused the Mamata Banerjee government of 'witch-hunting' by flouting the counselling process, while TMC said it can't allow the protesters to cash in on the movement.On Tuesday, junior doctors went to seek clarification from officials in Kolkata. Denied the audience, they said they will protest against the 'injustice'. Senior doctors' bodies like Association of Health Service Doctors, Service Doctors Forum and Medical Service Centre have come forward to support them. Health officials refused to comment.According to norms, all PG medical students must serve a bond posting for three years after completing the course. The final year PG results were published on Feb 28 and the counselling was completed on April 8. During counselling, the PG doctors are allocated places of posting according to the merit list and vacancies. After the counselling, candidates are made to sign an undertaking that the option they choose is final and they will not ask for a change in the future.""According to my ranking and the vacancy list, I opted for RG Kar during counselling.Now, when the final list has come, I find that I have been posted to Raiganj Medical College. This is vendetta,"" said Aniket Makata, who completed his PG in anaesthesia from RG Kar. Sources said all 871 junior doctors on the list of the SR bond posting published on Tuesday were allotted postings as per the counselling, except Aniket Mahata, Asfakulla Naiya, both from RG Kar, and Debashis Halder of MCH.""The reason is our participation in RG Kar protests. The move is also destroying the sanctity of the counselling process, introduced two years ago to make it transparent,"" said Naiya. He had opted for Arambag Medical College but got his posting at Purulia Medical College as per the list.According to the rules, the doctors after completing PG need to serve a medical college for a year on bond, and for the next two years, they can be posted either in a district hospital or a sub-divisional hospital.According to Halder, he opted for Howrah District Hospital as he completed his one year of posting at Regional Institute of Ophthalmology. But he has been asked to go to Gajol sub-divisional hospital.",Three senior resident (SR) doctors who were the prominent faces of the RG Kar movement have allegedly been given 'punishment' postings in Bengal. A large section of the medical community has accused the Mamata Banerjee government of 'witch-hunting',"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121449040,imgsize-1492277,width-400,resizemode-4/121449040.jpg"

Doors opened to private sector to join race to develop desi 5th-gen fighters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doors-opened-to-private-sector-to-join-race-to-develop-desi-5th-gen-fighters/articleshow/121448975.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: India has finalised a new 'programme execution model' for the indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter called the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), under which private firms can also bid for the project along with defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL).The new model approved by defence minister Rajnath Singh, which aims to accelerate prototype development and induction of the AMCA through a 'robust' domestic aerospace industrial ecosystem, marks a radical departure from the country's long-standing policy of fighter production being solely the preserve of HAL.The defence ministry expects HAL, which has been facing major flak for the huge delay in production of the fourth-generation Tejas Mark-1A jets, to bid for the AMCA project in partnership with one or more private players, officials told TOI.The defence PSU, after all, ""already has its hands full"" with the planned production of 180 Tejas Mark-1A jets for around Rs 1.2 lakh crore, which is slated to be followed by another 108 4.5-generation Tejas Mark-2 jets, apart from several other aircraft and helicopter projects.""Private companies can also bid for the AMCA project independently, or in a joint venture with a foreign OEM (original equipment manufacturer), or as a consortium.It provides equal opportunities to both private and public sectors on a competitive basis. The bidder, of course, should be an Indian company compliant with domestic laws and regulations,"" an official said.""It's an important step towards harnessing indigenous expertise, capability and capacity to produce the twin-engine AMCA prototype. There will be a competition. It will not be handed over to HAL on a nomination basis,"" he added.Towards this end, the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) of DRDO, which is entrusted with designing and developing the 25-tonne AMCA, will soon issue an expression of interest (EoI) for its development phase through industry partnership.The move to accelerate the AMCA project comes at a time when Pakistan is on course to acquire at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation jets from China, which is now even flaunting sixth-generation prototypes with tailless airframes like Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50.The IAF, meanwhile, is grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets) when 42.5 are authorised. At least eight more squadrons are slated for retirement over the next 10 years.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the full-scale engineering development of five AMCA prototypes, along with a structural test specimen, extensive flight testing and certification, by ADA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore.As per existing timelines, the AMCA with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and 'serpentine air-intake' will be ready for production only by 2035.The IAF plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, which will also have AI-powered electronic pilot systems, netcentric warfare systems, integrated vehicle health management and the like.While the first two AMCA squadrons will be powered by the American GE-F414 engines in the 98 Kilonewton thrust class, the next five will have 110 Kilonewton engines.HAL and General Electric are conducting techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the GE-F414 engines in India, with 80% of transfer of technology for around $1.5 billion.","India has finalised a new 'programme execution model' for the indigenous fifth- generation stealth fighter.

KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee rolled out on Tuesday the roadmap for filling up the 24,203 school positions left empty after the Calcutta HC's and Supreme Court's SSC rulings and also announced the creation of 20,000 extra jobs in schools.The process will start on May 30 (a day before SC's May 31 deadline) with a recruitment advertisement and will end with counselling (to start Nov 20). This is the Mamata Banerjee administration's biggest school recruitment drive till date.""Besides the 24,203 vacant posts, additional vacancies have been created to recruit 11,517 teachers for Classes IX and X, 6,912 vacant posts have been created for teachers for Classes XI and XII, and 1,571 vacancies have been created for Group C and Group D posts. The total vacancies are 44,203,"" Banerjee said.""There are many cases where age limit will be an issue,"" CM said, factoring in the nine-year lag for the 2016 School Service Commission panel. ""Age relaxation will be offered so that everyone can appear for the test. We will also give an advantage to those with work experience,"" CM said, which may work to the advantage of teachers who lost their jobs following court rulings.Banerjee's announcement also kept in mind those asked by SC to return their salaries and face immediate job loss: ""A separate notification will made in the first week of June for those Group C and Group D staffers who have lost jobs or been asked to return money so that they can opt to join three-four other departments. There will be a separate notification for this.""The state did not want to fall foul of SC's May 31 deadline despite having filed a review petition against the order, Banerjee emphasised. ""We did not act till now because we thought the review petition might lead to a favourable outcome. But we need to meet the May 31 deadline. Both processes (the new recruitment drive and the challenge to the SC order) will continue. Later, if the review petition yields results, we will accept that. Both options are open. We are doing this to ensure that there is no non-compliance with SC directives,"" Banerjee explained.Banerjee, directly appealing to the protesting SSC teachers, said: ""Take the exam. Continue going to your school. You will receive your salary till the year-end. Protect your right to return with dignity. Opportunities will come. Some 26,000 teachers will have problems if I do not comply with the court's order. You have to wait for the review. Saying you will not take the exam will not work; you will not have a job. This is not our directive, it is SC's order. """"We will register your review petition again after SC's summer break. We have kept time for this. Our lawyers will fight to the best of their ability. The verdict is not in my hands; it is in the court's hand,"" she added.""I will try my best. Why are you afraid? Those who are over 40 will be given an age-limit exemption. We were here, we are here, and we will remain here,"" the CM said.Banerjee also took a jab at the opposition. ""We did not take your jobs. Those who took away your jobs are now trying to be your friends. Some 10,000 teachers' jobswere cancelled in Tripura and they did not get their jobs back despite promises. Some 69,000 teachers lost their jobs in UP. Panels have been cancelled in other states as well.

Salesforce announced on Tuesday that it will acquire Informatica for approximately $8 billion, marking its biggest deal since acquiring Slack Technologies in 2021. The move signals a return to large-scale mergers and acquisitions for the cloud software giant as it looks to strengthen its capabilities in the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence market.After previously shelving talks with Informatica last year due to disagreements over terms, Salesforce is now betting that the data management platform can enhance its competitiveness in the AI space. The deal, valued at $25 per share, represents a roughly 30% premium to Informatica’s closing price on May 22, the day before news of renewed negotiations surfaced.Shares of Informatica rose 5.8% in premarket trading to $23.86, while Salesforce was up 1.2%.Buying Informatica will allow Salesforce to expand its suite of data management tools and tighten control over how business data is handled—an increasingly critical factor as the company integrates generative AI across its product offerings, Reuters reported.""Salesforce and Informatica will create the most complete, agent-ready data platform in the industry,"" said Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, emphasizing that the acquisition will enhance the company’s position in the $150 billion-plus data enterprise market.Salesforce has been actively developing AI agents—software programs capable of handling routine tasks without human intervention—for applications like recruiting and customer service. Its AI platform, Agentforce, has already secured more than 1,000 paid customer deals.Scotiabank analysts noted that the acquisition could help Salesforce better compete with other major software providers, pointing out that ""data management software is now most often sold as part of mega-vendor tool kits.""The deal will be financed through a combination of cash and new debt, with Salesforce expecting to complete the transaction early in its next fiscal year starting February. The company also anticipates the acquisition will begin contributing to operating margin improvements from the second year after closing.Salesforce has a history of high-profile acquisitions, including its $15.7 billion purchase of data analytics firm Tableau Software in 2019.

Remittances tax: How Donald Trump's 'The One Big Beautiful Bill’ may turn out to be ugly for Indians in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-remittance-tax-explained-how-donald-trumps-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-may-turn-out-to-be-ugly-for-indians-in-america/articleshow/121444456.cms,"Indians sending money from the US back home may have to pay a 3.5% remittance tax.

India Gets Largest Chunk of Remittances From US

The US continues to be the largest source of global remittances. RBI's remittance survey released in March indicates that of the total $118.7 billion remittances in 2023-24, the United States contributed approximately $32 billion, which is approximately 28 per cent.

How Indians in US will be hit

Should this legislation take effect, and even if one were to maintain current remittance levels, the Indian community would face an additional tax burden of $1.12 billion!

This regulation is likely to affect individuals who transfer money on a regular basis.

US President Donald Trump’s ‘The One Big Beautiful Bill’ may actually turn out to be ugly for Indians living in the US. By 2026, Indians sending money from the US back home may have to pay a 3.5% remittance tax. ‘The One Big Beautiful Bill’ carries significant implications for many Indian residents in the United States, including H-1B visa holders and permanent residents.International money transfers from the United States to India might become more expensive by 2026 if President Donald Trump's proposed legislation receives approval. The extensive 1,116-page 'One Big Beautiful Bill', which includes tax modifications and expenditure reductions, has received House approval and awaits Senate consideration.The final vote is anticipated in late June or July, with implementation contingent upon passage. The House passed the bill on May 22, reducing the initially proposed remittance tax rate of 5%.The legislation stipulates that only non-US citizens, including permanent residents and employment visa holders, would be subject to this tax. US citizens who incur the 3.5% tax can claim a credit during their tax filing, provided they use verified remittance providers.For Indian nationals, this holds particular importance as they constitute one of the largest immigrant populations in the United States.According to the Migration Policy Institute Data, over 2.9 million Indian immigrants resided in the United States in 2023. The US is Indians' second most preferred global destination after the United Arab Emirates.Statistics also indicate that Indians represent the second-largest foreign-born population in the United States, following Mexicans, comprising 6% of the total 47.8 million foreign-born residents in 2023.Even students earning income through various work opportunities would need to pay the 3.5% tax if they wish to transfer their earnings to India upon completing their studies and returning.Also Read | Big export boom: India benefits from Donald Trump’s tariffs; Indian firms see competitive position in the US tariff scenario Since there is no minimum amount specified, the taxation applies to remittances of every value. The rule would impact all categories of Indians residing in the US, including those on H-1B visas, L-1 visas (for intra-company transfers), and permanent residents. Any money sent to relatives in India or invested in Indian assets, such as securities or real estate, would be subject to a 5 per cent deduction by the remittance service provider (like a US bank).Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner and Mobility Leader at EY India explains, “The excise tax levy on remittances by US citizens/nationals can either be prevented by remittances through a qualified remittance transfer provider which has entered into written agreement with US Treasury to verify the status of senders as US citizens/nationals or claimed as credit against their income tax liability subject to compliance of certain conditions. ”“The bill, which aims at curbing US dollar outflows, is currently under Senate review and if enacted, could affect many Indian professionals working in the US, particularly those on H-1B visas or Green Cards, making remittances to India. Indian diaspora in the US may need to wait and watch, and potentially re-evaluate their remittance patterns, including the amount and frequency of remittances from the US,” he told TOI.Also Read | ‘Will not discuss…’: US tells WTO that India has no basis to impose retaliatory duties on 29 American products Devesh Kapur, who teaches political science and specialises in diaspora studies at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, notes that Indian diaspora generally send about 20 per cent of their income back home, with the amount fluctuating according to their household needs.Sudarshan Motwani, who leads BookMyForex, indicates significant consequences for overseas workers. ""These people have gone there for better prospects so that they could support their families back home. They need to send money back home to India. Hence, they will all be subjected to the new 3.5% tax,"" Motwani told ET.According to Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors, this regulation could affect the inflow of funds into Non-Resident External (NRE) accounts and investments in India's premium real estate sector, which has seen increased capital from overseas Indians. Kumar notes that it could also affect corporate mobility programmes where staff are posted to the US and receive US-based compensation.""These employees may seek to negotiate the additional 3.5% cost as part of their relocation package or under tax equalisation arrangements, effectively increasing the salary costs for the companies. Since this levy is classified as an excise tax, it may not fall within the definition of 'income tax' as outlined in tax treaties, and therefore may not be eligible for a foreign tax credit,"" he told ET.Also Read | ‘Instead of discussing the matter...’: Row erupts over India’s mango exports rejection; authorities say US inspectors did not follow protocol","US President Donald Trump’s ‘The One Big Beautiful Bill’ may actually turn out to be ugly for Indians living in the US.

Nvidia shares rise ahead of earnings as investors eye impact of US chip curbs on China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-shares-rise-ahead-of-earnings-as-investors-eye-impact-of-us-chip-curbs-on-china/articleshow/121444094.cms,"Nvidia shares climbed over 3 per cent to $135.16 in early trading on Tuesday as investors brace for the company’s earnings report due Wednesday, focusing on the financial impact of recent US export restrictions on its China business.Nvidia shares were trading 3.10 per cent higher at $135.36 as of 11:07 am ET.The Biden administration’s export controls, building on measures introduced last year, have limited Nvidia’s ability to sell its advanced H20 AI chip to China. Nvidia has disclosed that these curbs could result in $5.5 billion in charges.CEO Jensen Huang previously estimated the AI chip market in China could reach $50 billion next year but admitted the company had already lost approximately $15 billion in potential sales due to the restrictions, Reuters reported.China accounted for about 13 per cent of Nvidia’s revenue last year, but the company does not break out sales specifically for the H20 chip. Analysts at Wedbush highlighted that the key question for Nvidia’s upcoming earnings will be whether it can compensate for lost sales from the H20 chip and its China operations with growth elsewhere.Despite reports that Nvidia plans to launch a new AI chipset for China based on its latest Blackwell architecture, ongoing uncertainty around China sales has weighed on the stock.Year-to-date, Nvidia’s shares are down about 2 per cent, a sharp contrast to their nearly threefold gain in 2024.“China will probably be the biggest swing factor for Nvidia’s quarter,” said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson.Nvidia is expected to report first-quarter revenue of $43.28 billion, representing a 66.2 per cent year-on-year increase, according to LSEG data. However, analysts at Susquehanna estimate the export curbs impacted the final three weeks of the April quarter, costing the company roughly $1 billion in sales. For the remainder of the year, lost revenue could reach $4.5 billion per quarter, Wedbush analysts project a quarterly hit between $3 billion and $4 billion.Gross margins are also expected to take a hit, with Wedbush forecasting an 11 percentage point drop to 67.7 per cent, partly due to write-downs related to H20 shipments, which could reduce margins by as much as 12.5 per cent.Nvidia CEO Huang recently criticized the semiconductor export restrictions as counterproductive, stating they have accelerated Chinese competitors like Huawei’s development of domestic chip technology.On a positive note, easing of some Biden-era export controls under the AI diffusion rule may open up new markets for Nvidia in regions such as the Middle East. Nvidia has already announced plans to supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips to Saudi Arabia, including 18,000 of its Blackwell chips to a start-up backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund.Investor confidence has also been bolstered by renewed AI investment from major cloud providers, including Alphabet’s Google, which has pledged continued spending despite earlier concerns of a slowdown.“I don’t think investors’ expectations are very high as we go into it,” said Ivana Delevska, CIO at Spear Invest, which holds Nvidia shares in an actively managed ETF.As Nvidia reports its earnings on Wednesday, all eyes will be on how the company navigates the twin challenges of regulatory restrictions in China and rising AI infrastructure costs.","N Nvidia shares were trading 3.10 per cent higher at $135.36 as of 11:07 am ET on Tuesday.

Key UPI transactions may face restrictions from August 1 under NPCI’s new API guidelines to prevent outages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/key-upi-transactions-may-face-restrictions-from-august-1-under-npcis-new-api-guidelines-to-prevent-outages/articleshow/121443387.cms,"Autopay and transaction status APIs also get time-based restrictions

Limits also apply to account listing requests

Starting July 31, 2025, UPI users will face limits on how often they can perform certain non-financial actions like checking account balances or transaction statuses, as the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) moves to regulate API usage across the payment ecosystem. The new framework is aimed at preventing system overloads and improving the reliability of UPI services during peak hours.In a circular issued on May 21, 2025, NPCI directed all banks and Payment Service Providers (PSPs) to moderate and monitor the use of ten high-frequency APIs—requests initiated by users or systems on the UPI network, according to an ET report.These include APIs for balance enquiry, autopay mandate execution, transaction status checks, and account listing. Banks and PSPs have until July 31 to comply, failing which they may face penalties, API restrictions, or suspension of customer onboarding.“PSP banks and/or acquiring banks shall ensure all the API requests (in terms of velocity and TPS — transactions per second limitations) sent to UPI are monitored and moderated in terms of appropriate usage (customer-initiated and PSP system-initiated),” the circular stated.PSPs are also required to submit an undertaking by August 31 affirming that system-initiated APIs are properly rate-limited and queued.Among the most significant changes, balance enquiry API usage will be restricted to 50 requests per app per customer per day. This means users who access multiple UPI apps, such as Paytm and PhonePe, can check balances up to 50 times on each app daily.“This might be an inconvenience to traders and other users who check their balances or transactions extremely frequently,” says Musharraf Hussain, Chief Operating Officer, Ezeepay. “However, this is being done so that UPI’s infrastructure core remains stable and available for use by all.”The circular mandates that apps must discourage balance checks during peak hours (10 AM–1 PM and 5 PM–9:30 PM), and instead, banks will be required to send updated balances with each successful transaction notification. Still, this may reduce the ability for users to get real-time balance updates at will.“Customers might not be able to get a real-time, updated balance of their accounts on PSP apps,” said Pavan Kumar, Chief Product Officer at NPST. However, NPCI has clarified that customers will continue to receive accurate balance updates even after the changes go into effect.Autopay mandates—used for recurring payments like SIPs or subscription services—will now be executed only during non-peak hours, even though customers can continue to create them at any time. “A maximum of 1 attempt, with 3 retries per mandate, can be initiated at moderated TPS only during non-peak hours for autopay mandate,” the circular notes.For the check transaction API, banks and PSPs must now delay the first status check by 90 seconds after transaction authentication and limit checks to three calls within a two-hour window. Certain error codes will result in transactions being treated as failed to avoid unnecessary repeated calls.Furthermore, acquiring banks will now be required to undergo an annual audit by CERT-In empanelled auditors, with the first audit due by August 31 this year.Kumar emphasized that of the ten APIs listed, only one is financial (autopay). “The other nine are non-financial, thereby meaning financial transactions will not be significantly disrupted during peak hours,” he said.Another key API being regulated is the account listing request, which allows users to view all accounts linked to their mobile number. This request will be limited to 25 times per app per customer per day, and will only be allowed once the customer selects their issuer bank in the app. Re-attempts can only be made with explicit customer consent.The new regulations are part of NPCI’s broader strategy to streamline backend infrastructure amid the rising load of real-time payments. By imposing limits on high-frequency API calls, NPCI aims to ensure smoother user experiences, especially during peak transaction windows.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) moves to regulate API usage across the payment ecosystem.

Tata Digital CEO Naveen Tahilyani steps down

Naveen Tahilyani , the CEO and MD of Tata Digital has stepped own just after a year of being appointed by Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran to lead the company’s digital commerce ambitions. Tahilyani’s departure marks the exit of another top level executive. As reported by Economic Times, Hardeep Guru, the chief financial officer of Tata Digital is being considered as the frontrunner for the position.

US-China tech tensions 'escalate'



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly praised President Donald Trump while sharply criticising the Biden administration ’s export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, calling the policy 'a failure' that cost US companies billions. Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang blasts Biden-era AI chip export policy.

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has said that he is not impressed with the design choices of Tesla. Speaking at ""Your Mom's House"" podcast in March, he was asked ‘what's your favorite car?’. Cuban, who owns a Tesla replied with a grin “A Kia. EV6.” He further added “I like it. I'm comfortable with it.”Revealing that he hasn’t sold his Tesla ‘yet’, Mark Cuban explained: “On the Tesla you've got to find [the turn signal] and push the button… while you're driving. You can't pay attention to the road as much.”Praising Kia, he said: “It doesn't try to be too fancy. Your turn signal is like… a turn signal”.While Mark Cuban doesn’t mind driving a ‘cheaper’ Kia EV6, but his 15-year-old son isn’t impressed. When Cuban suggested handing down the car for driving practice, his son quickly shut it down, saying, “It’s not cool, Dad.” He even called it a “nerd car.” Cuban’s response? “Exactly,” he said, embracing the label.Mark Cuban is a known Elon Musk critic. Earlier this year on the ""Club Shay Shay"" podcast, Cuban admitted that he likes provoking Musk because he has ""really thin skin and it just makes it easy.""In another interview earlier this year, Cuban said “I have no problem throwing Elon under the bus, but I'll save it for when it's truly deserved.”Last year, when Musk encouraged users to share more positive content on X, Cuban wasted no time in delivering a sharp retort. “Please post a bit more positive, beautiful or informative content on this platform,” the Tesla CEO then wrote. Cuban commented “You first”.Cuban recently shared an anecdote from a night at COMDEX, which he claims was a major tech trade show in Las Vegas, where he found himself upstaged by none other than Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. At this event, Cuban recalled chatting with a group of women when they suddenly disappeared, only to learn they had left with Gates, who had just taken Microsoft public and was quickly becoming a tech icon.

It is the height of arrogance that actor @ikamalhaasan, who has acted in many Indian languages, including Kannada, has insulted Kannada.”He added, “Kannada is a prominent language in many parts of the world, including India, for centuries.”“Kamal Haasan, who supposedly brings harmony to South India, has been continuously insulting Hinduism and hurting religious sentiments for the past few years. Now, he has insulted Kannada by hurting the self-respect of 6.5 crore Kannadigas. Kamal Haasan should immediately apologise unconditionally to Kannadigas,” the BJP chief wrote.Vijayendra further stated, “He is not a historian to tell with authority which language gave birth to which language.”He emphasised the rich heritage of Kannada, saying, “Kannada language, which has a history of more than two and a half thousand years, symbolises prosperity and represents harmony on the map of India.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Rekha Gupta's recent visit to the iconic Sessions House, a beautiful bungalow located in north Delhi's Civil Lines area, has led to concerns among the judicial officers in the national capital.Gupta is currently searching for a suitable govt accommodation for herself. She visited the British-era bungalow, located at 2 North End Road, on May 22. The sprawling structure has been allotted to the principal district and sessions judge, Tis Hazari Court, and is undergoing renovation.""The Sessions House bungalow is like a holy site for the judiciary. District judiciary shouldn't be treated like this. This house has a legacy which should be respected and preserved,"" said a senior judge from the district courts.Sessions House is built on an area of over two acres and has a separate hall for seminars and judicial functions, a residential complex with six rooms, separate servant quarters, and lawns.According to a senior Delhi govt official, CM Gupta has considered several govt bungalows over the past few weeks and no decision on the house she might pick for her official residence has been taken so far.While Gupta's predecessor, Atishi, lived in the AB-17, Mathura Road bungalow during her short stint as chief minister, AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal was allotted a sprawling house located at 6, Flagstaff Road in Civil Lines area.Gupta has already refused to move in the same bungalow owing to the controversy around it for alleged extravagance on its renovation when Kejriwal was CM.Former chief minister Sheila Dikshit spent most of her 15 years in office at 3, Motilal Nehru Marg, which was later allotted to former PM Manmohan Singh. Currently, his family lives in the same bungalow.""There is also a belief that 33, Shamnath Marg is jinxed, as Madanlal Khurana and Sahib Singh Verma lost their positions as CMs during their stay in that bungalow. That is why Sheila Dikshit decided to live in the Motilal Nehru Marg bungalow,"" a source said.According to officials, there is a severe shortage of govt accommodation for judicial officers in the city. In March, the department of law and justice, Delhi govt, received a request through representation by the Judicial Service Association of Delhi (JSAD) seeking the return of four flats taken by govt for the expansion of former CM Kejriwal's official residence at 6, Flagstaff Road. These flats are still lying vacant but are in a dilapidated condition.On April 22, Delhi govt's Public Works Department informed the law department that in lieu of the flats taken away from the judicial pool, four flats had been allocated at a different location.The JSAD representation pointed out that against the sanctioned strength of 897 judicial officers, only 348 residences are available, leaving a shortfall of 549 residences. At present, there are only three residential complexes for district judges in Delhi — the Karkardooma Court Complex (55 units), Saket Court Complex (128 units) and Rohini Court Complex (48 units). Another 117 units have been allocated from the judicial pool in govt colonies such as Model Town, Timarpur and Civil Lines.The association has already filed a petition in this regard in Delhi High Court, highlighting the abysmal condition of accommodations for judges. The plea states that the house rent allowance (HRA) provided by govt to judicial officers in Delhi is ""grossly inadequate"".""At present, the HRA is 27% of the basic pay of judicial officers. The amount… is grossly inadequate when compared to the market trend, and it is impracticable for several judicial officers (especially up to J-5 level) to rent out suitable and appropriate accommodations in the areas surrounding court premises,"" the plea says, pointing out that judicial officers also have their families to support.""As a result, the majority of the lower-level judicial officers have to take properties situated in Faridabad, Noida and Ghaziabad, which causes them huge difficulty in commuting between court and their residence,"" says the petition.","Rekha Gupta is currently searching for a suitable govt accommodation for herself.

India’s biggest brain drain isn’t to Silicon Valley. It’s to the scroll.

Yes, I believe the next wave of global entrepreneurs will come from India

I have put my money on it

But we’re ALSO building the largest army of thumb warriors - overstimulated, under-inspired people, who're weirdly okay with it.

A billion screens.

A billion brains.

And what do most do with them?

Watch prank videos, swipe choreographed dances, and overdose on AI-generated “wisdom” like it’s roti-sabzi.

We didn’t evolve with media like the West did.

Radio → TV → Cable → Internet

We leapfrogged straight to Reels. And then fell right in

Even my 7-year-old starts with Peppa Pig and ends up in a vortex of glitchy animation and algorithmic chaos.

TikTok, Insta & YT did their job — they captured attention and monetized it.

But what did we lose in the process?

Teens that don’t talk.

Adults that don’t think - just scroll.

With AI, the stimulation will only intensify.

Opportunity?

Dystopia? Also

Feels like a ‘Black Mirror’ episode no one signed up for

This isn’t a call to delete Social apps. It’s not even a solution.

It’s a rant from a concerned father.

And maybe, a conversation about our children.

Curious to hear from other parents, professionals, educators, and entrepreneurs

What are you doing about this?

And how do we make sure the India we’re building doesn’t forget to look up?

Free, free Palestine!"" Security personnel quickly escorted the demonstrator from the venue as he continued calling for Microsoft to end its contracts with the Israeli government.Earlier this year, Agrawal disrupted Microsoft’s 50th anniversary celebrations. As Microsoft current CEO Satya Nadella; and former CEOs Steve Ballmer and co-founder Bill Gates sat on stage talking about the company, Vaniya Agrawal stood up and started shouting. “Shame on you all. You’re all hypocrites,” she said. “50,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been murdered with Microsoft technology. How dare you. Shame on all of you for celebrating in their blood. Cut ties with Israel.” Vaniya was escorted out by the security.Microsoft has reportedly Blocked emails with certain words.

Who is Khan Sir's wife



Khan Sir's real name still unconfirmed

With a surprise but touching declaration, popular educator Khan Sir, the popular online learning platform, and the unique teaching method, announced that he had recently married. This disclosure, shared through a private video message addressed to his students, instantly became a sensation on social media and academia. While his fame is widespread, his wedding ceremony remained low-key, consistent with Khan Sir's long-standing policy on personal life: quiet and dignified.Being true to his nature, Khan Sir decided to break the news of his marriage to the same people who form the core of his existence—his students. In a video message, he informed his students:This act underscores the teacher-student relationship that Khan Sir has nurtured over the years. His ascendance to national fame has been primarily fueled by his capacity to identify with students from varied backgrounds, especially those who are appearing for competitive tests in India. By informing them first, he again reaffirmed the pivotal position that they hold in his life and career.According to ET reports, Khan Sir has organised two functions to celebrate his marriage:The decision to host a student-exclusive feast is another indication of how deeply he values his educational community. Invitations for both events have been shared digitally, and sources close to the educator confirm that the celebrations will remain modest and controlled in scale, reflecting Khan Sir’s personal values.The date of the wedding had already been finalized, as per Khan Sir. Nonetheless, the wedding ceremony itself was made deliberately low-key in light of increased tensions.Though the public is curious, Khan Sir has not disclosed anything about his wife. All that has been heard is her name inscribed on the wedding invitation card: A. S. Khan. No pictures or more information about her has been released to the public.This is consistent with the established modus operandi of Khan Sir to protect his personal life. Although he is one of the most seen teachers in India online, he has always made a distinction between his professional and personal persona.The marriage announcement has been received with a blend of excitement and wonder by his fans. His fans and students have filled social media with congratulatory remarks. However, as curiosity grows, most of his fans will not force him to let go of private details. This response says it all about the trust and respect Khan Sir has earned. His audience appears to love his authenticity, and many have mentioned that his personal decisions only serve to further his reputation as a humble, down-to-earth teacher.There has been speculation for years regarding the actual name of Khan Sir. Though it is speculated to be Faisal Khan by many, the educator has not made any official confirmation or denial of this either. The wedding card also did not mention his full name, keeping up with the mystery.This deliberate decision not to share his complete identity could be due to his intent to keep the spotlight strictly on education and content, rather than individual fame. His audience so far has been supportive of this strategy.","Khan Sir, an Indian YouTube teacher, shares wedding news first with students.

President Donald Trump seems quite not-so-happy with Apple's decision to make in India. The US President Donald Trump announced that Apple can build factories in India but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the US if manufactured overseas. Speaking in the White House Oval Office during the signing of executive orders on nuclear energy, Trump referenced a discussion with Apple CEO Tim Cook , stating, ""I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn’t be doing this. He said he’s going to India to build plants. I said, ‘That’s okay, but you’re not going to sell into here without tariffs.’""Trump stressed, ""We’re talking about the iPhone. If they’re going to sell it in America, I want it to be built in the United States."" Initially singling out Apple, he later broadened the tariff threat to include all smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung and Huawei, saying, ""It would be anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair."" The tariffs are slated to take effect by the end of June 2025.Earlier in a social media post on the same day, Trump doubled down, writing, ""I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple to the US. American jobs come first!""During a recent trip to Doha, Trump had pressed Cook to focus on US manufacturing , noting India’s high tariffs make it a difficult market for US companies. He added, ""They’ve offered us a deal where they’re willing to charge us no tariff, but I told Tim, ‘I don’t want you building in India. Build here.’"" The US President highlighted that India’s tariff policies, among the highest globally, complicate market access, but he insisted on prioritizing domestic production.Apple CEO Tim Cook, addressing tariffs during Apple’s Q2 2025 earnings call, noted that they are determined by the product’s manufacturing location. Industry experts caution that relocating iPhone production to the US would sharply increase costs due to higher labor and operational expenses. If Apple passes these costs to consumers to maintain profit margins, iPhone prices could soar to $3,000 or more, potentially impacting demand. Analysts also point out that building a US-based supply chain would require significant investment and time, given the complex global network Apple currently relies on, primarily in Asia.The policy has sparked debate, with some economists warning that tariffs could raise consumer prices and disrupt global trade, while supporters argue it could boost US manufacturing jobs. The White House has not yet clarified how the tariffs will be implemented or whether exemptions might apply for companies investing in US facilities.In a related news, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly declined offer to join tech exectuives and representatives at Trump's recent trip to the Middle East. The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump, said a New York Times report.","US President Donald Trump said Apple can build factories in India but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the US if manufactured overseas.

Police investigation and warnings

In a shocking online fraud, around 200 people across Karnataka have fallen victim to an investment scheme involving a fake ‘Trump Hotel Rental’ app. The victims lost more than Rs 2 crore collectivity. The investment scam lured the victims by using AI-generated images and videos of US President Donald Trump and promising high returns with remote job opportunities.The fraudulent operation leveraged a seemingly legitimate-looking mobile application, falsely branded as a ""Trump Hotel Rental"" platform. Victims were enticed to invest money with the assurance of earning daily returns by ""renting out"" virtual hotel rooms or properties.The app operated for 5–6 months before being exposed. It initially allowed users to withdraw small amounts, such as Rs 300, to build trust. However, as victims invested larger sums—sometimes exceeding Rs 10 lakh—the app stopped functioning, and the scammers disappeared.A Bengaluru-based lawyer reported losing Rs 6 lakh between January and April 2025, stating that the fraudsters demanded tax payments on earnings before vanishing. Many victims were also assigned fake work-from-home tasks, such as writing company profiles, with inflated earnings displayed on their dashboards to encourage deeper investment.“I was paid Rs 30 every day, and I was allowed to withdraw it after the total earnings crossed Rs 300. As the money was being paid on time and I could withdraw it, they started asking me to invest more. It started with Rs 5,000 and ended at Rs 1,00,000. Finally, they asked me to pay taxes to withdraw the money. But, they did not return it,” states a victim’s complaint seen by TOI.The police has resisted around 15 FIRs in Haveri district alone, with cases also surfacing in Bengaluru, Tumakuru, Mangaluru, Hubballi, Dharwad, Kalaburagi, Shivamogga, Ballari, and Bidar. Cybercrime officials are now tracking the digital footprint of the scam’s organisers and urging more victims to come forward.Police claimed the scam took more than 800 investors for a ride, adding some had invested upwards of Rs 10 lakh hoping quick returns.",Around 200 people across Karnataka have fallen victim to an investment scheme involving a fake ‘Trump Hotel Rental’ app. The victims lost more than Rs 2 crore collectivity.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
