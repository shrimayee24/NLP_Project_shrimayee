"'Sister had gone to US on tourist visa, no idea why she was deported': Brother of 29-year-old",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sister-had-gone-to-us-on-tourist-visa-no-idea-why-she-was-deported-brother-of-29-year-old/articleshow/117999897.cms,"AHMEDABAD: A wave of despair spread across many parts of Gujarat as 33 illegal immigrants, including 13 women and eight children, landed in Ahmedabad early Thursday from Amritsar after they were deported from US. Faces covered by masks, without any luggage and a few with backpacks, they were taken to Gujarat Police vehicles stationed at the airport and whisked away to their homes.Having paid Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore to chase their 'US dreams', all they were left with were shattered dreams and mounting debts. All of them were deported under the 'catch and release' policy of Trump administration and were part of a larger group of 104 Indians who were sent back from the US this week.""My sister was handcuffed during the deportation. She hasn't talked much with us. She had gone to US on a tourist visa . We have no idea why she was deported,"" said Varun, brother of 29-year-old Khushbu Patel of Luna village in Vadodara. Many deportees, including Khushbu, chose to go incommunicado to avoid the intense social scrutiny.Of the 33 deportees, 18 were caught just as Trump took oath as the US president. They stepped on US soil on Jan 19 and 20 and walked straight into the hands of American authorities, sources said.All 18 are from north Gujarat, a region known as a hub for human smuggling operations . ""They were smuggled into US through Mexico border,"" said a source connected with human smuggling network. ""The smugglers pushed them to enter US way before Trump took the oath, fearing stricter immigration policies. But for some reason, they could not cross over in time. They were caught and marked for deportation almost immediately,"" the source added.Sources said the remaining 15 Gujaratis had been in US for periods ranging from one month to four years. They did not get permission to stay even though they sought asylum, citing political persecution. Some deportees like Jignesh Zala, a native of Gandhinagar, said illegal immigration was a traumatic experience that should never be attempted. He had crossed into US with his wife and 11-year-old twin daughters four months ago. ""We went from Delhi to Paris to Madrid to Salvador before reaching Mexico and crossing the border. We were sent back with hands and legs in cuffs. It was a traumatic experience for our entire family,"" Zala said on Thursday.","33 illegal immigrants, including 13 women and eight children, landed in Ahmedabad early Thursday from Amritsar after they were deported from US.

"'We were handcuffed, had shackles on our legs during the 30-hour flight': US deported Indians",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-were-handcuffed-had-shackles-on-our-legs-during-the-30-hour-flight-us-deported-indians-recount-horror/articleshow/117999760.cms,"AGRA: The thing about dreams is that sometimes they come true. Other times, they land you in handcuffs, 13,000 km from home, on a 30-hour flight back to where you started. Devendra Singh, Rakshit Balyan, and Gurpreet Singh learned this the hard way.Devendra, a 38-year-old farmer from Muzaffarnagar, wanted more than what his family's sugarcane fields could offer. He wanted the bright neon lights, the dollars. Instead, he got a seat on a deportation flight packed with 103 others whose dreams had been stamped with a ""denied entry"" sign, his savings spent, his future uncertain.On the flight, he met Rakshit, 24, from the same district, and Gurpreet Singh from Pilibhit. Three men from different walks of life, bound together by the same mistake - believing in a way out that wasn't real. When the trio stepped off the plane at Amritsar on Wednesday, their wrists and ankles were sore from the metal restraints that had bound them for over 30 hours.Devendra had left India in Nov last year for the land of promise. Rakshit had left even earlier, on a tourist visa a month before, hoping to disappear into a new life before the authorities noticed. They had taken different routes but believed in a path to the West, though it was not the kind taught in textbooks or explained in visa offices. These were routes drawn in whispers, brokered in dark corners, & paid for in steep sums.Devendra had met his traffickers in Thailand, men who assured him safe passage to US for Rs 40 lakh - an amount he cobbled together through personal savings, loans from family, and borrowed trust.On Nov 29, his journey began in earnest. Thailand to Vietnam to China to El Salvador. From there, the world's underbelly became his highway: buses across Guatemala, taxis through Mexico, stretches of road walked under cover of night. He was not alone -11 others walked with him, each carrying the weight of hope and debt in equal measure.Then, on Jan 15, he arrived. But he did not arrive as he had imagined. There was no breath of free air, no sense of relief. Only the uniformed men of US Border Patrol, their words sharp, their procedures swift. ""They didn't give me a chance to file for asylum or go through the legal process,"" Singh told TOI on Thursday.Rakshit was already in detention when Devendra arrived. He had barely been in US for a few days before being picked up, another name on a list of deportations waiting to be processed. ""He passed his Class XII exams and wanted to pursue BTech,"" said his father, Sudhir Balyan. ""I want him to focus on his education now."" Rakshit, unlike the others, refused to speak to reporters. Maybe it was shame. Maybe he just didn't have the words.""The return journey to India took over 30 hours,"" Devendra said. ""We were handcuffed and had shackles on our legs. No one misbehaved, but we were chained the entire time."" It wasn't cruelty, just procedure. They were no longer people, just cases to be processed, errors to be corrected. By Thursday, they were back on Indian soil, handed over to authorities before being released.","Devendra Singh, Rakshit Balyan, and Gurpreet Singh were deported from the U.S. to India. The trio were bound together by the same mistake - believing in a way out that wasn't real.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/latest-income-tax-slabs-2025-26-how-much-tax-do-individuals-earning-slightly-above-rs-12-lakh-have-to-pay-marginal-relief-calculations-explained/articleshow/117911656.cms,"Budget 2025 income tax: The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs. 12,75,000/-.

According to the Income Tax Department, in the new tax regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to resident individuals who have taxable income marginally above Rs 12 lakh. The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000/-.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How is the marginal relief computed?

First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. tax on the total income of Rs. 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:

Tax payable on total income of Rs. 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.

Now, the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs. 61,500) shall be compared with the amount exceeding total income up to which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs.12,10,000- Rs. 12,00,000]

The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs.10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs. 61,500).

Therefore, in this case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/-= 51,500/-) is allowed.

Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500-Rs 51,500]

For income of Rs 12,50,000, the tax liability reduces from Rs 67,500 to Rs 50,000 with marginal relief.

At Rs 12,70,000 income level, the tax obligation decreases marginally from Rs 70,500 to Rs 70,000 with the relief provision.

At Rs 12,75,000 income, the tax payable is Rs 71,250, and marginal relief becomes inapplicable.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 post Budget 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced ZERO or NIL tax liability for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh in the Union Budget 2025 under the new income tax regime. For salaried individuals, including the standard deduction, this limit is Rs 12.75 lakh under the new regime.But what about individuals with taxable income slightly above Rs 12 lakh? Will they have to pay more income tax than their additional earnings above Rs 12 lakh? Will someone earning Rs 12,10,000 face a Rs 61,500 tax burden versus an individual earning Rs 10,000 less who will pay nothing?There's good news! Here's where the concept of marginal relief comes us. Individuals with income slightly above Rs 12 lakh, which is the nil tax threshold, will receive fair treatment through marginal tax relief.For example, for a person having income of Rs 12, 10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax works out to be Rs 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakh + 10% of 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10,000). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-)Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The marginal relief is computed in the following manner:-Marginal relief examples:It's important to note that rebate is offered to individuals with taxable income up to Rs 12 lakh under the new tax regime.

'Indians insulted' - Opposition protests in Parliament

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday briefed Parliament on the recent deportation of 104 illegal Indian immigrants from the United States. Clarifying that the deportation process ""was not a new one"" and had been ongoing for several years, Jaishankar informed Rajya Sabha that a total of 15,668 illegal Indian immigrants have been deported to India from the US since 2009.A day earlier, a US military plane carrying 104 deported Indians landed in Amritsar. Rejecting all the opposition's charges, the minister also addressed the ""handcuff"" charges, Jaishankar said deportations by the US are organised and executed by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities and ""the standard operating procedure for deportations by aircraft used by ICE that is effective from 2012, provides for the use of restraints"".""However, we have been informed by ICE that women and children are not restrained. Further, the needs of deportees during transit related to food and other necessities, including possible medical emergencies are attended to,"" he said.During toilet breaks deportees are temporarily unrestrained if needed in that regard, the minister said, adding, ""this is applicable to chartered civilian aircraft as well as military aircraft"".""There has been no change from past procedures for the flight undertaken by the US on February 5, 2025,"" Jaishankar said.First, let's understand how the deportation process works in the US. According to NBC News, the process begins with an arrest.This could happen during a routine traffic stop, a workplace raid, or, in the case of individuals with criminal histories, a raid at the house.Following the arrest, immigrants are transferred to an ICE detention facility, which may be local or a few hours away. ICE currently operates over 100 facilities in the US with the capacity to hold up to 41,500 individuals.Immigrants who have arrived in the US within the past two years may face expedited removal, bypassing an immigration judge and being deported within weeks. Those who have been in the country longer could face years of legal proceedings before deportation for now.If a judge issues a “final order of removal,” the individual is typically flown to one of four staging locations along the southwest border—Mesa, Arizona; Alexandria, Louisiana; and San Antonio and Harlingen, Texas — either on a commercial airline or one of ICE’s 10 planes. At these staging facilities, detainees stay for a few days before being transported back to the airport for deportation.The Trump administration, however, has also started using military planes to deport immigrants. One such aircraft, the C-17 Globemaster, landed in Amritsar with 140 Indian deportees.Both the Houses, however, saw several disruptions by the opposition over the treatment of Indians sent back from the US.Earlier in the day, opposition leaders, including Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Akhilesh Yadav and those from the Left parties, protested by staging a demonstration in Parliament complex.Some of the opposition leaders protested while wearing handcuffs.Carrying placards that read ""Humans. Not prisoners"", the opposition leaders said they would not tolerate the insult to India and raised slogans such as ""Indians insulted. India won't stay silent"" against the government.""We, the INDIA parties, shall not tolerate the humiliation of Indian nationals,"" they said."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday briefed Parliament on the recent deportation of 104 illegal Indian immigrants from the United States.

NEW DELHI: Two speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Parliament in the space of three days ... first a day before the Delhi assembly elections and the second a day after voting in Delhi was over. What was the difference?Well, the second speech had no references to "" sheesh mahal "" and ""AAP-da"" unlike the first one in Lok Sabha during which these two terms were used quite a few times by the Prime Minister. The focus in Rajya Sabha was back on the Congress , and in full force, as it has been in the past in most of the Prime Minister's speeches.In his reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's address in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Prime Minister Modi had targeted both Congress, AAP and took digs at their leaders Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal over a range of issues without taking any names.The terms ""sheesh mahal and AAP-da"" - which were used extensively by the Prime Minister and other BJP leaders during campaigning for Delhi assembly elections - were used in the Lok Sabha speech quite a few times.""Sheesh mahal"" was a reference to BJP's charge of splurge of public money by Arvind Kejriwal in the renovation of his CM house. The BJP had released several videos showing Kejriwal's extravagance and opulence in CM house. On the other hand, the term ""AAP-da"" was used by PM Modi in his election rallies to suggest that the AAP government in Delhi was a disaster for its people.In his Lok Sabha speech, PM Modi said: ""Some leaders are focusing on jacuzzi and stylish showers in homes, but our focus is on providing water to every home. After 75 years of independence, 70-75% of the country's population, i.e. more than 16 crore households, did not have tap water connection. Our government has provided tap water to 12 crore families in 5 years and that work is progressing rapidly.""Referring to his government's resolve of helping the poor, PM Modi said ""Earlier, the headlines of the newspapers used to be related to scams and corruption. 10 years have passed and crores of rupees have been saved which has been used for the public. We have taken several steps which have saved a lot of money, but we have not used that money to build a 'sheesh mahal', instead we have used that money to build the nation.""Later, in his speech discussing the government's resolve to help the youth, PM Modi said: ""We have been working continuously by keeping the future of youth in mind. But there are a few parties that are deceiving the youth. They promise allowances at the time of elections but do not fulfill those promises. These parties are 'AAP-da' on the future of youth.""All these references in Prime Minister's Lok Sabha speech were oblique references to Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party which was in direct contest with the BJP in Delhi assembly elections. Delhi voted for a new assembly on February 5.PM Modi's second speech today, in Rajya Sabha, did not mention these terms even once. There was no reference to ""sheesh mahal"" or AAP-da in the entire speech. Prime Minister Modi was once again unsparing in his attacks on the Congress.The Prime Minister accused the Congress of adopting a policy of 'family first' and appeasement. He criticised the grand-old-party for having ""hatred and anger"" towards BR Ambedkar and said this was reflected in not giving due recognition like the 'Bharat Ratna' to the architect of India's Constitution.PM Modi also hit out at the economic policies of the Congress government and the 'licence quota raj' that gave rise to corruption and affected the country's economic progress and growth.He also said the entire Hindu community was blamed and its image tarnished across the world for the economic mismanagement and wrong policies of the Congress 'royal family' that led to slow growth, which was coined as the 'Hindu rate of growth'.Read more: PM Modi's big attack on Congress in Rajya Sabha address The Prime Minister also targeted the Congress government for imposing Emergency in the country during which the entire opposition was put behind bars and hand-cuffed. He also cited several examples of film stars, singers and writers against whom action was taken for not lauding the Congress during that time.Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders, he said those carrying copies of the Constitution have scant respect for it as he recalled how Nehru amended the Constitution during his first stop-gap government curtailing the freedom of speech and expression of common people and did not even wait for elections in doing so.","Two speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Parliament in the space of three days.

Lifetime Pass (₹30,000) – Long-Term Savings Annual Pass (₹3,000) – More Flexible

NEW DELHI: In yet another relief to the middle class and private car owners who frequently use national highways , govt is likely to soon offer the option of purchasing an ‘ annual toll pass ’ with a one-time payment of Rs 3,000 for unlimited use. It will also offer car owners the option to purchase a ‘lifetime pass’ for 15 years with an upfront payment of Rs 30,000.Sources said the proposal is at an advanced stage with the road transport ministry . TOI has also learnt that the ministry is looking at the option of tweaking the base toll rate per km for private cars to give relief to highway users. No new pass has to be bought as they will be embedded in FASTags.At present, only monthly passes are issued to local and frequent commuters for crossing a single toll plaza. For such passes, they need to provide the address proof and other details. This pass is priced at Rs 340 per month, that works out to Rs 4,080 for a year. “So, the offer of Rs 3,000 for unlimited travel across NH network for the entire year is much less than what people pay for free travel at one plaza. This would be optional and detailed analysis has shown that this can be a preferred choice,” said a source.Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had recently said that his ministry is working on the plan to offer passes for car owners. Sources said the ministry is looking at it as one solution to several issues, including the growing resentment against toll plazas within municipal limits, toll gates at less than 60 km interval and violence at plazas.Data show that out of the total toll revenue of Rs 55,000 crore of 2023-24, private cars had a share of barely Rs 8,000 crore. The trend of toll transaction and collection also shows that while 53% of the transactions were for private cars, their share in toll collection is barely 21%. Moreover, while nearly 60% of traffic are private vehicles at toll plazas between 6 am to 10 pm, the distribution of commercial vehicles are almost even throughout day and night.Sources said there will be no loss of earning due to the passes over a period of few years, though initially the NHAI has to forgo some revenue.","The proposal is at an advanced stage with the road transport ministry. No new pass has to be bought as they will be embedded in FASTags. At present, only monthly passes are issued to local and frequent commuters for crossing a single toll plaza. For such passes, they need to provide the address proof and other details.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117933171,imgsize-719024,width-400,resizemode-4/117933171.jpg"

AAP rejects Delhi exit polls claiming 'historical underestimation' - What pollsters said in last 3 elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-rejects-delhi-exit-polls-claiming-historical-underestimation-what-pollsters-said-in-last-3-elections/articleshow/117987056.cms,"Here's how correct the exit polls have been in the past.

Note

2013

2015

2020

NEW DELHI: Two more exit polls for Delhi assembly elections, Axis My India and Today's Chanakya, on Thursday predicted clean sweep for the Bharatiya Janata Party and placed Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) at a distant second. AAP has categorically dismissed the exit poll results stating that pollsters have ""historically"" underestimated its performance.Most exit polls predicted a comeback for BJP in Delhi after 27 years and a big setback for the ruling AAP.AAP national spokesperson Reena Gupta said the exit polls have consistently underestimated the Arvind Kejriwal-led party, and in reality, the party often outperforms these projections.""Look at any exit poll from 2013, 2015, or 2020 – the AAP was always predicted to win fewer seats. But we ended up securing many more in the actual results,"" Gupta said.Senior AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh also dismissed the projections, calling them ""surveys by massage and spa companies"".: Exit polls are just projections made by election survey agencies based on interviews of voters as they come out after casting their votes. They might not hold true on the day of results. The Election Commission will announce Delhi assembly results on February 8.In 2013, an average of four exit polls placed BJP in a strong position, predicting 35 seats, just one shy of a majority. They forecast AAP and Congress each securing 17 seats. However, the actual results saw the BJP winning 32 seats, AAP securing 28, and Congress just 8. The exit polls significantly underestimated AAP’s rise, with the party building on the India Against Corruption movement. With support from Congress, AAP formed government that lasted only 48 days, before Kejriwal resigned over the failure to pass the Jan Lokpal Bill and Delhi was placed under President’s Rule.Two exit polls — Headlines Today-ORG and ABP-Neilsen—overestimated BJP's strength, predicting 41 and 37 seats, respectively. All four polls also overestimated Congress's performance, predicting it would win in double digits. The most accurate exit poll was Today's Chanakya, which predicted AAP would win 31 seats, BJP 29, and Congress 10. On average, the polls were off by 11 seats for AAP, while giving three additional seats to the BJP and nine extra to Congress.In 2015, six exit polls predicted an outright AAP victory, but none could foresee the extent of its triumph. The average of these polls estimated AAP would win 45 seats, BJP 24, and Congress just one. In reality, AAP won 67 seats, leaving BJP with just three. No exit poll predicted that AAP would exceed 60 seats, and only one, Axis My India, predicted the party would win over 50 seats, estimating 53. The lowest estimate came from India TV-CVoter, which projected 39 seats for AAP.For the BJP, exit polls suggested a much stronger performance, but not enough to challenge AAP. All but one poll predicted BJP would secure more than 20 seats, with Axis My India’s estimate of 17 seats being the lowest. Two agencies, Today's Chanakya and Axis My India, correctly predicted that Congress would fail to win any seats. However, other polls were more optimistic about Congress, with India Today-Cicero projecting it would win four seats, its highest estimate. The average of the six exit polls was off by 22 seats for AAP and predicted BJP would win 21 more seats than it actually did.By 2020, with 10 exit polls conducted, predictions for a strong AAP victory were once again widespread, with an average forecast of 52 seats for AAP, 17 for BJP, and just 1 for Congress.However, AAP performed even better, securing 62 seats, while BJP managed only 8. The Times Now-Ipsos exit poll was the first to report, predicting 47 seats for AAP and 23 for BJP. The India Today-Axis My India poll predicted between 59 and 68 seats for AAP, and 2 to 11 seats for BJP.Sudarshan News predicted 24-28 seats for BJP, the highest projection for the party by any agency. However, AAP was expected to win only 41-45 seats according to Sudarshan News. The ABP News-C voter exit poll projected between 49 and 63 seats for AAP, and 5 to 19 seats for BJP, while the Republic TV-Jan Ki Baat exit poll predicted between 48 and 61 seats for AAP, and 9 to 21 for BJP.India TV projected 44 seats for AAP and 26 for BJP. In the 2015 elections, AAP secured a historic mandate, winning 67 out of 70 seats, with BJP taking just 3 and Congress failing to open its account.Despite some improvement in exit poll accuracy in 2020, the predictions still undershot AAP’s electoral performance, which solidified the party’s dominance in Delhi politics.","Most exit polls predicted a comeback for BJP in Delhi after 27 years and a big setback for the ruling AAP. AAP has categorically dismissed the exit poll results stating that pollsters have ""historically"" underestimated its performance. Exit polls are just projections made by election survey agencies based on interviews of voters.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117987054,imgsize-1113799,width-400,resizemode-4/117987054.jpg"

Family members who are now filled with fear are now unable to sleep at night due to the growing anxiety and action being taken by Trump.Family members say that the children insisted on going, forcing them to send them to the USA by selling land and valuables through the dangerous ""donkey route."" Agents charged over 40 lakhs per person to send the children via this route. Now, if the children are deported, the families will be ruined.Talking to TOI, Suresh Kumar, a retired army personnel and a native of Khark Bhura village in Uchana town of Jind district, is at a loss for words after his son Rohit Sharma (21), was deported in first batch.""My son went to the UK on January 20, 2024, after completing his graduation. He initially went there on a study visa, but later decided to go to America. He reached America a few days ago, but was caught there. I haven’t received any official communication from the authorities; instead, I learned about his return to India after the village sarpanch and local police contacted me to confirm his details. I haven’t been in touch with my son for the past 15 days, and I don’t know what has happened to him. I am unable to do anything at the moment, but I take solace in knowing that he is coming back alive. Once he returns, I will speak to him and advise him to settle his life in India,"" he said.Gurudev Singh, a resident of Jind, shared that his son went to England two years ago, but after insisting, he requested money and somehow made his way to the USA. They spent nearly 50 lakhs to send him. Now, due to Trump's actions, everyone is worried. The whole family can't sleep at night. Everyone is concerned about what will happen next. ""I have only one son, but out of his persistence, I sent him to the US. Now, children being sent back in handcuffs, it is devastating, and the family is worried about how they will recover the money they invested,"" Singh said.Singh explained that unemployment in Haryana is at its peak, and young people can't find jobs. They are hopeless and disheartened. That's why they want to go abroad. ""If the government ensures good employment opportunities and industries create new jobs in India, the youth will not go abroad. Many children from Haryana have gone to the US, but if Trump deports them, everything will be ruined. Therefore, Prime Minister Narendra Modi should negotiate with Trump to resolve this issue during his scheduled meeting there.Meanwhile, Mandeep from the Durana village of Jind shared that he was deported last year. He endured a lot while traveling through the ""donkey route."" His life was always at high risk. Women also face exploitation on this route. People who travel this way are treated like animals. They are kept like criminals in several countries for months. Now ""I will not plan to go there again through dunki route on seeing this situation. I had lost my one acre land to fulfill my dream to go abroad but don't want further loss. Therefore, I will plan to go there through a legal route now,"" he added.","Family members say that the children insisted on going, forcing them to send them to the USA by selling land and valuables.

Poll What Are You Most Looking Forward to About the Delhi Assembly Elections 2025 Results? Understanding the Voter Trends Knowing the Winning Party

NEW DELHI: The fate of three major political players and 699 candidates is now sealed with over 60.42% (data updated at 11.30pm) of the 1.56 crore voters of Delhi coming out to cast their votes on Wednesday for electing their representatives for the 70-member assembly in the capital.The voter turnout this year is the lowest since 2008, when only 57.8% of the total number of electors had cast their votes. Nearly 66% of the total electorate exercised their franchise in 2013 while in the subsequent election in 2015, a record high voting of 67.5% was witnessed.The 2020 polls, however, saw a dip of nearly five percentage points with 62.8% exercising their franchise.The turnout this time is 1.8 percentage points more than that of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections – 58.6% – conducted during the peak of summer in May.The Election Commission has, however, said the turnout figures are provisional and will be updated in the next couple of days.ECI director Anuj Chandak said in press statement that near the close of polling, officials have to prepare several statutory and non-statutory forms, seal the EVMs, give copies of VTR (voter turnout) data in Form 17C to the polling agents and then move the EVMs to the designated centres under security.""Thereafter, updated VTR starts continuously reflecting on the VTR APP again from 7pm, as and when the data is updated by ROs (returning officers) when these polling parties return from the polling stations,"" he added.Chandak explained that at times some polling parties fail to submit their documents on poll day which may lead to further update of the turnout numbers after scrutiny of statutory papers and consideration of a repoll, if any.The relatively poor turnout went against the general perception that the city's aware electorate sets an example for the rest of the country. A senior Delhi election official accepted that the turnout was indeed less than expected but added that one should wait for the final turnout figures before looking for reasons. Accepting that the voter turnout was less than what they had expected, election officials said it was too early to look for reasons.""There are several factors that determine voter turnout, and on most occasions those are political. Let's wait for the final numbers before making a comment on it,"" Singh said. It was a triangular contest with AAP, BJP and Congress running an intense campaign in the run-up to the polls.Seeking a third consecutive term, AAP showcased the work done in health, education, water and other sectors besides providing free power and water to frugal consumers and free ride to women in public transport. It promised more welfare schemes for women, senior citizens and other sections of society.BJP, which has been out of office for nearly 26 years, promised to continue the welfare schemes already being run in the capital and also proposed several new free initiatives for various sections of society. With its govt at the Centre, it promised better development projects with a double-engine govt.Congress, while reminding people of the developmental work done by the Sheila Dikshit-led govt in 1998-2013 came out with a manifesto which mentioned various free schemes and plans for all sections.Going by the interim data, Muslim-dominated Mustafabad recorded the highest turnout at 69%, which was more than what was recorded in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls when 66.8% people had cast their votes. However, the constituency recorded a turnout nearly 1.8% less than the 2020 assembly polls, which had witnessed 70.8% voting.Seelampur recorded the second-highest turnout of 68.7%, followed by the reserved constituency of Seemapuri where 65.3% votes were cast. Mehrauli witnessed the lowest turnout of 53% followed by Model Town at 53.4%. The polling started at 7am and the first two hours witnessed a decent turnout of 8.1%. By 11am, almost 20% voting had occurred. That increased to 33.3% at 1pm and 46.5% at 3pm. As per the ECI's voter turnout mobile app, 57.7% turnout was recorded by 5pm with one more hour to go.While the polling booths were largely empty during the first two hours of the day when the air was nippy, officials said queues had started forming by 9am. Several polling booths, especially in the outer Delhi areas, saw queues in the evening, indicating that the final voting percentage may increase by a few more points.""Those who reached the polling stations before the official time of voting to end were given a paper slip.All such voters were allowed to vote,"" said an official.Among the prominent candidates who contested the polls were chief minister Atishi; AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal; former deputy CM Manish Sisodia; ministers Saurabh Bharadwaj, Imran Hussain, Mukesh Ahlawat and Raghuvinder Shokeen; BJP's Vijender Gupta; former MPs Ramesh Bidhuri and Parvesh Verma; former ministers Kailash Gahlot, Raaj Kumar Anand, Arvinder Singh Lovely and Rajkumar Chauhan; Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav; Sandeep Dikshit; and Haroon Yusuf.The votes will be counted on Feb 8, and if a political party gets a clear majority, the govt will be formed by Feb 11.Election Commission officials claimed that voting remained peaceful across the city and no cases of violence were reported from anywhere.""All 70 assembly constituencies of the National Capital Territory of Delhi went to polls today in a peaceful and festive atmosphere. Voters were delighted with the seamless polling process and facilities at the polling stations,"" Chandak said.""Chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar, along with election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu, maintained a thorough and exhaustive oversight of the ongoing elections ahead of and during the polling day to ensure seamless, smooth and peaceful elections,"" he added.","The voter turnout this year is the lowest since 2008, when only 57.8% of the total number of electors had cast their votes.

Government scraps deals for 400 defence drones with Chinese parts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-scraps-deals-for-400-defence-drones-with-chinese-parts/articleshow/117997096.cms,"NEW DELHI: Cracking the whip against domestic private sector companies that are using Chinese components in drones being supplied to the armed forces, the defence establishment has now scrapped three contracts for the induction of 400 logistics drones by the Army.The defence establishment is also putting a “stringent mechanism” in place to ensure the military drones being acquired do not have “any Chinese parts or electronics as well as malicious codes”, sources told TOI.The contracts that have been scrapped for 200 medium-altitude, 100 heavy-weight and 100 light-weight logistics drones, collectively worth over Rs 230 crore, were inked with a Chennai-based company under emergency procurement provisions by the Army in 2023.These drones were primarily meant for deployment along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with China, amid the military confrontation that erupted in April 2020 after the People’s Liberation Army made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh.“Unfortunately, some Indian companies are using Chinese components and electronics in the drones they are producing for the armed forces. This is a major cybersecurity threat, with the possibility of data security and operations being compromised,” a source said.“An adversary can seize control of a drone or `soft kill’ it through jamming. There may be a `backdoor’ in the electronics that bypasses security protection measures,” he added.All this has gained urgency after some cases of operational failures in the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for tactical ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) missions along the borders with China and Pakistan.In one incident in Aug last year, an infantry unit deployed along the Line of Control in the Rajouri sector inexplicably lost control of a fixed-wing VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) UAV, which then veered into Pakistan-occupied J&K.“An investigation was conducted into the incident. The drone-manufacturer was also called for it. It seems there was some technical glitch in the drone. The Army is using over 180 of these drones and the feedback about them is generally positive. The incident in Aug could be an aberration,” another source said.Nevertheless, the defence establishment-Army has increased the level of checks during procurement, with more comprehensive certifications to be provided by drone-manufacturers. “There will also be counter-checking and technical verification to ensure the complete absence of Chinese parts or malicious codes in the drones,” the source said.The defence ministry’s department of defence production has also asked industry bodies FICCI, CII and Assocham to “sensitise and caution” their member companies from procuring Chinese components for drones and other related equipment.Amid the military standoff with China, the armed forces have gone in for the procurement of a wide array of drones. These range from nano, mini and micro drones to kamikaze, logistics, armed swarms and fighter-size MALE (medium-altitude, long-endurance) and HALE (high-altitude, long-endurance) UAVs.","The defence establishment is also putting a “stringent mechanism’ in place to ensure the military drones being acquired do not have “any Chinese parts or electronics as well as malicious codes” The contracts that have been scrapped for 200 medium-altitude, 100 heavy-weight and 100 light-weight logistics drones, collectively worth over Rs 230 crore, were inked with a Chennai-based company in 2023.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117997190,imgsize-1036123,width-400,resizemode-4/117997190.jpg"
India engaging with US to ensure deportees aren't mistreated in flights: EAM S Jaishankar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-engaging-with-us-to-ensure-deportees-arent-mistreated-in-flights-eam-s-jaishankar/articleshow/117997033.cms,"NEW DELHI: After an outrage over the treatment meted out to Indian deportees from the US, which echoed also in Parliament, external affairs minister S Jaishankar strongly defended in both Houses India’s decision to accept illegal migrants sent back in an American military plane saying there had been no change in the past US procedure for the flight.While he did not confirm if this was the first time Indians nationals had been deported by the US in a military plane, the minister said that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) SOP for deportation allowed use of restraints since 2012 and was applicable to both charter and military aircraft. The minister’s statement followed visuals released by US authorities, and comments by some of the returnees, that confirmed they were kept handcuffed and shackled during the flight.“Deportations by the US are organized and executed by the ICE authorities. The Standard Operating Procedure for deportation by aircraft used by ICE, that is effective from 2012, I repeat, that is effective from 2012, provides for the use of restraints,’’ said Jaishankar, while adding that India had been informed by ICE that women and children are not restrained.American authorities this week used a C17 transport plane to deport 104 Indian nationals, in possibly the first use of a military aircraft for deportation to India. Replying to clarifications sought in the Rajya Sabha, the minister said India had obtained passport details and verified citizenship of all returnees before allowing the plane to land in Amritsar.Jaishankar also said that the needs of deportees during transit related to food or other necessities, including possible medical emergencies, are attended to in such flights. “During toilet breaks, deportees are temporarily unrestrained if needed in that regard. This is applicable to chartered civilian aircraft as well as military aircraft. There has been no change, I repeat, no change, from past procedure for the flight undertaken by the US on 5 February 2025,’’ said the minister, adding that the process of deportation is not a new one and has been going on for several years.The minister gave a year-wise break up of illegal migrants taken back by India from the US since 2009. According to the figures, successive Indian governments have accepted 15,668 illegals from the US.With more such flights not ruled out, the minister said India is engaging the US government to ensure that the returning deportees are not mistreated in any manner during the flight. He also promised action against agents facilitating illegal migration .“At the same time, the House will appreciate that our focus should be on strong crackdown on the illegal migration industry, while taking steps to ease visas for the legitimate traveller. On the basis of information provided by returning deportees about the agents and others involved, law enforcement agencies will take necessary preventive and exemplary actions,’’ he said.The minister also reiterated India’s position that it will accept all illegal migrants, subject to unambiguous verification of their Indian origin, saying it is the obligation of all countries to take back their nationals, if they are found to be living illegally abroad. “This is naturally subject to an unambiguous verification of their nationality. This is not a policy applicable to any specific country, nor indeed one only practiced by India. It is a general accepted principle in international relations,’’ he said, adding that people-to-people exchanges constitute the bedrock of India’s ties with the US. “Indeed, more than any other relationship, mobility and migration has had a key role to play in enhancing its quality,’’ he said.Jaishankar said it’s in India’s interest to encourage legal mobility and discourage illegal movement, adding illegal mobility and migration has many other associated activities, also of an illegal nature.“Moreover, those of our citizens who have been inveigled into illegal movement themselves become prey to other crimes. They are trapped into both moving and working under inhumane conditions. Members are aware that unfortunately there have even been fatalities in the course of such illegal migration. Those who have returned have also testified to their harrowing experiences,’’ he said.","US authorities this week used a C17 transport plane to deport 104 Indian nationals, in possibly the first use of a military aircraft for deportation to India.

Maharashtra deportee's 62-day ordeal: 'Saw man being shot by mafia as he could not pay',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-deportees-62-day-ordeal-saw-man-being-shot-by-mafia-as-he-could-not-pay/articleshow/117996919.cms,"NAGPUR: Harpreet Laliya , alias Roshan , was sold on the prospect of earning Rs 4 lakh a month driving a taxi in Canada. So, he bartered his family gold, two trucks and a debt-free life in his native Nagpur for a Rs 50 lakh gamble on reaching the US-Mexico border - supposedly the gateway to what he imagined would be a future worth risking everything for.Little did Roshan know that 62 days later, he would be a physical and mental wreck, haunted by memories of walking on an empty stomach for hours through hilly, forested terrain and seeing a fellow illegal immigrant shot dead by trafficking mafia after he had no money left to pay them.The 33-year-old's journey culminated in him being handcuffed and put on a US military aircraft back to India as a deported illegal immigrant.A day after landing in Amritsar with 103 others, the father of two took a flight back to the city on Thursday. ""I didn't know what I was getting into when I contacted an immigration agent in my mother's village of Gurdaspur. I told him that I wanted to migrate to Canada,"" Roshan told TOI.The agent quoted an initial fee of Rs 18 lakh to prepare ""a profile"" for a tourist visa that he promised would be converted into a work permit once he reached the country.On Dec 5, Roshan flew to Abu Dhabi, from where he was to take a flight to Montreal in Canada. At Abu Dhabi, Etihad Airways officials told Roshan that he would be flown back to Delhi, per instructions of Indian embassy there. The following day, Roshan reached Delhi.""My agent advised me not to approach embassy, warning that I would forfeit the immigration fee if I did so,"" Roshan said. He was made to wait a week before being handed a ticket to Cairo via Mumbai.From Egypt, Roshan was flown to Madrid and asked to ""lie low"" for few days. The next stop was Guatemala on Dec 26 and then to Nicaragua, from where immigration agents took them to Honduras. ""In Nicaragua, we were told to insert dollars inside our passports and hand them over to cops at the checkpoints. Local agents had by then already handed us over to other middlemen, who kept changing at each transit point,"" he added.""Police would hand us over to the immigration mafia at some places. We were herded from one hideout to another.""In Honduras, the group got ""visas"" to supposedly cross the US border. "" I had to pay the mafia $1,400 (around Rs 1.2 lakh). My Mexican agent also paid almost an equal amount to get my documents released,"" Roshan said. He and other immigrants were ferried by car to Tapachula in Mexico, where they were made to cross a river by boat. ""We were shocked to see mafia and Mexican cops hobnobbing with each other,"" Roshan said.Between Dec-end and first week of Jan, Roshan and others kept moving from one city in Mexico to another till they reached Tabasco. ""We were then taken to Mexico City in covered pick-up vans and dumped in a warehouse. Mexico police left us at the mercy of the local mafia,"" Roshan said.The group walked for hours through forests & hills in Mexico to reach the zero-line border with a barbed-wire fence. ""It was another 16-hour trek into US territory after crossing the border. We had a family from Gujarat with us,"" Roshan said. US border forces arrested the group and took them to a San Diego prison on Jan 22. ""We were handcuffed and kept like terrorists for four days. Chips, apples and juice were all we got for 12 days.""","Harpreet Laliya was sold on prospect of earning Rs 4 lakh a month driving a taxi in Canada.

Better connectivity and agents: Why Delhi is key stop on 'Donkey route',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/better-connectivity-and-agents-why-delhi-is-key-stop-on-donkey-route/articleshow/117996911.cms,"Next: Those who never reached the US

NEW DELHI: Like a siren's call, the allure of the American Dream has turned Delhi into a clandestine crossroads, where desperate souls from Punjab to Gujarat and from West Bengal to Maharashtra converge in a perilous quest to sneak into the promised land, no matter the cost. The city is a major transit hub for individuals from across India attempting to travel illegally to the United States and its neighbouring countries.2024 saw a significant increase in the number of such travellers, accompanied by a 100% surge in the arrests of agents and facilitators involved in these illegal activities. The state-wise breakdown of agents arrested for visa fraud reveals widespread distribution, Punjab topping the list with 70 arrests, followed by Haryana with 32 and Delhi with 25. Uttar Pradesh also recorded 25 arrests while West Bengal had 17. Other states where agents were nabbed in significant numbers were Maharashtra with 8, Gujarat with 7 and Rajasthan with 4.Delhi's emergence as a key transit point for illegal immigration to the US and neighbouring countries can be attributed to a combination of factors. One primary reason is the city's well-developed air connectivity, with Indira Gandhi International Airport the convergence point for a large number of international flights. This facilitates easy travel to destinations in the US, either directly or through connecting flights.Another significant factor is the presence of a large number of travel agents, immigration consultants and visa facilitators in the capital. These individuals often have established networks and connections with agents in other states and countries, enabling them to provide illicit services to those seeking to enter the US illegally. The modus operandi in most cases is to avoid a direct route to a US city. Instead, pit-stops in random countries are planned to keep suspicion at bay.Police say they keep tabs and crack down on the syndicates engaged in illegal immigration. Besides making more arrests, the cops have even busted illegal 'visa labs' in Delhi and Gujarat, thus cutting the supply chain. The labs busted by the IGI Airport police mass produced fake visas, counterfeit immigration stamps and other forgeries required to help individuals bypass airport checks and enter foreign countries illegally.A facility in west Delhi, the cops discovered, ran a fully equipped visa forgery operation. Headed by Manoj Monga, a graphic designer, the factory, according to DCP (Airport) Usha Rangnani, produced high-quality counterfeit visas, appointment letters and other documents. It used immigration stamps to alter passports and create false travel histories. Police also seized sophisticated printing equipment and state-of-the-art engraving equipment besides watermark printing equipment and UV machines used to produce convincing counterfeit documents.Subsequent police raids busted a major network in Delhi, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, leading to the arrest of eight individuals. Another factory in Surat in Gujarat was run by one Prateek Shah, an electrical engineer, who specialised in counterfeit PR cards, holograms and visas.Of late, Delhi Police's focus has been on the agents and facilitators instead of the immigration seekers, who are often in the dark about what's in store. According to DCP Rangnani, this was a decisive shift in strategy, with a focus on dismantling illegal syndicates, targeting high-profile agents, and addressing the root causes of immigration fraud.Police have also cracked the whip on syndicate members based abroad and fugitives from justice.The cops have urged people planning to travel abroad to exercise caution. They advise them to verify the credentials of agents offering immigration services. ""Passengers should be wary of shortcuts or promises of guaranteed visas. Any suspicious activities should be reported to police immediately,"" said a senior police officer.Police plan to carry out awareness drives on the matter because many individuals desperate to attain their American dream fall victim to these scams.","2024 saw a significant increase in the number of such travellers, accompanied by a 100% surge in the arrests of agents and facilitators involved in these illegal activities. Punjab topped the list with 70 arrests, followed by Haryana with 32 and Delhi with 25.

They (Congress) failed, but ""blamed an entire civilisation for it,"" Modi said.Modi contrasted this with his govt's economic achievements and said, ""Today, the world recognises India's economic strength, and we are one of the fastest-growing economies. Free from Congress's grip, the country is breathing freely and soaring high.""Modi painted a stark picture of India's economy under Congress, recalling an era when even buying a scooter required a decade-long wait and obtaining a gas connection depended on MPs' quotas. He lambasted 'licence raj' and govt-controlled markets which, he argued, stifled India's entrepreneurial potential. ""India's natural ability for free trade and business was crushed under Congress's governance,"" he said, contrasting it with his govt's success in making India one of the world's fastest-growing economies.Interestingly, to buttress his criticism, the PM cited two Congress MPs of the House - an ""erudite"" former finance minister who had in an interview acknowledged that people had to pay bribes to get past the stifling licence and quota regime, and another who had recalled how his father had to wait for 15 years to buy a car.Modi also recalled leading lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri being jailed during the prime ministership of Jawaharlal Nehru and the ban on Bollywood legends Dev Anand and Kishore Kumar on govt-controlled All India Radio and Doordarshan after they refused to toe the Congress govt's line during Emergency.Highlighting economic achievements under his leadership, Modi cited the rise of India as the world's second-largest mobile phone and steel producer, the expansion of the defence manufacturing sector, and the growth in exports across industries, from electronics to agrochemicals.He attributed this progress to initiatives such as the Production-Linked Incentive scheme and Make in India , which have boosted domestic production and reduced reliance on imports.Taking aim at what he described as Congress's ""politics of appeasement,"" Modi accused the rival of deliberately obstructing constitutional recognition for the OBC panel for decades. He credited his govt for granting constitutional status to the commission and implementing 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections without affecting existing quotas.The PM also criticised attempts to spread caste-based divisions, warning that certain political forces were sowing discord for electoral gains. He underscored his govt's commitment to marginalised communities.Attacking Congress's governance model, Modi accused the party of prioritising nepotism, corruption and selective appeasement over inclusive development. ""For nearly 60 years, there was no alternative model. Post-2014, the people chose a new path - one of saturation, not appeasement,"" he said, reiterating his govt's focus on universal policy implementation rather than selective benefits.Modi also championed the aspirations of the middle class, pointing to tax cuts, housing reforms and education policies that have bolstered the sector.

""Our goal should be to uproot the existence of terrorists,"" Shah told the meeting.The home minister directed the agencies to make new appointments in the posts of Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in view of the timely implementation of the new criminal laws.Recalling the Modi govt's 'policy of zero tolerance against terrorism' to achieve the goal of a terrorism-free Jammu & Kashmir, Shah directed all security agencies to remain vigilant and continue to work in synergy to eliminate terrorism from the UT.""The Union home minister appreciated the efforts of the security agencies for significant improvement in all parameters of the security scenario in J&K,"" said a release issued by the home ministry after Wednesday's review.","Home minister Amit Shah flagged the role of narcotics proceeds in funding terror and facilitating infiltrators. Shah stressed on the need to take prompt action against this trend with ""alacrity and rigour"" The back-to-back meetings by Shah came close on the heels of a terror attack in south Kashmir's Kulgam district.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117964269,imgsize-1260879,width-400,resizemode-4/117964269.jpg"

Countries Should Have Better Immigration Policies It's a Necessary Enforcement of Immigration Laws

A Gujarati family claims to have 'paid Rs 1cr' to reach US

AMRITSAR/CHANDIGARH: A US military C-17 Globemaster aircraft landed in Punjab's Amritsar Wednesday afternoon with 104 deported Indians , grounding their 'American dream' that led them to stake their all in its pursuit.The Union govt didn't rule out more deportation flights from the US, saying all repatriated citizens whose antecedents had been verified - like in the past under the Biden administration and during Donald Trump's previous stint as President - would be ""accepted back"".Sources said this was the first known instance of the US deploying a military aircraft to send deported immigrants from India back home. On why a C17 was used, a US embassy spokesperson only said the military was supporting the new Trump administration's efforts to expedite the removal of illegal migrants globally. When illegal Indian immigrants were last deported in Oct 2024, US authorities had used a charter flight.The arrivals in Amritsar included 25 women and 13 children. Although no official data was put out, the state-wise break-up based on multiple reports is: Haryana 35, Gujarat 33, Punjab 31, three from UP and 2 from Maharashtra.On speculation about the deportees being handcuffed, a Punjab govt official said, ""Some of them said barring the kids, they were made to wear handcuffs during the flight. I can't confirm it, though."" The military aircraft, which took off from San Antonio in Texas arrived in Amritsar at 1.55pm and returned around 5.15pm.Several of the deportees told a government official at the airport that they were picked up ""at the US-Mexico border about 10 days ago"". Some said they travelled to the US from the UK.Sources involved in the clearance process at the airport said deportees from Punjab and Haryana were sent home by road. Those from Gujarat and other states were scheduled to take flights late Wednesday. A senior police officer said investigators would look into who helped the deportees reach the US and how much money they paid to these illegal immigration agents.""They feel betrayed by whomever they gave money to. A Gujarati family claims to have paid Rs 1 crore to reach the US,"" another official said. An uncle of a youth from a border village of Amritsar said the family sold one-and-a-half acres of land and spent a little over Rs 42 lakh to send his nephew abroad. ""He reached the US via Mexico only a few months ago,"" he said.Charanjit Singh, a retired police inspector in Punjab, was at the airport to receive his grandson Ajaydeep Singh, a resident of Amritsar Cantt. He said the young man was living in a camp before being deported. On whether families of all the deportees were aware about the circumstances of their return, an official said, ""Some requested us not to inform their families.""Special counters had been set up at the airport to process formalities for the deportees. Several police vehicles and buses were sent to the cargo terminal and used to transport the deportees back to their hometowns.","104 deported Indians landed in Punjab's Amritsar Wednesday afternoon with 104 deported Indians.

India plans to crank up Tejas production to stem IAF’s depletion in fighters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-plans-to-crank-up-tejas-production-to-stem-iafs-depletion-in-fighters/articleshow/117967197.cms,"Poll How Do You Feel About India’s Increased Tejas Fighter Jet Production? Excited to See India’s Progress in Aerospace A Great Move for Strengthening Our Defense

NEW DELHI: With US major General Electric promising the revised delivery of aero-engines for Tejas jets from March onwards, India plans to progressively crank up production of the much-delayed indigenous light combat aircraft and stem the rapid depletion of fighter squadrons in IAF.Tejas-manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) already has three Tejas Mark-1A “ready in the flight line”, which will be fitted with the GE-F404 turbofan jet engines once they begin arriving in March. “HAL will have five Tejas Mark-1A jets and four trainers ready by March-April. If the GE engines begin coming, fitments can be done in a few days,” a top defence official told TOI.While integration of advanced electronic warfare systems and the Israeli radars on the Tejas Mark-1A has been completed, work is underway to soon also test-fire the indigenous Astra air-to-air missile from the single-engine jet, which undertook its first flight in March last year.The delivery of 99 GE-404 engines, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021 but has been delayed by almost two years, is all-important. GE has now promised to begin the delivery next month, with 12 engines to be delivered in 2026, and 20 every year thereafter, another official said.Depending on the supply of engines, HAL contends it can progressively scale up production to 20 Tejas per year, and then to 24 per year, with the third production line now functional in Nashik to add to the two existing ones at Bengaluru.“The first Tejas Mark-1A should roll out of the Nashik line in a month or two. HAL is also sub-contracting private companies to build wings, fuselages and the like. If they deliver, Tejas production can even go up to 30 per year,” he said.The wait, however, has been excruciating for IAF. Air Chief Marshal A P Singh just last month publicly expressed frustration at the huge delays in the 4th-generation Tejas fighters, while China recently displayed two new 6th-generation fighters.IAF till now has got only 38 of the first 40 Tejas Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010. The first “improved” Tejas Mark-1A jet, out of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021, will now hopefully be delivered in a couple of months. The order for another 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore is also in the pipeline.These 220 jets, along with 108 Tejas Mark-2 variants with more powerful engines, are critical for IAF, down to just 30 fighter squadrons when it is authorized 42.5 to tackle the twin challenge from China and Pakistan.HAL and GE, of course, are now conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the GE-F414 engines in India, with 80% of transfer of technology for around $1.5 billion.These engines, in the 98 Kilonewton thrust class, will power Tejas Mark-2 fighters for a longer combat range and greater capacity to carry weapons than the existing fighters.In Aug 2022, the cabinet committee on security had cleared the development of Tejas Mark-2 with prototypes, flight testing and certification for over Rs 9,000 crore.While the long-delayed Tejas Mark-1 (13.5 tonne weight) was meant to replace obsolete MiG-21s, the Mark-2 variant (17.5 tonne) will succeed fighters like the Mirage-2000s, Jaguars and MiG-29s in IAF’s combat fleet.","General Electric promises revised delivery of aero-engines for Tejas jets from March.

The Anthony Davis and Luka Doncic trade has left everyone at the NBA stunned as it was a bombshell report no one saw it was coming to shake the league to the core. Doncic who was a star player for the Dallas Mavericks was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for LeBron James’ iconic on-court partner Anthony Davis. While many NBA stars have shared their thoughts on one of the biggest surprises of the year, the Golden State Warriors star Draymond Green reacted to the trade with a bold message explaining how it would change the roster. Draymond Green ’s reaction to the Anthony Davis Luka Doncic trade reveals that he is not very fond of the surprise from both teams. In the latest episode of his The Draymond Green Show with Baron Davis podcast, the Golden State Warriors veteran shared his thoughts on the trade while showing concern. ""Nobody's safe,” Green shared.“If you're a general manager - you're calling Giannis, you're calling Steph Curry, you're calling Wemby - you calling guys you don't even think have a chance. If you're a GM, you're going to see more promising young talent get traded because you're gonna get more calls,"" he added.The Warriors forward added, ""People just tryna throw sh*t out of the wall to see if it sticks. That's one of the biggest impacts on the NBA.""The NBA trade in general, has been frustrating for many including Green’s Warriors teammate Dennis Schröder who recently called it modern day slavery. “Luka Dončić just got traded and got five f–---g NBA First Teams,” Schröder said. “All-Stars, he brought money to them, NBA Finals last year and $117 million he can’t sign now because he got traded, and that’s no state income tax. From now on, I see it even more crazier than it was, because to trade somebody like that, nobody’s safe,” he continued.He added, “Not even Steph Curry’s safe probably when I see that. It’s a f–--d up business… But still grateful that we’re here and that we can live this every single day. I think everybody who’s in here is blessed. But if you really think about it, it is kind of crazy that the organization can tell you, ‘We want you to be team-first, but you’re going over there.’ It’s a lot.”Following his comments on the NBA trade, the Warriors signed Jimmy Butler from the Miami Heat but at the expense of Andrew Wiggins, Dennis Schroder and Kyle Anderson. According to Shams Charania, “Schroder is headed to Utah and Kyle Anderson to Toronto as part of this multi-team trade.”Also Read: Jimmy Butler shared his first reaction after the Miami Heat-Golden State Warriors trade: “Welcome to the Wild Wild West” Regardless, in Schroder’s words, “That’s what the NBA is.” Green and Stephen Curry got a new teammate but have lost many.

Taylor Swift fans are eagerly waiting for the Super Bowl match between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Eagles.

One of those brands was by sports commentator and TV personality Erin Andrews , who noticed Swift wore her gear to three separate games.Fox sideline reporter Erin Andrews spoke with Elle magazine about what she calls her ""proudest career moment,"" not because of the many media achievements that have helped propel her career forward, but rather because of a start-up company she's begun called "" Wear by EA ,"" an inclusive clothing line designed for female sports fans.""We launched WEAR in 2019, so COVID was our second year. Then, in 2021, I remember walking out on the field for my first game of the season—it was Vikings vs. Packers in Minnesota—and everybody was excited to be back,"" she said in the interview.""So many women were in the front row wearing WEAR, and our security guard looked up and goes, 'E.A., I think this [expletive's] about to be big.' That was a really cool moment, to come back from the pandemic and see that we were still able to grow and that people were so excited to wear it.”Andrews' proudest moment was witnessing Taylor Swift in ""Wear by EA"" gear at the Super Bowl in 2024, which left her in tears as she saw her own outfit. ""And then to see Taylor Swift show up not once but three times in our gear, I was just so thankful that she recognized our small female-owned, female-run business. When she first walked into that Thursday night game in our windbreaker, I was screaming and crying,"" Andrews said.She added, ""And then when she walked into the 2024 AFC Championship in WEAR, I was like, Come on, enough is enough. I wasn’t even thinking of it for the 2024 Super Bowl, so when I saw what she was wearing, I just started crying on the plane, and the flight attendant was like, 'You good?' I was like, 'No, I’ll have a double tequila and water. Thank you.' It was amazing.

Stock market recommendations: According to Bajaj Broking Research, Camlin Fine Sciences and Equinox India Developments are the top stock picks for today. Here’s their view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for February 7, 2025:The Nifty traded in a range with corrective bias in the last two sessions after 1000 points up move in previous seven sessions highlighting consolidation ahead of the RBI Monetary policy outcome.Going ahead, we expect index to trade with a positive bias while sustaining above the support area of 23,400-23,200 and gradually head towards 24,000-24,200 levels in the coming weeks which is the 38.2% retracement of the previous fall (26277-22786) and upper band of the falling channel containing entire decline of the last four months.Key support is placed at 23,200-23,400 levels being the confluence of the last week low, last Tuesday gap up area and past three weeks breakout area. Stock specific action will continue to remain in focus as we sail through the fag end of the Q3FY25 earnings seasons.Volatility is anticipated to remain elevated due to fluctuating global cues, the RBI monetary policy outcome, and the results of the upcoming Delhi elections.On the market breadth front, the percentage of stocks above the 50-day SMA within the Nifty 500 universe has increased from a bearish extreme of 9% last week to 23%. Additionally, the weekly stochastic oscillator has bounced back from the oversold territory and has generated a buy signal, further supporting the positive bias.Bank Nifty in the last two sessions consolidated in a range after rallying 2500 points in the preceding 9 sessions. The index in the process closed above the last three weeks range indicating revival in the upward momentum.We believe 48,900-49,200 to act as immediate support and any dip witnessed hereon should be capitalized as a buying opportunity in quality stock in a staggered manner. We expect the index to head towards 51,200-51,500 levels in the coming sessions being the measuring implication of the last three weeks range breakout and the 50% retracement of the previous decline (53,888-47,844).Volatility is likely to remain elevated on account of RBI monetary policy outcome on Friday. Key support is seen at 48,900-49,200 being the confluence of current week low and 61.8% retracement of the recent up move.The stock is seen breaking above the last five weeks range (140-120) as it is seen rebounding after a base above the 200 days EMA thus offers fresh entry opportunity.The daily RSI is in uptrend thus supports the positive bias. The stock is expected to head higher towards 157 levels in the coming months being the measuring implication of the last five weeks range breakout (140-120).The share price of Equinox India Developments is at the cusp of breakout above the falling supply line joining the highs of CY21 and CY24 thus offers entry opportunityThe stock has formed a good base around the 50 day EMA and is forming higher highs and higher lows in the weekly chart.

For an annual income of Rs 13.7 lakh, with basic salary at 50% (Rs 6.85 lakh), the NPS contribution at 14% would amount to Rs 95,900. Combined with the Rs 75,000 standard deduction, this eliminates tax liability on the entire Rs 13.7 lakh.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 after Budget 2025: Zero income tax on Rs 13.7 lakh salary? Don’t rub your eyes! Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget 2025 speech announced that there will be NIL or zero income tax for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh. But did you know that for salaried individuals, the tax-free annual income can reach Rs 13.7 lakh, compared to Rs 12 lakh for others!“I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable upto income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000,” FM Sitharaman announced in her Union Budget speech.This advantage of no tax till Rs 13.7 lakh income stems from the Rs 75,000 standard deduction and National Pension System (NPS) investments. Section 80CCD(2) allows tax deduction of up to 14% of basic salary invested in NPS, whilst the old tax regime offers 10%.According to an ET analysis, a salaried individual with Rs 13.7 lakh yearly income can achieve tax savings of approximately Rs 96,000 through NPS contributions. It’s important to note that this benefit requires employer participation in NPS as part of cost to the company, as employees cannot opt independently.It’s interesting to note that despite this opportunity existing for nearly a decade, only 2.2 million individuals have enrolled. ""Only a few corporates are interested in rolling out the NPS benefit, and even fewer employees are willing to enrol in it,"" said Sudhir Kaushik, chief executive of tax filing portal Taxspanner.com.Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: Post income tax slab changes, which tax regime is better for salaried middle class taxpayers? The extended NPS lock-in period and withdrawal limitations at maturity discourage many investors. Pre-retirement withdrawals are restricted to exceptional circumstances. Upon maturity, only 60% can be withdrawn, whilst 40% must be invested in an annuity for lifetime pension.Financial experts consider these restrictions beneficial. ""The lack of liquidity in NPS is not necessarily bad because the money is at the right place. Investment returns can be enormous if held for the long term,"" said Sriram Iyer, chief executive of HDFC Pension.NPS provides additional benefits, including asset mix selection, fund switching options, and pension fund manager changes without tax implications. It maintains the industry's lowest fund management charges at 0.09% annually, compared to 1-1.5% for the most economical mutual funds.

Rohan Khaunte: Will not tolerate Goans subletting shacks to Delhiwallahs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/khaunte-will-not-tolerate-goans-subletting-shacks-to-delhiwallahs/articleshow/117701194.cms,"PANAJI:

Tourism minister Rohan Khaunte has instructed the tourism director to initiate an enforcement drive to regulate the operations of shacks, water sports, adventure activities, and other tourism-related activities. Khaunte said the department will not tolerate Goans subletting their shacks to “Delhiwallahs” and outsiders.“Using technology, we will go to the next level and ensure each shack is monitored. From Mandrem to Calangute to the south, mapping has started,” said Khaunte.He said that shack operation was a traditional business of locals and that it “must remain with Goans”. He said the tourism department simplified the allotment process, agreed to all the demands of the Shack Owners Welfare Society , and issued permissions for shacks well in advance with the “belief that a Goan will not give away his own business” to a “Delhiwallah come here to make money”.The minister said that enforcement drives will be continuous. He also said Goan shack operators finding it unviable to operate the allotted shacks should surrender them so that those on the waiting list get a chance. “These Delhiwallahs come here to make money and these incidents happen. We have been very clear that these businesses cannot be allowed to be taken over by outsiders,” said Khaunte.Speaking about paragliding activities, Khaunte said extreme adventure sports are fraught with risks, which tourists and enthusiasts need to understand and accept. “Adventure activities come under extreme sports and such extreme sports will always have some danger. There needs to be safety standards in place. People are illegally doing it in panchayat areas. If there are safety standards and all permissions, anyone can come to the director and get an NOC,” said Khaunte.","Tourism minister Rohan Khaunte has instructed the tourism director to initiate an enforcement drive to regulate the operations of shacks, water sports, adventure activities, and other tourism-related activities.
