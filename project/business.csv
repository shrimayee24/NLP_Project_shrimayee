Was Justice Varma notice in Rajya Sabha just submitted or was it admitted?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/was-varma-notice-in-rajya-sabha-just-submitted-or-was-it-admitted/articleshow/122848328.cms,"High court judge Yashwant Varma (File Photo)

NEW DELHI: Was the notice for the motion of removal of Allahabad HC Justice Yashwant Varma only ""submitted"" or was it ""admitted"" as well. The seemingly technical issue goes to the heart of the fast-paced events that led to the resignation of Vice-President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday evening.It acquires significance because a determination would decide whether the RS Chairman would have a role in the choice of the three members of the investigation panel which, under the Constitution, would examine the veracity of the charges against Justice Varma.Dhankhar is learnt to have earned the annoyance of the govt and the governing coalition by acknowledging the notice given by 63 opposition MPs to seek the launch of proceedings for the HC judge's ouster. Sources termed it as a ""breach-of-faith"" issue by pointing out that the govt had already announced its decision that the process should start in Lok Sabha and had taken the first step by getting 145 MPs from all parties to sign the notice which was submitted to LS Speaker Om Birla on Monday morning.However, Dhankhar sidestepped this, and the RS notice had signatures of only opposition members. Although technically correct, the decision flew in the face of govt's desire to make the proceedings against Justice Varma an all-party concern.On Monday afternoon in RS, Dhankhar cited the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, to say that in a situation where such a notice is given in both Houses on the same day, ""no committee shall be constituted unless the motion has been admitted in both Houses and where such motion has been admitted in both Houses, the committee shall be constituted jointly by the speaker and the chairman"".The ex-chairman said that the motion signed by 63 members ""meets the numerical requirement of setting in motion a process for the removal of an HC judge"" - reference to the stipulation that the motion for removal, in case of RS, needed to be signed by at least 50 members. He stopped short of saying whether the motion has been admitted, but emphasised that the chairman or the speaker has no right to admit or reject if ""a motion is presented on the same day in both the Houses"".However, the 1968 Act doesn't mention such a provision. Dhankhar had directed the RS secretary general to take necessary steps.Sources, however, said the final call on the issue will now be that of the deputy chairperson, Harivansh, who started as the officiating chairman after President Droupadi Murmu accepted Dhankhar's resignation.""There is no certainty he would endorse what Dhankhar observed,"" said a source. ""In any case, he has no special interest in matters concerning judiciary and is unlikely to diverge drastically from the speaker in the choice of the members of the inquiry panel,"" the source further said.",Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned as Rajya Sabha Chairman on Monday evening. He is learnt to have earned the annoyance of the govt and the governing coalition by acknowledging the notice given by 63 opposition MPs to seek the launch of proceedings for the HC judge's ouster.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122848450,imgsize-15858,width-400,resizemode-4/122848450.jpg"
Election for VP must be held 'ASAP' in event of a vacancy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/election-for-vp-must-be-held-asap-in-event-of-a-vacancy/articleshow/122848255.cms,"Former VP Jagdeep Dhankhar

NEW DELHI: Election to the vice-president's office must be held ""as soon as possible"" in the event of a vacancy caused by the death, resignation or removal of the incumbent, according to Article 63(2) of the Constitution. In the normal course, however, such an election must be held before expiration of term of the incumbent.A person who is elected to fill such vice-presidential vacancy caused by death, resignation or removal shall have a full term of five years.As per Article 66 of the Constitution, the vice-president is to be elected by an electoral college comprising members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The election follows the system of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote. In this system, the elector has to mark preferences against the names of the candidates. Preference can be marked in figures only and not in words. The elector can mark as many preferences as the number of candidates. While the marking of first preference is compulsory for the ballot paper to be valid, other preferences are optional.All MPs must vote by secret ballot.Election Commission conducts the election to the office of vice-president in accordance with Article 324 of the Constitution, read with Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952, and the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Rules, 1974.The current electoral college for election of the vice-president comprises 542 Lok Sabha members and 240 Rajya Sabha members. The value of vote of each MP is the same, that is, one.The election process will get underway with announcement of poll schedule by EC, followed by issue of the notification, after which candidates - who must be citizens of India, over 35 years of age and qualified for election to Rajya Sabha - can file their nominations. The returning officer for the election may be secretary general of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, and is appointed by EC in consultation with the central govt.Each nomination must be subscribed by at least 20 electors as proposers and 20 electors as seconders. A security deposit of Rs 15,000 is required to be made along with the nomination paper.Polling for a vice-presidential election is taken on Parliament premises only.For marking the vote, the poll panel will supply particular pens to electors in the polling station. Voting by using any other pen shall lead to invalidation of the vote at the time of counting.Political parties cannot issue any whip to their MPs in the matter of voting in the vice-presidential election.During counting, the number of first preference votes secured by each candidate is ascertained and added up. The total is divided by two and one is added to the quotient disregarding any remainder. The resulting number is the quota sufficient for a candidate to secure his return at the election. If at the end of the first or any subsequent count, the total number of votes credited to any candidate is equal to, or greater than the quota, that candidate is declared elected.","Election to the vice-president's office must be held ""as soon as possible"" in the event of a vacancy caused by the death, resignation or removal of the incumbent.

"Can SC fix timeline for President, governor nod to bills? Centre, states' view sought",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-sc-fix-timeline-for-president-governor-nod-to-bills-centre-states-view-sought/articleshow/122848194.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday swiftly entertained President Droupadi Murmu's reference questioning SC's power and jurisdiction to fix timelines for the President and governors in granting, declining or withholding assent to bills passed by assemblies while brushing aside 'maintainability' objections by Tamil Nadu and Kerala.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar issued notice to the Union and state govts on the presidential reference under Article 143(1) of the Constitution which seeks the SC's opinion on the correctness of the April 8 judgment of an SC bench led by Justice J B Pardiwala granting deemed assent to Tamil Nadu bills using the SC's exclusive powers under Art 142.The bench said it would post preliminary hearing on July 29 to fix a schedule for detailed hearing on issues raised by the President.Senior advocate K K Venugopal, for Kerala, and P Wilson raised the issue of maintainability of the reference. The bench said all questions raised in the reference were open for consideration. However, it said it would hear all parties on the issue of maintainability and asked Wilson not to raise it repeatedly.The bench said attorney general R Venkataramani would assist the court while solicitor general Tushar Mehta would represent the Union govt.On the opposite side were senior advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi, Gopal Subramanium and Rakesh Dwivedi.TOI was the first to report on May 15 about the President sending a reference to the SC for its opinion on the contentious issue of judiciary stepping into the domain of the executive, especially when the Constitution gave no power to the SC to grant deemed assent on behalf of the governor to bills.The reference had said Articles 200 and 201, applicable to governors and the President respectively, “does not stipulate any timeframe or procedure” to be followed by them while considering grant or refusal of assent to a bill passed by an assembly. “The exercise of constitutional discretion by the governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution, respectively, are essentially governed by polycentric considerations, including federalism, uniformity of laws, integrity and security of the nation, doctrine of separation of powers,” the reference had said. Article 200 mandates the governor, on presentation of a bill passed by an assembly, to grant assent or ‘as soon as possible’ return the bill, excluding money bills, for reconsideration by the House. And when the reconsidered bill is presented to the governor, he “shall not withhold assent”, the provision says.However, when a governor reserves a bill for consideration of the President, she under Article 201 is mandated to declare whether she assents to the bill or withholds it. If she directs the governor to return the bill for reconsideration of the House, then upon reconsideration within six months, it “shall be presented again to the President for assent”. It does not fix any timeline for the President.Critical of the SC using its Article 142 powers to rule that the 10 bills pending with the TN governor were deemed to have been assented to, the President had said, “The concept of a deemed assent of the President and the governor is alien to the constitutional scheme and fundamentally circumscribes the powers of the President and the governor.”","President Droupadi Murmu questioned SC's power and jurisdiction to fix timelines for the President and governors in granting, declining or withholding assent to bills passed by assemblies. Tamil Nadu and Kerala raised the issue of maintainability of the reference.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122848202,imgsize-39568,width-400,resizemode-4/122848202.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The auxiliary power unit (APU) located in the tail section of an Air India Airbus A321 (TV-TVG) caught fire at Delhi airport when passengers were disembarking from the aircraft after its arrival from Hong Kong on Tuesday. The aircraft, which had about 170 people on board, was damaged. Luckily passengers and crew were unhurt. The airline has reported this to the regulator. Sources say this could be due to a maintenance issue.An AI spokesperson said: “Flight AI 315, operating from Hong Kong to Delhi on July 22, 2025, experienced an APU fire shortly after it had landed and parked at the gate. The incident occurred while passengers had begun disembarking, and the APU was automatically shut down as per system design. There was some damage to the aircraft, however, passengers and crew members disembarked normally, and are safe. The aircraft has been grounded for further investigations and the regulator has been duly notified. ”According to aviation website Skybrary, APU allows an aircraft to operate autonomously without reliance on ground support equipment such as a ground power unit, an external air-conditioning unit or a high pressure air start cart.“The APU is a small jet engine which is normally located in the tail cone of the aircraft but, in some cases, is located in an engine nacelle or in the wheel well. The APU can be started utilising only the aircraft battery(s) and, once running, will provide electrical power to aircraft systems as well as bleed air for AC and for engine start,” the website says.There have been instances of APU failure of APU fire both on ground and inflight globally. In June 2016, the cabin of a fully loaded Airbus A330 of a foreign airline on ground at London Heathrow was engulfed with smoke and an emergency evacuation had to be initiated. Investigation found that the smoke had been caused when an APU seal failed and hot oil entered the bleed air supply.Also Read: Runway scare: 3 tyres burst, engine damaged as Air India flight veers off course during landing at Mumbai airport In July 2013, passengers still boarding an Air France Boeing 777-300 at Paris CDG felt a burning smell and then thin smoke in the cabin.

Can't keep occupying govt bungalow indefinitely: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-keep-occupying-govt-bungalow-indefinitely-sc/articleshow/122845034.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: After activating the process to wrest the Chief Justice of India's official residence from overstaying ex-CJI D Y Chandrachud, Supreme Court Tuesday said no one can occupy official residence indefinitely and dismissed a former Bihar MLA's plea against Rs 21 lakh penal rent for staying in an upscale bungalow for two years after resigning as a legislator.Appearing before a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria was former Bihar MLA Avinash Kumar Singh, who was ordered to pay a penal rent of Rs 21 lakh for overstaying at his govt bungalow on Taylor Road, Patna, for two years from April 2014 till May 2016.He argued against the ""illegal demand of huge sum"" and said he was entitled to a govt accommodation after being nominated to 'State Legislature Research and Training Bureau' as a 2009 govt notification entitled members of the bureau to MLA-level perks, including a house.The apex court bench dismissed his petition and said, ""Once you resigned as a legislator, you should have vacated the govt bungalow within the stipulated time. No one can hold on to a govt bungalow indefinitely.""The MLA's counsel Anil Mishra told SC that the rent demand for two years at Rs 21 lakh was exorbitant and requested the court to examine this issue. But the bench remained firm, forcing him to withdraw the petition to avail other remedies available in accordance with law.Singh, a five-time MLA from Dhaka constituency, resigned in March 2014 to contest Lok Sabha elections, which he lost. He was later nominated to the bureau. His petition against the demand of rent was dismissed by Patna HC, which had said the 2009 notification did not entitle him to continue in the bungalow earmarked for legislators.""It nowhere provides that a former MLA can retain the same quarters. The notification only allows general benefits such as accommodation, not a specific entitlement to a previous allocation,"" HC had said. It had asked Singh to pay 6% interest per annum on the amount due as rent to Bihar govt.The SC in two renowned judgments - 'Lok Prahari' and 'S D Bandi' cases - had ruled that public figures cannot unauthorisedly occupy govt bungalows using their clout and had ordered all govts to take eviction action against such occupants.","Former Bihar MLA Avinash Kumar Singh was ordered to pay a penal rent of Rs 21 lakh for overstaying at his govt bungalow.

Poll Do you believe businesses should display owner information publicly? Yes, it's necessary for transparency. No, it invades privacy

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed dhaba and restaurant owners along the Kanwar Yatra route to comply with the Uttar Pradesh government’s mandate requiring the display of licence and registration information.“At this stage, all the respective hotel owners shall comply with the mandate of license and registration certificate as required statutorily. We make it clear that we’re not going into the issues being argued. The application stands closed”, the top court stated in its order, as quoted by ANI.Earlier this year, the Uttar Pradesh government issued an order requiring eateries to display QR codes containing information about their owners. Shortly afterward, the Uttarakhand government issued a similar directive.Last week, the apex court had issued notices to the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.The petition, filed by academic Apoorvanand Jha and others, argues that such requirements violate citizens’ fundamental rights and could lead to discriminatory profiling.“The new measures mandate the display of QR codes on all eateries along the Kanwar route, which reveal the names and identities of the owners, thereby achieving the same discriminatory profiling that was previously stayed by this court,” said Jha, citing a June 25 UP government press release.""Vague and overbroad directives deliberately mix up the licensing requirements with the other unlawful demand to display religious identity, and leave scope for violent enforcement of such a manifestly arbitrary demand both by vigilante groups and by authorities on the ground. There is grave and imminent risk of irreparable injury to the fundamental rights of affected vendors, particularly from minority communities, unless this Court issues immediate directions to restrain Respondents from continuing this indirect implementation,"" it added.The plea urged the Court to restrict such mandates to standard licensing norms and eliminate vague directives requiring identity disclosures.Last year, the top court had restrained the UP and Uttarakhand governments from enforcing directives that required shop owners and hawkers along the Kanwar Yatra routes to display their names and those of their staff at their establishments.The Court held that food sellers were only obligated to indicate the type of food they were offering. In its 22 July order, the Court said: ""We deem it appropriate to pass interim order prohibiting the enforcement of the impugned directives. In other words, the food sellers (including dhaba owners, restaurants, foods and vegetable sellers, hawkers, etc) may be required to display the kind of food that they are serving to the kanwariyas. But they must not be forced to display the name/identity of the owners and the employees deployed in their respective establishments.""","The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed dhaba and restaurant owners along the Kanwar Yatra route to comply with the Uttar Pradesh government’s mandate.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has slammed the Telangana Police for converting a civil land dispute into a criminal case at the behest of an influential builder to arrest and harass a retired Major General's 70-year-old widow, quashed the FIR and asked the complainant to pay Rs 10 lakh to her.The Delhi-based woman owned a 500 square yard plot in Gachibowli village in Telangana's Ranga Reddy district. In 2020, the complainant approached her husband for sale of the plot, then valued at Rs 7 crore. Before the deal could materialise, the retired Army officer passed away. As his wife and daughter found it difficult to manage the plot from Delhi, they orally agreed in Oct 2020 to sell it to the complainant for Rs 5.75 crore.The complainant paid Rs 4.05 crore through banking channels and later claimed he had paid Rs 75 lakh in cash. When the officer's widow demanded the balance and refused to sign the sale deed, the complainant lodged a complaint in Dec 2020. Police registered an FIR and arrested her in Jan 2021, resulting in eight-day incarceration. She had unsuccessfully moved Telangana high court for quashing the FIR.Accepting the woman's arguments presented through advocate Vanshaja Shukla, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta slammed the Telangana Police and said, ""In gross disregard to all tenets of law, the impugned FIR was registered for allegations which had no elements of any offence whatsoever what to talk of a cognizable offence.""Writing the judgment, Justice Mehta said, ""The fact that the widow was arrested in this frivolous FIR clearly shows the clout of the company, of which the complainant is an agent, on the police agency as not only did the complainant manage to get FIR registered but, thereafter, also saw to it that she is arrested and humiliated by keeping her in custody for eight days.""SC also criticised the high court for dealing with her quashing plea in a pedantic manner. The HC disposed of her petition in a cryptic manner without even touching the merits of the case, the apex court said.During the hearing of the appeal in SC, the woman had offered to return Rs 4.05 crore paid by the complainant, who refused and demanded interest on the amount to settle the dispute.SC said, ""It is a fit case wherein the complainant should be penalised with exemplary cost for misusing the process of criminal law in a case which was of purely civil nature.""

NEW DELHI: The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Tuesday rejected an appeal from Congress against the I-T department for withdrawing a tax exemption to the party for the assessment year 2018-19 and adding Rs 199 crore as its income through donations.The tribunal, headed by judicial member Satbeer Singh Godara and comprising M Balaganesh, declined to interfere with the department's assessment order against Congress. The I-T order rejected Congress's tax exemption for not filing returns for AY 2018-19 by the due date, and thus, added the income of Rs 199 crore to the party, on which it will be liable to pay tax.The appellate tribunal also refused to allow Congress to net its income against the expenditure on the grounds that it had violated section 13(A) of the I-T Act. The order also found violations of receiving cash donations of more than Rs 14 lakh, which were over Rs 2,000 each. Election Commission guidelines mandate that any donation above Rs 2,000 has to be through bank transfer. Congress's appeal was first rejected by the Commissioner of I-T (Appeal) after which the party approached the tribunal in March 2023.""Whether the assessee's impugned section 13A exemption claim violates clauses (b) and (d) of the first proviso thereto is concerned, we have already held that its return filed on Feb 2, 2019, was a time barred one, and the same stands academic and rejected accordingly,"" the bench observed.On the question of ""netting"" basis - claiming corresponding expenditure against receipts - the tribunal noted that the ""High Court's decision has concluded the very issue in the department's favour - the legal position is that no deduction can be allowed with respect to the expenditure incurred by the political party for any purpose whatsoever if it fails to comply with the basic requirements of the Act's section 13A.

'HC discarded confessions on technicalities'

NEW DELHI: A day after Bombay high court quashed the conviction of all 12 accused found guilty a decade ago for the 2006 Mumbai train blasts that killed 187 and injured 824 people, Supreme Court Tuesday agreed to hear on Thursday an appeal filed by Maharashtra govt challenging the acquittals.State govt told the apex court that HC misdirected itself into trivialities and misread cogent evidence, leading to failure of justice.Evidence had been meticulously collected by the prosecution to establish a chain, inculpating the accused for specific roles discharged by them to strike terror at the heart of the economic capital of India and wage a war against the country, govt added.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench led by CJI BR Gavai, “It (the plea) requires urgent hearing as it has serious ramifications. Can it be listed for hearing on Wednesday?” Gavai said he learnt from news reports that eight accused have already been released from prison. SG said it was true, but the petition required urgent hearing. Finding additional solicitor general Rajkumar Bhaskar Thakre alongside the SG, the CJI said, “It was Thakre who had argued the case before HC. We will list the petition for hearing the day after tomorrow (Thursday).”HC on Monday had acquitted all 12 accused, five of whom were awarded death penalty and the rest life sentences, in the case relating to seven coordinated bomb blasts in as many crowded suburban trains within six minutes from 6.23pm on July 11, 2006. In Sept 2015, the special trial court for crimes under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act had convicted the 12 accused while acquitting one.Maharashtra govt told SC that the evidence clearly pointed to central role of LeT commander Azam Cheema, a Pakistani national, and two other accused who masterminded the attack on Mumbai by sending three groups of terrorists from Pakistan who entered India through Kutch, Gujarat, and through various entry points to India from Bangladesh and Nepal.

NEW DELHI: The world's most expensive earth observation satellite, NISAR, which has been jointly developed by Nasa and Isro, will be launched after much delay from the Sriharikota spaceport at 5.40pm on July 30, the Indian space agency has said. Both India and the US have been working on the Nasa-Isro SAR Mission (NISAR) for over a decade and it has cost them over $1.5 billion.""Historic Launch Ahead... NISAR will scan the entire globe every 12 days, providing high-resolution, all-weather, day-and-night data. It can detect even subtle changes in Earth's surface like ground deformation, ice sheet shifts, and vegetation dynamics,"" Isro posted on X.Speaking to TOI on Tuesday, space minister Jitendra Singh said, ""NISAR will open a new horizon in Indo-US collaboration. The satellite will take images of every piece of Earth. It will not only have scientific applications but also provide new earth science"".The minister, who wanted to witness the crucial launch but may not be able to go to Sriharikota due to Parliament being in session, said that ""crucial data generated from NISAR will, besides being beneficial for the US and India, help other countries in disaster management. Thus, it will live up to PM Modi's dream of Bharat playing the role of Vishwa Bandhu.""India's GSLV-F16 rocket will inject the satellite into a 743-km sun-synchronous orbit with an inclination of 98.4 degrees. NISAR will observe Earth with a swath of 242 km and high spatial resolution, using SweepSAR technology for the first time. The satellite, weighing 2,392 kg, will be the first one to observe the Earth with a dual frequency synthetic aperture radar, with one each provided by Isro (S-band) and Nasa (L-band). The NISAR mission is designed to observe and measure some of the planet's most complex natural processes, including ecosystem disturbances and natural hazards like quakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides.","The world's most expensive earth observation satellite, NISAR, will be launched after much delay from the Sriharikota spaceport at 5.40pm on July 30.

NEW DELHI: The first truly supersonic fighters to be inducted by the Indian Air Force from Russia in 1963 but plagued by an alarmingly high crash rate in later years, the MiG-21s will fly for the last time in Indian skies this Sept.The IAF is now left with only two MiG-21 'Bison' squadrons, totalling 36 fighters, at the Nal airbase in Rajasthan. The ceremonial farewell for the MiG-21s, after over six decades in service, which saw the old warhorses take part in all major conflicts, will take place at Chandigarh on Sept 19.After the first lot of MiG-21s were inducted from Russia, the single-engine jets were produced by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited in large numbers and also underwent upgrades later. The highly-unforgiving and ageing MiG-21s, however, continued to lack modern systems with built-in safety mechanisms.Huge delays in the production of the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft, which were supposed to replace the virtually obsolete MiG-21s, means that the IAF will now be left with just 29 fighter squadrons. This when the IAF authorised 42.5 squadrons for the collusive challenge from China and Pakistan.TOI had earlier reported the two remaining MiG-21 squadrons will be retired this year after the IAF repeatedly deferred the phasing out of the delta-wing jets due to the depletion in the number of its fighter squadrons. The MiG-21 jets and the Cheetah/Chetak helicopters, which number around 350 in the armed forces, in particular, should have been retired at least a couple of decades ago.Of the 872 MiG-21s progressively inducted by IAF, over 400 were lost in accidents since 1971-72. Crashes of different MiG variants, the bulk of them being MiG-21s, have killed well over 200 pilots and 50 civilians on the ground over the decades. The MiG-21s, however, did play a stellar role especially during the 1965 and 1971 wars.","The first truly supersonic fighters to be inducted by the Indian Air Force from Russia in 1963.

Battery fire on Virgin flight from Sydney | Sunrise





A suspected fire triggered by a power bank in carry-on luggage forced emergency response aboard a Virgin Australia flight from Sydney to Hobart on Monday, prompting the airline to review its lithium battery policies.The incident occurred during descent on Flight VA1528, when smoke and flames were seen emanating from an overhead locker.Cabin crew swiftly extinguished the fire before the aircraft landed safely. Upon arrival, firefighters removed the affected bag from the compartment.No injuries to passengers or the flight crew was reported according to Virgin Australia, who issued a statement, quoted by The Guardian saying, “The safety of our guests and crew is always our highest priority, and we commend our cabin crew for their quick action in containing the event. We would also like to thank the emergency services teams who met the aircraft upon arrival.”Matt Cocker, the Chief Operating Officer of Hobart Airport, stated that all passengers safely disembarked the aircraft and one person was assessed by paramedics for suspected smoke inhalation.The airline is now investigating the cause of the fire in coordination with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (Casa).Virgin Australia indicated that the incident may lead to changes in its battery safety protocols.Currently, lithium-ion batteries, including power banks and spare batteries, are restricted to carry-on baggage. Casa has long advised passengers about the risks associated with lithium-powered devices, which can overheat, short-circuit, or ignite.Casa warns that “lithium battery fires can be difficult to extinguish” and says that typical Australian travellers now carry at least four rechargeable battery-powered devices.The agency has also clarified that while items like laptops or cameras may be stored in checked luggage if completely powered off, loose batteries and power banks must remain in cabin bags.According to Casa, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) recorded a 92 per cent increase in lithium battery-related incidents between 2020 and 2022.The Hobart incident follows a January fire aboard an Air Busan Airbus in South Korea, which led to the full evacuation of 176 passengers and crew. Investigators attributed that fire, which destroyed the aircraft, to a malfunctioning power bank.In response to growing concerns, several airlines, including Singapore Airlines, have introduced stricter rules. Singapore Airlines now bans power bank usage entirely during flights.Meanwhile, Virgin Australia said that it will “review its policies regarding the carriage of lithium battery-powered devices” to ensure enhanced safety for all travellers.","A suspected fire triggered by a power bank in carry-on luggage forced emergency response aboard a Virgin Australia flight from Sydney to Hobart on Monday.

Criticism Over Lakers Commitment

has reignited the never-ending GOAT debate by declaring thatknows he will never surpass—not because of talent or longevity, but due to Jordan’s unmatched legacy, emotional impact, and cultural power.Despite LeBron’s historic career and statistical dominance, Cowherd argues the gap between the two legends remains rooted in intangibles Jordan still owns.Colin Cowherd pinpointed three main areas where Michael Jordan remains untouchable:- Brand Power: Jordan’s Air Jordan empire isn’t just a shoe line—it’s a global phenomenon. Cowherd called it “the most powerful marketing campaign in sports history,” noting that LeBron James, despite immense commercial success, hasn’t reached that same transcendent level of influence.- Emotional Connection: Michael Jordan, Cowherd says, “makes you feel something.” His clutch performances and larger-than-life persona created a legacy that goes beyond numbers—a deep, emotional bond with fans that remains strong decades later.- Loyalty and Identity: Cowherd contrasted Jordan’s commitment to the Chicago Bulls with LeBron James’ team-hopping path. While LeBron sought the best basketball situations, Michael Jordan built his dynasty with one team, further cementing his mythos.To be clear, Colin Cowherd gave LeBron James his due. He acknowledged LeBron’s incredible durability and elite play into his 40s, something even Cowherd once said wouldn’t happen. In his 22nd season, LeBron remains one of the league’s top performers, disproving early doubts about his staying power.Cowherd also stated that LeBron may have the most complete resume in basketball history, with All-Star appearances, championships, MVPs, and records piling up year after year.Cowherd illustrated the contrast between Michael Jordan and LeBron James through a pop culture analogy, comparing Jordan toand LeBron to. He described Jordan as—short-lived but iconic, unforgettable, and still a cultural landmark years after its original run. In contrast, LeBron was likened to—a long-running, steady presence that remains relevant but lacks the same explosive cultural moment. This analogy captures how many fans perceive the two legends: Jordan as the singular, unforgettable phenomenon, and LeBron as the enduring force of consistency.Colin Cowherd also criticized LeBron James’ decision to opt into a lucrative deal with the Lakers , claiming it limits the franchise’s ability to build a title-contending roster. He suggested that LeBron may now be prioritizing financial security over chasing a final championship, a shift from the “championship or bust” mentality Michael Jordan represented.Fans and analysts have called for Cowherd to walk back some of his past takes, especially those doubting LeBron’s longevity. But Cowherd stands firm—respecting LeBron’s greatness while still placing Jordan on a higher tier when it comes to legacy and cultural relevance.In Cowherd’s view, LeBron’s greatness lies in performance and longevity, but Michael Jordan’s GOAT status is built on unmatched brand appeal, emotional depth, and singular loyalty. While LeBron James continues to break records, Cowherd believes even he knows that the emotional magic and cultural legacy of Michael Jordan remains unmatched.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers Reportedly Among Five Contenders Eyeing $26.2 Million Golden State Warriors Star in Free Agency The debate will rage on—but Colin Cowherd’s latest comments offer a compelling lens: in the battle between longevity and legend, Jordan still holds the edge.","Colin Cowherd has reignited the never-ending GOAT debate by declaring thatknows he will never surpass.

Nazem Kadri trade talks stall as Toronto Maple Leafs struggle to meet Calgary Flames’ demands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nazem-kadri-trade-talks-stall-as-toronto-maple-leafs-struggle-to-meet-calgary-flames-demands/articleshow/122844865.cms,"(Jeff McIntosh/CP)

Calgary Flames hold firm as Toronto Maple Leafs trade talks for Nazem Kadri stall

Toronto Maple Leafs remain interested in Nazem Kadri trade but face uphill battle with Calgary Flames

FAQs:

1. What is Nazem Kadri’s net worth in 2025?

2.

Who is Nazem Kadri’s wife?

The Toronto Maple Leafs have been actively exploring trade options this offseason to strengthen their roster following Mitch Marner’s departure. One of their top targets has reportedly been Calgary Flames center Nazem Kadri. While Kadri could be an ideal replacement in the lineup, trade talks between the two sides have failed to progress, with Calgary holding firm on its demands and Toronto lacking the assets to make a compelling offer.According to SportsNet’s Nick Kypreos, the Maple Leafs have made multiple attempts this summer to bring Nazem Kadri back to Toronto. However, the Calgary Flames have rebuffed every proposal so far, indicating they are not willing to part with their star center unless the offer is significantly in their favor.Kadri, who recorded 35 goals and 32 assists last season, continues to be a key leader on and off the ice for Calgary. His offensive consistency and veteran presence make him an integral piece of the Flames’ core. That value has translated into a high asking price, one that the Maple Leafs have yet to meet.While Toronto remains interested in a reunion with Kadri, their limited pool of tradable assets is proving to be a major roadblock in negotiations.With Marner gone, the pressure is on general manager Brad Treliving to find a high-impact replacement, but Calgary’s unwillingness to budge has complicated matters.For Toronto, acquiring Kadri would provide an immediate boost at center and bring back a familiar face who played a significant part in the team's previous playoff runs. However, the Flames appear content to keep their top scorer unless they receive an offer they can’t refuse.Toronto’s current cap situation and asset pool make it difficult to put together an enticing package. Without prospects or picks to sweeten the deal, convincing Calgary to move Kadri is increasingly unlikely.While the Maple Leafs remain hopeful of upgrading their roster with a big-name acquisition, a trade for Nazem Kadri looks improbable unless Toronto significantly improves its offer. With Calgary holding firm, the stalemate could persist deep into the offseason unless one side gives ground.Also Read: After Mitch Marner exit, Toronto Maple Leafs weigh trading Morgan Rielly or Brandon Carlo As of 2025, Nazem Kadri’s estimated net worth is between $10 million and $20 million, primarily derived from his NHL contracts with total career earnings of roughly $59 million.Nazem Kadri is married to Ashley Cave; they tied the knot in July 2018 and have a daughter named Naylah.","Calgary Flames hold firm as Toronto Maple Leafs trade talks for Nazem Kadri stall. Kadri recorded 35 goals and 32 assists last season for the Calgary Flames.

A recent study published in Nature Medicine by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialised agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), has issued a stark warning: the world is facing a significant surge in gastric cancer cases, with Asia—and particularly India—bearing the brunt. The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk.Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.India must take public health action against gastric cancerTo reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.",Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions.

Eternal Share Price Rise: What’s the outlook?

Profitability Outlook Mixed Among Analysts

Valuation Milestone Achieved

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Eternal share price today: Eternal Ltd's, Zomato and Blinkit’s parent company, saw its stock reach an unprecedented peak of Rs 311.6 on Tuesday, with the company’s market value crossing Rs 3 lakh crore.This remarkable increase followed exceptional June-quarter results from Blinkit, the company's quick-commerce division, alongside positive management statements that analysts interpreted as distinctly more confident than previous communications.With this, Eternal’s market cap has overtaken that of several notable Nifty 50 companies including Wipro, Tata Motors, JSW Steel, Nestle India, and Asian Paints, according to an ET report.The market responded enthusiastically to Blinkit's exceptional performance, particularly as its net order value (NOV) exceeded Zomato's figures.Following the impressive Q1 results, analysts revised their targets upwards.Jefferies upgraded its recommendation to 'Buy' and set a new target of Rs 400, the highest on the Street, whilst acknowledging their previous overestimation of competition risks.Despite mixed results for the June quarter, Jefferies highlighted that ""management commentary was significantly positive, especially on quick commerce, a departure from earlier quarters.""Emkay Global has highlighted Blinkit's impressive first quarter performance. It said that the company ""registered strong 1Q results, with Blinkit reporting 140% YoY GOV growth and 50bps QoQ improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin."" The firm increased its target price to Rs 330 from Rs 290, maintaining its 'Buy' recommendation.JM Financial noted a significant shift in the company's communication approach. ""Eternal once again surprised us positively on Blinkit. This time though, the surprise was more on management commentary than the reported numbers, as it was quite a contrast to the cautious tone post 4QFY25 results,"" the firm stated.The strategic direction of Eternal caught analysts' attention. ""Over the next 2-3 quarters, Eternal is set to gradually make a transition in the quick commerce (QCom) business, from its current marketplace model to an inventory ownership model; this will drive ~100bps margin expansion, albeit requiring net working capital of ~18 days,"" Emkay reported.Nomura outlined a path towards financial sustainability, projecting ""Blinkit to break-even at adjusted EBITDA level in 4Q FY26F"". The firm noted that ""Blinkit management expects lower absolute growth in adj EBITDA in coming quarters as it continues to rationalize marketing spends.""Nevertheless, certain analysts remained sceptical. Macquarie maintained its pessimistic stance, keeping an 'Underperform' rating and Rs 150 target price. The brokerage expressed concerns about the implied Blinkit valuation of $15bn at current share prices, given unproven economics and heightened competition in the sector.The company's Tuesday surge pushed Eternal's market capitalisation briefly to Rs 3 lakh crore, surpassing several prominent Nifty 50 constituents, including Wipro, Tata Motors, JSW Steel, Nestle India, Coal India, Bajaj Auto, Asian Paints, Eicher Motors, Tech Mahindra and Cipla.Eternal's shares have demonstrated strong performance, recording a 33% increase over the previous 12 months, whilst gaining 7% in 2025.","Eternal Ltd's, Zomato and Blinkit’s parent company, saw its stock reach an unprecedented peak of Rs 311.6 on Tuesday.

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power. Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, says he would study the physical sciences if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025.

Astronomer CEO's moving forward note



Who is Pete DeJoy



Astronomer's new CEO, Pete DeJoy , addressed the recent Coldplay ""kiss cam"" scandal, noting that the New York-based AI company has gained widespread recognition. DeJoy, a co-founder, assumed leadership after former CEO Andy Byron stepped down. Byron resigned following public attention from being caught on the kiss cam with Astronomer's HR head, Kristin Cabot, at a Coldplay concert in Boston. During the incident, Byron was seen embracing Cabot, both attempting to shield their faces from the camera as it panned on them.Their reaction made the band’s frontman Chris Martin to joke: “Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy.” The video quickly went viral, with Astronomer leading all headlines. The Internet also went wild on memes of the two.Late last week, Astronomer announced the resignation of Andy Byron as CEO and announced founder Pete DeJoy as the new CEO. On what appears to be his first working Monday, Pete DeJoy seems to have started the day with a note on Andy Byron scandal and the way forward for the company.The new interim CEO of Astronomer broke his silence on the Coldplay “kiss cam” scandal — and gushed that the small, New York-based AI firm is now a “household name.” Brooklynite Pete DeJoy, the company’s co-founder, took the reins at Astronomer over the weekend after its disgraced boss Andy Byron resigned after being caught on the kiss cam cozying up with Kristin Cabot, the company’s head of HR.Byron, after being spotted on the kiss cam with his arms wrapped around Cabot at last week’s Coldplay concert in Boston, literally ducked out of view as Cabot turned her back to the camera and rushed to cover her face with her hands.Over the weekend, I stepped into the role of Interim CEO at Astronomer, a company that I’ve proudly poured my entire professional life into helping build.Over the past few years, our business has experienced incredible growth.

The bill solves 10 problems



Myth vs fact



Age and tenure relaxation



The govt will introduce the much-awaited ‘National Sports Governance Bill 2025’ in the Parliament on Wednesday, with a hope that the passage of the legislation will create a legal framework for transparent and fair functioning of national federations (NSFs), and protect athletes through safe sport and grievance redressal systems.The bill aims to provide for the promotion of sports, athletes’ welfare and ethical practices in sports; to establish standards for the governance of NSFs and to institute measures for the resolution of administrative disputes.Alongside the governance bill, the govt will also table the ‘National Anti-Doping (Amendment) Bill, 2025’ in the Lower House to “bring the 2022 anti-doping act in line with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) Code and global standards, and to ensure that both the panels – anti-doping disciplinary (ADDP) and appeals (ADAP) — work independently”.It will be a major achievement for the BJP-led NDA govt, as the governance bill had previously been returned twice from the Cabinet and once from the Parliament after a consensus couldn’t be reached over the proposed legislation.One of the major highlights of the bill is that the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) will come under its purview as an NSF. Like any other federation, BCCI will have to apply for annual recognition afresh once the bill becomes an Act and all the board’s ongoing and future litigations will be resolved by the proposed ‘National Sports Tribunal’.BCCI or its affiliated state associations can’t directly approach various courts of the country in case of any dispute. Once the board’s elections are done in Sept, the national cricket body will be required to take recognition from the soon-tobe-formulated ‘National Sports Board’, even though it is not reliant on govt funding.“Like all NSFs, the BCCI will have to comply with the law of the land once the bill becomes an Act. The Board doesn’t take ministry funding but an Act of Parliament applies to them. They will remain an autonomous body like all other NSFs but their disputes, if any, will also come to the National Sports Tribunal which will become the dispute resolution body for sports matters ranging from elections to selection. However, this bill does not mean govt control over any NSF. The govt will be a facilitator in ensuring good governance, not an enforcer,” a ministry official said.The bill aims to resolve 10 issues plaguing Indian sports: frequent litigation over NSF elections and athlete selections; lack of a dedicated dispute resolution forum; weak or token athlete representation in federations; gender imbalance in sports leadership; no standard electoral process across federations; financial opacity and poor governance in NSFs; absence of internal grievance redressal systems; multiple court interventions delaying sports events; no legal recognition for safe sport mechanisms and limited enforceability of Code provisions till now.The bill dispels notions that the govt will control the NSFs and the tribunal will override courts. The ministry official informed: “The bill ensures autonomy while enforcing basic governance standards.”The bill provides for relaxation in the contentious age and tenure provisions. Sources have informed that the office bearers of NSFs — including president, secretary general and treasurer — can continue in their posts even after attaining the age of 70 to complete their respective terms.The office bearers don’t have to relinquish office after reaching the age of 70. So, if an office-bearer contests for a position in a federation and he/she is 69 years and 364 days old at the time of his/her election after the voting, the person can continue to complete his/her full mandated term without relinquishing office.As far as the tenure is concerned, the bill says “The president, secretary and treasurer shall be eligible for election to the executive committee after a cooling-off period of one term, provided they have held the position for the last three consecutive terms. A term shall not be of more than four years which will be a total of 12 years (three terms of four year each).”","The govt will introduce the much-awaited ‘National Sports Governance Bill 2025’ in the Parliament on Wednesday.

Passport index: India makes strongest jump to rank 77th,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/henley-passport-index-india-ranks-77th-chcek-list/articleshow/122849651.cms,"Representative image (TOI)

The Indian passport has made a strong recovery, climbing eight spots in the latest Henley Passport Index, its strongest jump to date.India now holds the 77th position, an improvement from its 85th ranking last year, this comes after last year saw India drop five places in ranking.The Henley Passport Index evaluates the strength of passports based on the number of destinations their holders can access without a visa or with visa-on-arrival privileges. This year's advancement signals a positive shift in global mobility for Indian passport holders.The latest improvement comes on the back of 59 destinations Indian passport holders can get a visa free entry to, adding two more destinations to its roster. Some countries which offer visa-free access include Malaysia, Indonesia, Maldives, Thailand, whereas countries that give visa-on-arrival facilities include Sri-Lanka, Macau, Myanmar and others.The latest index highlights a shift in global mobility trends, with Asian nations emerging as the new leaders. India’s rise in the rankings comes amid a gradual decline in the strength of traditionally dominant passports like those of the United States and the United Kingdom.“The consolidation we’re seeing at the top underscores that access is earned - and must be maintained - through active and strategic diplomacy. Nations that proactively negotiate visa waivers and nurture reciprocal agreements continue to rise, while the opposite applies to those that are less engaged in such efforts,” said Dr Christian H Kaelin, inventor of the passport index concept.According to a statement issued by Dr Juerg Steffen, CEO of Henley & Partners, this shift reflects a major transformation in global migration patterns, largely influenced by evolving political dynamics and diplomatic realignments.“Americans are now leading the demand worldwide for alternative residence and citizenship options, with British nationals also among the top five globally. As the US and UK adopt increasingly inward-looking policies, we’re witnessing a marked rise in interest from their citizens seeking greater global access and security,” Steffen said in a press release.He went on to emphasise upon the importance of passport rankings as more than just travel ease and convenience.“Your passport is no longer just a travel document - it’s a reflection of your country’s diplomatic influence and international relationships. In an era of growing inequality and mounting geopolitical uncertainty, strategic mobility and citizenship planning are more critical than ever,”While Asian countries like India, UAE, China and Saudi Arabia are steadily improving their mobility scores, the United States and United Kingdom are experiencing a gradual decline. The UK has fallen to sixth place, while the US has dropped to tenth and now sits on the edge of dropping out of the top 10 for the first time in the index's 20-year history.Whereas UAE has jumped 34 spots to enter top 10 at number eight in the last decade, also the only country to break into top 10 in the same duration. China has improved its ranking from 94 in 2015 to 60th this year.Singapore retains its position as the world's most powerful passport, granting visa-free access to 193 destinations. On the other end, Afghanistan ranks lowest, with its passport holders able to travel visa-free to just 25 countries. While there’s been some movement at the top, European nations continue to dominate global mobility rankings.Japan and South Korea hold second place with access to 190 destinations, followed by seven EU countries, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Finland, Denmark, and Ireland, tied for third with 189 destinations.Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden share fourth place with visa-free access to 188 destinations, while New Zealand, Switzerland, and Greece round out the top five.","India now holds the 77th position, an improvement from its 85th ranking last year.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

What happens if the Cabot couple file for divorce



New details about Astronomer’s HR head Kristin Cabot has emerged in the ongoing fallout from the viral Coldplay ‘Kiss Cam’ scandal. Astronomer CEO Andy Byron has resigned from his position after the scandal, but Cabot is still on leave. Now an online report reveals that Cabot and her husband Andrew Cabot took $1.6 million mortgage just before five months from the viral incident. According to a report by The Sun, the couple mortgaged their luxury home on Rye for the amount. It is a four-bedroom estate located near the coast. This new information raises questions about the complexities they could face if their marriage were to end in divorce, according to legal experts.According to a report by The Sun, the Kristin Cabot and her husband Andrew Cabot, the CEO of Privateer Rum obtained 1 $1.6 million mortgage from Morgan Stanley in March this year. The coupled borrowed the amount in lieu of their $2.2 million property on the New Hampshire cost. However, after the viral ‘Kiss Cam’ incident which happened at the recent Coldplay concert there are speculations that the couple might head for a divorce. Now legal experts explain what will happen to the property if the couple files for divorce.As reported by The Sun, legal experts suggest that a shared mortgage can definitely complicate the divorce proceedings. If the couple were divorce, then both of them will remain legally responsible for the payments related to mortgage. The experts also suggest that the most easiest solution is to sell the property. The couple can sell the house and divide the amount after paying off the mortgage.On the other hand, one spouse can also refinance the mortgage solely in their name, taking on full financial responsibility for the loan. Also, the spouse who wishes to keep the property could ""buy out"" the other's share of the equity, often by refinancing or using other assets.Attorney William Cafaro told The Sun that high-value loans like this often become “leverage points” in divorce negotiations. “It’s not just about who gets the house—it’s about who can afford to keep it,” he said.","Kristin Cabot and her husband Andrew took out a $1.6M mortgage for a coastal New Hampshire home amid Coldplay kiss cam scandal.

Helpful call to friend





Bengaluru: In a chilling reminder of how far cybercriminals will go, two women were digitally held hostage and forced to strip by fake cops in a digital arrest scam . The criminals had ordered the women to disrobe as part of an online ""physical examination"" to identify birth marks and moles.The women, who are childhood friends, realised they were victims of online fraud and extortion only when they reached out to another friend after being held hostage by the cybercriminals for nearly nine hours, despite having transferred Rs 58,447 to them. A complaint has been lodged with the East CEN Crime police.While Anne (name changed) is a resident of the city, her friend Richa, who works in Thailand as an instructor, was on a visit to Bengaluru when the duo got trapped in a web of deception.Their ordeal started at 11am on July 17 when Richa received a call from the number 8856062795. The caller introduced himself as a police officer from Colaba police station in Mumbai and accused her of being involved in money laundering linked to Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal. He also accused her of being involved in human trafficking and a murder case.A shocked Richa tried to explain she was on a visit to India and had no connection to the case.The caller, however, shared details of a debit card she was using and managed to scare her of arrest.Spooked on being furnished with her personal debit card details and official-looking documents, including forged arrest warrants and Central Bureau of Investigation ID cards, Anne also was convinced and fell prey to the ruse. While more fraudsters joined in, the women were made to believe the call was being made from a police station.To further deceive the women, the fraudsters made a video call claiming to connect them to officers from CBI. The crooks told the women they had to be kept under digital arrest at home, and had to stay on a WhatsApp video call for 24 hours.They told the victims that according to Reserve Bank rules, the transactions done from their bank accounts needed to be verified. The women were told to transfer money to an account provided by the fraudsters, on the promise it would be returned after the verification process if the money wasn't found to be black. Richa transferred Rs 58,447 from her bank account. The fraudsters also impersonated officials from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and Delhi police.After receiving the money, the fraudsters told the victims they needed to get clearance, for which they had to undergo a medical examination online. This was to identify and ensure there were no ""bullet marks, moles, or tattoos"" on their bodies. The women were asked to strip naked and follow instructions, which they complied with, Anne told police, adding that she was also told that her entire house was under surveillance and an arrest warrant was issued against Richa.A senior police officer said the women had no idea that the fraudsters were recording them nude under the pretext of medical examination. When the women stripped, the miscreants also allegedly body shamed them.After suffering tremendous pressure and harassment, Richa decided to reach out to a friend for assistance. She made a WhatsApp call around 8pm, and after she explained the ordeal, the friend advised her to disconnect all the calls and not transfer any more money.After the call was disconnected, the fraudsters attempted to reach the women again and sent across their nude photos and videos, threatening to make them public.Anne told police that the photos and videos shared by the fraudsters to both their phones weren't downloaded or saved. They deleted them as they had been digitally and physically abused and under tremendous fear and shame for nine hours.A senior police officer said a case has been registered under various sections of the Information Technology Act and Section 318 (cheating) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.","Two women were digitally held hostage and forced to strip by fake cops in a digital arrest scam.

The change was made quietly on Monday and follows an executive order by president Donald Trump, signed in February this year.The new rule appears under the “Athlete safety policy” section on the USOPC website. It does not directly mention the word “transgender” or the name of Trump’s order — “Keeping men out of women’s sports.” Instead, it refers to it as “Executive order 14201.” No details have been shared yet about how the ban will be enforced.This policy change means that all sports federations in the US, including those for youth and amateur athletes, will now have to follow the same rule. Leaders of several Olympic sports confirmed that national bodies must now comply with the USOPC’s decision. The Olympic committee has 54 member organisations, according to its website.The USOPC confirmed the rule change in a statement on Tuesday. It said it had been in talks with federal officials since the executive order was signed. “As a federally chartered organisation, we have an obligation to comply with federal expectations,” the statement said as quoted by New York Times.The committee also said it would help national sports bodies to follow the new rule.USA Fencing, one of the sports bodies under the Olympic umbrella, has already updated its policy. Starting 1 August, transgender women can no longer compete in the women’s category and must join the men’s events. The same rule applies to nonbinary, transgender men, and intersex athletes.The Olympic committee said it aimed to “protect opportunities for athletes” and would coordinate with global bodies like the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee to ensure women’s sports remain “fair and safe.”Until now, the USOPC had left decisions on transgender athletes to each sport’s governing body. It had earlier said it would rely on “real data and science” instead of ideology and that decisions should be made on a sport-by-sport basis.The IOC has also struggled with the issue over the years. It currently lets international sports bodies like World Athletics or the International Cycling Federation decide how to handle transgender participation in global events.","United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has updated its rules to ban transgender women from competing in women’s Olympic sports.

United States and Indonesia have agreed on a new trade deal that will reduce tariffs and allow more American goods into the Southeast Asian country.The White House said that Indonesia will also ease its export restrictions on critical minerals like nickel, copper and cobalt — which are key for electric vehicles and electronics.Under the deal, US will lower a planned tariff on Indonesian products from 32 percent to 19 percent. However, items suspected of being transshipped to avoid duties will face a higher 40 percent rate.US president Donald Trump celebrated the agreement on his social media platform, Truth Social on Tuesday, calling it a “huge win” for American businesses. He said Indonesia will cut 99 percent of its tariff barriers, making it easier for US companies to sell industrial, tech and agricultural goods there.In return, Indonesia is expected to buy American products, including Boeing aircraft, farm produce and energy.A US official said the deal could be worth at least $50 billion for the US in terms of new trade and purchases. The official also said Indonesia will no longer try to tax cross-border data flows — something the US had opposed — and will accept US vehicle safety standards.The agreement comes ahead of a 1 August deadline, when the US is set to raise tariffs on several countries. Similar trade deals have also been announced with Britain, Vietnam and the Philippines.","U.S. and Indonesia have agreed on a new trade deal that will reduce tariffs and allow more American goods into the Southeast Asian country.

Trump vs Jerome Powell: Scott Bessent softens tone; suggests Fed chief 'shouldn’t step down right now’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vs-jerome-powell-scott-bessent-softens-tone-suggests-fed-chief-shouldnt-step-down-right-now/articleshow/122843097.cms,"AP photo

Bessent calls for review of 'the entire' Federal Reserve





US treasury secretary scott Bessent said on Tuesday he saw no immediate reason for federal reserve chair Jerome Powell to step down. This comes just a day after Bessent publicly called for a full review of the Fed’s operations beyond its main role in setting interest rates.Speaking to Fox Business, Bessent said, “There’s nothing that tells me that he should step down right now.” He also noted that Powell’s term ends in May 2026 and that he should be allowed to complete it—unless he chooses to leave early.The comment follows rising pressure from US president Donald Trump’s administration for the Fed to cut interest rates. Trump has been sharply critical of Powell in recent weeks, especially over the central bank’s $2.5 billion renovation of its headquarters. While Trump said Powell has done a “bad job,” he also said it’s unlikely he’ll remove him before his term ends.Late Monday, Bessent posted on X calling for an “exhaustive internal review” of the Fed’s non-monetary operations. He said the bank’s independence was vital for economic stability but warned it was being threatened by “mandate creep,”—saying the Fed was taking on tasks outside its core responsibilities. He did not give examples.Earlier on CNBC, Bessent said the entire Federal Reserve should be evaluated for effectiveness.Meanwhile, Fed vice chair Michelle Bowman defended the bank’s independence and said it's “very important” for setting monetary policy.The Fed has held interest rates steady this year while assessing the impact of Trump’s new tariffs. Trump argues that rates should be three percentage points lower, saying it would ease debt costs. But Fed officials are cautious, warning that cutting rates too soon could raise consumer prices.The Fed holds its next policy meeting at month-end, and is widely expected to keep rates unchanged again.",US treasury secretary scott Bessent said on Tuesday he saw no immediate reason for federal reserve chair Jerome Powell to step down.
