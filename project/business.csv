Election Commission Reforms: Election Commission to implement electronic death data integration to clean voter rolls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/election-commission-to-implement-electronic-death-data-integration-to-clean-voter-rolls/articleshow/120811080.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Introducing an important reform aimed at cleaning the electoral roll, the Election Commission on Thursday said it would obtain deaths registration data electronically from Registrar General of India, which maintains mandatory database of all births and deaths in line with the amendments made to Registration of Births and Deaths Act (RBD Act) in 2023. This would eliminate the dependence on field visits by the booth level officers (BLO) to gather data on dead voters in a household, so that they can be removed from the roll.The BLO will, however, still be required to make field visits to re-verify the information of deaths received from the RGI database, said an EC official.In two other reforms approved by commission on Thursday, the format of the voter information slips shall be revised to prominently display voter details; and standard photo identity cards issued to all BLOs to help the citizens recognise them and verify their identity. While the redesigned voter slip will make it easier for the electors to identify their polling station and for the polling officials to efficiently locate their names in the roll, the identity cards will help the citizens interact with BLOs more confidently during house-to-house visits for voter verification and registration.As per the system followed so far for dead voters, either their kin could apply through Form 7 for removal of the deceased elector from the roll, followed by a verification visit by the BLO, or the BLO would himself initiate the process during a field visit for roll updation. Form 7 would then be processed by the ERO to remove the dead voter permanently from the roll. However, this process sometimes involved a time-lag between death of a voter and his removal from the roll, creating scope for bogus or unnecessary entries.“The Commission will now obtain death registration data electronically from the RGI in line with Rule 9 of the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960 and Section 3(5)(b) of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 (as amended in 2023). This will ensure that the EROs receive timely information about registered deaths. This will also enable BLOs to re-verify the information through field visits, without waiting for a formal request under Form 7,” EC said in a statement issued on Thursday.Sources said while the RBD (Amendment) Act, 2023, also allows RGI to share births database with the EC — since it can help ascertain when a citizen by birth turns 18 years of age and should be enrolled, this reform may need to wait longer as registration of births and deaths was made mandatory only in 2023. “For now, EC is focusing on getting data on deaths,” a senior officer told TOI.","The Election Commission on Thursday said it would obtain deaths registration data electronically from Registrar General of India.

Government to rank districts on road safety parameters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-rank-districts-on-road-safety-parameters/articleshow/120807285.cms,"NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from the Swachhata ranking of cities, the govt will carry out ranking of districts on road safety parameters. Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday directed his ministry to work out the details for carrying out the exercise which will also determine the best and worst performers.The minister issued this direction while chairing a day-long brainstorming session on road safety with officials from different ministries, state govts and experts. Sources said the ministry will work with the Niti Aayog to finalise the parameters.Gadkari also instructed officials to integrate “safe school zone” while planning construction and expansion of roads. District road safety committees (DRSCs) will include this provision while evaluating any plan, sources said. DRSCs will play a crucial role in the implementation of the Centre’s major schemes such as cashless treatment to road crash victims and giving financial rewards to good samaritans who take crash victims to hospitals for immediate medical care.Sources said responding to a suggestion on the need to have experts to assist DRSCs, road transport secretary V Umashankar said industry bodies such as CII and FICCI can extend their support.","Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari directed his ministry to work out the details for carrying out the exercise.

Navy intensifies muscle-flexing against Pakistan even as small arms fire continues across LoC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-attack-aftermath-navy-intensifies-muscle-flexing-against-pakistan-even-as-small-arms-fire-continues-across-loc/articleshow/120803512.cms,"NEW DELHI: Navy has further intensified its muscle-flexing against Pakistan by issuing another warning for ships to stay away from specified coordinates in the northern Arabian Sea due to its firing drills, as the exchange of small arms fire continues unabated between the rival armies along the Line of Control in J&K.The ""NavArea' warning for the specified zone off Gujarat till May 3, incidentally, is just around 80-85 nautical miles from where the Pakistan Navy is undertaking its own drills in the Arabian Sea. ""We have made it clear that if any warship or ship enters that zone, she will do so at its own peril,"" an officer said.Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi took stock of his force's operational readiness during a visit to the Western Navy Command in Mumbai Thursday. The review came even as Navy has deployed several warships in the Arabian Sea, which conducted multiple firings of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other weapon systems last week.China, which has the world's largest Navy with over 370 warships and submarines, is assiduously helping Pakistan build a strong maritime force. Pakistan has already inducted four latest Type 054A/P multi-role frigates and other platforms from China. It's slated to soon get eight Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines, with air-independent propulsion, in a major capability jump for India's western adversary.Amid the heightened tensions with Pakistan, IAF is undertaking long-range day and night fighter sorties, while also keeping its air defence network with a variety of surface-to-air missile systems in full alert mode.While IAF has increased the number of ORPs (operational readiness platforms) at its air bases, especially in the western sector, the force is also slated to practice operations of supersonic fighter jets like Rafales, Jaguars and Mirage-2000s, transport aircraft and helicopters on an emergency landing facility (ELF) on the Ganga Expressway in UP on Friday.This will be the fourth such ELT on expressways in UP, and the first to support day and night landings. Such ELT airstrips being established in different parts of the country, with reinforced cement concrete construction on national highways or expressways, can provide operational flexibility during conflicts.If an adversary bombs air bases, for instance, such ELTs can be used for unhindered air operations using mobile air traffic and radar control, refueling and armament-loading facilities, say officers. Pakistan and several other countries like Germany, Sweden, South Korea, Taiwan, Finland, Switzerland, Poland and Singapore also have dedicated stretches on their highways and expressways for aircraft to land and take off in emergencies or war-like events.The ceasefire along the 778-km LoC and 198-km international boundary in J&K has frayed since the Pahalgam attack, with Army Thursday saying Pakistan army posts had opened unprovoked small arms fire across LoC in Kupwara, Uri and Akhnoor sectors.","Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi took stock of his force's operational readiness during a visit to the Western Navy Command in Mumbai Thursday.

Developed under a public-private partnership by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), the Rs 8,867-crore project is expected to significantly enhance India's cargo-handling capacity and reduce dependence on foreign ports like Colombo.Ahead of the inauguration, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a post on X that the port represents the largest investment ever made by any Indian state in a port project, with two-thirds of the cost borne by the Kerala government. He described the commissioning as a ""historic moment"" and a ""new chapter"" in India’s maritime development.Vizhinjam’s strategic location—just 10 nautical miles from a key international shipping route—and naturally deep waters make it ideal for accommodating large container vessels. Until now, 75% of India’s transshipment traffic was handled abroad, leading to foreign exchange losses. Vizhinjam aims to change that by reclaiming a substantial share of this traffic.The port boasts India’s first semi-automated operations, featuring AI-enabled vessel traffic management developed with IIT Madras, fully automated yard cranes, and remotely operated ship-to-shore cranes. Its breakwater—one of the deepest in the country—extends nearly three kilometres and stands 28 metres tall.Trial operations began in July 2024, and full commercial operations started in December. Over 272 large vessels have docked at the port during this phase, handling over 550,000 containers.Vizhinjam has already made significant gains, including becoming part of the Jade Service operated by MSC, the world’s largest shipping company. The port now shares routes with global hubs like Shanghai, Singapore, and Busan. Cargo ships on this route will sail from Singapore to Vizhinjam before heading to ports in Spain and Italy.With the first phase of development complete, the second phase—costing Rs 10,000 crore and fully funded by Adani Ports—is expected to be completed by 2028, taking annual capacity to 3 million TEUs.Plans are also underway to turn Vizhinjam into a multi-modal logistics hub, with direct highway connectivity via NH-66, Kerala’s first cloverleaf interchange, and an upcoming railway link to the national network.The Vizhinjam International Seaport, now operational, is being hailed as a major step forward in India's bid to become a global maritime power.","PM Modi will officially commission the Vizhinjam International Seaport on Friday.

He added that those responsible for the attack will be held accountable and given appropriate response.""Today, they should not think that by killing 27 citizens, they have won the war. I want to tell all the perpetrators of terrorism that this is not the end of the fight but only a turning point... ek makam hai, har vyakti ko chun-chun kar jawab milega, jawab bhi liya jayega (each one involved will be given a fitting response and will be held accountable too),"" Shah said in his first public speech after the slaughter of tourists at Pahalgam.Shah, who was addressing a meeting after the unveiling of the statue of Upendranath Brahma, a leading figure among the Bodos, in Delhi, asserted that the fight against terrorists and their backers would continue until each one of perpetrators is punished.Shah said BJP govt, under PM Modi's leadership, has effectively tackled terror threats everywhere - be it in the northeast, areas impacted by left-wing extremism, or in Kashmir - and has given befitting responses. ""If anyone thinks that a cowardly attack is their big victory, they must remember this is Narendra Modi's India - none will be spared. Our resolve is to uproot terrorism from every inch of India, and it will become a reality,"" he added.Soon after the terror attack, the home minister had rushed to Srinagar and visited Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam. He met the grieving families and vowed that the ""culprits of this dastardly terror attack will not be spared"".Last week, the PM in his first remarks at a public event in Bihar, had issued a similar warning. ""We will go to the ends of the earth to find the perpetrators,"" he had said.Shah, in his address, said no Bodo should have an inferiority complex; they have the same rights in the country as the home minister himself.Recalling the signing of Bodo Accord in 2020 after nine months of discussions, Shah said everyone dropped their weapons and joined the mainstream. ""I want to tell all tribes that BJP govt honours the pacts it signs. We are implementing several agreements that were signed before us. They (earlier govts) did not follow them. We have cleared 96% of issues that were part of Bodo Accord. We will resolve 100% issues before next election in Assam,"" he added.The home minister said that Modi govt has signed over 20 accords in the northeast and over 10,000 people have surrendered and integrated inro the society. ""On an average, 78% of the issues have been resolved in the past four years... This shows what we do what we say,"" he added.Earlier, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sharma highlighted the progress made in the state under BJP rule and said that the state, which previously used to see violence, now hardly reports any incidents.","Home minister Amit Shah said terrorists are mistaken if they believe that by killing innocent civilians in Pahalgam, they have won the war.

NEW DELHI: More than 32 years after a man sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl, the long arm of the law finally caught up with him as Supreme Court overturned a trial court verdict acquitting the then 21-year-old, who is now 54, and ordered him to undergo a 10-year sentence.""We would like to know who this daredevil sessions judge is who acquitted the man despite forensic science laboratory report, and statements of doctors and duty magistrate corroborating the girl's version of sexual assault,"" SC said while upholding a Gujarat HC decision to set aside the trial court verdict.A year after the incident, the additional sessions judge, Ahmedabad (rural), in Oct 1994 acquitted the man, who was charged with sexually assaulting the girl in an agricultural field. The injured girl was taken to hospital and the relatives waited for the sarpanch to come to help them in filing the FIR. Medical examination proved she was raped.The trial court, without taking into consideration the circumstances, had recorded the delay of 48 hours in FIR registration as one of the grounds for acquitting the accused.The appeal filed by the state in HC remained pending for 30 years. Finally, a bench of Justices Aniruddha P Mayee and Divyesh A Joshi, on Nov 14 last year, set aside the trial court decision to acquit the man. It convicted him under Sections 376 and 506 of IPC and sentenced him to imprisonment for 10 years and a fine of Rs 10,000.Rejecting arguments for not imposing any sentence after 31 years on the man, who is now married and has a family to support, HC had said, “If a perpetrator of a crime is set free, the concept of deterrent theory may not work and there might be adverse effect on society. Moreover, it is a 10-year-old girl who was subjected to sexual assault.” The SC bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh, agreeing with the HC judgment, revoked its order of Nov 14 last year and ordered the convict to surrender within a week.","Supreme Court overturned a trial court verdict acquitting the then 21-year-old, who is now 54.

India's billion plus stories will fuel economic growth: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-billion-stories-will-fuel-eco-growth-pm-modi/articleshow/120803193.cms,"Dream big & tell your story: PM to creators & investors



MUMBAI: Today, when the world is looking for new ways of storytelling, India with its ""timeless treasures"" can help build an Orange Economy of content, creativity and culture, PM Modi said at the World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) in Mumbai Thursday.Stressing on the event's potential as a platform for entertainers and investors to connect and collaborate, he said it could transform India into the world's third-largest economy.The arc of Indian cinema beginning with Dadasaheb Phalke's Raja Harishchandra in 1913, the PM said, has widened over the years with the popularity of Raj Kapoor in Russia, Satyajit Ray at Cannes and the Oscar-winning RRR.The creative economy 's contribution to GDP is set to increase significantly, he said.India is not only home to a billion-plus population, but also a billion-plus stories,” said the PM, adding that every street in the country has a story, every mountain carries a song, and every river hums a tune. Cautioning against potential dehumanisation resulting from technological advancements in the creative industries, Modi stressed the necessity of retaining emotional depth and intellectual richness in expression.Advising creators and investors to “dream big and tell your story”, he urged them to invest in people, not just platforms. “We must not turn humans into robots; instead, we must make them more enriched and sensitive,” he said, noting that genuine progress should factor in the arts—including music, dance and painting — not just information, technology, or speed.As an example, Modi cited the $430-billion global animation market which is projected to double in the next decade. The PM said this presents a significant opportunity for India’s animation and graphics industry, which could leverage the expansion for greater reach. “Indian films have now reached audiences across the globe. Today, Indian films are screened in more than 100 countries. Foreign audiences are not just watching Indian films but also trying to understand them. A notable aspect of Indian cinema is that many international viewers are watching Indian content with subtitles. India has become a global hub for film production, digital content, gaming, fashion, and music,” he said, pointing to the tenfold growth in the OTT segment in recent years.India is a world leader in global fintech adoption and the second-largest mobile manufacturer, he added, showing the way forward in other areas such as the creative fields. He also noted Indian cuisine’s global popularity and expressed confidence in similar recognition for Indian music — ‘Khaana’ is becoming popular worldwide; similarly, ‘gaana’ also has tremendous potential for growth, said Modi.The Centre has now allocated Rs 400 crore to build the first Indian Institute of Creative Technology (IICT) in Mumbai, a decision that was reiterated by Information and Broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw at the event. IICT is all set to become a national hub for the Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality sector. Work on the institute has already commenced. “IICT has aligned with a few tech giants for collaborative efforts towards courses. These include NVIDIA, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Star India, and Adobe,” said Vaishnaw. Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said Mumbai’s Film City, spread over 500 acres, is being developed into a global centre for next-generation studio ecosystems. Of this, 120 acres will be dedicated to a media and entertainment city focused on animation, visual effects, and gaming, he added. IICT is being established by the I&B ministry, in strategic collaboration with FICCI and CII, as a national Centre of Excellence on the lines of IITs and IIMs.Modi also unveiled postage stamps in memory of Gurudutt, P Bhanumathi, Raj Khosla, Ritwik Ghatak, and Salil Chowdhury on the occasion for their contributions to Indian cinema.",PM Modi spoke at the World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) in Mumbai.

Corporate ties and shared history

Fallout at Kohl’s

What’s next for Holt?

Chandra Holt, once considered one of the most promising executives in American retail, is now at the center of a corporate scandal involving her former Walmart colleague, and reported former romantic partner, Ashley Buchanan .Buchanan was fired this week as CEO of Kohl’s after the company accused him of engineering a vendor deal riddled with “undisclosed conflicts of interest.”According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Buchanan directed Kohl’s to enter into a multimillion-dollar contract with a vendor that allegedly had “highly suspicious” and “favorable” terms. The filing did not name the vendor or the individual involved, but The Wall Street Journal identified the woman as Chandra Holt.In a statement to The Journal, Holt confirmed she had known Buchanan for a decade but denied any business wrongdoing. “I’ve known Ashley Buchanan for 10 years, but I have not received any compensation for my Incredibrew business from Kohl’s,” she said.Holt is the founder and CEO of Incredibrew, a coffee brand she launched in 2022 that claims to infuse beverages with vitamins and minerals. It remains unclear whether Incredibrew was the vendor involved in the Kohl’s deal under scrutiny.Buchanan and Holt first crossed paths at Walmart, where they worked closely before departing around the same time for other executive roles. Buchanan left in early 2020 to head arts-and-crafts giant Michaels, while Holt exited in 2021 to become CEO of Conn’s HomePlus.Most recently, she served as CEO of Beyond, Inc, the parent company of Overstock.com and Bed Bath & Beyond, between February 2024 and June 2024.Her impressive résumé includes leadership stints at Target, Sam’s Club, and Walgreens. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in advertising, PR, and communications from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and an MBA in strategy and marketing from the Carlson School of Management.Buchanan’s exit comes amid a challenging period for Kohl’s. The company reported a 7.2% drop in annual sales to $15.4 billion and announced plans to close more than two dozen underperforming stores. The firing triggered serious consequences: Buchanan must now forfeit all equity awards granted during his tenure and repay a prorated portion of his $2.5 million signing bonus.While Kohl’s emphasized that the CEO's termination had “no bearing on the company’s financial performance,” the incident adds turbulence to a company already struggling with leadership instability . Buchanan was the third CEO in as many years, following short-lived tenures by Tom Kingsbury and Michelle Gass.Although no formal allegations have been made against Holt, her name is now linked to a boardroom controversy that could complicate her professional path. With her leadership record and entrepreneurial success through Incredibrew, the coming months may determine whether Holt can distance herself from the scandal or whether her past with Buchanan will cast a longer shadow.","Ashley Buchanan was fired this week as CEO of Kohl’s after the company accused him of engineering a vendor deal riddled with “undisclosed conflicts of interest” Buchanan directed Kohl's to enter into a multimillion-dollar contract with a vendor that allegedly had “highly suspicious” and “favorable” terms.

Index View: NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty consolidated in a 2000 points range in the last 6 sessions after the recent strong rally of 5500 points or 11% in the preceding 6 sessions underpinned by robust institutional accumulation in frontline banking counters and a notable revival in FII inflows—reflecting a clear risk-on undertone. Rate cut hopes and positive result of the large cap private Banks boosted sentiment.

A sustained move above the recent high of 56,098 could trigger further upside toward the 56,800 levels in the coming sessions. However, if the index fails to surpass this level, the index is likely to extend the last 6 sessions consolidation within the 54,000–56,000 range, helping to ease the overbought conditions created by the recent sharp rally.

On the downside, key support is seen between 54,000-53,500, which corresponds to the gap-up region and the previous significant breakout zone.

Volatility is expected to stay elevated due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, developments related to tariffs, and the unfolding Q4 earnings season.

Exploring alternative routes

Broader diplomatic fallout

International calls for de-escalation

In the wake of the tragic Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, 2025, which claimed the lives of 26 Hindu tourists, India and Pakistan have entered a severe diplomatic and aviation standoff. The incident has led to reciprocal airspace closures, significantly impacting international flight operations and escalating regional tensions.Following the attack, India accused Pakistani nationals of involvement, prompting Pakistan to close its airspace to Indian carriers on April 24. In retaliation, India issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) on April 30, effective until May 23, barring all Pakistani-registered and operated aircraft, including military planes, from its airspace .Many aviation operations have been hampered by the airspace closures. The forced rerouting of some 600 international flights headed west by Indian carriers, mainly Air India and IndiGo, has resulted in longer flight durations and higher operating expenses. For example, planes from San Francisco to Delhi now have to make extra fuel stops, which can make the trip take up to four hours.Read more: Japan’s genius airport hack: No more lifting luggage—just roll it on! Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has also been affected, with 6-8 weekly flights impacted due to the Indian airspace closure . The airline is rerouting flights through alternative corridors, including Chinese and Thai airspace, to maintain operations .Indian authorities are looking into alternate flight routes to avoid Pakistani airspace in reaction to the interruptions. One suggested route would provide direct access to Europe and North America by flying north from Delhi to Leh and then crossing the Hindu Kush mountains into Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. However, China's overflight permits and modifications for high-altitude flying, including a larger oxygen supply, are needed for this route.The aviation standoff is part of a broader deterioration in India-Pakistan relations following the Pahalgam attack. India has suspended visa services for Pakistani nationals, expelled diplomats, and halted the Indus Waters Treaty. Pakistan has responded with its own set of countermeasures, including trade suspensions and diplomatic downgrades.Read more: Timeless wonders: India’s 7 oldest forts that have seen it all The rising tensions have sparked concerns across the world.

However, with the first census of independent India in 1951, the government chose to discontinue the practice, except for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).By 1961, the central government permitted states to conduct their own surveys and compile state-specific lists of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), if they wished.More than six decades later, amid growing political and social demands, the government has now approved the inclusion of caste enumeration in the upcoming nationwide census.The last attempt at caste data collection at a national level took place in 2011 through the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), intended to assess the socio-economic condition of households alongside caste information.A caste census involves systematically recording individuals’ caste identities during a national census. In India, where caste influences social, economic, and political life, such data can offer valuable insights into the distribution and socio-economic status of various caste groups. This information can help shape policies related to affirmative action and social justice.Beyond statistics, the caste census has deep social and political implications.According to activists, the data could help redesign affirmative action policies , improve representation, and address entrenched inequalities.“Much of access to essential services in India—education, healthcare, nutrition, and social protection—is shaped by structural inequalities of caste, region, religion, and economic status. A caste census is critical to uncover these intersectional disparities and to design policies and programs that are truly equitable and inclusive,” Poonam Muttreja, executive director, population foundation of India told news agency PTI.While some view the caste census as necessary to uplift marginalised communities, others argue it may reinforce caste divisions.The decision marks a major shift after more than 70 years of hesitation. However, details on how the data will be collected, categorised, and applied are yet to be clarified.The move is expected to significantly influence governance, electoral politics, and India's broader battle against inequality. A timeline for the census exercise has not been announced.","Caste enumeration was a regular feature of census exercises during British rule from 1881 to 1931.

"UPS to lay off 20,000 jobs, shut down facilities as it reduces Amazon shipments",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ups-to-lay-off-20000-employees-shut-down-facilities-as-it-reduces-amazon-shipments/articleshow/120739052.cms,"What UPS said about the 20,000 job cuts



“The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier. The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.”

""The world hasn't been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,""

""These actions will enable us to expand our US Domestic operating margin and increase profitability.”

“Amazon is our largest customer but it’s not our most profitable customer. Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business,”

“Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision.”

United Parcel Service (UPS) has announced its plans to cut nearly 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by the end of June. This move comes after the biggest package delivery company in the world decided to sharply cut back on the shipments from its largest customer, Amazon . The company announced that it expects the job cuts to take place this year and the facility closures, across both leased and owned sites, by June 30. UPS is still reviewing its network and may identify additional locations for shutdown. As per FactSet data, the company employs about 490,000 workers. The upcoming job cuts will reduce UPS’ workforce by slightly over 4%. This decision follows the company's announcement to cut 12,000 positions last year.In a statement to the news agency Reuters, a UPS spokesman said the job cuts reflect a 50% reduction in shipping volume from Amazon, its largest customer, combined with broader cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives as part of a major operational restructuring.On the other hand, union's general president Sean O'Brien told Reuters, ""UPS is contractually obligated to create 30,000 jobs under its current national master agreement with Teamsters. But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.""In its recent regulatory filing, the company said that cuts are in ""connection with our anticipation of lower volumes from our largest customer.”UPS CEO Carol Tome said:This decision follows a slowdown in economic growth and mounting recession fears driven by Trump’s aggressive trade policies.Tome noted during the company's latest earnings call.UPS CFO Brian Dykes added:In January, UPS agreed with Amazon to reduce the volume it handles by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. Speaking on the fourth-quarter earnings call, Tome noted that after nearly 30 years of partnership, the renewal of Amazon’s contract this year prompted a reassessment of the relationship.Tomé said at the time.Meanwhile, an Amazon spokesperson said to Reuters:In related news,","United Parcel Service (UPS) has announced its plans to cut nearly 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by the end of June.

Elon Musk’s role in the White House

Donald Trump’s public praise and invitation for Elon Musk



Backlash against Musk and Tesla

Shift toward reduced involvement

Corporate priorities and strategic refocusing

In a significant political and corporate development, U.S. President Donald Trump publicly acknowledged Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk 's intent to scale back his involvement with the administration’s informal “Department of Government Efficiency” ( DOGE ). Musk, who has served in an advisory capacity, reportedly plans to shift focus back to his business ventures—particularly Tesla, which has recently faced mounting challenges.During a White House cabinet meeting held on Wednesday, Trump expressed deep appreciation for Musk’s contributions and made it clear the tech billionaire was welcome to continue his advisory role for as long as he wished. The move underscores the complex intersection between public service and private enterprise, especially when a figure as influential as Musk straddles both worlds.Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration has been through an unofficial advisory initiative dubbed the “Department of Government Efficiency,” or DOGE. Though not a formal government entity, the initiative has been described as an internal task force focused on streamlining bureaucratic processes, cutting costs, and leveraging technological innovation across federal agencies. Musk has played a prominent role in shaping its direction.Musk’s approach—often centered on radical cost-cutting and automation—has been polarizing. Supporters argue that his involvement brings a much-needed tech-centric mindset to government, while critics have pointed to the social implications of service reductions, especially in public sectors like education and transportation.During the cabinet meeting, President Trump lauded Musk’s work and the personal costs he has endured, as per reports. “The vast majority of the people in this country really respect and appreciate you,” Trump told Musk in front of administration officials. He added, “You’re invited to stay as long as you want,” acknowledging Musk’s significant influence on policy discussions.However, Trump also noted the strain Musk’s dual roles have created. “You may want to get back home to your cars,” he said, alluding to the growing pressure on Musk to focus on Tesla, the electric vehicle company that remains the cornerstone of his business empire.Musk’s political alignment with the Trump administration has reportedly contributed to negative publicity for Tesla. According to reports, several Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States have been targeted by vandals, and calls for consumer boycotts have increased. The incidents coincide with widespread criticism of public service cuts that some associate with Musk’s advisory role.During the cabinet session, Trump defended Musk against these criticisms, saying, “You really have sacrificed a lot. They treated you very unfairly.” Musk responded with understated humor, saying, “They did like to burn my cars, which is not great,” referencing acts of vandalism aimed at his company.Despite rumors of a complete departure, David Sacks—a tech entrepreneur and close Musk ally who also serves in the administration—clarified that Musk is not fully exiting DOGE. Instead, he is transitioning into what Sacks called a “maintenance mode.” This approach mirrors Musk’s operational style during his 2022 acquisition of Twitter, where he initially maintained a hands-on role before stepping back once systems and personnel were in place.Sacks stated on the All-In podcast, “Once he felt like he had a mental model and he had the people in place that he trusted, he can move to more of a maintenance mode.”Musk’s decision to shift focus back to Tesla comes amid reports of declining brand sentiment and operational disruptions. The company is currently grappling with heightened competition in the EV market, regulatory scrutiny, and investor concerns over Musk’s political affiliations. The strategic move to refocus on core business operations could be seen as an attempt to stabilize Tesla’s position in the global market.","President Donald Trump acknowledged Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's intent to scale back his involvement with the administration.

BENGALURU: In what can be pegged as a crucial finding that would benefit global endeavours returning to the Moon, India’s Chandrayaan-3 and China’s Chang'e-6 missions have independently discovered primitive lunar mantle materials near the Moon's South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin.The discoveries in two separate studies published in the journal Nature — China’s paper was published on April 23, India’s on April 25 — point to a growing scientific interest in probing planetary interiors via polar exploration, adding critical pieces to the puzzle of how the Moon, and rocky planets like Earth, formed and evolved.India’s findings come from in-situ surface analysis and China’s from returned samples. Despite different methodologies, both discoveries provide insight into the Moon's early formation and evolution, highlighting the South Pole region as a treasure trove of lunar history. They point to the SPA basin as a unique site where the Moon’s deep history lies exposed.The Indian study by a team of scientists from Isro ’s Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) shows how Pragyan, the rover on Chandrayaan-3, detected soil with low sodium and potassium but high sulphur content, suggesting materials from the Moon's deep interior rather than its crust.“The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) aboard Pragyan directly measured the elemental composition of the Moon’s surface at an unexplored location, Shiv Shakti station located at 69.37° S, 32.32° E in the southern high-latitude highlands of the nearside of the Moon,” Isro said.Pragyan analysed surface soils in the southern highlands, about 350km from the SPA rim. “The study has revealed the potential presence of primitive lunar mantle materials at the [Chandrayaan-3] landing site, which was excavated during formation of the SPA,” PRL scientists said.Elaborating further, Isro said that the rover detecting unusually low levels of sodium and potassium, and a distinct enrichment in sulphur points to a chemical profile that diverges from those recorded at previous lunar landing sites.It suggests limited influence from “KREEP-rich materials” — products of late-stage magma crystallisation. Instead, the data point to a mix of lower crust and upper mantle materials excavated by the ancient SPA impact.The Indian team concluded that the sulphur likely originated from deep within the Moon, possibly as iron sulphide (FeS), and not from external sources such as meteorites. This supports the view that the Chandrayaan-3 site preserves early, unaltered signatures from the Moon’s interior.Meanwhile, China’s mission has returned samples containing rare magnesian olivine grains with high nickel concentrations, representing the most primitive mantle materials ever recovered.As per the study based on samples returned from the Chang’e-6 mission, which landed within the SPA basin, some of the grains, with nickel concentrations up to 682 parts per million, are said to represent the most primitive mantle materials yet recovered.Their composition matches model predictions for the earliest olivines crystallised from the lunar magma ocean. Researchers suggest these mantle fragments were brought to the surface by ascending high-magnesium lavas and preserved in the SPA basin’s impact-shattered crust.As per the study, the olivines’ oxygen isotope ratios align with the terrestrial fractionation line, confirming their lunar origin. Their high magnesium and nickel levels distinguish them from previously known crustal rocks and suggest a direct link to early mantle differentiation.",India's Chandrayaan-3 and China's Chang'e-6 missions have independently discovered primitive lunar mantle materials near the Moon's South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Singapore's long-ruling party seeks stronger election victory in test for new prime minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/singapores-long-ruling-party-seeks-stronger-election-victory-in-test-for-new-prime-minister/articleshow/120807643.cms,"Singapore (File Photo AP)

SINGAPORE: Singaporeans will vote Saturday in a general election that is set to return to power the city-state's long ruling party, and it will be closely watched as a gauge of public confidence in Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's leadership.The People's Action Party has won every election since the Asian financial hub gained independence in 1965. Wong, who took office last year, hopes to clinch a stronger mandate after the PAP suffered a setback in 2020 polls over voters' rising discontent with the government.Here's what to know about the Singapore election.How does the vote work? Singapore holds a general election every five years and voting is compulsory. Its electoral system involves single-member wards along with group representation constituencies (GRCs) where voters pick a team of up to six members rather than individual candidates. The team includes at least one member from a minority ethnic group.The GRCs ensure minority representation in Parliament, but critics say they entrench the PAP and make it harder for the opposition to contest. Ethnic Chinese are the majority in Singapore, while Malays and Indians are in the minority.Nearly 2.76 million voters are registered to elect 97 members of Parliament, but five seats have already been won uncontested by the PAP after the opposition failed to nominate candidates in a GRC. There are 33 constituencies, comprising 15 single-member wards and 18 GRCs.Voting opens at 8 a.m. (OOOO GMT), runs for 12 hours, and results are expected the same night.What's at stake? The election is the first test for Wong, 52, since he succeeded Lee Hsien Loong, who stepped down last year after two decades at the helm. Lee's departure marked the end of a family dynasty started by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first leader, who built the former colonial backwater into one of the world's richest nations during 31 years in office.Known for its clean and effective governance, the PAP is seen as a beacon of stability and prosperity. While it is assured of victory, its support is being chipped away by unhappiness over government control and a high cost of living. Widening income disparity, increasingly unaffordable housing, overcrowding caused by immigration and restrictions on free speech have also loosened the PAP's grip on power.In 2020 polls, the PAP's share of popular support slipped to a near-record low of 61%, down from nearly 70% in 2015. The PAP kept 83 out of 93 parliamentary seats, but it ceded more seats to the opposition, which won 10 seats, the most ever.The opposition has acknowledged it cannot unseat the PAP but is appealing to voters for a stronger voice in Parliament.Wong, a U.S.-trained economist and former finance minister, warned this would only weaken the government as it navigates economic turbulence following U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff hikes. The government has lowered its growth forecast, and warned of a possible recession.""If the PAP has a weakened mandate, you can be sure there will be people tempted to push us around. It will be harder for us to advance Singapore's interest. But with a clear mandate from you, my team and I can speak up for Singapore confidently,"" Wong said while campaigning this week.The PAP has fielded many new faces to refresh the party. Wong offered cash handouts, vouchers and other goodies in this year's national budget, and sought to engage younger voters in developing a more balanced and inclusive Singapore. A strong PAP performance would help seal Wong's leadership and determine whether the one-party dominance in Singapore could endure over the next decade.""The ruling party has portrayed the ongoing tariffs war as a crisis for trade-reliant Singapore,"" said Eugene Tan, a law professor at Singapore Management University. ""Will voters rally behind the PAP, or will they come to view the political system ... as being robust enough and can accommodate more political diversity and competition?""Who are the PAP's rivals? The Workers Party, led by lawyer Pritam Singh, is the biggest opposition party and the only one with a presence in Parliament. Singh was named as Singapore's first opposition leader after the WP won 10 seats in the 2020 polls. But despite gaining ground over the years, the opposition still struggles with limited resources and talent, and fragmented support.The WP is fielding only 26 candidates in this election. Singh has said even if the WP won all 26 seats, it wouldn't hamper the PAP but lead to a more balanced political system and greater accountability. The remaining seats are contested by nine smaller opposition parties and coalitions, as well as two independent candidates.""The WP threat is taken seriously by the PAP and it will be a keener contest than in 2020. It remains to be seen how many more seats it will win. But even an additional seat won will add to the WP's standing and builds on the momentum to erode the one-party dominant system,"" said law professor Tan.","Singaporeans will vote Saturday in a general election that is set to return to power the city-state's long ruling party. The People's Action Party has won every election since the Asian financial hub gained independence in 1965. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who took office last year, hopes to clinch a stronger mandate after the PAP suffered a setback in 2020 polls.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120807809,imgsize-1367045,width-400,resizemode-4/Singapore-File-Photo-AP.jpg"

Records show she purchased the Dorchester townhouse in 2023 for $2.2 million, along with another nearby for $2.3 million, a $3 million Roxbury townhouse, and a $610,000 Cape Cod cottage now under renovation.Hudson, who once worked as a flight attendant, reportedly met Belichick on a Boston-to-Florida flight in 2021, just 18 months before she began snapping up Boston homes filled with tenants largely around her age.“She’s only three years older than me,” said 21-year-old Dominic Fantoni, who splits $9,100 in rent at one of her properties. “That’s insane. Holy crap.”Hudson’s background reads like a plot twist: She’s the daughter of a Provincetown fisherman and a sex shop manager. A former pageant contestant and college philosophy student, she’s recently made headlines for her off-camera interjections during Belichick’s CBS interview, most notably halting a question about how they met.“She seems controlling,” Fantoni said. “I love Belichick, but this whole thing is weird.”Despite the shock, Hudson’s tenants admit the properties are in excellent shape and well-run, managed by Boston Property Advisors. “We’ve never seen her,” said Nelson. “We had no clue.”With Belichick’s net worth estimated at $200 million, some wonder how much of Hudson’s real estate success stems from the relationship, but others say she’s simply making savvy moves.“She’s smart,” said 37-year-old neighbor Tina Hudson. “With all the money he has, why not?”","Jordon Hudson, a 24-year-old former cheerleader, is the girlfriend of Patriots legend Bill Belichick.

"Pentagon to cut 1,000 jobs, consolidate commands in major army overhaul",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pentagon-to-cut-1000-jobs-consolidate-commands-in-major-army-overhaul/articleshow/120803766.cms,"The Army is initiating a comprehensive reorganisation that includes consolidating or shutting down headquarters, retiring obsolete vehicles and aircraft, reducing Pentagon staff by up to 1,000 positions, and redeploying personnel to field units, as detailed in a recent memo and confirmed by US officials.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a directive on Thursday to establish ""a leaner, more lethal force."" The reorganisation plans, which have been under discussion for several weeks, include the consolidation of various Army commands.According to US officials speaking anonymously about personnel matters, the restructuring could result in the elimination of up to 40 general officer positions.These adjustments are occurring as the Pentagon faces pressure to reduce expenditure and staffing as part of broader government cutbacks advocated by President Donald Trump's administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.Hegseth's memo emphasises the necessity to eliminate inefficient spending and focus on enhancing air and missile defence, long-range fires, cyber capabilities, electronic warfare and counter-space operations.The directive specifically requires merging Army Futures Command with Training and Doctrine Command, whilst combining Forces Command, Army North and Army South into a unified headquarters ""focused on homeland defense and partnership with our Western Hemisphere allies.""The plan also calls for consolidating units, including Joint Munitions Command and Sustainment Command, alongside operations at various depots and arsenals.Officials indicate that whilst staff positions will decrease through mergers, the Army's overall size will remain unchanged, with soldiers being reassigned to different posts.The restructuring targets legacy equipment including Humvees and certain helicopter formations, alongside various armour and aviation units across active duty, National Guard and Reserve forces. Specific units remain unidentified.Congressional approval remains a significant challenge.Historically, legislators have opposed Army and Pentagon attempts to terminate programmes, often due to their presence in representatives' constituencies.Defence leadership has traditionally distributed headquarters, depots, troops and facilities nationwide to secure congressional backing. This strategy has complicated subsequent attempts to reduce programmes with established support.The extent of Congressional approval for these cuts remains uncertain, as legislators may opt to preserve certain programmes through additional budget allocations.","The Army is reorganising to create ""a leaner, more lethal force"" The restructuring could result in the elimination of up to 40 general officer positions.
