Ties normalisation contingent on public safety talks: Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eam-jaishankar-canadian-fm-laud-progress-in-2025-roadmap/articleshow/125289277.cms,"Canada FM Anita Anand Visits India To Strengthen Bilateral Trade, Energy And Security Cooperation

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand met on the margins of the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Canada, amidst efforts by both sides to rebuild the relationship after the diplomatic row over the killing of a Sikh separatist in 2023. While both sides appreciated progress in implementation of the new roadmap that was launched during Anand’s visit to India last month, the Canadian minister also stressed the significance of ongoing law enforcement dialogue between the two countries.While India sees the dialogue as important to check the anti-India activities of Khalistan separatists in Canada, Ottawa considers essential for the safety and security of its own citizens. In an interview to ToI last month, Anand had said Canadians have the right to feel safe and secure in their own country.“Appreciated the progress in implementation of the New Roadmap 2025. Look forward to the further rebuilding of our bilateral partnership,” said Jaishankar after the meeting. India was among the guest countries that were invited to participate in the G7 meeting in the Niagara-on-the-Lake town.After the 2 sides announced a series of measures last month in a joint statement to normalise the relationship, including through trade discussions, Canada’s minister for international trade Maninder Sidhu arrived in India on Wednesday to explore opportunities in trade and investment.However, Ottawa also maintains, and as Anand reiterated at a press event, rule of law and public safety concerns are foremost in the advancement of the relationship. Anand recalled the joint statement that sought a constructive relationship based on mutual respect for rule of law and a commitment to upholding the principles of sovereignty and territorial integritySignificantly, Anand, who has maintained that Canada will carry forward the relationship with a step-by-step approach, also asserted that the normalisation will be contingent on the law enforcement dialogue. “We are taking the relationship step by step to ensure that we are stressing the importance of public safety and security in the interests of all Canadian citizens, first and foremost...it will be systematic, and it will not occur unless we can ensure that this public safety dialogue continues,” said Anand in an interview to Canada’s CBC Radio. She was responding to a query on whether Canada can have a relationship with a country accused of violating its sovereignty.","Canada FM Anita Anand Visits India To Strengthen Bilateral Trade, Energy And Security Cooperation.

Global carbon emission projected to hit record high in 2025; Renewable energy push makes emission growth in India & China slower,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/global-carbon-emission-projected-to-hit-record-high-in-2025-renewable-energy-push-makes-emission-growth-in-india-china-slower/articleshow/125287789.cms,"NEW DELHI: Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels are projected to rise by 1.1% in 2025, reaching record high of 38.1 billion tonnes, over 2024 with the US heading for the highest percentage increase of 1.9% followed by India (1.4%), China and the EU (0.4% each) among the big four emitting countries, shows Global Carbon Budget - an annual, peer-reviewed report released on Thursday.It says the emissions in India and China are, however, growing more slowly from 2024 to 2025 than in recent years due to strong growth in renewable energy in both the countries.Growth rate from 2023 to 2024 was the highest at 4% for India and 0.7% for China whereas the EU and the US reported a decline of 2.6% and 0.6%, respectively, when the overall global emissions increased by 0.8%. In 2024, the largest absolute contributions to global fossil CO2 emissions were from China (32%), the US (13%), India (8%), and the EU (6%).On the positive side, total CO2 emissions – the sum of fossil and land-use change emissions – have grown more slowly in the past decade (0.3% per year), compared to the previous decade (1.9% per year).The 20th edition of the annual report, produced by an international team of more than 130 scientists under the Global Carbon Project, however, underlined that though decarbonisation of energy systems is progressing in many countries, this is not enough to offset the growth in global energy demand.As a result, the remaining carbon budget for keeping the world within 1.5 degree Celsius of warming (around 170 billion tonnes of CO2 ) will be exhausted in about four years if emissions continue at current levels.The remaining carbon budget is the amount of carbon dioxide that can still be emitted while keeping global warming within a certain temperature limit, such as 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels. The budget is rapidly diminishing as emissions from fossil fuels and land-use change continue to far outpace the rate at which carbon is removed from the atmosphere.“The remaining carbon budget for 1.5 degree C, 170 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, will be gone before 2030 at current emission rate. We estimate that climate change is now reducing the combined land and ocean sinks - a clear signal from Planet Earth that we need to dramatically reduce emissions,” said Pierre Friedlingstein of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute, who led the study.According to the report, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is set to reach 425.7 ppm in 2025, 52% above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels.The report says, “With no sign of the urgently needed decline of global emissions, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere – and the dangerous impacts of global warming – continue to increase.”“It is 10 years since the Paris Agreement was negotiated, and despite progress on many fronts, fossil CO2 emissions continue their relentless rise. Climate change and variability are also having a discernible effect on our natural climate sinks. It is clear that the countries need to lift their game. We now have strong evidence that clean technologies help reduce emissions while being cost effective compared to fossil alternatives,” said Glen Peters, senior researcher at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research.","Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels are projected to rise by 1.1% in 2025.

(With agency inputs)





NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday invoked stricter anti-pollution measures under Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR after the city's air quality slipped into the 'severe' category.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) said the decision was taken after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) surged from 362 on Monday to 425 on Tuesday morning, due to calm winds, a stable atmosphere, and unfavourable weather conditions that allowed pollutants to accumulate near the surface.The Stage III curbs, which include a ban on non-essential construction and the closure of stone crushers and mining activities, build upon the measures already enforced under Stages I and II of the GRAP.Classes up to Class 5 are required to shift to hybrid mode under Stage 3. Parents and students have the option to choose online education wherever available.Under Stage 3, the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel cars (4-wheelers) is restricted in Delhi and nearby NCR districts. Persons with disabilities are exempt.Several parts of the city registered alarming pollution levels with AQI readings crossing the 400-mark.As per CPCB data, Anand Vihar recorded an AQI of 412, Alipur reported 442, and Bawana registered the highest level at 462. Chandni Chowk recorded an AQI of 416, while RK Puram and Patparganj logged 446 and 438, respectively.Sonia Vihar also recorded a 'severe' AQI of 433, indicating hazardous air conditions across the city.During winters, the Delhi-NCR region enforces restrictions under GRAP, which categorises air quality into four stages - Stage I (Poor, AQI 201-300), Stage II (Very Poor, AQI 301-400), Stage III (Severe, AQI 401-450), and Stage IV (Severe Plus, AQI above 450).Hazardous air quality levels in Delhi-NCR during the winter are caused by unfavourable meteorological conditions, combined with vehicle emissions, paddy-straw burning, firecrackers, and other local sources of pollution.",The Centre on Tuesday invoked stricter anti-pollution measures under Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR.

Ladakh airbase close to China border activated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ladakh-airbase-close-to-china-border-activated/articleshow/125285799.cms,"Nyoma airbase underwent Rs 230cr upgrade

NEW DELHI: In a major booster shot for military capabilities in eastern Ladakh, India on Wednesday operationalised its new Nyoma airbase close to the frontier with China, even as a large Army exercise called 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' is now under way in Arunachal Pradesh on the eastern front.The developments at the opposite ends of the 3,488-km LAC underscore the high military readiness being maintained along the China frontier. ""There is ongoing reset in bilateral diplomatic ties. Military CBMs are also being progressively strengthened but the trust deficit on the ground remains high,"" a senior officer told TOI. ""With no de-escalation along LAC, troops will continue to be forward deployed for 6th successive winter since multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020,"" he said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself flew a C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi to the Mudh airfield at Nyoma, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, to formally inaugurate the strategically located airbase. He was accompanied by Western Air Command chief Air Marshal Jeetendra Mishra.Located just about 35 km from the LAC, Nyoma has undergone an upgrade worth Rs 230 crore, which included extending the original airstrip into a 2.7-km 'rigid pavement' runway, a new ATC complex, hangars, crash bay and accommodation, as was earlier reported by TOI.The Mudh airfield is now fully capable of handling and sustaining operations by heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. Primarily, it will help quickly rush troops, weapons and supplies to areas such as Pangong Tso, Demchok and Depsang in eastern Ladakh.The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026 though high altitude will be a limiting factor. China has assiduously upgraded all its airbases facing India over the last five years to offset the terrain constraints due to high-altitude and rarefied air, which limits the weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.China now has additional fighters, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters, as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones deployed at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping. It has also built many new heliports all along the LAC.In the far reaches of the Eastern Himalayas, thousands of soldiers from the 3 Spear Corps of the Indian Army, along with elements of IAF, ITBP and others, are now also engaged in the 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' exercise in the high-altitude terrain of Mechuka and other areas of Arunachal Pradesh.From airlift and force projection to mountain warfare manoeuvres and multi-domain integrated operations, the exercise aims at validating rapid mobilisation, operational logistics and precision-strike capabilities. ""The right force must reach the right place at the right time during conflicts,"" an officer said.While Nyoma will be another operational base for the IAF in Ladakh after Leh, Kargil and Thoise airfields and the Daulat Beg Oldie ALG (advanced landing ground), India has also progressively upgraded the infrastructure at ALGs like Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh.

AHMEDABAD: A 41-year-old man has approached Gujarat high court seeking a divorce from his wife on grounds of cruelty, alleging she brought stray dogs into their home and arranged a prank call about an imagined extra-marital affair, causing him public humiliation.According to the man's appeal, the couple married in 2006 and his troubles began when his wife introduced a stray dog into their flat in a society that prohibited dogs as pets. She then brought in additional strays, made him cook, clean and care for them. He said one dog bit him when it insisted on sleeping in their bed.The husband said the presence of the dogs turned neighbours against them, leading to a police complaint in 2008. He alleged that after his wife joined an animal rights group, she repeatedly filed police complaints against others, summoned him to stations to assist her, and, on his refusal, abused and humiliated him.He claimed the stress destroyed his well-being and led to erectile dysfunction. He also alleged that on April 1, 2007, his wife arranged for a radio jockey to make a prank call about his supposed affair, which embarrassed him at work and in society.The man said he fled to Bengaluru but his wife continued to harass him.He filed a divorce suit in 2017 in an Ahmedabad family court, but she defended it by arguing that he had deserted her and introduced her to animal activism. She produced photographs of him embracing and kissing the dogs.In Feb 2024, the family court dismissed his petition, stating, ""Considering the evidence, the petitioner has failed to prove that the respondent treated him with cruelty or has deserted him."" Regarding the prank call, it held, ""This cannot be the grounds for seeking divorce...""The husband appealed, asserting the marriage was irretrievably broken and offering to pay Rs 15 lakh in alimony, while his wife insisted on Rs 2 crore.

The land deal controversy

Activist’s allegations and demand

Pawar’s defence and political response

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday responded to activist Anjali Damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged Rs 300-crore land deal in Pune, saying he would “use his conscience” before making any decision.A company linked to his son, Parth Pawar is at the centre of the controversy surrounding the purchase of government-owned land in Pune’s Mundhwa area.The state government has since scrapped the deal and ordered an inquiry led by senior IAS officer Vikas Kharge.“I will use my conscience and take a decision,” Pawar told reporters in Pune when asked about Damania’s resignation demand, news agency PTI reported.The controversy involves around 40 acres of government land, reportedly valued at Rs 1,800 crore, which was sold to Amadea Enterprises LLP, a firm in which Parth Pawar holds a 99% partnership for Rs 300 crore. Following allegations of irregularities, the government cancelled the sale deed and suspended several officials.Revenue minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule confirmed that FIRs have been registered against three individuals involved in the transaction but said Parth Pawar’s name was not included, as it did not appear in the sale deed.However, the firm has been issued a notice to pay double stamp duty of Rs 42 crore to complete the cancellation process.Bawankule added that activist Anjali Damania met him on Wednesday and submitted documents related to the case.“I have told her that if she has any proofs, she can submit them to the inquiry committee,” he said, assuring that the probe would be free from interference.Anjali Damania accused Ajit Pawar of shielding his son and said a fair probe cannot happen while he remains in office, news agency United News of India (UNI) reported.“As long as Ajit Pawar is in power, a fair investigation is impossible. He must step down from both posts. Parth Pawar holds a 99% stake in the firm and yet no FIR has been registered against him,” Damania told reporters.She urged the state to register a case against Parth and ensure transparency in the inquiry.The deputy chief minister has denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations “random accusations” raised before local body elections. He maintained that Parth was unaware the land was government-owned.“I still don’t understand how a document can be registered without even a rupee being exchanged. The truth will come out soon,” he said.He also said he had already briefed chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and welcomed the inquiry.“If anyone close to me has done something wrong, I will never support it. I have told the Chief Minister to order a probe,” Pawar said. He added that the issue was “a lesson” for his son to be more cautious in future dealings.Meanwhile, minister Bawankule reiterated that the inquiry would continue independently under ACS Vikas Kharge.Bawankule said the officer heading the inquiry is honest and that there will be no interference in the investigation.","M Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar responds to activist Anjali Damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged Rs 300-crore land deal in Pune.

NEW DELHI: The cabinet on Wednesday cleared the '25,000-cr Export Promotion Mission and '20,000 cr additional collateral-free credit to support exporters grappling with global trade uncertainty.Priority support is being given to sectors such as textiles, leather, gems and jewelry, engineering goods, and marine products hit by US tariffs.The mission, which was announced in the budget, is spread over six years and seeks to help exporters get better access to credit and innovative finance tools, while also aiming to address the logistics cost disadvantage. The scheme also aims to help exporters tap new markets and deal with branding and warehousing issues overseas.It also approved high royalty for four critical minerals - graphite, caesium, rubidium and zirconium - to get more interest from bidders in the proposed auction of blocks. Tenders have been issued for the auction of nine blocks of these critical minerals, five of which are for graphite.The Union Cabinet on Wednesday cleared a Rs 25,060 crore Export Promotion Mission (EPM), spread over six years, seeking to provide a cushion to several labour-intensive sectors hit by global tariffs, while also aiming to address the oft-repeated concerns over access to export credit and logistics as well as support market access and warehousing efforts.Besides, the Cabinet approved Rs 20,000 crore additional credit support for eligible exporters, including MSMEs, through credit guarantee scheme.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday said rampant illegal mining in Aravali range, the natural barrier spread across Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Delhi that's preventing desertification of Gangetic plains, is causing immense damage to the sensitive eco-system. The court reserved verdict on the issue of a uniform definition of what the Aravali range is.Amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar told a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria that the report submitted by the expert committee set up by the SC in May last year on this issue appears to be oriented towards how to allow mining in the Aravalis rather than focusing on stringent measures to protect it.The entire Aravali Range must be protected as one geographical and morphological entity along with its eco-system and the protective measures cannot be allowed to be varied from state to state. He said along with conservation of Aravali range, restoration of its pristine form is equally important,"" Parameshwar said, adding that he must not be understood to advocate blanket ban on mining activities.The bench said a complete ban always leads to rampant illegal mining and we have seen how a hillock in Aravali was reduced to a column and how a road was illegally built in Nuh district for clandestine transportation of mined minerals from Haryana to Rajasthan.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, while complimenting the amicus for his zealous approach towards protection of the Aravali Range, said the SC-appointed committee has addressed every concern of the amicus while giving stringent guidelines for regulated mining under the principle of sustainable development. The bench agreed with her.The committee in its report said that all hillocks have a height of over 100m (from mean sea level) and these should be protected along with its slopes. ""Keeping in view the immense ecological and environmental significance of Aravalli hills and ranges, owing to their rich biodiversity and the wide range of ecosystem services they provide, such as groundwater recharge, regulation of desertification, and moderation of the regional microclimate, it becomes imperative to protect and conserve the area from further degradation,"" it said.""Core/inviolate areas - protected forests and tiger reserves and one km from their boundaries, eco-sensitive zones, afforestation areas and 500m from Ramsar sites and wetlands - may be designated in the Aravali hills and ranges for prohibiting mining in them,"" the committee said.However, the committee flagged that the Aravali range contains well-known repositories of base metals such as lead, zinc, and copper, as well as precious and strategic minerals including gold and tungsten. ""In addition, the Aravali-Delhi system has been identified as having significant potential for critical minerals such as tin, graphite, molybdenum, niobium, nickel, lithium, and rare earth elements (REEs), all of which are of growing strategic relevance for energy transition, high-technology manufacturing, and national security,"" it said.The committee opined that while the ecological and environmental integrity of the Aravali Hills and Ranges must remain the foremost priority, it is also necessary to evolve a framework that enables sustainable exploitation of critical, strategic and atomic minerals located within the region.""In view of the ecological significance of the Aravali hills and ranges, the committee recommends that the following environmental safeguards and regulatory measures be adopted by respective state governments to encourage systematic, sustainable, and environmentally friendly mining while effectively preventing illegal mining using modern and information technology tools,"" it said.","Rampant illegal mining in Aravali range causing immense damage to sensitive eco- system.

Slow Traffic, Then Sudden Fireball: CCTV Captures The Delhi Red Fort Blast That Killed At Least 10

Smith and Michelle Beadle (Image via: Getty)

Stephan A. Smith’s fiery rant brings his feud with Michelle Beadle back to life

The long-running rivalry between Michelle Beadle and Stephen A. Smith has burst back into the spotlight after Beadle ripped into Smith’s new partnership with gaming firm Papaya — a deal clouded by a lawsuit — triggering his heated on-air response and reigniting one of sports media’s most bitter feuds. The outspoken former ESPN host called out Smith for teaming up with Papaya, a mobile gaming company accused in a federal lawsuit of using bots to deceive players in paid competitions.On her Beadle and Decker podcast, Beadle didn’t hold back, saying, “It’s not secret how I feel about that human. I’m not a religious person, but I pray for the downfall. I really do.” She went on to call the partnership “gross” and questioned Smith’s ethics, arguing that it sends a terrible message to fans and the industry alike. The backlash intensified because the deal was announced just months after Smith was caught playing solitaire during the NBA Finals — the very event he was covering as a top analyst.Smith, known for his fiery personality and unmatched presence in sports broadcasting, fired back with a defiant monologue on Mad Dog Sports Radio. Without naming Beadle, his message was unmistakable. “I hear people talking about me on SiriusXM and who they would have preferred and who they would have wanted or whatever.I’ve been doing this for 30 years,” he said. “You got some people that were in this business and they talk smack now cause they can’t get a job in the business… they just didn’t know how to act. ” His response was a blend of confidence and frustration — the kind of tone that’s made him a polarizing figure in sports media.Beadle’s criticism went far beyond the Papaya deal. She accused Smith of being overpaid and underperforming, saying, “ESPN pays him a gazillion dollars to get a lot of stuff wrong and yell. He gets caught playing solitaire during the NBA freaking Finals.” Her comments reflected a deep disdain for what she views as Smith’s unchecked influence and the network’s willingness to overlook his behavior. Beadle framed the partnership as proof that principles often take a backseat to profit in today’s sports broadcasting landscape.The company at the center of the storm, Papaya, is facing a federal lawsuit alleging that it used “bots masquerading as human players” in online games where users competed for real money. Papaya has denied the claims and filed counterclaims, but the legal dispute has cast a shadow over Smith’s endorsement deal. Critics argue that aligning with a company under investigation could harm his credibility, especially as one of the most recognizable voices in sports.This latest clash adds another chapter to Beadle and Smith’s tense history. Their feud dates back to 2014, when Beadle called out Smith for implying that women sometimes “provoke” domestic violence during the Ray Rice scandal. Her blunt response — “I’ll never feel clean again” — became symbolic of her refusal to stay silent. Over the years, the two have traded barbs, but this latest exchange feels more personal than ever. With Beadle out of SiriusXM and Smith expanding his empire, their rivalry has evolved into a battle of principle versus power — and this time, the internet is watching every move.Also read: Stephen Nedoroscik spills rugby star Ilona Maher’s message for his special ‘Dancing with the Stars’ cameo","Michelle Beadle ripped into Stephen A.

NPS myths busted! Why National Pension System is one of the smartest retirement plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/retirement-planning/nps-myths-busted-why-national-pension-system-is-one-of-the-smartest-retirement-plans-explained/articleshow/125276698.cms,"Many working professionals, even those who plan meticulously for their financial goals, give NPS a miss. The reasons are a clutch of misconceptions that refuse to go away. (AI image)

It’s time to take a closer look at these myths and explain why NPS deserves a place in every long-term investor’s portfolio:

Myth 1: NPS is inflexible

Centre Approves 3% DA Hike For Central Govt Employees, DR For Pensioners

Myth 2: NPS is not tax-efficient

Myth 3: The investment rules are too complex

NPS myths busted

Myth 4: The long lock-in period is a drawback

Myth 5: NPS has poor liquidity



Myth 6: The annuity rule is a problem





NPS myths busted! When it comes to building a retirement corpus, few instruments are as efficient, disciplined and tax-friendly as the National Pension System NPS ). Yet, despite being a thoughtfully designed long-term savings product, it has failed to gain mass popularity among investors. Many working professionals, even those who plan meticulously for their financial goals, give NPS a miss. The reasons are a clutch of misconceptions that refuse to go away.One of the biggest myths about NPS is that it ties your hands once you start investing. On the contrary, the NPS offers a level of flexibility that even mutual funds don’t. Investors can choose their own mix of equity, corporate debt, and government securities—called asset classes—and switch between them as their risk appetite changes. More importantly, NPS investors can also change their pension fund manager (PFM) if they are dissatisfied with performance.And there’s more. In 2022, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) introduced a provision allowing investors to choose multiple fund managers—one each for different asset classes.That means you could have one manager for equities, another for debt, and a third for government securities, giving you the benefit of professional diversification within your retirement portfolio. All this can be done with a few clicks of the mouse and without any tax implication. This level of flexibility and control is unmatched in any other long-term investment product.This is also incorrect. In reality, NPS is one of the most tax-efficient investment options available to Indians. Under Section 80CCD(1B) of the Income Tax Act, you can claim an additional deduction of ₹50,000 for NPS investments over and above the ₹1.5 lakh limit under Section 80C. That makes it a total tax-saving potential of ₹2 lakh under the old regime.But the bigger, often overlooked benefit comes when your employer contributes to your NPS account. Under Section 80CCD(2), an employer’s contribution of up to 10% of basic salary plus dearness allowance is exempt from tax. This benefit applies under both the old and the new tax regimes, where the deduction is even higher at 14% of the basic. This makes NPS one of the rare tax-saving avenues available even to those who have opted for the new system.In short, NPS gives you tax breaks when you invest, and even when your company invests on your behalf. Few products can match that.Even if you don’t understand financial jargon or market dynamics, NPS ensures your money is invested wisely and in tune with your age and goals.For investors who aren’t comfortable making allocation decisions between equity and debt, NPS has a simple and elegant solution—lifecycle funds. These are pre-designed portfolios that automatically adjust the mix of equity and debt as you age. Younger investors start with a higher equity exposure, which gradually tapers off in favour of safer assets like government bonds as they near retirement.There are four such lifecycle funds—Conservative, Moderate, Balanced, and Aggressive—to match different risk appetites. Once you choose one, the system does the rest, adjusting your portfolio each year without any effort from your side.Yes, NPS is designed as a retirement product, and your funds are locked in until you reach 60. But that should not be seen as a flaw but a useful feature. The single biggest challenge for most savers is sticking to their investment plan. Market volatility, changing life goals, or short-term temptations often derail even the best-laid financial plans. NPS removes that behavioural risk by enforcing discipline.Moreover, the long investment horizon allows your money to compound—the most powerful force in wealth creation. The combination of regular contributions, market-linked growth, and tax advantages can result in a surprisingly large corpus by the time you retire.For example, an investor contributing ₹5,000 a month from age 30 could build a retirement pot of over ₹1.7 crore by 60, assuming a modest 9% annual return. That’s the magic of staying invested for the long term.It’s true that NPS is meant for long-term savings, but it’s not as rigid as many believe. Partial withdrawals are permitted for specific purposes—like a child’s education or marriage, medical emergencies, or buying or constructing a house.You can withdraw up to 25% of your contributions, subject to certain conditions, after three years of investment. So while the scheme promotes discipline, it also recognises that life can be unpredictable and offers room for genuine contingencies.Upon retirement, at least 40% of your NPS corpus must be used to buy an annuity, which provides a lifelong pension. Some investors see this as restrictive, since annuity rates in India are not very high.However, this rule also ensures that retirees don’t exhaust their savings too quickly. The monthly pension acts as a steady income stream, which is crucial for maintaining financial independence in old age. Moreover, the remaining 60% of the corpus can be withdrawn tax-free, giving retirees a significant lump sum to meet immediate post-retirement expenses or to reinvest elsewhere.In an era when private-sector employees have no guaranteed pension and traditional instruments like the EPF are struggling to beat inflation, NPS fills a critical gap. It’s a low-cost, market-linked, tax-efficient, and well-regulated system designed to help Indians retire with dignity.The NPS is a flexible product that rewards discipline and long-term thinking. Investors who look past the myths and understand its true benefits will find that it’s not just a good product but one of the smartest retirement investments available today.","Many working professionals, even those who plan meticulously for their financial goals, give NPS a miss.

NEW DELHI: Investigators probing the Red Fort blast have traced the origins of the terror conspiracy to a Turkiye-based handler, known by the codename Ukasa, who allegedly directed the module led by Al-Falah University professor Umar Un Nabi.According to security sources,acted as the primary link between the Delhi-based module and handlers of proscribed outfits Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGuH).The plot, officials said, was hatched as early as 2022 in Turkiye, where Umar and three others — all linked to the two Pakistan-backed groups — had travelled.Umar had visited Turkiye in March 2022 and stayed in Ankara for two weeks. “Their conversations had initially started on Telegram and later shifted to encrypted apps like Signal and Session,” an officer said.“It waswho guided them on how to establish covert cells and avoid digital footprints.”Investigators believeplayed a crucial role in shaping the module’s plan to carry out a “spectacular” series of attacks in India — involving multiple vehicle-borne IEDs followed by armed strikes.Three cars — a Hyundai i20, a red Ford Ecosport, and a Maruti Brezza — were reportedly procured for the operation.While Umar’s i20 exploded near Red Fort on November 10, killing him instantly, security agencies have since recovered the Ecosport from Faridabad and launched a search for the Brezza. Officials suspect the remaining vehicles may still contain hidden explosives.Sources said Umar’s close aide, Dr Muzammil — also associated with Al-Falah University — had conducted multiple recces of Red Fort in January this year.“They intended to study the monument’s security apparatus ahead of a possible strike, likely to coincide with Republic Day celebrations in 2026,” an investigator said.Over 350kg of explosive material, including ammonium nitrate and traces of RDX, had been accumulated by the group since 2022.This cache was recovered earlier this year in Faridabad, leading to Muzammil’s arrest and pushing Umar to flee before detonating the IED-laden i20 after a 16-hour drive across Delhi-NCR.The probe has also revealed that besides Delhi, Ayodhya was on the hit list. “They planned to attempt an attack around November 25, coinciding with the hoisting of a saffron flag atop the Ram temple,” a source said.Investigators are now seeking the cooperation of foreign intelligence agencies to trace’s digital footprint and establish his links to Pakistani terror handlers. “Every encrypted chat and overseas transfer is being scrutinised. The Turkiye connection is the fulcrum of this case,” an officer added.","Investigators probing the Red Fort blast have traced the origins of the terror conspiracy to a Turkiye-based handler.

Delhi: 8 Killed In Multiple Red Fort Blasts; Explosion Shakes 3 KM Area Radius Of Indian Capital





NEW DELHI: The Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squads have foiled a planned chemical terror attack, arresting three suspects, including a Hyderabad-based doctor, who allegedly intended to poison prasad with ricin.The plot reportedly included Ayodhya as a target, with Nov 25—when the saffron flag is due to be hoisted atop the Ram temple—marked for an attack.According to sources, the suspects had also planned a series of attacks in Delhi akin to the 26/11 Mumbai strike, describing it as a “spectacular attack” of unprecedented scale. Key targets included railway stations, malls, India Gate and temples.DNA tests confirmed Umar Un Nabi as the bomber in Old Delhi. Sources said Nabi’s module had planned multiple vehicle-borne IED explosions followed by assault rifle firing.Three vehicles—an i20, a red Ford Ecosport, and a Brezza—had been procured for the operation. While the i20 exploded near Red Fort, authorities issued a BOLO notice for the other two vehicles.The Ecosport, registered in Delhi with the number ending 0458, was recovered in Faridabad, while the Brezza remains untraced.The investigation revealed that besides Delhi, Ayodhya, railway stations, India Gate was also on the module’s radar.\Security officials said they had collected ammonium nitrate and RDX, though it remains unclear whether these materials were in the i20.The plot had reportedly been hatched in Turkiye in 2022, with Nabi following instructions from his Turkey-based handler, identified by the codename Ukasa.The breakthrough came after Jaish-e-Mohammed posters appeared overnight on Oct 19 across Nowgam-Bunpora in Srinagar, warning security forces of “dire consequences.”Srinagar SSP Dr GV Sundeep Chakravarthy described the posters as deliberate and dangerous, ordering a case under the UAPA, Explosive Substances Act, and Arms Act. CCTV footage led to the identification of three men, including Moulvi Irfan Ahmad of Shopian.Further investigation traced digital footprints and communications to operatives in Haryana and UP, leading to the arrest of Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, a Pulwama doctor working in a Faridabad medical college, and two others from Nowgam.The probe also led to seizures of IED-making materials.A senior officer described the investigation as “a thorough forward-and-backward effort that mapped every link in the chain,” noting that the operation exposed a sophisticated cross-state “white-collar” module involving medics, a moulvi, and radicalized operatives.For Dr Chakravarthy, a 2014-batch IPS officer, the case stands out as one of his most intricate investigations, peeling back layers of radicalization and revealing an unlikely alliance of professionals and militants.","The Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squads have foiled a planned chemical terror attack.

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason





Gates Foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide. The funding aims to fuel dozens of projects, from life-saving maternal medicines to vaccines targeting infections that hit women hardest. The pledge marks a roughly 33% jump in the foundation's investments in women's and maternal health compared to the prior half-decade. It is the largest funding commitment the Gates Foundation has made in women’s health. The pledge also is a sign of the areas where Bill Gates wants to focus on as he seeks to donate the vast majority of his $114 billion fortune before winding down the foundation over the next 20 years. Gates spoke about the pledge during an event with STAT this week.The vast majority of the funds — as much as 70% — will go to research and development. About a tenth will go to market introduction of new technologies or generating better data around them. Only about 4% will go to manufacturing, and 3% to advocacy. ""It's curious why some of these areas are so under-invested, because the rich world health burden on preeclampsia specifically is still, you know, very high,"" Bill Gates remarked during a briefing, highlighting one of the hypertensive disorders that claim thousands of women's lives annually, even in wealthy nations.The portfolio brims with high-tech promise. Backed by the foundation's dollars will be self-injectable contraceptives for easier access, long-lasting contraceptive patches, lightning-fast diagnostics for STIs, and deep dives into the human microbiome's role in everything from pregnancy complications to broader women's health challenges, including disease transmission.Yet Bill Gates was clear-eyed about the foundation's boundaries. ""One thing we make very clear is we're not able to replace what the U.S. government has canceled,"" he said, nodding to recent federal budget trims in global health programs. Gates told STAT, ""It's just not our role to say, OK, the U.S. government wants to save money and so we'll help them do that.""In fields like malaria, tuberculosis, and non-hormonal birth control, the Gates Foundation already reigns as the world's top funder, Gates noted. Its R&D bets will yield lasting innovations that outlive the organization's support. But for on-the-ground health delivery, the clock is ticking: The foundation's aid is designed to be temporary, hinging on sustainable handoffs to other players.Even with Gates' immense wealth as a backstop, he stressed the need for collective action. A core aim, he and his team emphasised, is to ignite urgency among governments, pharmaceutical giants, and researchers to prioritise women's health disparities—long overlooked despite their outsized toll.""We'd love to have other people work on this stuff,"" Bill Gates said. ""It's crazy that this stuff isn't better funded. Drawing governments and other philanthropists in—we've had some success at that, and I'm putting more time into talking with other philanthropists about how impactful this work is. So I think we'll have a lot of additional partnerships, certainly at the end of the 20 years"", he added.""Then we're gone,"" he added pointedly, ""and so other people will have to step up in these areas.""As the foundation accelerates its sunset strategy, this women's health push underscores a pivotal shift: from lone-wolf giving to catalysing a broader ecosystem. With maternal deaths still claiming a life every two minutes globally, advocates hailed the commitment as a vital spark—one that could, if multiplied, finally bend the arc toward equity.Recently, the Gates Foundation announced a $2.5 billion commitment through 2030 to advance women’s health, marking its largest-ever investment in the field. The funding will support a wide range of initiatives — from developing new medicines to prevent maternal deaths to creating vaccines that target infections disproportionately affecting women.The new pledge represents a roughly one-third increase in the foundation’s funding for women’s and maternal health compared to the past five years. It is also a small illustration of the kinds of commitments that Bill Gates is making as he seeks to donate the vast majority of his $114 billion fortune before winding down the foundatio","Gates Foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide.

Siddhant Awasthi’s journey through Tesla: From Model 3 to Cybertruck





Siddhant Awasthi’s impact on Tesla and the Cybertruck









Siddhant Awasthi, Tesla’s head of the Cybertruck programme, has announced his departure after more than eight years with the company. Rising from an intern to a senior leadership role, Awasthi played a key part in shaping several of Tesla’s landmark projects, including the Model 3, the Shanghai Gigafactory, and the groundbreaking Cybertruck. In a LinkedIn post, he reflected on his journey, highlighting the challenges and achievements that defined his career. Known for his technical expertise and leadership skills, Awasthi’s exit marks the end of a significant chapter for Tesla, leaving a lasting legacy on the company’s electric vehicle programmes and demonstrating the impact of innovation, dedication, and collaborative effort in advancing Tesla’s mission and shaping the future of sustainable automotive technology worldwide.Awasthi’s career at Tesla began as an intern immediately following his graduation in 2018. He quickly impressed the leadership with his technical expertise and drive, earning a promotion to engineering manager within two years. This rapid rise continued when he became senior technical programme manager, overseeing the development of the Cybertruck’s 48-volt architecture.By late 2022, as Tesla prepared to start production of the Cybertruck, Awasthi was appointed head of the electric truck programme.He oversaw not only the production ramp-up but also planned future upgrades for Tesla’s high-profile pickup. This trajectory demonstrates both his technical prowess and capacity to lead complex engineering projects at a young age. During his eight-year tenure, Awasthi contributed to multiple core Tesla projects. He was integral to the Model 3 ramp-up, ensuring production efficiency and reliability. He also worked on the Shanghai Gigafactory, helping establish Tesla’s manufacturing footprint in China.His work extended to the development of new electronics and wireless architectures, critical components in Tesla’s advanced electric vehicles. Finally, Awasthi delivered the Cybertruck, Tesla’s most ambitious pickup project to date, known for its futuristic design and advanced technology. His multifaceted contributions showcase a rare blend of engineering skill, programme management, and innovation.In his social media post, Awasthi expressed deep gratitude toward Elon Musk and Tesla’s leadership. He called his colleagues “talented, driven, and truly rockstar,” recognising the collaborative effort required to execute Tesla’s high-intensity projects. He also thanked Tesla’s customers for their support, noting that the company’s vehicles have positively impacted lives by improving safety and delivering tangible value.This acknowledgment underscores Awasthi’s perspective on teamwork and mentorship as essential to career growth, as well as his appreciation for the culture and leadership at Tesla. Despite Awasthi’s leadership, the Cybertruck has faced commercial challenges. Tesla initially aimed to produce 250,000 units annually, yet current sales reportedly remain around 25,000 per year. These figures highlight the complexity and unpredictability of launching a revolutionary vehicle.Nonetheless, Awasthi’s role in guiding the Cybertruck from concept to delivery has been significant. His work on vehicle architecture, production ramp-up, and future upgrades demonstrates a lasting legacy on Tesla’s electric truck programme. Reflecting on his time at Tesla, Awasthi described it as a “thrilling journey,” filled with high-intensity work across multiple programmes. From the Model 3 to the Shanghai Gigafactory and finally the Cybertruck, he emphasised the personal and professional growth he experienced.","Siddhant Awasthi has announced his departure from Tesla after eight years.

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well” Facebook-parent Meta made a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup in June.

Asian markets traded mostly in red on Thursday as excitement over the end of the United States’ record government shutdown quickly lost steam. With the focus shifting back to the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate decision and mounting fears of a technology sector bubble, investors showed little appetite for risk.Nikkei jumped 88 points or 0.17% to 51,152. Shanghai and Shenzhen also inched higher, adding 17 and 238 points respectively.Meanwhile in Hong Kong, HSI dipped 156 points or 0.58% to 26,766. Kospi also traded marginally down, shedding 2 points at 10 AM IST.US lawmakers late on Wednesday approved a bill to end the 43-day shutdown that had paralysed government operations and delayed key economic reports. Later, US President Donald Trump signed the legislation, officially reopening departments that were shuttered for weeks.But despite the breakthrough, trading sentiment was subdued. Investors are now awaiting the release of data that had been held up during the closure, hoping it will offer clues on the health of the world’s largest economy and help shape the Fed’s policy outlook.Still, the White House said October’s employment and inflation numbers might remain unavailable because data collection was interrupted during the stoppage.“Reopening also doesn't mean an instant snap-back to normal for the real economy. When you starve a system of staffing and pay for six weeks, the backlog doesn't vanish just because a bill passed at 8 pm,” wrote Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management. “The shutdown ends with a vote and a signature; the aftershocks show up in queues, call centres and cash-flow stress far away from the Capitol dome,” AFP further cited the analyst.Market caution was also amplified by concerns that the AI-driven boom in technology stocks has pushed valuations too far. Analysts warned that heavy investments in artificial intelligence could take longer than expected to generate returns, sparking fears of an eventual correction.The Nasdaq slipped for a second straight day, while the S&P 500 also struggled. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record close, helped by speculation that investors were shifting money from tech firms into traditional industrial stocks.Oil prices continued to fall after a steep four percent drop on Wednesday, following OPEC’s revised forecast that global crude markets would face a surplus in the third quarter. The group had previously projected a shortfall for the same period. The downgrade, combined with easing tensions in the Middle East and rising output among major producers, has dragged prices lower. The International Energy Agency has also projected record surpluses by 2026.In currency markets, Japan drew attention as the yen slid further. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama told parliament on Wednesday that “the government is watching for any excessive and disorderly moves with a high sense of urgency.”Since her comments, the currency has weakened to nearly 155 per dollar, fuelling speculation that Tokyo may consider intervention. The decline comes as Japan’s central bank maintains its dovish stance on monetary policy, while US markets stabilise following the government’s reopening.","Nikkei jumped 88 points or 0.17% to 51,152.

MCX Gold has recently given a bullish breakout from an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is considered a strong technical signal indicating a potential trend reversal. This breakout suggests renewed buying interest and a shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish. The pattern’s neckline breakout has been confirmed with higher volumes, adding strength to the bullish view.Technically, the inverse head and shoulders pattern represents a phase where selling pressure weakens, and buyers gradually take control. With this breakout, prices are likely to maintain upward momentum in the coming sessions. The next significant resistance and potential target is seen around the ₹129,000 level, where traders may look to book partial profits.On the downside, immediate support is placed near ₹122,600.As long as prices sustain above this support zone, the bullish outlook remains intact. Any pullback toward the support could offer a buying opportunity for traders looking to ride the upward trend. Overall, the current price action, combined with improving momentum indicators, signals that MCX Gold is poised for further gains in the near term. Maintaining positions with a stop loss below ₹122,600 could help manage risk effectively while aiming for the ₹129,000 target.MCX Silver has also given a bullish breakout from an inverse head and shoulders pattern, similar to the recent move seen in MCX Gold. The breakout above the neckline has been accompanied by a noticeable rise in trading volumes, confirming market participation in the uptrend. With this positive setup, prices have the potential to rally toward the ₹164,000 level in the near term. This target aligns with the measured move projection derived from the height of the pattern, further reinforcing the bullish outlook.On the downside, immediate support is seen near ₹152,000. As long as prices sustain above this level, the momentum is expected to remain positive. Any dips toward the support zone could be seen as a buying opportunity for traders with a short- to medium-term perspective. Overall, the technical structure and improving sentiment point to a strong possibility of continued upside movement in MCX Silver, with traders advised to maintain a stop loss below ₹152,000 while aiming for ₹164,000.","Gold prices may continue to rally in the coming sessions, maintaining their upward momentum.

The United States has imposed sanctions on an Indian company among 32 individuals and entities accused of helping Iran’s missile and drone development networks.The US department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control (OFAC) listed Farmlane Private Limited as part of a network operating across Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, China, Hong Kong, India, Germany, and Ukraine, which allegedly supports Iran’s ballistic missile and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) production.According to the treasury department, Farmlane’s director, Marco Klinge, who is based in the UAE, played a key role in coordinating procurement activities for Iran’s defence Industries Organisation through a partnership known as the “MVM partnership.”Klinge, a German national, is also the chief executive officer of Germany-based EVA Handelsgesellschaft UG and the point of contact for UAE-based MVM Amici Trading LLC.The treasury said the partnership, since 2023, procured hundreds of metric tonnes of missile propellant ingredients, including sodium chlorate, sodium perchlorate, and sebacic acid, from Chinese suppliers for Iran’s Parchin Chemical Industries, a unit of Iran’s Defence Industries Organisation.OFAC has designated Klinge, Farmlane, MVM Amici Trading LLC, and EVA Handelsgesellschaft UG under Executive Order 13382, which targets weapons of mass destruction proliferators and their supporters.In a statement, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K Hurley said, “Across the globe, Iran exploits financial systems to launder funds, procure components for its nuclear and conventional weapons programs, and support its terrorist proxies. At the direction of President Trump, we are putting maximum pressure on Iran to end its nuclear threat. The United States also expects the international community to fully implement UN snapback sanctions on Iran to cut off its access to the global financial system. ”The treasury said the sanctioned networks pose a threat to US and allied personnel in the Middle East and to commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The measures are part of Washington’s effort to disrupt Iran’s attempts to rebuild its missile and UAV capabilities following the 12-Day War.","The US department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control (OFAC) listed Farmlane Private Limited as part of a network operating across Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, China, Hong Kong, India, Germany, and Ukraine.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

‘Deport Him…’: Team Trump Moves To Strip Mamdani Of US Citizenship After NYC Win

New York will survive, but will get worse before it gets better







Billionaire real estate investor Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai as he pledged to freeze rents because tenants' incomes have stagnated. Sternlicht who has both commercial and residential holdings in NYC said when one neighbor finds out that their neighbor is not paying, they stop paying and thus NYC will turn into Mumbai.“Over $100 million, every project in New York has to go union, and it’s super expensive. It leads to extremely expensive housing. And other developers have tried to cut deals with the unions, but they rule New York, and that’s one of the key reasons the blue states are so expensive and they’re so difficult to add supply of housing to,” Sternlicht said in an interview with CNBC Property Play, reacting to Mamdani's win.“And then the far left gets really nuts and says the tenants don’t have to pay. Well, you can’t kick them out if they don’t pay. So the neighbor finds out the neighbor isn’t paying, and they don’t pay, and the next guy doesn’t pay, and then you’re basically going to turn New York City into Mumbai,"" he said.Sternlicht said his New York team is considering leaving the city as well.“The core issues are not what he’s focusing on. We need to increase housing.That’s not going to happen easily, right? You need serious subsidies from the government if they want us to work with unions. The unions have to be more accommodative on their work laws and the wages and everything else, otherwise you can’t add economically,"" he said. Sternlicht said rent freezing is not the solution but increasing housing is.Sternlicht said he believed New York will survive but will first gets a lot worse before it gets better. “People are working really hard. Just how do we help others to do well and believe in the American dream? That’s probably a better message for a leader in the city than saying, let’s just tax everyone who’s been successful, force them to leave and then have to rely on Washington for handouts to basically keep the city going,” Sternlicht added.","Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai.

What happens next









US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) signed a government funding bill to end a record 43-day shutdown that triggered financial stress to federal workers. The shutdown highly impacted travellers at several airports in US and led to long queues at food banks.He said, ""I just want to tell you the country has never been in better shape. We went through this short-term disaster with the Democrats because they thought it would be good politically. And it's an honour now to sign this incredible bill and get our country working again.""The longest government shutdown came to an end, but left no one happy as Democrats didn't get what they demanded (health insurance provisions), while Republicans, despite controlling Congress and the White House, faced public backlash.The fallout was severe: thousands of federal employees went without paychecks, airports faced delays and cancellations due to staff shortages, and long lines formed at food banks as nutrition assistance programs stalled. For many Americans, the shutdown's toll extended beyond financial strain, deepening anxiety ahead of the holiday season.The agreement, shaped by the Senate Appropriations Committee, will fund key sectors including food aid, veterans' programs, and legislative operations.However, most federal funding will only be extended until January 30, offering Congress a narrow two-month window to finalise additional spending bills. Trump's signature came just hours after the House passed the legislation, following a Senate vote earlier in the week.According to Reuters, Republican Congressman David Schweikert compared the political stalemate to ""a Seinfeld episode,"" saying, ""We just spent 40 days and I still don't know what the plotline was."" He added, ""What's happened now when rage is policy?""Federal workers are expected to return to their jobs as early as Thursday, but the path to full normalcy remains uncertain, according to a report from Reuters. Air travel services, strained by staffing shortages, are expected to stabilise gradually before the busy Thanksgiving period. Nutrition assistance programs and government data reporting will resume, though some economic indicators — including employment and inflation data for October — may be lost permanently.The stopgap deal also leaves open deeper fiscal questions: government debt continues to grow by roughly $1.8 trillion annually, and partisan divisions over long-term spending loom large as the next funding deadline approaches.","US President Donald Trump signed a government funding bill to end a record 43-day shutdown.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened flat in trade on Thursday. While Nifty50 was near 25,850, BSE Sensex was above 84,400. At 9:17 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,854.85, down 21 points or 0.081%. BSE Sensex was at 84,404.72, down 62 points or 0.073%.Market analysts anticipate the positive trend to continue, backed by ongoing company results, positive developments in India-US trade negotiations, and favourable global market conditions.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The market needs more triggers to take it to new record highs. With the outcome of the Bihar polls largely discounted by the market, there are no political triggers that can push the market significantly higher. The reverse might happen if the actual poll results turn out to be different from the exit polls.”“The important economic factors that have to be watched for is a possible India-US trade deal removing the penal tariffs and reducing the reciprocal tariffs. The decline in October retail inflation in India to 0.25% indicates the possibility of a rate cut from the MPC in December. But the monetary policy transmission turning weak has become a challenge for the RBI.”“In the near-term the market is likely to consolidate and then respond to triggers when they happen. Positive triggers happening simultaneously can lead to short-covering pushing the market sharply up. But sustained uptrend would be challenging given the FII selling and elevated valuations.”On Wednesday, US stock indices showed mixed results, with the Dow Jones reaching a new closing high whilst the Nasdaq declined as investors shifted away from expensive technology shares, whilst considering the probable resolution of the US government shutdown.Asian markets and US equity futures saw flat trade following a tepid Wall Street session, with investors remaining cautious due to few economic indicators data affecting Federal Reserve policy visibility.Foreign portfolio investors recorded net sales of Rs 1,750 crore on Tuesday, while domestic institutional investors made net purchases worth Rs 5,127 crore.","While Nifty50 was near 25,850, BSE Sensex was above 84,400.

Al-Falah doctors’ notebooks show 2-year multi-attack plan





NEW DELHI: In a major development in the Delhi terror blast investigation, sources on Thursday said that the Red Fort blast accused—Dr Muzammil, Dr Adeel, Umar, and Dr Shaheen—had jointly raised around Rs 20 lakh in cash, which was handed over to Umar Un Nabi.The group later procured over 20 quintals of NPK fertiliser worth Rs 3 lakh from Gurugram, Nuh, and nearby areas.The fertiliser was reportedly intended for preparation of improvised explosive devices (IEDs).Sources further revealed that a money dispute had arisen between Umar and Dr Muzammil.Additionally, Umar had reportedly created a group on the Signal app with 2–4 members to coordinate activities, according to investigative agencies.Authorities continue to probe the network, tracing financial transactions, communication records, and materials linked to the terror module.Notebooks and diaries recovered during searches on Tuesday and Wednesday from the campus lodgings of two Al-Falah University doctors involved in the Delhi terror plot suggest they had been planning multiple strikes for over two years, sources involved in the probe told TOI.Evidence allegedly recovered from Room 13, where Muzammil Ganaie resided, and Room 4, occupied by Umar Un Nabi, points to an elaborate terror plan. Investigators said the notebooks and diaries contained coded references, names, and numbers dated from November 8–12, indicating the doctors were plotting multiple attacks.The word “operation” was reportedly scribbled repeatedly throughout the diaries.“The Delhi blast happened on Nov 10. Even if it was not meant to happen that day, the coded messages in the diaries suggest they were planning something big between Nov 8 and 12,” a source said.The investigation has widened to include anyone who may have assisted the suspects. “Those who provided batteries, helped arrange vehicles, secured rented accommodations, and university staff are all under scrutiny. Regular searches are being carried out to check if there are more locations where explosives could be stored,” an investigator said.","Al-Falah doctors’ notebooks show 2-year multi-attack plan, sources say.

The destination offers a new approach to coastal luxury, with a focus on wellness, rejuvenation, and connection to nature. Its guiding principle is simple: to help guests and residents “live longer, better,” whether through tranquil retreats or adventure-filled experiences along the sun-drenched coastline.John Pagano, Group CEO of Red Sea Global, underscores the ambition: AMAALA is envisioned as the new home of wellness, drawing inspiration from Saudi Arabia’s long-standing traditions of retreat and renewal. The destination is designed to balance high-end luxury with environmental and cultural stewardship.AMAALA’s launch will introduce six world-class resorts, alongside a yacht club, marine life institute, state-of-the-art marina, and a Marina Village. A 5km linear park, the Wellness Route, will connect the resorts and experiences, allowing visitors to traverse pristine natural surroundings seamlessly.Additional first-phase attractions include Corallium, a three-level marine life institute highlighting the Red Sea’s biodiversity, and the AMAALA Hotel, offering 144 keys and multiple dining options for staff and guests alike.AMAALA is integral to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. Red Sea Global anticipates the project will create 50,000 jobs and contribute SAR 11 billion (USD 3 billion) to the national GDP upon completion. Phase One alone involved an investment of SAR 51.04 billion, encompassing nine resorts and over 1,600 keys. Future openings include the Clinique La Prairie Health Resort, Jayasom Wellness Resort, and The Ritz-Carlton Resort.The destination also promotes sustainable development at a global scale. Designed to host no more than 500,000 visitors annually, AMAALA aims to achieve a 30% net conservation benefit to local ecosystems by 2040. The development is fully powered by renewable energy, preventing the emission of 350,000 tCO₂e each year.Guests can now easily reach AMAALA via the Red Sea International Airport, now offering direct flights from Doha, Dubai, Jeddah, and Riyadh. Transfers to the resorts will be conducted in luxury electric vehicles, with additional convenient European routes imminent.

"'Forced labor, withholding visa documents': H-1B visa holder from India sues US company; 'Squid Game for Indians'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/forced-labor-withholding-visa-documents-h-1b-visa-holder-from-india-sues-us-company-squid-game-for-indians/articleshow/125254569.cms,"An H-1B visa holder from India has sued his US company, led by an Indian-origin CEO, for forced labor.

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders





Amrutesh Vallabhaneni, an H-1B visa holder in the US, has brought a lawsuit against his employer, accusing the company of forced labor, labor trafficking and withholding visa documents, Breitbart News reported. Jay Palmer, Vallabhaneni's consultant who prepared the lawsuit, said it is a Squid Game for Indian workers in the US job market, as the ultimate goal is to stay in America, surviving the exploitative culture, created by Indian CEOs. These Indian-origin CEOs import their ""home-country caste discrimination politics"" to their workplaces in the US, Palmer said.According to the report, Vallabhaneni studied in India, got an F-1 student visa and a loan to attend a US college in 2015. Then he got OPT (Optional Practical Training), worked at a New Jersey company and then in 2018 moved to the company that he sued. He moved to the company as they promised him H-1B. The lawsuit said that the company violated laws and asked Vallabhaneni to pay his own salary for a period of six months. They also did not pay Vallabhaneni the prevailing wage.But after all this, Vallabhaneni was not free to leave the company as they allegedly threatened to withdraw his H-1B if he did not comply with their requests.The company also promised a green card but continued to pressure Vallabhaneni to accept their terms and conditions; otherwise he would have to leave the US.""Despite being guaranteed a wage by the DOL, AV (Amrutesh Vallabhaneni) often barely had enough money for rent and living expenses for himself and his family. Because of the broken promises and inconsistent pay, his health insurance lapsed, he missed credit card payments, and he and his wife lacked access to needed healthcare. At one point, AV suffered a serious leg injury, but he couldn’t see a doctor,"" the lawsuit said.The company extracted a huge amount of money from AV, forcing him to pay all the visa fees and keeping him on the hook. The report said Vallabhaneni is still working with the company as he waits for the Green Card.","Amrutesh Vallabhaneni, an H-1B visa holder in the US, has brought a lawsuit against his employer, accusing the company of forced labor, labor trafficking and withholding visa documents.
