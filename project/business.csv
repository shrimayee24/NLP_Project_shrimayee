"Assam's tribute to Zubeen Garg: GST from final film Roi Roi Binale to be donated; funds to support flood victims, needy students",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assams-tribute-to-zubeen-garg-gst-from-final-film-roi-roi-binale-to-be-donated-funds-to-support-flood-victims-needy-students/articleshow/124933093.cms,"The Assam government will be donating its entire share of GST collected from the upcoming Assamese film Roi Roi Binale, the last movie featuring Zubeen Garg . The amount will be handed over to the Kalaguru Artiste Foundation, a charitable organisation set up by the late singer for humanitarian work.CM Himanta Biswa Sarma told reporters on Wednesday that there is no entertainment tax levied on films in the state. He clarified that this means there is no scope to offer any waiver, as some people had demanded.""The state government will exclusively hand over its share of the GST realised from the movie to the Kalaguru Artiste Foundation to support medical treatment of artistes, help flood victims, and assist needy students in their academic pursuits,"" Sarma said.He explained that the GST applicable on cinema tickets varies depending on the ticket price. “For movie tickets above Rs 100, there is 18% GST and it is 5% GST for tickets priced below Rs 100. The state share is half of that rate and we will get the money later. We will then hand it over to the foundation,” he added. The CM also mentioned that the decision was finalised after Garg’s wife agreed to the proposal.The Kalaguru Artiste Foundation, created by Garg, carries out philanthropic activities in Assam.Alongside this announcement, the chief minister also listed several other decisions cleared by the cabinet, including financial approval for the second phase of the Asian Development Bank-backed ‘Climate Resilient Brahmaputra Integrated Flood and Riverbank Erosion Risk Management Project’.The state has earmarked Rs 2,205.75 crore as additional funding for this phase. The project will be implemented by the Flood and River Erosion Management Agency of Assam, acting as the project management unit, while the Water Resources Department and the Assam Agroforestry Development Board (AADB) will serve as the project implementation units.In another major decision, the cabinet approved the settlement of hereditary land rights for members of the Moran and Matak communities. The chief minister said this would follow the same model used for tribal communities under Mission Basundhara 2.0.","The state government will be donating its entire share of GST collected from the upcoming Assamese film Roi Roi Binale.

Yes Bank-ADAG loan fraud case: Anil Ambani's son under CBI lens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/yes-bank-adag-loan-fraud-case-anil-ambanis-son-under-cbi-lens/articleshow/124925266.cms,"MUMBAI: While industrialist Anil Ambani has been chargesheeted by CBI in the Yes Bank loan fraud case, his son, Jai Anmol Ambani , has come under the lens.According to the chargesheet filed recently, the CBI said that as part of its further investigations, it was probing the role of Jai, who was then executive director of Reliance Capital Ltd (RCL), when Reliance Nippon Mutual Fund, part of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani (ADA) Group, subscribed to non-convertible debentures (NCDs) worth 1,160 crore of Morgan Credits Pvt Ltd at a low interest rate and invested 2,250 crore in Yes Bank's AT-1 bonds under Anil's influence as part of a quid pro quo arrangement. Radha Kapoor and Roshini Kapoor, daughters of Yes Bank's former MD and CEO Rana Kapoor , are the promoters/directors of Morgan Credits.The CBI said Anil and Jai interfered in the decision-making process at Reliance Nippon Mutual Fund without informing its Japanese partner, prompting objections and allegations. It said Jai held monthly review meetings with the mutual fund firm's officers, expressed displeasure over their performance, and directed that he be informed of any mutual fund investment of 50 crore or more before execution. This interference led to internal objections, but the directives were eventually withdrawn, the chargesheet stated.It alleged that Anil entered into a criminal conspiracy with Kapoor to get the bank to subscribe to his group companies' NCDs and commercial papers (CPs) worth 3,400 crore ""when there was no demand for them in the secondary market."" It further alleged that Kapoor pushed for the NCDs' acquisition despite knowing that holding them for an extended period would harm the bank.The chargesheet said that in return, Kapoor's wife, Bindu, received credit facilities of 570 crore from Anil's companies at a lower interest rate. ""...Yes Bank Limited suffered a total loss of 2,796.77 crore due to subscribing to NCDs and CPs of RHFL (Reliance Home Finance Ltd) and RCFL (Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd),"" the chargesheet stated.The CBI has named 13 accused in the chargesheet, including Bindu, Kapoor, Radha, and Roshini. None of them has been arrested. The agency also said it is probing the role of another daughter of the Kapoors, Rakhee.The chargesheet said Kapoor and Anil held frequent meetings, but no bank officer attended these. Following these discussions, Kapoor instructed his bank officers to process proposals for Anil's companies, it said.","Jai Anmol Ambani was executive director of Reliance Capital Ltd.

Purpose not to usurp HCs' powers, looking at norms for uniformity: SC



NEW DELHI: Undercurrents of two-decade-long discontent over the apex court framing service rules for state judicial officers brimmed over on Wednesday with the Allahabad high court bluntly telling Supreme Court to adopt a ""hands-off approach"" over the issue.Allahabad HC, which in the recent past has been censured by Supreme Court for delays in deciding cases, said, ""The SC should leave it to the HCs to chalk out the framework for ensuring adequate promotional avenues to career judicial officers and direct recruit district judges. Article 227(1) gives HCs superintendence over district judiciary.""Representing the high court, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said, ""Why should the high courts be divested of their authority and duty under the Constitution? It is time to strengthen the HCs, not weaken them. Things have gone too far.""In 2017, the SC had in principle finalised a concept paper advocating that SC should conduct the recruitment test for direct appointee district judges from among advocates. We protested and it was stalled. SC can't be fixing retirement age, quota for the career judicial officers and eligibility"", Dwivedi, representing Allahabad HC, said.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, K Vinod Chandran and Joymalya Bagchi said the concept of an All India Judicial Service is still alive and if it comes to fruition, SC may have some role to play in framing uniform service rules for the district judiciary.Justice Kant, the next CJI, said, ""The purpose of present proceedings is not to usurp the powers of HCs in relation to district judiciary. We are considering whether a general guideline is needed to bring in some uniformity in promotions to the post of district judge. ""There are states where a person who joins as a civil judge junior division and through the seniority-cum-merit route takes two decades to become a district judge (DJ), but lawyers with 10 years' practice can clear an examination to become district judges. There is a third category under which judicial officers, through limited departmental competitive examination, can become DJs.The ratio for promotion to DJ's post was 50-25-25 in 2002, which was made 65-25-10 in 2010 and again reverted to 50-25-25 by SC. CJI Gavai said, ""We do not even remotely intend to take away powers of the HCs"" but asked why Allahabad HC is so averse to a uniform service rule for judicial officers and what suggestions it has to offer.Dwivedi said, ""I am not giving any suggestion but persuading the SC to adopt a hands-off approach on this issue. The service conditions vary from state to state, and HC is in the best position to consider these aspects while framing service rules. SC can interfere in those cases where the HC is unable to manage the affairs of the subordinate judiciary or where the administration of justice in district courts has broken down. .."" he said, and argued against any quota for judicial officers' promotion to DJ posts.For Punjab and Haryana HC, senior advocate Maninder Acharya said the present system is working well in the two states and there is no need for SC to create a quota for career judicial officers. For direct-recruit DJs from Kerala, Bihar and Delhi, the advocates supported the argument that SC should not tweak present promotion procedure.","Allahabad high court bluntly tells Supreme Court to adopt a ""hands-off approach"" over the issue.

8th Pay Commission : Top things to know about Cabinet decision





In a big cheer for central government employees, PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved the Terms of Reference for the 8th Central Pay Commission.The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will impact the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and 69 lakh retired personnel.In January 2025, the Government announced the formation of the 8th Central Pay Commission to review and propose revisions to the salaries and benefits of Central Government employees.Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: How much salary & pension hike should central government employees, pensioners expect? Top things to know According to the Cabinet release, the 8th Central Pay Commission Commission will function as a temporary entity, consisting of a Chairperson, one Part-Time Member, and one Member-Secretary. Its recommendations are due within 18 months of its establishment, with the possibility of submitting interim reports when specific recommendations are finalised.The 8th Pay Commission, led by former Supreme Court justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, will deliver a preliminary report to the government.Professor Pulak Ghosh from IIM Bangalore has been appointed as a part-time commissioner, whilst Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain will serve as the Member Secretary.When questioned about the implementation timing of the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations, I&B Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""The specific date will be decided once the interim report comes in... But, mostly it should be January 1, 2026.""The 8th Central Pay Commission's deliberations will consider:i. The economic conditions in the country and the need for fiscal prudence;ii. The need to ensure that adequate resources are available for developmental expenditure and welfare measures;iii. The unfunded cost of non-contributory pension schemes;iv. The likely impact of the recommendations on the finances of the State Governments which usually adopt the recommendations with some modifications; andv. The prevailing emolument structure, benefits and working conditions available to employees of Central Public Sector Undertakings and private sector.Terms of Reference (TOR) serves as a framework document for a pay commission, establishing guidelines and parameters for preparing its report. It includes essential definitions, terms and conditions that guide the commission's work.The Terms of Reference is drafted by a Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM), with final approval from the Cabinet Committee under the Finance Ministry. The JCM includes union representatives from various ministries. From its 60 members, 12 are chosen for the standing committee. These selected members engage in discussions about TOR subjects with secretary-level government officials. The finalised TOR is then submitted for Cabinet approval.The significance of TOR lies in its function as a main reference document when a pay commission develops its recommendations.According to a TOI report, The government has kept the terms of reference undisclosed, yet the committee's primary responsibility involves examining the financial implications of non-contributory pension programmes.The central government's decision to transition from the National Pension System to Unified Pension Scheme for pre-2004 recruits lacks clarity on pension payment obligations.This absence of estimated liabilities has resulted in no budgetary allocations. Additionally, any increase in employee remuneration and benefits will inevitably lead to enhanced pension commitments.Central Pay Commissions are established periodically to assess and recommend changes to emoluments, retirement benefits and service conditions for Central Government employees.These recommendations are typically implemented on a ten-year cycle. Following this pattern, the 8th Central Pay Commission's recommendations would take effect from January 1, 2026.The 7th Pay Commission was established in February 2014, with its proposals taking effect from January 1, 2016.Central government staff receive dearness allowance (DA) to offset inflation's impact on their actual salary value. This DA rate undergoes regular revision every six months, with adjustments linked to inflation levels.","The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will impact the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and 69 lakh retired personnel.

Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

Also read |

What is KYV?

The Process

The Pain

If recurring KYCs was not enough, there’s now a KYV that you must go through if you happen to own a vehicle. Short for know your vehicle, this new process that is supposed to sanitise your FASTag is the latest compliance burden to be thrust on Indians.What was the need? Apparently, cases of misuse of FASTags — in some cases by truck drivers who were using tags meant for cars — convinced policy-makers that they needed a nationwide firewall to prevent a bunch of delinquents from misusing FASTags.It was rolled out as a mandatory process, beginning Oct 31, 2024, that requires all FASTag users to submit images of their vehicle and registration certificate to verify that the tag is linked to the correct vehicle. A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiative, KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). To prevent fraud. And if you thought this was a one-time process, you’re wrong. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Why? The possibility of misuse, and ingenious delinquents finding more ways to bend the system.A govt official explained that instances had emerged of people keeping loose FASTags in their pockets or wallets, instead of fixing them on their vehicle windshields, “leading to misuse”.“In some cases, tags issued for cars were used on trucks to pay lower toll charges. KYV will put an end to such misuse,” said another official.A source said since the main thrust of the FASTag rollout was to increase its usage so that toll collection became digitised, there may have been some laxity on the part of banks while issuing them. A KYV, said officials, will “help sanitise the system”.“Ensuring a FASTag is assigned to and affixed on the correct category of vehicle, and that it remains active, is crucial as we prepare to roll out multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system of tolling in which vehicles will neither need to stop, nor slow down as there will be no physical barriers, said a road transport ministry official.Govt aims to bring all national highways that have four or more lanes under MLFF tolling in the next 4-5 years. Therefore, according to officials, one vehicle, one tag is so important.Asked why not detect and disable fraudulent tags or penalise those using multiple tags on the same vehicle, there were no clear answers.According to the circular issued by NPCI, all FASTags need to comply with KYV norms. The process mandates linking the FASTag to the unique Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) and chassis number. FASTag issuers, meanwhile, need to follow the one-vehicle-one tag mandate and replace all tags that are more than five years old.So, anyone with a FASTag must upload their vehicle registration certificate (RC), take a picture of their vehicle from the front and upload that along with the FASTtag and vehicle registration number, besides a side image with the tag and vehicle axles. All these, mind you, must be clearly visible.Issuers need to verify this with the VAHAN database, customer mobile number, and data entered by the point-of-sale agent. FASTags without a valid KYV will get automatically deactivated.While there is great conviction among decision-makers that KYV is the right way to go, there are unpleasant surprises galore that the process is throwing up for people, from being stopped at toll plazas and being told FASTag isn’t working because of “non-compliance with KYV”, to encountering an upload process that involves multiple rounds of clicking photos and sharing documents. Adding to frustrations is its propensity to get stuck — a backend that is simply not prepared to handle such a mammoth job — and sending harried users back to square one.“I was told by a toll gate attendant that my FASTag isn’t working because KYV hasn’t been completed. So, I stopped and had to go through the entire process of taking photos and uploading documents from the toll plaza, just so I could drive on without a penalty despite having a legal and functional FASTag. Govt talks about ease of life, ease of travel, ease of business, etc. How is this ease of anything?” a Delhi resident who recently had to do a KYV at a toll plaza in NCR asked.Having seen people struggle through this, govt officials have started telling banks they should not deactivate tags without calling up customers and informing them about the KYV norm. Sources said the issuer bank, not NPCI, is involved in backend processing of KYV documents.A senior road transport ministry official admitted the process needs to be made easier for the people. Another official said that having a similar process across bank portals and a helpline to guide people could be useful.",KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to prevent fraud. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. The process mandates linking the FASTag to the unique Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) and chassis number.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124896681,imgsize-44982,width-400,resizemode-4/lkn-2.jpg"

Delhi Tries to Make It Rain With Cloud Seeding: A High-Stakes Weather Experiment to Fight Toxic Air

The Experiment: Delhi Tries to Play Storm



Give them the forecast (Storm destroys Sentinels in X-Men 97)

The Good: When Cloud-Seeding Actually Works



In short:

Cloud-seeding can work when conditions are right — it’s proven science, not science fiction.

It has history — the first experiments began in the 1930s, and GE scientists refined the silver iodide method in the 1940s.

It can temporarily clean the air — even light drizzle helps wash particulate matter out of the atmosphere.

The Bad: Why Delhi’s Skies Refused



Delhi Stays Dry; IIT-K Says Trace Rain In Noida

The Ugly: It never rains, it pours



The Takeaway: The Real Fight Is on the Ground



In the X-Men universe, an Omega-level mutant is defined as one whose dominant power has no upper limit. Among them was Ororo Munroe, better known by her moniker Storm , who could make it rain at will because she could control the entire planetary ecosystem. This led Magneto, in the X-Men ’97 reboot, to refer to her as the closest thing to a divine being, which in essence is what humans have been trying to do since we arrived on earth. We have managed to fly distant continents, split the atom, create antimatter, build machines that mimic the mind, map the human genome, reach the moon, grow meat without animals and diamonds in a lab — but we still struggle to, like Storm, make it rain at will.And yet, every so often, we try. From Beijing to Dubai, humans have spent decades firing silver iodide into clouds, hoping to bend the weather to our will. The latest to attempt this act of atmospheric persuasion was Delhi — a city so desperate for clean air it decided to summon rain from a clear sky.As the capital’s air turned toxic this October, officials tried what man dreams of – making it rain. The Delhi government signed a memorandum of understanding with IIT-Kanpur for a ₹3.2 crore cloud-seeding project, costing roughly ₹64 lakh per trial.The plan: send small Cessna planes to spray silver iodide flares into the sky, hoping to coax moisture from passing clouds.After three sorties over north Delhi, no significant rainfall was recorded. The Air Quality Index stayed locked in the “poor” to “very poor” range. It wasn’t the first time Delhi tried this; earlier attempts in 1957 and the 1970s had fizzled out too. Seven decades later, the capital cannot summon rain.To be fair, cloud-seeding is real science, not magic. The idea dates back nearly a century. By dispersing tiny particles — typically silver iodide or dry ice — into moisture-rich clouds, scientists can trigger condensation, forming heavier droplets that fall as rain. Under the right conditions, studies show seeding can boost rainfall by 5–15%.India’s own experiments have produced promising results. The IITM’s CAIPEEX programme over drought-prone Maharashtra recorded rainfall increases of up to 46% on seeded days. Research by IIT-Kanpur and the IMD also found measurable gains when the atmosphere was suitably humid.Other countries have gone further. China, the UAE, Indonesia, Malaysia and even Pakistan regularly conduct cloud-seeding operations — to induce rain for agriculture, combat smog, or clear skies before major events. The principle is straightforward: if clouds are ripe, give them a nudge.If Delhi’s skies had resembled monsoon season, the plan might have bought the city a brief reprieve. Unfortunately, nature didn’t cooperate.The failure wasn’t surprising. The skies above Delhi simply didn’t have enough to give. Humidity during the trials hovered around 20%. The clouds themselves carried only about 15–20% moisture — far too little for the silver iodide particles to latch onto. As one IIT Delhi scientist told TOI , “You can’t seed what isn’t there.” Then there was the cost. Each sortie ran up a bill of around ₹64 lakh. Three flights later, Delhi saw barely 0.1–0.2 mm of drizzle in Noida and NCR. Crores spent, for a few drops on the windshield.Even if the mission had succeeded, experts warned the impact would have been fleeting. Pollution in Delhi is relentless — driven by vehicles, factories, construction dust and seasonal stubble burning. A passing drizzle might wash away particulates for a few hours, but the smog returns as soon as emissions resume.Environmentalists called it a gimmick. As one told TOI: “Artificial rain is symbolic, not a real solution."" Without curbing pollution at its source, they argue, cloud-seeding is little more than an atmospheric placebo — a photo-op in the sky while the ground burns below.For a cautionary tale, one need only look west. In April 2024, Dubai was hit by record-breaking floods — a year’s worth of rain in a single day — prompting viral claims that the UAE’s cloud-seeding had gone rogue. Meteorologists quickly debunked it.As the Associated Press reported, the deluge was purely natural, caused by a large storm system. The UAE’s National Meteorology Centre confirmed that no seeding flights were conducted during the event. “You don’t need cloud seeding’s influence to account for the record deluge,” noted Yale meteorologist Jeff Masters back then.Still, the incident was telling. Weather manipulation has always carried the whiff of hubris — the belief that we can outthink chaos. The same misgivings surfaced in Saudi Arabia in 2020, when unseasonal rains sparked rumours of a “seeding disaster.” No evidence emerged, but the perception lingered: tamper with the skies, and you risk taking the blame when nature pushes back.Delhi’s cloud-seeding project joins a long line of grand, short-lived solutions to deep-rooted problems. Like Dubai’s floods or Beijing’s Olympic “blue sky” campaigns, these attempts make for good optics but poor outcomes.If India truly wants clean air, it must look down, not up — towards sustained emission cuts, stricter enforcement, and cleaner energy. The technology that could save Delhi already exists on the ground: electric mobility, dust control, crop management. No silver iodide flare can substitute for political will.Because unlike Storm, we can’t command the weather. And unlike gods, we don’t control chaos. All we can do is face the smoke we made — and start cleaning it up.","Cloud-seeding is proven science, not science fiction.

The People’s Liberation Army (PLA), however, continues with its relentless infrastructure build-up along the frontier.At the 23rd round of corps commander-level meeting at the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point in eastern Ladakh on Oct 25, “both sides agreed to continue to use existing mechanisms to resolve any ground issues along the border to maintain stability”, the external affairs ministry said on Wednesday.This was the first meeting of the “general-level mechanism” in the western sector of the LAC since the 24th round of special representatives talks between national security advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Aug this year.The meeting between the Indian 14 Corps commander and the South Xinjiang Military District chief was held in “a friendly and cordial atmosphere”. The two sides “noted the progress” since the 22nd round between them a year ago and “shared the view that peace and tranquillity has been maintained in the border areas”, the MEA said.The troop disengagement at Depsang and Demchok, along with “coordinated patrolling” by the rival troops there, has certainly reduced the chances of any clashes and inadvertent vertical escalation. The trust deficit, however, remains high, sources said.De-escalation and the consequent de-induction of troops, which will require return of all additional troops to their permanent peacetime locations, and the restoration of status quo that existed before April 2020 are “still nowhere on the horizon”, the sources added.After initially being caught off-guard, India had pumped in well over 50,000 troops into eastern Ladakh, along with heavy weapon systems like tanks, howitzers and surface-to-air missile systems, to match the PLA after it made multiple incursions into the region in April-May 2020. Similar “mirroring” of forward troop deployments took place in the eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal) and middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal) sectors of the LAC as well.“Over five years later, there have been some troop reductions, which in any case is done during the winters. But the bulk of the troops from either side remain in place. There is an uneasy calm,” a source said.China’s continuing massive infrastructure build-up all along the LAC, which ensures it can rush additional troops and weapons to forward areas many times faster than India, remains a major concern.Similarly, China has deployed additional fighters, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones at its airfields facing India like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi, Lhunze and Hoping after upgrading them with new and extended runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities, as reported earlier by TOI.Restoration of patrolling rights in areas where “no patrol buffer zones” were established to India’s disadvantage after previous rounds of disengagement till Sept 2022 is also yet to take place.There was supposed to be only “a temporary moratorium” in patrolling in these buffer zones at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3-km to 10-km, which largely came up on what India considers to be its own territory.","The military thrust amid the ongoing diplomatic détente is to manage tensions and “maintain peace and tranquillity” The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) continues with its relentless infrastructure build-up along the frontier. The trust deficit, however, remains high, sources said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124922218,imgsize-60228,width-400,resizemode-4/pm-modi-xi-jinping-file-photo.jpg"

Climate financing 12-14 times less than what's needed: United Nations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/climate-financing-12-14-times-less-than-whats-needed-united-nations/articleshow/124921646.cms,"NEW DELHI: A new UN report, released Wednesday, warned that developing countries will need at least $310-365 billion per year by 2035 for taking adaptation measures to protect lives, livelihoods, and economies from the impact of climate change, but the current financing lags far behind at around $26 billion (2023 values) - 12-14 times less than what is actually needed by them. Released by the UN Environment Programme, the report said the ""world is gearing up for climate resilience without the money to get there"".It underlined that though overall adaptation planning and implementation are improving, the Glasgow Climate Pact goal of doubling international public adaptation finance to $40 billion by 2025 from 2019 levels will not be achieved, and this gap will put millions at greater risk from floods, heatwaves and storms. International public adaptation finance flows to developing countries, in fact, declined from $28 billion in 2022 to $26 billion in 2023.""Climate impacts are accelerating. Yet adaptation finance is not keeping pace, leaving the world's most vulnerable exposed to rising seas, deadly storms, and searing heat,"" said UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres in his message on the report. ""Adaptation is not a cost - it is a lifeline. Closing the adaptation gap is how we protect lives, deliver climate justice, and build a safer, more sustainable world.""The report, released ahead of the annual UN climate conference (CO) in Brazil, also flagged that the new goal for climate finance that calls for developed nations to provide at least $300 billion for climate action in developing countries per year by 2035 is ""insufficient to close the finance gap"".Though the amount ($300 billion per year) was agreed at COP29 in Baku last year, developing countries, including India, expressed strong objections to it as they wanted it to be raised to $1.3 trillion per year by 2035.The report said if the past decade's inflation rate is extended to 2035, the estimated adaptation finance needed by developing countries goes from $310-365 billion per year in 2023 prices to $440-520 billion per year.",New UN report warns developing countries will need at least $310-365 billion per year by 2035.

SC focuses on timeline for framing of charges; to pass order on 60-day BNSS window,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-focuses-on-timeline-for-framing-of-charges-to-pass-order-on-60-day-bnss-window/articleshow/124919560.cms,"To Pass Order On 60-Day BNSS Window

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over delay in framing of charges which derail trial in criminal cases, Supreme Court on Wednesday decided to deal with the problem by passing pan-India guidelines for implementation of provision of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) which says that a court shall frame a charge against the accused within a period of 60 days from the date of first hearing.Taking note that many courts across the country take months and years in framing of charges, a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria said that the problem needed to be addressed and requested attorney general R Venkataramani to guide the court in the case and also appointed noted criminal lawyer Siddharth Luthra as amicus curiae to assist the court.BNSS, which replaced colonial era Criminal Procedure Code, sets specific timelines for criminal investigations and trials but it seems to remain only in the rule book and not being implemented on ground, resulting in trials getting delayed like earlier times.""Perusal of Section 251 BNSS, which governs framing of charges, read thus. Clause b of 251 indicates that where the matter is exclusively triable by the court, it should frame charges within 60 days of the first hearing on the charge. We have noticed, time and again, the charges are not being framed even after months and years after framing of chargesheet. This is one of the primary reasons for the trial getting delayed.Until and unless it is framed, trial will not commence. As such, this situation seems to be prevalent in most of the courts and we are of the considered opinion that certain directions need to be issued pan India in this regard,"" the bench said.The court passed the order while hearing a bail plea of an accused from Bihar who had been in jail for the last one year. It was brought to court's notice that charges in the case had not been framed in the last one year by the court. The bench decided that it was a fit case to intervene to address the problem of delay in framing of charge and expanded the ambit of the case.Earlier in this month, another bench of the apex court had earlier also flagged the issue of delay in framing of charge and had noted that charges had not been framed by trial court in Maharashtra despite chargesheets being filed years ago and trials had not commenced in at least 649 criminal cases.",Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria said that the problem needed to be addressed.

Battle for Bihar: Sanjay Jha Reaffirms NDA Will Fight Assembly Polls Under Nitish Kumar's Leadership

NEW DELHI: In the run up to Bihar assembly poll announcement, Nitish Kumar was seen as NDA's weak link - his fitness under scrutiny, focus on CM's gaffes in and outside legislatures, the image of 'sushashan babu' fraying as sensational murders and collapse of bridges made national headlines allowing RJD-led Mahagathbandhan to home in on him.Halfway into the campaign, his challenger Tejashwi Yadav of RJD was goading voters by claiming that BJP will not repeat Nitish as CM if NDA retains power. But, as if on cue, BJP member and deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary said he will remain the CM, its poll in-charge and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan insisted there is no vacancy for CM's post and other allies like Chirag Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi endorsed his leadership.As polling day nears, the JD(U) president remains not only NDA's most dependable face in state, but also someone whom large sections continue to look up to. His party's strength has declined in the assembly over successive elections but he continues to be seen as the alliance's most assured bridge to victory.His arch rival Lalu Prasad's derisive sobriquet of 'Paltu Ram', a colloquial turn on his frequent switches between the two rival alliances in state, appeared to have stuck for a while.But what has endured for his supporters is his deliverance of Bihar from the 15-year govt of Lalu and his wife Rabri Devi, a period dubbed as 'jungle raj' by NDA for its alleged lawlessness and retreat of state from various spheres of public life.Nitish is credited for restoration of basics of governance in his 20-long years in office, save for nine months of Jitan Ram Manjhi between 2014 and 2015. A quality road network, reliable power supply with electricity reaching almost every village by 2016, state's turn to the rule of law, and partial gains in school education and healthcare, at least at primary level, are considered undeniable successes of his era.While a sense of fatigue, poor employment opportunities with little let-up in migration from the state, and public frustration of those who want the state to have more than basic necessities pose a big challenge to him, what helps him is that the opposition's chief ministerial face Tejashwi continues to be weighed down with the legacy of his father.BJP's support is a big help as it ensures support of vocal upper castes and non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs among whom the saffron party has steadily made inroads. PM Narendra Modi has been warning voters in his rallies and virtual interactions against the return of 'jungle raj' of RJD, while offering wholehearted endorsement of Nitish.Lalu had famously said he might not have given people 'swarg' (heaven) but did render them 'swar' (voice), a suggestion that RJD govt empowered socially-deprived classes even though it scored poorly on governance. Nitish is seen to have succeeded in broadening the empowerment tent by pivoting govt's welfare focus to EBCs and most-deprived of Scheduled Castes, and provided an efficient administration as well. Focus on governance, building of infrastructure and a push for welfare schemes and empowerment initiatives like quotas for women and EBCs seem to be cushioning against attempts to turn his long tenure into a vulnerability.To his admirers, Nitish is also a rare politician who, despite his two decades in office, has managed to avoid any taint of corruption or charge of subversion of due process for rewarding his band of loyalists with govt jobs or contracts, an attribute brought into sharp relief when compared to a host of netas heading regional parties, not the least his arch rival Lalu.Despite lacking the advantage of an assured vote bank like Lalu, whose caste Yadavs account for over 14.2% of population, Nitish has assiduously weaved a support block comprising of sections of non-Yadav OBCs, EBCs and Scheduled Castes.In his multiple stints in office since 2005, the 74-year-old neta has cultivated women voters with a host of sops, from 35% quota in govt jobs to 50% quota in local bodies. The recent transfer of Rs 10,000 to over 1.20 crore of them being the latest outreach. His choice of keeping family members out of politics also casts him in a positive light for his supporters when no major regional party leadership can escape the charge of nepotism.",Nitish Kumar was seen as NDA's weak link in run up to Bihar assembly poll announcement.

Delhi Tries to Make It Rain With Cloud Seeding: A High-Stakes Weather Experiment to Fight Toxic Air





NEW DELHI: Experts have termed Delhi govt's cloud seeding trials, held on Tuesday, a ""hugely expensive, temporary and unsustainable"" measure to deal with the capital's toxic pollution. Even if the artificial rain temporarily settles down the pollutants, the pollution will rise in one-two days, they say.According to the MoU signed between the Delhi environment department and IIT-Kanpur, the budget for cloud seeding is over Rs 3.2 crore for five trials —meaning one trial run costs Rs 64 lakh. Three trials have been done in north Delhi, and none of them led to any major rain. Delhi's air quality index (AQI) has been hovering in the ‘very poor' to ‘poor' range for the past few days.Also read: 1st ever cloud seeding: How a freezer experiment in 1946 led to mankind’s first attempt to make artificial rain; know history Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""The city has not yet recorded any substantial rainfall after cloud seeding. Even if the rains wash out the pollutants, the pollution will bounce back quickly. The impact lasts from hours to a couple of days.""Stressing that the initiative is not sustainable, she said, ""It cannot be done regularly for the entire winter season.Such investments need to target actual emission reduction from sources on the ground for sustained air quality improvement to protect public health.""Shahzad Gani, assistant professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT Delhi, said that in the winter season, the weather in Delhi is typically very dry, with very little moisture in the air. The only time it usually rains during winter is when a western disturbance influences the plains.""If it rains due to a western disturbance, there is no point in carrying out cloud seeding. And if an intense spell of rain occurs simultaneously during the cloud seeding process, causing very heavy rain and damage to life and property — even if it is actually unrelated to cloud seeding — who will take responsibility for it?"" he said, adding. ""Why do we adopt silver-bullet technologies like smog towers, smog guns and cloud seeding? There is a need to systematically reduce emissions from different sources. ""Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst of think tank EnviroCatalysts, said addressing air quality requires tackling sector-specific emissions from transport, power and construction. Without that, no real impact can be achieved, he added. ""Cosmetic measures may create short-term visibility benefits but are not sustainable solutions. The focus should instead be on coordinated action across states and agencies through an airshed-based approach that targets the actual sources of pollution,"" he said.Activist Bhavreen Kandhari said cloud seeding can only enhance rainfall when the atmosphere is moisture-deficient and conditions are marginal for precipitation. ""The skies were already rich with moisture, and a western disturbance was forecast to bring natural rain. Under such circumstances, cloud seeding adds little scientific value; it becomes a costly experiment chasing what nature is already prepared to deliver. Clean air will not come from artificial rain, but from sustained reductions in emissions, dust control, and responsible policy,"" said Kandhari.","Experts have termed Delhi govt's cloud seeding trials, held on Tuesday, a ""hugely expensive, temporary and unsustainable"" measure.

OpenAI's IPO plans: AI giant might see up to $1 trillion valuation—When to expect it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/openais-ipo-plans-ai-giant-might-see-up-to-1-trillion-valuationwhen-to-expect-it/articleshow/124931997.cms,"



ChatGPT parent OpenAI might hit Wall Street soon in what could become one of the largest IPOs ever. According to sources, the initial public offering would place the company at a valuation of up to $1 trillion.The artificial intelligence giant has been exploring a potential regulatory filing as early as the second half of 2026, Reuters reported citing sources.In initial conversations, OpenAI has examined raising around $60 billion at the lower end, with expectations that the final figure could be higher. However, those familiar with the matter highlighted that discussions are preliminary and that the valuation, timing and size of the fundraising could shift depending on business performance and market conditions.Chief financial officer Sarah Friar has reportedly told some associates that the company is targeting a listing in 2027, although the advisers involved believe that the process could move faster, potentially landing in late 2026.“An IPO is not our focus, so we could not possibly have set a date,” an OpenAI spokesperson told Reuters. “We are building a durable business and advancing our mission so everyone benefits from AGI.”The preparations come after a major internal restructuring aimed at reducing its dependence on Microsoft.An IPO would enable OpenAI to raise capital more efficiently and use publicly traded shares to pursue larger acquisitions, helping fund CEO Sam Altman ’s intention to channel trillions of dollars into AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking.The company, now valued at about $500 billion, is expected to reach an annualised revenue run rate of approximately $20 billion by the end of the year, Reuters reported citing sources.However, despite booming sales, losses are also rising, the agency added.During a livestream on Tuesday, Altman acknowledged that going public was increasingly likely. “I think it's fair to say it is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we'll have,” he said.Founded as a nonprofit in 2015, OpenAI later created a capped-profit structure to ensure the nonprofit retained oversight and prioritised safe development of AI technology. This week, the business underwent another overhaul. A nonprofit, now known as the OpenAI Foundation, continues to hold control but now owns a 26% stake in OpenAI Group and holds a warrant for additional shares if certain performance milestones are met. The update gives the nonprofit entity financial stake in the company’s future success.A listing would deliver substantial returns to early backers, including SoftBank, Thrive Capital and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion, now owns about 27% of the company, Reuters reported.The discussions come at a time when AI is dominating investor appetite in global markets. Earlier this year, AI cloud operator CoreWeave went public at a valuation of $23 billion and has since roughly tripled. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a market value of $5 trillion, underlining its position at the centre of the worldwide AI investment boom.","ChatGPT parent OpenAI might hit Wall Street soon in what could become one of the largest IPOs ever.

US Federal Reserve decision: What Jerome Powell said

Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public and private sector data that have remained available suggest that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September.

Conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling, and inflation remains somewhat elevated.

Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. GDP rose at a 1.6% pace in the first half of the year, down from 2.4% last year.

Data available prior to the shutdown show that growth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer trajectory than expected, primarily reflecting stronger consumer spending, business investment in equipment and intangibles has continued to expand, while activity in the housing sector remains weak.

The shutdown of the federal government will weigh on economic activity while it persists, but these effects should reverse after the shutdown ends.

In the labor market, the unemployment rate remained relatively low through August, job gains have slowed significantly since earlier in the year. A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force due to lower immigration and labor force participation, though labor demand has clearly softened as well.

Available evidence suggests that both layoffs and hiring remain low and that both households perceptions of job availability and firms, perceptions of hiring difficulty continue to decline in this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen in recent months.

Tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods resulting in higher overall inflation. A reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation will be relatively short lived, a one time shift in the price level.

But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed. Our obligation is to ensure that a one time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.

In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside a challenging situation

We judged it appropriate at this meeting to take another step toward a more neutral policy stance.

A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion, far from it.





US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on Wednesday cut the key benchmark rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to the 3.75-4.00 per cent range. According to the FOMC statement, ""uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated.""“Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August; more recent indicators are consistent with these developments. Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated,” it said.“In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee decided to conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings on December 1. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,” the statement said.Whilst the Federal Reserve has indicated potential additional rate reductions in December, the current lack of economic data creates additional uncertainty regarding their forthcoming decisions.This is the second consecutive rate cut by the central bank, aiming to safeguard against increasing employment market uncertainties, amid evident disagreements within the committee.The Fed's statement indicated that committee members voted 10-2 to reduce the central bank's primary lending rate.Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented, advocating for a larger 0.50 percentage point reduction, whilst Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid ""preferred no change to the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting,"" according to the Fed's statement.Experts had widely anticipated that the Federal Reserve's rate committee will largely support a 0.25 percentage point reduction.The Federal Reserve elevated interest rates to approximately 5.3% between 2023 and 2024 to address the most significant inflation surge experienced in 40 years. A reduction in rates could eventually lead to decreased costs for various forms of borrowing, including home mortgages, vehicle financing, credit card debt and commercial loans.The timing is particularly challenging for the Federal Reserve, as employment growth remains slow whilst inflation continues to exceed their 2% objective. The situation is further complicated by the absence of crucial government economic indicators typically used for decision-making, including monthly employment statistics, inflation data and consumer expenditure reports, which are currently suspended due to the government closure.The rate reduction will strengthen the US economy, which continues to adjust to President Donald Trump 's tariff policies, whilst providing officials additional time to assess the government shutdown's impact.The political impasse between Republicans and Democrats continues nearly a month into the shutdown, resulting in the temporary cessation of most official statistical releases.The Federal Reserve operates independently with two primary objectives: managing inflation and unemployment rates through adjustments to its primary lending rate, whether increasing, maintaining, or decreasing it.Reduced rates encourage economic and employment growth, typically resulting in lower mortgage costs. Conversely, increased rates restrict economic activity and control inflation.According to an AFP report, recent statements from Federal Reserve officials indicate growing worry about employment market deceleration, prompting them to prioritise job creation despite inflation exceeding their target rate.Additionally, there remains ongoing tension regarding Trump's efforts to influence Federal Reserve operations, alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's public initiative to identify Powell's successor when his chairmanship concludes in May.","US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on Wednesday cut the key benchmark rate by 25 basis points.

US government shutdown fallout: Data blackout poses threat to economic growth- explained by analysts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-government-shutdown-fallout-data-blackout-poses-threat-to-economic-growth-what-analysts-have-to-say/articleshow/124932506.cms,"US government shutdown (AI image)





The ongoing US government shutdown has created a significant data vacuum, impacting the release of vital federal economic statistics, from employment figures to national GDP measurements.The information gap is set to widen as authorities postpone releasing third-quarter GDP figures for the largest economy globally.The US administration has postponed various reports on employment, trade and retail sales, with limited staff recalled only to produce essential inflation data necessary for Social Security payment calculations.The political standoff between Congressional Republicans and Democrats continues, with neither side conceding responsibility for the shutdown, whilst food assistance for numerous Americans hangs in the balance.Experts indicate that this increasing data absence could negatively influence business decisions regarding employment and investments. ""There's a huge demand right now for government data,"" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. ""Every industry is trying to figure out if the Federal Reserve is going to keep cutting interest rates,"" he added.""This is the time of year where most organizations are finalizing their budgets for 2026,"" Long further told AFP. ""So, almost any company is sitting there thinking: Do we think 2026 is going to be an uptick? Or a slowdown, or a recession?""The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan organisation, estimates economic losses of up to $14 billion due to the shutdown.Oxford Economics' economist Matthew Martin suggests businesses will adopt a cautious approach, considering the uncertainty already created by President Trump's tariff policies. ""Businesses would therefore reduce their overall hiring to be on the safe side of things, until they see data that really points towards increased demand, or at least stabilization in the economy,"" he told AFP. Financial market participants require this data to make informed investment decisions across various asset classes.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs' recent analysis suggests that if the shutdown extends through mid-November, as predicted, most delayed data releases will likely be postponed until December. The report warns of potential distortions affecting both October and November data.Long emphasises the risk of permanent October data loss due to collection delays during the shutdown. Whilst retrospective data collection remains possible, extended delays could compromise accuracy and reliability. The situation risks producing either no data or ""tainted data"" as recall accuracy diminishes over time.Despite access to private sector information, analysts emphasise that government statistics remain irreplaceable as the most reliable economic indicators. ""We have a remarkable amount of uncertainty about just literally what's happening with labor supply, like how many people are in the United States and want jobs,"" said Brookings Institution senior fellow Wendy Edelberg. She noted significant uncertainty regarding emigration figures since early 2025.Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House acknowledges recent strong GDP growth whilst noting underlying economic pressures and uneven distribution of economic benefits. She emphasises the shutdown's negative economic impact: ""If you're not sure when your next paycheck is coming as a government worker, you're not going to be going out to eat for dinner."" ""You're maybe pushing off a trip, or just not buying little discretionary things. """,The ongoing US government shutdown has created a significant data vacuum.

The Asian Arowana: Ancient fish that rules the modern aquarium



The Asian Arowana: From banned species to billion-dollar status symbol



The super red Arowana : The fiery dragon fish worth more than gold



Also Read |





For centuries, dragons have embodied prosperity, power, and mystery in Asian culture. Today, that legend lives on in the Asian arowana, famously known as the dragon fish and hailed as the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. Native to the rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, this ancient predator moves with elegant precision, its metallic scales shimmering like coins of gold under filtered light. As highlighted by National Geographic, the arowana’s mythical resemblance to dragons has made it a potent symbol of luck and wealth across generations. Coveted by collectors, enthusiasts, and investors alike, it now commands staggering prices, often exceeding the value of gold, transforming a once humble river dweller into a living emblem of prosperity, success, and timeless prestige.The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish. Growing up to three feet in length, it glides through the dark waters of Southeast Asia with hypnotic grace, its large, shimmering scales catching light like polished coins. Two slender barbels extend from its chin, evoking the whiskers of a dragon, a resemblance that fuels its legendary reputation as a bearer of fortune, power, and eternal protection across Asian cultures.This prehistoric species, believed to have existed since the age of dinosaurs, thrives in slow-moving rivers and peat swamps in Borneo, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yet, it is far from a humble creature. In the modern world, an arowana can command prices as high as £250,000 per fish, a valuation that has elevated it from swamp inhabitant to luxury treasure.In the 1970s, the Asian arowana was added to the list of endangered species under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The trade ban was meant to protect its dwindling numbers in the wild. Instead, it ignited a new kind of frenzy.The ban transformed the arowana from a simple food fish into an elite, forbidden object of desire. Collectors across Asia began competing for the rare, mystical “dragon fish.” Suddenly, what once sold for a few dollars in a local market became a high-stakes commodity worth tens of thousands.By the late 20th century, farms in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia began breeding the fish legally under government licence. These operations were run like fortresses with guards, surveillance systems, and barbed wire to protect their valuable stock. Each fish was microchipped and issued an identification certificate to prove its legal, captive-bred origin. Despite such measures, black market smuggling and theft became part of the trade’s darker undercurrent.Among the many colour varieties, green, gold, and silver, the Super Red arowana reigns supreme. Found in the remote Kapuas River basin and the Lake Sentarum wetlands of Borneo, its scales shimmer in rich shades of ruby and crimson. In the right light, it appears almost aflame, like a dragon rising from the depths.This rare beauty can sell for astronomical prices. Reports claim that elite collectors, including high-ranking officials and business magnates, have spent more than £200,000 for a single fish. During international fish exhibitions, these rare specimens are transported in tanks escorted by security guards proof that even a creature of water can inspire terrestrial greed and glamour.Former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was said to have owned one himself, paying around £10,000 for his prized arowana. For many, ownership signifies not just wealth, but alignment with luck, prosperity, and spiritual balance.","The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish.

The line between love and law





NEW DELHI: The idea of living together once symbolised freedom — a quiet rebellion against rigid social codes. But today, “live-in” is no longer a whisper of modern romance.It has thrown up country’s some of the most chilling incidents of betrayal, violence and death.From Noida to Bengaluru, Delhi to Mumbai, headlines now read like scenes from a psychological thriller.Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel’s recent warning to women — “stay away from live-in relationships, or you might end up chopped into 50 pieces” — was not a metaphor.When 21-year-old Amrita Chauhan met Ramkesh Meena during a job interview in Noida, sparks flew instantly.Within months, they were living together in Delhi, recording their affection on camera — racy clips that would later become their undoing.But by September, Amrita’s ex-boyfriend Sumit Kashyap — a gas cylinder distributor — re-entered her life. Their social media romance reignited, while Ramkesh faded into the background. Soon, those private videos became a weapon.Ramkesh allegedly began blackmailing Amrita with the clips, demanding attention she no longer wanted to give.What followed was macabre. Police allege Amrita plotted his murder with Sumit’s help. On October 6, they allegedly tied and gagged Ramkesh before choking him to death. Then, in a calculated cover-up, Amrita — a forensics science graduate — advised Sumit to stage a fire.They poured ghee, oil, and wine on the body, opened a gas cylinder, and ignited it. Flames consumed the room; the crime, they thought, would disappear.But CCTV footage caught them leaving in masks. The fire, initially thought to be an AC blast, revealed a murder planned with chilling precision.In Bengaluru, Vanajakshi, 26, thought leaving her abusive partner would end her suffering. But her live-in partner Vithal, a cab driver, refused to let go.When he saw her in a car with relatives after a temple visit, he blocked her vehicle at a traffic signal, splashed petrol, and set her ablaze in broad daylight.She died in hospital. He was arrested within 24 hours — his own burns betraying him.In Delhi’s Nabi Karim, a crowded market turned into a battlefield of passion and rage. Shalini , 22 and pregnant, was attacked by her former live-in partner Aashu, who couldn’t accept that she had reconciled with her husband Aakash.As Aashu lunged with a knife, Aakash tried to shield her but was stabbed. In a desperate counterattack, he snatched the weapon and stabbed Aashu.By the time police arrived, both Aashu and Shalini were dead — lovers locked in a deadly triangle of jealousy and vengeance.In a quiet Anekal neighbourhood, neighbours broke down the door of a rented room to find Rakesh Kumar and Seema Nayak, both from Odisha, hanging from the ceiling fan.There were no notes — only silence and suspicion.Police say Rakesh, consumed by jealousy and alcohol, might have ended his life first.Seema followed soon after.Friends said they fought daily over accusations of infidelity. Love had turned into a slow death long before the rope tightened.The stench came first. Then the horror.When police broke into Manoj Sane’s flat in Mumbai’s Mira Road in June, they found pressure cookers filled with human flesh.Sane had allegedly murdered his live-in partner Saraswati Vaidya, chopped her body into pieces, and tried to boil the remains.For days, neighbours thought a rat had died. What they smelled was evil, simmering behind a locked door.In Haryana’s Manesar, police found a woman’s body wrapped in a blanket in a wheat field. It was Rita, a factory worker.Her live-in partner, Shiv Shankar Sharma, confessed to strangling her in a fit of jealousy.She had been missing for weeks. By the time her father identified her body, Kalicharan, as he was locally known, was already on the run. He was arrested two months later.In Mumbai’s Andheri, Sonali Bait, 37, and her lover Mahesh Pandey killed her 58-year-old father Shankar Kamble — all because he opposed their relationship.The father had begged her to end the affair and return to her husband and children. Instead, she and Mahesh allegedly punched him in the chest during a heated argument, killing him on the spot.\Love blinded her to blood — her own father’s.When Aaftab Poonawala murdered Shraddha Walkar, chopped her body into 35 pieces, stored them in a fridge and dumped them across Delhi, the country gasped.A year later, Delhi Police’s 6,629-page chargesheet confirmed every grisly detail — the fridge, the saw, the lies. Shraddha had once told Mumbai Police Aaftab had threatened to “cut her into pieces.” Few believed her then. Everyone remembers it now.Speaking to Vivek Dubey from TOI, Psychologists said it is a perfect storm — a toxic brew of emotional detachment, patriarchy, mental illness and alcohol.Dr. Dipali Batra, senior psychologist at Max Hospital, says, “These are not crimes of passion — they are crimes of possession. The perpetrator sees their partner as property. When the illusion of control breaks, violence replaces love.”Dr. Nisha Khanna adds: “It’s a power-control wheel. For many men, the partner’s autonomy feels like rebellion. The response? Punishment.”Infidelity, jealousy, humiliation — all become weapons in fragile minds that never learned to cope.Also read: Why Indian couples are killing each other Governor Anandiben Patel’s blunt warning — “Girls, stay away from live-in relationships, or you’ll be cut into 50 pieces” reignited a national debate that cuts across generations and ideologies.Her words, spoken at a women’s empowerment event in Lucknow, drew both applause and outrage.Union minister Nitin Gadkari in December said that live-in relationships were “not part of Indian culture” and warning that such arrangements “often end in tragedy.”In May 2025, observing the increasing prevalence of live-in relationships in recent years, the Supreme Court stated that if two able-minded adults reside together as live-in partners for more than a couple of years, a presumption would arise that they voluntarily chose that kind of relationship, fully aware of its consequences.Therefore, the allegation that such a relationship was entered into based on a promise of marriage may be deemed unworthy of acceptance.While quashing criminal proceedings against a man who was accused of rape charges by his live-in partner, a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Manoj Misra said the physical relationship continued for over two years without a complaint in between and a presumption would arise of there being valid consent for initiating and maintaining the physical relationship.""A decade or two earlier, live-in relationships might not have been common. But now more and more women are financially independent and have the capacity to take conscious decisions of charting their life on their own terms. This financial freedom, inter alia, has led to proliferation of such live-in relationships. Therefore, when a matter of this nature comes to a court, it must not adopt a pedantic approach; rather, the court may, based on the length of such relationship and conduct of the parties, presume implied consent of the parties to be in such a relationship regardless of their desire or a wish to convert it into a marital bond,"" the court said.In a similar verdict, the Supreme Court in March had held that a woman who was in a live-in relationship for a long period may not be able to accuse her live-in partner of compelling her to get into a physical relation on the false promise of marriage in order to face rape charges, as it could not be said with certainty that the physical relationship was purely because of the promise.The court had said in such cases, even if it was assumed that a false promise of marriage was made to the complainant initially by the accused, the fact that the relationship continued for such a long period would render the plea of the complainant — that her consent for all these years was under a misconception of the fact that the accused would marry her — implausible.Each case, each verdict, each public remark adds a new layer to a nation still learning to reconcile freedom with fear, autonomy with accountability.What began as a symbol of liberation now stands at crossroads: between those who see it as moral decline and those who see it as the right to live and love freely.","The idea of living together once symbolised freedom. But today, ‘live-in’ is no longer a whisper of modern romance. It has thrown up country’s some of the most chilling incidents of betrayal, violence and death.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124929509,imgsize-39488,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/-.jpg"

Delhi Tries to Make It Rain With Cloud Seeding: A High-Stakes Weather Experiment to Fight Toxic Air

Back-To-Back Attempts At Cloud Seeding; Sirsa Calls It A Huge Step To Mitigate Pollution

3 Trials, Rs 1.9cr, 0.3mm: Wait for rain continues





NEW DELHI: The Delhi govt attempted two trials of cloud seeding on Tuesday, but neither led to any rainfall in the city. However, IIT Kanpur, which executed the project, claimed that neighbouring areas received negligible rainfall - Noida (0.1 mm) and Greater Noida (0.2 mm) at 4pm attributing the data to a private app, Windy.Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said, ""According to expert forecasts, rain after seeding could occur anytime in next 24 hours, depending on cloud moisture. Initial radar readings and ground observations recorded light rainfall at Delhi-Noida Border around 4pm, indicating some positive response from the seeded clouds.""In the first trial, the Cessna aircraft of IIT Kanpur took off at 12.13pm from Kanpur and landed at Meerut at 2.30pm. The seeding points included Khekra, Burari, north Karol Bagh, Mayur Vihar, Sadakpur and Bhojpur. The second sortie started from Meerut carrying 4kg of seeding material and landed back at the same place. The main waypoints were the same as the first sortie.The second trial started at 3.45 pm, with the first seeding at Khekra at 4.08 pm, followed by Burari, Mayur Vihar, Pavi Sadakpur, Noida, Bhojpur, Modinagar and Meerut, before landing back at 4.45 pm, an IIT Kanpur statement said.Each flare weighed about 0.5 kg, with eight flares released per sortie, dispersing a tested mixture designed to enhance precipitation potential. Reported humidity levels in seeded clouds ranged from 15-20% - lower than ideal, but sufficient for a scientifically meaningful test. The operation lasted about one and a half hours for each sortie, ensuring consistent coverage,"" said Sirsa.Following the trials, IIT Kanpur too said the moisture content remained low at 10-15%, which is not an ideal condition for seeding. ""The PM2.5 was 221, 230, and 229 reported from Mayur Vihar, Karol Bagh, and Burari, respectively, before cloud seeding, which got reduced to 207, 206, and 203 micrograms per cubic metre respectively, after the first seeding. Similarly, PM10 was 207, 206, 209 micrograms per cubic metre, which got reduced to 177, 163, 177 micrograms per cubic metre at Mayur Vihar, Karol Bagh, and Burari, respectively. Given that winds were negligible, one possible explanation is that the denser moisture content created due to seeding particles has helped in settling down a portion of these particles, which translated to these reductions,"" said a report by IIT Kanpur.With this, three cloud-seeding trials have been conducted, with the first having taken place on Oct 23, which again did not lead to any rain. According to the MoU between the Delhi environment department and IIT Kanpur, the budget for cloud seeding is nearly Rs 3.21 crore for five trials. ""However, IIT Kanpur said it will conduct up to nine trials from this budget. It said it is a research institute and not a profit-making institute and hence it will conduct maximum trials to help people breathe good air,"" said Sirsa.The minister said this is among India's biggest scientific steps for urban air quality control, proving Delhi's resolve to confront legacy pollution challenges head on. ""The govt's proactive approach, thanks to the support from chief minister Rekha Gupta and guidance from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will ensure effective and transparent climate action for the citizens,"" said Sirsa.IIT Kanpur director Manindra Agrawal told TOI, ""As per my knowledge, it did not rain in Delhi. The moisture content was low. However, our team has conducted different data for better understanding. Two additional attempts for cloud seeding will be conducted on Wednesday.""Experts doubted whether the cloud seeding process can lead to a reduction in air quality in absence of rain. Mukesh Khare, professor emeritus at IIT Delhi's Civil Engineering Department said natural rain can reduce PM2.5 concentration depending on the raindrop size, their density and fall velocity. ""During the rainy season, rain washes out the pollutants and suppresses them to the ground. However, clouds are generally devoid of humidity during winters in Delhi. A mixture of silver iodide and other contents was released to make some reaction so that enough water vapour can be generated into the clouds, making them unable to hold those drops. Since only negligible rain occurred, it means cloud seeding was not able to generate enough water vapour.""He added that a mere increase in humidity within the clouds may not suppress the particles. ""Humidity only can make the particles heavier. However, PM2.5 particles are very small. Unless there is a force, humidity cannot settle down PM2.5 particles. Hence, reduction in PM2.5 may have occurred due to other reasons.""","The Delhi govt attempted two trials of cloud seeding on Tuesday, but neither led to any rainfall in the city. IIT Kanpur, which executed the project, claimed that neighbouring areas received negligible rainfall - Noida (0.1 mm) and Greater Noida at 4pm attributing the data to a private app.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124886827,imgsize-398005,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/wait-for-rain-continues.jpg"
Yes Bank-ADAG loan fraud: Anil Ambani’s son under CBI lens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/yes-bank-adag-loan-fraud-anil-ambanis-son-under-cbi-lens/articleshow/124917271.cms,"



Mumbai: While industrialist Anil Ambani has been chargesheeted by CBI in the Yes Bank loan fraud case, his son, Jai Anmol Ambani, has come under the lens.According to its chargesheet filed recently, CBI said as part of its future investigations, it was probing the role of Jai, then executive director of Reliance Capital Ltd (RCL) when Reliance Nippon Mutual Fund, part of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani (ADA) Group, subscribed to non-convertible debentures (NCDs) worth Rs 1,160 crore of Morgan Credits Pvt Ltd at low interest rate and invested Rs 2,250 crore in Yes Bank's AT-1 bonds under Anil's influence as part of a quid pro quo arrangement. Radha Kapoor and Roshini Kapoor, the daughters of Yes Bank's former MD and CEO, are the promoters/directors of Morgan Credits.CBI also said Anil and Jai interfered in the decision-making process at Reliance Nippon Mutual Fund without informing its Japanese partner, prompting objections and allegations.It said Jai held monthly review meetings with the mutual fund firm's officers, expressed displeasure over their performance and directed that he be informed of any mutual fund investment of Rs 50 crore or more him prior to execution. This interference led to internal objections, but the directives were eventually withdrawn, said the chargesheet.It alleged that Anil entered into a criminal conspiracy with Kapoor to get the bank to subscribe to his group companies' NCDs and commercial papers (CPs) worth Rs 3,400 crore ""when there was no demand for them in the secondary market"". It alleged that Kapoor pushed for the NCDs' acquisition, knowing that holding them for an extended period would harm the bank.The chargesheet said in return, Kapoor's wife, Bindu, received credit facilities of Rs 570 crore from Anil's companies at a lower interest rate. ""...Yes Bank Limited suffered a total loss of Rs 2796.77 crore due to subscribing NCDs & CPs of RHFL (Reliance Home Finance Ltd) and RCFL (Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd),"" the chargesheet said.CBI has named 13 accused in the chargesheet, including Bindu, Kapoor, Radha and Roshini. None of them has been arrested. The agency said it is also probing the role of another daughter of the Kapoors, Rakhee.As per the chargesheet, ahead of the NSE listing in 2017 of Reliance Nippon Asset Management—an asset management company (AMC) jointly owned at the time by Reliance Capital and Japan's Nippon Life Insurance, Sundeep Sikka, then CEO of the AMC, informed Takeshi Furuichi, then vice-president of Nippon Life Insurance, about interference by Anil and Jai in the fund's investment decisions. Following a business meeting at the office of the ADA Group, Furuichi held a private meeting with Anil. ""In this meeting, he made allegation against Anil Ambani and Jai Anmol Ambani for interfering in the investment decision of the AMC,"" said the chargesheet. Afterwards, Anil allegedly expressed his displeasure to Yoshinobu Tsutsui, then president of Nippon Life Insurance.The chargesheet said Kapoor and Anil held frequent meetings, but no bank officer attended these. After these discussions, Kapoor instructed his bank officers to process proposals for Anil's companies, it said. Similarly, Anil allegedly directed key managerial persons in his financial companies to relax terms for loan proposals associated with Kapoor's family.CBI said in Dec 2016, RHFL issued NCDs worth Rs 3,500 crore and Yes Bank processed a proposal to subscribe to unsecured debentures of Rs 250 crore. Kapoor failed to disclose that his wife's company had already got an inter-corporate deposit from RCL, for which he was a personal guarantor. The chargesheet also cited a report from The Economic Times highlighting that Reliance Communications Ltd missed loan repayments to local banks, affecting its credit rating and creating an urgent need to arrange long-term debt from other sources.According to CBI, during this period, Reliance Nippon Mutual Fund held sufficient public money for investment in long-term debt instruments. However, Sebi regulations barred investments in securities issued by sister concerns or group companies through private placement. To circumvent this, Anil allegedly conspired with Kapoor to misappropriate public funds held by the mutual fund, using them to arrange long-term debt for his financial companies without the knowledge of the Japanese co-sponsor.CBI alleged that Yes Bank invested Rs 640 crore in the commercial papers of RCFL to support ongoing operations and refinance existing debt. A significant portion of these funds was diverted through a series of transactions involving shell companies and ultimately used by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd to disburse dividends to shareholders, it said. The CBI probe uncovered a complex network of shell companies used to route funds and discharge financial liabilities, all allegedly orchestrated under Anil's instructions.","CBI has named 13 accused in the chargesheet, including Bindu, Kapoor, Radha and Roshini. None of them has been arrested. The agency said it is also probing the role of another daughter of the Kapoors, Rakhee.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124917270,imgsize-96914,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/yes-bank-adag-loan-fraud-anil-ambanis-son-under-cbi-lens.jpg"

FULL: Trump ‘Buries The Hatchet’ With Xi; Hints At ‘Great Meeting’ At Seoul Summit Amid Tariff War





US President Donald Trump’s week-long three-nation trip to Asia is generating comedic gold dust for late-night commentators and social media trolls in America even as his MAGA minions maintain that he is crushing it with his diplomatic masterstrokes.US trade agreements with Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea took a backseat to visuals of Trump bumbling around “like a grandpa lost in a mall” during a reception in Japan, an event that critics and comedians feasted on. The US President’s habitual word salads, including rambling digressions on his beef against magnets, his preference for steam engines over electric, and his incessant boasts on “solving” numerous wars, was cannon-fodder for comics while the White House put its best spin on the visit considered crucial to maintain US primacy.Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea reiterated commitments of more than $ 1 trillion in investments in the US, but what caught the eye of the American commentariat for the most part was the abject flattery from leaders of the three East Asian countries as they bowed and scraped before Trump to obtain low tariffs and maintain access to the US market that he has threatened to shut off unless they pony up tributes to the US by way of investments and buying American goods.South Korea presented Trump with a gold medal representing the Grand Order of Mugunghwa, the country's highest honor, and an exhibition of six ancient Silla Dynasty gold crowns—artifacts signifying the ""king’s heavenly mandate""—specially assembled for the event, a gesture critics noted could be seen as overly deferential amid US domestic ""No Kings"" protests. A band played Trump’s campaign anthem, ""YMCA,"" upon his arrival and a special lunch menu featured US-raised beef and a gold-adorned brownie, in deference to the US President’s obsession with the gold motifs and gilded accents.Earlier, Japan’s new prime minister also had a thick overlay of gold on the visit, presenting Trump with a gold-leaf golf ball, part of a golf-themed gift package that included a putter once owned by the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (Trump's former golfing buddy) and a golf bag signed by Japanese Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama. Reporters were directed past a gold-hued Ford F-150 pickup truck outside their meeting venue, a visible acknowledgment of Trump's desire for Japan to buy more US vehicles.In the case of South Korea, home to corporate business giants like Samsung, Hyundai and LG, Trump is said to have demanded an upfront payment of $ 350 million in cash for US in lieu of the investments it had pledged over a longer time period, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Seoul fended off the demand, agreeing to $200 billion in cash installments and $150 billion in shipbuilding cooperation, it said, citing Kim Yong-beom, South Korea’s presidential chief of staff for policy.In the case of Japan, the country’s new prime minister reaffirmed and advanced a prior $550 billion investment commitment made by her predecessor, signing a Framework Agreement that will direct $ 400 billion into promoting US leadership in advanced technology such as AI and quantum computing, besides $ 100 billion for nuclear power projects, increased US LNG purchases, and pipeline infrastructure.Comedians took a dim view of the booty as they mocked visuals of Trump dancing at a welcome ceremony in Malaysia and before US troops in Japan. ""Japan's throwing $550 billion at US factories, Malaysia's dropping $70 billion—Trump's turning Asia into his personal GoFundMe for 'Make America Build Again.' Who needs taxes when you've got tariffs and tango?"" sneered Jimmy Kimmel.The US President talked up his triumph though, leaving little doubt that he was setting the stage for a larger agenda on Thursday. ""Bringing back Trillions of Dollars to USA! A great trip. Dealing with very smart, talented, and wonderful Leaders. Tomorrow, President Xi of China. It will be a great meeting for both!!!"" he posted on X.","Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea reiterated commitments of more than $ 1 trillion in investments in the US.

After months of campaigning against the H-1B visa program through social media polls, posts and commentary, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis asked the Florida Board of Governors to pull the plug on the use of the H-1B visas in the state colleges and universities. At a press conference, he said the positions can be filled with Americans and if they can't be filled, then the problem lies somewhere else.The Republican leader asked why a Florida university would need to bring someone from China to talk about public policy. ""We can do it with Florida residents or Americans! If we can't? Then man, we need to really look deeply at what's going on with this situation!"" he said, dropping the bombshell announcement that would impact several state colleges and universities.According to USCIS data, as of June 30, 2025, there were more than 1900 Florida employers sponsoring over 7,200 H-1B visa holders. In the education sector, there are 78 employers and 677 beneficiaries.Though H-1B visa program is primarily used by tech companies, higher education sector in the US also employs H-1Bs in medical programs.DeSantis said assistant professors, coaches, data analysts, coordinators, marketers, and more university workers on H1-B visas from areas like the United Kingdom, China, Spain, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, Russia, Poland, Albania, Argentina, and the West Bank -- as he questioned how these positions are high-skilled that got them H-1Bs and could not be filled with Americans.Ron DeSantis drew criticism for his diktat on social media as someone pointed out that if he bans H-1B in the education sector, colleges and universities will have to choose from the pool of national elites instead of the pool of global elites.DeSantis shot down the apprehension and said the H-1B positions that he found out in audit were not even elite -- they were for assistant athletic coaches and media relations specialists, for example.","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis asked the Florida Board of Governors to pull the plug on the use of the H-1B visas in the state colleges and universities.

CEO’s AI investment drives workforce reduction strategy

Severance package and support for affected employees





Amazon is preparing to eliminate 800 to 1,000 positions in India as part of a sweeping global restructuring driven by artificial intelligence adoption, The Economic Times reported on Wednesday, marking one of the largest workforce reductions at the e-commerce giant’s Indian operations.The layoffs will span critical functions including finance, human resources, and technology, with employees reporting to Amazon’s global teams facing the steepest cuts, ET reported citing sources. The India job cuts are part of a broader plan to reduce approximately 14,000 corporate roles worldwide, announced by Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and TechnologyWhen contacted about the India-specific layoffs by ET, an Amazon India spokesperson referred to Galetti’s global announcement. In a blog post to employees, Galetti said the cuts aim to reduce bureaucracy, remove organizational layers, and redirect resources toward the company’s “biggest bets.”The restructuring follows CEO Andy Jassy’s June 2025 warning that AI would shrink Amazon’s workforce in coming years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote to employees, describing agentic AI as transformative technology that “should change the way our work is done.”Amazon has ramped up AI investments significantly, pouring more than $100 billion into the technology this year compared to $83 billion in 2024. While the company plans continued hiring in AI-related functions, it expects overall workforce reductions as automation handles more tasks previously done by humans.The company employs approximately 1.55 million people globally as of June 30, including roughly 350,000 in corporate roles. This marks Amazon’s second major round of layoffs in recent years, following the elimination of 27,000 positions between late 2022 and early 2023.Most affected employees will receive 90 days to seek internal positions, with recruiting teams prioritizing internal candidates. Those unable to secure new roles within Amazon will receive severance packages, outplacement services, and continued health insurance benefits.Despite strong business performance, Galetti emphasized that rapid technological change necessitates leaner organizational structures to maintain competitive speed and innovation in an AI-transformed landscape.","Amazon is preparing to eliminate 800 to 1,000 positions in India as part of a sweeping global restructuring driven by artificial intelligence adoption.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said that Bill Gates warned him against investing in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. During an interview with ‘TPBN’ – a tech-focused YouTube show, Nadella recalled that getting investment for the company wasn’t straightforward. Even at Microsoft, you kind of got to have to get a board approval to just go throw a billion dollars out there,” Nadella said, adding “Remember this was a nonprofit, and I think Bill even said, 'Yeah, you're going to burn this billion dollars’”.“But I must say it was not that hard to convince anyone that this is an important area and it's going to be risky,” he continued. To recall, Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019. Since then it has funded the AI company with over $13 billion.“In retrospect, who would have thought? I didn't put in a billion dollars saying, ‘Oh yeah, this is going to be a hundred bagger,’” he said during the interview. “We kind of had a little bit of high risk tolerance, and we said we want to go and give this a shot,” he reiterated.In a related news, OpenAI has struck a major deal with tech giant Microsoft to restructure itself into a public benefit corporation (PBC), a move that solidifies CEO Sam Altman's authority within the burgeoning AI industry and grants the $500 billion startup significant new latitude to grow.The agreement, announced Tuesday, October 29, untangles key limitations on capital-raising that have constrained OpenAI since its 2019 partnership with Microsoft. That initial deal granted Microsoft broad rights over OpenAI's work in exchange for the massive, costly cloud computing resources needed for its research. However, the unexpected, rapid explosion of the AI assistant ChatGPT three years ago strained those original terms, creating significant tension between the companies.""OpenAI has completed its recapitalization, simplifying its corporate structure,"" said Bret Taylor, board chair of the OpenAI Foundation, in a blog post.

Bill Gates calls for shift in climate aid





Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates recently said that if given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, he will choose the latter option. In a memo released today, October 28, Gates said that the world’s primary goal should instead be to prevent suffering, specifically in the world’s poorest countries. “I’ll let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria. People don’t understand the suffering that exists today,” he told reporters.Gates emphasized that climate change is a serious problem. However, it alone won’t be the end of civilization adding that scientific innovation may likely curb it. Gates stated that it’s instead time for a “strategic pivot” in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.The memo comes a month before the United Nations climate change conference in Brazil. During a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release of the 17-page memo, Gates said “If you think climate is not important, you won’t agree with the memo.If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo. It’s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who’s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries. ”Bill Gates believes the world’s progress in clean energy has outpaced expectations, thanks to faster innovation and the rise of artificial intelligence. He said affordable solar and wind energy are now replacing coal, oil, and gas plants, helping prevent worst-case climate scenarios.However, Gates warned that funding to help poorer nations cope with climate change is shrinking, as wealthy countries — led by the United States — reduce their foreign aid budgets. “Gavi, a public-private partnership started by my foundation that buys vaccines, will have 25% less money for the next five years compared to the past five years,” Gates said. “Gavi can save a life for a little more than $1,000.”He stressed that vaccines are even more vital in a warming world because “children who aren’t dying of measles or whooping cough will be more likely to survive when a heat wave hits or a drought threatens the local food supply.”Gates pointed to research by the University of Chicago Climate Impact Lab showing that projected deaths from climate change fall by more than 50% when accounting for future economic growth. “Health and prosperity are the best defense against climate change,” he said.Under these conditions, Gates argued that development aid should be spent where it can have the biggest impact. “If you have something that gets rid of 10,000 tons of emissions, that you’re spending several million dollars on,” he said, “that just doesn’t make the cut.”","Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates recently said that if given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, he will choose the latter option.

Read Tesla Board chairman's 'SOS letter' to shareholders on Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-tesla-board-chairmans-sos-letter-to-shareholders-on-elon-musk/articleshow/124895403.cms,"Dear Fellow Shareholders,

As you know, Tesla is at a critical inflection point, and we need your vote to help determine the future direction of our evolving company. Your vote matters, and the deadline for voting is 11:59pm ET on November 5th. The fundamental question for shareholders at this year's Annual Meeting is simple:

Do you want to retain Elon as Tesla's CEO and motivate him to drive Tesla to become the leading provider of autonomous solutions and the most valuable company in the world?

Kathleen and I engaged in a rigorous, seven-month Special Committee process resulting in a highly customized performance plan that aligns shareholder value and measurable business outcomes with the interests of our CEO.

Our goal was two-fold: (1) retain and incentivize Elon to capitalize on the unique opportunities that lie ahead for Tesla and (2) do so in a manner that promotes the development of products and services that will propel our world toward a cleaner, safer, and more prosperous future while creating unparalleled value for our shareholders.

We've done this by challenging Elon with the potential to secure what he values most—meaningful voting influence—conditioned on his commitment to continue leading Tesla for at least another 7.5 years while successfully driving our company to ambitious new heights.

The bottom line is simple: Elon is rewarded only if and when he delivers extraordinary performance that benefits all Tesla shareholders.

When negotiating this performance award, we necessarily considered what Tesla's future without Elon would look like, and we did not believe it was the future that our shareholders deserve. At a time when companies—both big and small—are competing to be the first to bring groundbreaking AI technologies to market, we could not risk losing the best leader in the industry to put Tesla on top.

Now is a pivotal moment for our company to emerge as a leader in AI, and with our exceptional CEO at the helm, we are perfectly positioned to seize it.

Though it's no question that Elon has other pursuits, he has proven that one of the many things that make him unique is his ability to stretch his capacity beyond normal limits and remain successful at Tesla. However, if we fail to foster an environment that motivates Elon to achieve great things through an equitable pay-for-performance plan, we run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision, which have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns.

Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor, with products such as FSD and Optimus, and working to better humanity in the process. While there may be nothing wrong with being just another car company, our Board believes that Tesla can be more, that our shareholders deserve more, and that Elon is the right leader to help us achieve our full potential.

Elon's leadership is also built upon the critical support of our ""tailor made"" governance structure, including our carefully constructed Board. Good governance should be customized to the company, not applied with a ""cookie cutter"" approach, and it is exemplified by the results that Tesla has delivered, and this Board has overseen. We therefore ask you to vote ""for"" the three members of the Board—Ira, Kathleen and Joe—who are up for re-election to ensure that the Board, which has worked alongside Elon for years, complementing and enhancing his efforts to deliver extraordinary shareholder returns, remains in place.

That is why your vote is so consequential to the future of our company. A vote here is both an endorsement of Elon's vision and a vote for Tesla's carefully tailored strategy and governance. I urge you to support Proposal One, which ensures the continued leadership and support of our outstanding and experienced directors, as well as Proposals Three and Four, which aim to keep Elon focused on our mission here at Tesla.

I feel strongly—as do the rest of my colleagues on our Board—that Elon singularly possesses the leadership characteristics and technical manufacturing know-how to keep us on the path towards maximizing long-term shareholder value as well as social good.

We at Tesla are laser focused on exceptional performance—not promises—and we structure our awards in line with this principle.

If you care about building a better world for humanity and supporting our vision for Sustainable Abundance—then you should vote ""FOR"" Proposals One, Three and Four.

If you want Tesla to have a shot at becoming the world's most valuable company—then you should vote ""FOR"" Proposals One, Three and Four.

Please read the Special Committee Report, which is attached to this year's proxy statement, for a more detailed explanation of Kathleen's and my work in coming to the essential conclusions embodied in the proxy statement and how we structured this performance plan to align Elon's incentives with delivering extraordinary performance for all of you.

Thank you for your continued support of Tesla.

Very truly yours,

Robyn Denholm Chairperson of the Board





Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm has issued an urgent appeal to shareholders ahead of the November 6 annual meeting, warning the company could lose significant value if they reject CEO Elon Musk 's proposed $1 trillion compensation package. In a letter sent earlier this week, Denholm cautioned that without the pay plan, Tesla risks losing Musk's ""time, talent and vision"" as he could step down from his executive position or become less engaged with the company. Denholm confirmed she's had direct conversations with Musk about his potential departure, stating there's a ""high probability"" he would back away if the package isn't approved.The unprecedented compensation package includes 12 tranches of stock options tied to ambitious milestones, culminating in Tesla achieving an $8.5 trillion market capitalization—more than quadruple its current $1.44 trillion valuation. Other targets include delivering 20 million vehicles, deploying 10 million FSD subscriptions, delivering one million robots, and operating one million robotaxis.Major proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended shareholders vote against the package, citing concerns about its excessive size and board independence. Musk dismissed the advisors as ""corporate terrorists"" during Tesla's recent earnings call.Shareholders must cast their votes by 11:59 p.m. ET on November 5, with the meeting scheduled for the following day.Read Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm’s letter to shareholders","Tesla CEO Elon Musk is up for re-election at the company's Annual Meeting on November 5th.

Nvidia CEO praises Donald Trump





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came to Washington with a message for the Donald Trump administration. Speaking at he first Nvidia developers' conference, Nvidia CEO cautioned the US government that America cannot win the AI battle if the world, if China fully excludes Nvidia from its vast developer ecosystem. Highlighting Beijing's effective shutdown of Nvidia's operations in the world's second-largest economy, Huang urged US policymakers to reconsider restrictions that could result in Nvidia cede half the planet's AI talent to domestic rivals.""They've made it very clear that they don't want Nvidia to be there right now,"" Huang said at a news conference during the GTC event, revealing that Nvidia has not even applied for U.S. export licenses for its latest chips to China due to the hostile stance from Beijing. ""I hope that will change in the future because I think China is a very important market."" He argued that a policy isolating America from China's developers ""hurts us more"" in the long term, potentially squandering Nvidia's role in powering global AI infrastructure.This is not the first time that Jensen Huang has spoken about the company's falling market share in China.Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022. He said that he has seen Nvidia's dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.Despite the Chinese blockade -- exacerbated by the US export controls that have changed under successive US administrations -- Nvidia reported $500 billion in bookings for advanced chips and announced seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The largest, built with Oracle and featuring 100,000 Blackwell chips, will support nuclear weapons maintenance, fusion energy research, and other national priorities.Huang credited Trump's ""America First"" policies with revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, noting Nvidia's chip production in Arizona via TSMC, server assembly in Texas, and networking gear in California. ""Putting the weight of the nation behind pro-energy growth completely changed the game,"" he said, thanking Trump directly.The DOE deals underscore Nvidia's pivot to fortified US ties amid China's rejection. Analyst Blake Anderson of Carson Group estimated one supercomputer, ""Solstice,"" could involve $3–4 billion in Nvidia chips alone, though federal discounts may apply from the standard $30,000–$40,000 per Blackwell unit. Huang balanced praise for President Trump who is touring Asia ahead of a Thursday meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Nvidia's chips may feature prominently -- with pleas for market access.Trump initially tightened export bans on China-specific AI chips in his second term but reversed in July. Huang has long contended that barring Nvidia from ~$50 billion in annual Chinese sales hampers U.S. R&D funding, even as Chinese developers reportedly still prefer Nvidia over mandated Huawei alternatives.Beyond government wins, Huang unveiled expansions to offset China losses: A $1 billion investment for 2.9% stake in Nokia, plus the ""Arc"" product line to boost 6G base station efficiency for millions of global sites.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang urged US policymakers to reconsider restrictions that could result in Nvidia cede half the planet's AI talent to domestic rivals.

New training rules at JLN: Only Mondo spikes allowed; warm-up track to open after Nov 15,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/athletics/new-training-rules-at-jln-only-mondo-spikes-allowed-warm-up-track-to-open-after-nov-15/articleshow/124932902.cms,"Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The Jawaharlal Nehru (JLN) stadium was buzzing on Wednesday with competition vibes as 300–400 school kids competed in various age-group track and field events at an athletics meet.Junior athletes participating in U14 to U18 categories in sprint, javelin throws, long and high jumps were soaking in the experience of competing on the newly-laid, blue-coloured ninelane Mondo track, wearing running shoes without spikes. But once the ongoing school meet ends, the gates of the city’s premier venue will again be shut for trainees, professional athletes and for those who pay Rs 100 annually to train as part of the govt-run ‘Come-andplay’ scheme. The stadium recently witnessed protest outside its main gate after some Delhi-based athletes and coaches resisted shutting of the venue on the pretext of renovation and upkeep of synthetic track following the World Para Athletics Championships, and due to two big-ticket international concerts planned in the month of Oct-Nov. American rapper Travis Scott performed on Oct 18 and 19 and singer Akon’s concert is planned for Nov 9.The stadium is owned by the Sports Authority of India (SAI), which operates under the sports ministry.In the present case, the authorities say the Mondo track is inaccessible until Nov 15 when the renovation work will be completed. Same people claim that the stadium has been out of bounds for practice since Oct 5. But in reality, the main arena and warm-up track have been inaccessible for athletes and those training under ‘come-and-play’ since May 15.The whole project of laying down both Mondo tracks cost the govt close to Rs 25 crore, and it was completed in a space of four months. The stadium refurbishment alone cost Rs 80 crore, some reports suggest.It’s been learnt that the authorities will soon issue a notification, directing athletes to purchase a new set of spikes with specific design if they want to train. Currently, athletes use ‘needle (or pin) spikes’, whose sharp points can puncture and tear the track’s rubber and underlying honeycomb structure. The recommended design henceforth will be ‘compression (Christmas tree) or pyramid spikes’. These spikes – typically 6mm or 1/4 inch) – have a wider base and tiered shape that pushes down on the track surface, causing negligible damage. However, there’s one problem: these spikes aren’t easily available in the sports market or on the ecommerce platforms in India. Such spikes are purchasable internationally with prices ranging from Rs 1,500-2,000.It’s also been learnt that only the warm-up track will be opened for training after Nov 15, and the Mondo arena will still be out of bounds. The SAI is considering bringing a policy for the use of Mondo track by the end of the current financial year – after which it will renew membership of ‘come-andplay’ scheme cardholders. The authorities will only allow state or national-level athletes to train on the main track.","The Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi was buzzing on Wednesday with 300–400 school kids competing in various age-group track and field events.

"ICE shaken, not stirred: Why Donald Trump's deportation math isn’t adding up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ice-shaken-not-stirred-why-donald-trumps-deportation-math-isnt-adding-up/articleshow/124932563.cms,"Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks during a press conference Friday, Oct. 24, 2025, in Minneapolis.

Inside the Shake-up





‘Deport Every Indian’: U.S. Politician Gets Censured Over Mass Deportation Call

Why It Matters





The Big Picture





Border Patrol’s new role:

Factional divide inside DHS:

The numbers problem:

Politics over process:

Bottomline:





Donald Trump’s second-term immigration crackdown looks like a reboot of his first — louder, harder, and wrapped in the language of “law and order.” The latest shake-up at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) puts Border Patrol in the driver’s seat, but what it really exposes is a system straining under its own ambition: too many arrests, too few deportations, and too much politics.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has begun moving Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials into ICE field offices that the White House believes are “underperforming.” The goal is simple: inflate arrest numbers and reinforce Trump’s narrative that his administration is delivering on mass deportations.But the machinery beneath the headlines is jammed. ICE detention centres are already full, immigration courts are backlogged, and the government doesn’t have enough planes to keep pace with arrests. An administration official described the chaos bluntly: “Border Patrol arrests them and dumps them on ICE — but most of these people aren’t ready to be removed.”The bottleneck means that even as arrests spike, actual deportations lag far behind the president’s rhetoric.Trump’s immigration policy is designed as a spectacle. Record arrests make for strong campaign visuals, especially when broadcast from sanctuary cities like Chicago or Los Angeles.But the numbers tell a more complicated story.Despite claims of 600,000 deportations and millions of voluntary departures, insiders and former ICE officials say the data is murky, inflated, and unsustainable. The system is producing headlines faster than it can process cases. Meanwhile, the focus on arrest quotas risks sidelining career officers who favour targeting high-risk individuals over blanket sweeps that clog the courts and detention network.The administration’s move effectively imports Border Patrol’s militarised, high-volume arrest culture into ICE. Greg Bovino — a commander known for aggressive raids in the Chicago area — has become the face of this shift, despite facing legal scrutiny over the use of tear gas and excessive force.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and adviser Corey Lewandowski are pushing for mass roundups to show political results, while Border Czar Tom Homan and acting ICE chief Todd Lyons argue for targeted enforcement of existing removal orders. The divide reflects two visions of Trumpism: one pragmatic, one performative.The administration’s megabill in July allocated billions to expand detention space and hire more ICE officers, but infrastructure and staffing shortfalls persist. ICE’s daily arrests still average around 1,000 — far below the White House’s target of 3,000. Deportations remain throttled by limited beds, long case queues, and logistical constraints on removal flights.The visual impact of Border Patrol raids — confrontations, detentions, and street-level arrests — serves Trump’s messaging goals but deepens operational dysfunction. It’s law enforcement as political theatre, designed more for cable news than for sustainable policy outcomes.Trump’s ICE overhaul looks less like reform and more like a public relations exercise built on bureaucratic overreach. Border Patrol’s growing influence has blurred lines between border enforcement and domestic policing, while ICE — burdened with the paperwork and logistics — struggles to keep up. The president’s team may win the optics war, but the system beneath it is running on fumes.","Donald Trump’s second-term immigration crackdown looks like a reboot of his first — louder, harder, and wrapped in the language of “law and order” The latest shake-up at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) puts Border Patrol in the driver's seat.

Building a sustainable legacy of giving









Driven by the UAE’s enduring spirit of unity and generosity, a new national vision is taking shape to empower community participation and social development. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum has launched an ambitious framework designed to transform volunteering and strengthen nonprofit organisations across the Emirates. The initiative, rooted in collaboration, compassion, and civic responsibility, unites citizens, residents, and institutions to embed giving as a defining feature of the nation’s identity.His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, launched the “Volunteering and Community Engagement Ecosystem” from Qasr Al Watan in Abu Dhabi. The initiative seeks to reinforce the impact of volunteering, support nonprofit organizations in all forms, and advance their contribution to sustainable development.Sheikh Mohammed explained that the ecosystem includes a comprehensive strategy to expand the country’s volunteer base to 600,000 people, supported by a unified digital platform and initiatives to strengthen the third sector and public benefit organizations. He emphasized that the project’s goal is to increase the number of nonprofit organizations by 30 percent, facilitated through a single services portal, community project incubators, and a fund worth AED 100 million.“Our aim is to make volunteering easier, strengthen community participation, and embed giving as part of our national identity,” Sheikh Mohammed said. “The UAE is a country of progress and prosperity, but also of generosity and compassion. It builds with one hand, and gives with the other.”He thanked Sheikh Theyab bin Mohamed bin Zayed, who leads the strategy as Deputy Chairman of the Presidential Court for Development and Fallen Heroes’ Affairs, along with the dedicated team implementing the plan. “The UAE moves forward with two forces, economy and cooperation, and giving and solidarity,” he added.The launch is supported by the Education, Human Resources, and Community Development Council, which coordinates national efforts to promote social capital and empower the nonprofit sector as a driver of inclusive, sustainable progress.The ecosystem aligns with the Year of Community and national directives to enhance social cohesion and expand volunteer participation. Over the next five years, the initiatives are set to deliver significant outcomes, including:These targets are designed to enhance collaboration, generosity, and collective participation while positioning the UAE as a global leader in organized community engagement.The Volunteering and Community Engagement Ecosystem consists of eight strategic initiatives developed by the Ministry of Community Empowerment, structured around two integrated tracks: promoting a culture of volunteerism and empowering nonprofit organizations.Four major programs are dedicated to embedding volunteering as a national value:Another four initiatives focus on enabling the nonprofit ecosystem:The Ministry of Community Empowerment will work closely with the Emirates Foundation, local government bodies, nonprofit entities, and private sector partners to ensure smooth implementation and long-term success.Beyond its institutional goals, the ecosystem aims to embed generosity, cooperation, and civic duty into the everyday lives of UAE residents. By aligning with the nation’s broader vision for sustainability and social well-being, the initiative builds a permanent structure for organized community engagement, ensuring that volunteering remains central to national progress.It also seeks to empower individuals, companies, and institutions to create lasting impact, nurturing a society that not only builds but also gives, a principle Sheikh Mohammed described as the UAE’s defining dual force.With its clear framework, digital integration, and measurable targets, the Volunteering and Community Engagement Ecosystem represents a strategic leap forward, transforming goodwill into organized, scalable, and sustainable action across the Emirates.","Sheikh Mohammed launches AED100 million UAE Volunteering Ecosystem to create 10,000 jobs and expand nonprofits.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
