Cruel to squash snouts of breeds like pugs: PETA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cruel-to-squash-snouts-of-breeds-like-pugs-peta/articleshow/111671209.cms,"MUMBAI: Ahead of World Plastic Surgery Day (15 July), PETA India said it was launching an appeal to remind everyone that while humans may have a choice when it comes to the shape of their nose, pet dog breeds like Pugs and other flat-faced dogs don't. PETA said they are intentionally and cruelly bred to have a snout so squashed it's difficult for them to even breathe, so compassionate people should never buy them.The awareness drive, PETA said, will be simultaneously held in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kolkata, among other cities.In Mumbai, a giant billboard will be displayed at Marine Lines.Pugs and other breathing-impaired breeds (BIB), including French and English bulldogs, Pekingese, Boston terriers, boxers, Cavalier King Charles spaniels, and shih tzus, suffer from an agonising and sometimes fatal condition called brachycephalic syndrome , which causes them to pant, snort, wheeze, and struggle just to breathe. It can make chasing a ball, running, playing, and even going for a walk difficult. The situation is so serious that a number of countries, including Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway, have banned or are currently working on amendments which either ban or restrict the breeding of some or all BIBs, PETA has said.","Pugs and other breathing-impaired breeds (BIB) suffer from an agonising and sometimes fatal condition called brachycephalic syndrome.

Lung cancer hits non-smoking Indians earlier than Westerners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lung-cancer-hits-non-smoking-indians-earlier-than-westerners/articleshow/111670935.cms,"MUMBAI: A lung cancer patient in India is likely to be 10 years younger than a patient in the West and possibly someone who avoids smoking , a lifestyle factor associated with it.This typical, though unique, profile of an Indian patient has emerged in a special review of lung cancer cases in Asia in The Lancet, one of the most widely read medical journals in the world.Studies have shown that lung cancer presents approximately a decade earlier in India as compared to Western countries, with a mean age at diagnosis of 54-70 years.Written by a team of doctors, mainly from Tata Memorial Centre in Mumbai, the article, titled 'Uniqueness of lung cancer in Southeast Asia', said lung cancer was the third most commonly diagnosed cancer (18.5 lakh new cases or 7.8%) in this region in 2020, but it is the commonest cause of cancer mortality, causing 16.6 lakh or 10.9% deaths. The corresponding global figures are 22 lakh new cases (11.6%), causing 17 lakh deaths (18%). In India, lung cancer accounts for an annual incidence of 72,510 cases (5.8%) and 66,279 deaths (7.8%).Highlighting the ""uniqueness"" of Indian patients, one of the authors, Dr Kumar Prabash from Tata Medical Centre's medical oncology department, on Tuesday told TOI that ""over 50% of our lung cancer patients are non-smokers "".The study said the important risk factors for lung cancer in non-smokers included air pollution (especially particulate matter PM2.5), occupational exposure to asbestos, chromium, cadmium, arsenic and coal as well as second-hand smoke at home. Factors like genetic susceptibility, hormonal status, and pre-existing lung disease could also play a role in the rising lung cancer incidence in never-smokers.Dr Prabash further said the proportion of cases here is lower than in the West. ""The incidence rate of lung cancer in the US is 30 per 1,000, but it's 6 per 1,000 in India. Given our huge population, however, even the 6% works out to a huge number of patients.""Another uniqueness about India's lung cancer problem, he said, is the high incidence of TB. ""Diagnosis often gets delayed because of TB as both conditions mimic each other."" In this regard, the authors said it's not easy to get access to newer treatment modalities and molecules. ""Most treatments are developed abroad, and importing them adds to the cost."" The biggest challenge is early identification and start of treatment. ""Barely 5% of lung cancer patients seek help in time for surgical help. We need to increase this number to at least 20% like in the West,"" Dr Prabash said.","A lung cancer patient in India is likely to be 10 years younger than a patient in the West.

There must be some material against the person before proceedings under the law can be initiated, it stressed.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Ahsanuddin Amanullah held that ""in the absence of the basic/primary material, it cannot be left to the untrammelled or arbitrary discretion of the authorities to initiate proceedings"", which have life-altering and very serious consequences for the person.It said, Section 9 could not be invoked on the basis of hearsay or bald and vague allegation(s).""...the question is that does Section 9 of the Act empower the executive to pick a person at random, knock at his/her/their door, tell him/her/they/them 'We suspect you of being a foreigner'?...

Ipso facto just an allegation/accusation cannot lead to shifting of the burden to the accused, unless he/she is confronted with the allegation as also the material backing such allegation,"" the court said.The court said that there was no material in possession of authority which could raise suspicion on his nationality. After fighting a legal battle for two decades, SC came to his rescue and declared him Indian as all his relatives were also declared Indian citizens. The court also said that minor spelling mistakes in names on official documents could not be the sole reason to deny authenticity as happened in the case.""However, mere allegation, that too, being as vague as to mechanically reproduce simply the words which mirror the text of provisions in the Act cannot be permitted under law.

liberty aspect

: SC on bail case

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday said courts should not stay bail order in a ""casual"" manner as it affects liberty of a person and took exception to the Delhi HC keeping a bail order stayed for over a year during which the accused remained in jail.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih expressed shock that the HC stayed the trial court order granting bail to an accused in a money laundering case and kept the case pending for a year which forced the accused to approach the SC.""What is happening? This is shocking. Please answer our question. Can bail be stayed as a matter of course? Unless he is a terrorist, where is the reason to stay? Can you defend? We will set it aside... how HC casually stayed the bail. Could HC have stayed without a reasoned order? Answer us, what signals are we sending? We are blaming us also,"" it told ED counsel Zoheb Hossain. The bench said such a practice could not be allowed as it was about liberty. ""The HC passed the order in a very casual manner. It stayed the bail order and the case was thereafter heard after one year. The court did not bother to look into the case during the period and he kept languishing in jail,"" it said. The bench reserved its order but Hossain urged the court to grant him at least 10 minutes on Friday to argue the case on behalf of ED as any order passed by the apex court would have ramifications in other cases too. He said the prosecution was not at fault for the delay.We are worried about the liberty aspect. A person has to languish for one year in jail after bail was granted, the bench said, allowing Hossain to place case laws before the bench on the issue.The court was hearing a plea filed by one Parvinder Khurana who was granted bail by the trial court in a PMLA case on June 17 last year but the HC stayed the order.

MUMBAI: Mihir Shah , accused in the Worli hit-and-run case , and two of his friends had consumed 12 large pegs of whiskey on the fateful day -or around four pegs each-based on the bill paid at the bar , excise officials alleged on Wednesday. This quantity can keep one intoxicated for eight hours, they added.Mihir and his friends left the bar at 1.30am on Sunday and the mishap occurred around 5am- within four hours of intoxication, excise sources said.The victim, Kaveri Nakhwa (45), was on a two-wheeler while Mihir (24) was in a BMW at the time of the accident .The state excise administration has already suspended the licence of the Juhu bar that served hard liquor to Mihir, who is not 25 yet. The excise department also found other alleged irregularities with the bar listed as Don Giovanni Restaurant, Jobel Hospitalities Pvt Ltd, including selling liquor to non-drinking permit holders in non-permitted areas, non-submission of licensed premises for inspection, mixing the permitted liquor serving area with the non-permitted restaurant zone, variations in the liquor stock permitted against non-permitted, and lack of liquor transport licence for a certain amount of liquor stock.On the cash memos and receipts, the bar has been named as Vice-Global Tapas Bar.It may be recalled that following the Porsche accident in Pune in May in which two died, around 60 bars across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region were closed for 5 to 10 days as a punishment for not following closure timings, for offering liquor to underage patrons, and for not issuing a day's drinking permit to patrons.","Mihir Shah, 24, and friends consumed 12 whiskey pegs at Vice-Global Tapas Bar.

The chargesheet deals with Rs 100 crore of the Rs 1,100 crore alleged to be involved overall.The chargesheet claims that that Kejriwal demanded Rs 100 crore kickbacks from the members of the South Group for the liquor sale contract, of which Rs 45 crore was spent on the Goa elections .ED insisted that Kejriwal claimed Vijay Nair, former AAP communications-in-charge and co-accused in the excise policy case, worked under minister Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj, not him. It also claimed that CM said Durgesh Pathak was the state prabhari (in-charge) for Goa and managed the funds and he himself had no role in fund-related decisions and hadn't received kickbacks from K Kavita, Bharat Rashtra Samithi functionary and accused.The agency has included screenshots of chats between Kejriwal and Vinod Chauhan to show the two had a close relationship. ED said the screenshot of hawala note numbers retrieved from Chauhan's phone matched those in the data seized by income tax officers. The agency said this proved Chauhan was involved in transferring Rs 25 crore through hawala for Goa elections.The chargesheet also claims that Chauhan's proximity to CM is apparent from the way he managed postings of the Delhi Jal Board officials.The chargesheet alleges that Kejriwal ""personally utilised"" a part of proceeds of crime because Chanpreet Singh, who managed the funds sent by Chauhan to Goa, booked a stay for him in a five-star hotel in Goa in Nov 2021. ED claimed that Singh had been unable to explain the reason for this payment. ""This is a complete and direct money trail of the proceeds of crime transferred from the South Group to the AAP elections,"" reads the chargesheet.Pointing out that Kejriwal ""wilfully disobeyed"" nine summons sent to him by ED for questioning in the case, the chargesheet claimed that in his evasive replies to queries, the CM said he was unaware about more than 10 meetings Nair had with the other co-accused in the liquor business including liquor manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and middlemen like Dinesh Arora and Abhishek Boinpally.Even when confronted with evidence about the hawala transfer of approximately Rs 45 crore corroborated by phone call detail record, records, data seized by income tax department from a Goa firm and WhatsApp messages showing arrangements for part of the payments being made in cash and partly as bills, Arvind Kejriwal claimed no knowledge of these, the chargesheet says.","The Enforcement Directorate has described chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as the ""kingpin and key conspirator"" in its seventh supplementary chargesheet in the case.

NEW DELHI: The chiefs of several central forces announced on Thursday that they have made all preparations to set aside 10% of posts for ex-Agniveers. The reservation for ex-Agniveers in the central security forces was announced by the Union home ministry last year.CISF director general Nina Singh and BSF director general Nitin Agrawal on Thursday detailed the recruitment plans for ex-Agniveers.According to Singh, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) will reserve 10% of jobs for ex-Agniveers in all future constable appointments.""The Union home ministry had taken the important decision regarding the recruitment of ex-Agniveers. Accordingly, the CISF is also preparing the process of the recruitment of ex-Agniveer,"" Singh said.She further explained the specifics, noting that physical tests will include exemptions for former Agniveers and there will be age relaxations.During the first year, the age relaxation will be five years, while in subsequent years, it will be three years.""Ex-Agniveer will be able to take advantage of this and the CISF will ensure that. This will be beneficial for the CISF too as the force will get trained and disciplined personnel,"" Singh told DD News.""They got four years of experience. They are fully disciplined and trained personnel. This is very good for the BSF as we are getting trained soldiers. After short training, they will be deployed along the border,"" said BSF director General Agrawal.Agrawal emphasized that all security forces would benefit from recruiting ex-Agniveers.""We are waiting for them to be deployed after giving conversion training, they will be deployed. 10 per cent of the total vacancies will be reserved for them,"" he said.He also confirmed that age relaxations would be provided, with the first batch receiving five years of relaxation and subsequent batches getting three years.""There will be age relaxation for them as well. The first batch will get five years of age relaxation and the subsequent batches will get three years of age relaxation,"" Agrawal told DD News.DG CRPF Anish Dayal Singh said: ""All arrangements have been made to recruit ex-Agniveers in CRPF. The recruitment rules have been accordingly amended. A reservation of 10% has been made for Ex-Agniveers. They will also get relaxation in age. The first batch will get five years of relaxation while it will be three years afterwards. There will also be no Physical Efficiency Test for them.

We have amended the recruitment rules accordingly. The first batch will be given an age relaxation of five years. And, there will be no Physical Efficiency Test for them.""The announcement comes days after Parliament saw furious arguments break out between the opposition and the Centre over the Agnipath recruitment scheme, which is aimed at inducting personnel into the Army, Navy, and Air Force for short-term periods.While the opposition has demanded that the scheme be scrapped, even the BJP's own allies such as the LJP and the JD(U) have demanded a review of the scheme.The Agnipath scheme, rolled out in June 2022, seeks to lower the age profile of the armed services.

Regarding the allegations, she added, “I am not authorized to speak on the issue.

As per rules, former ministers and MPs are required to move out of govt accommodations within a month after they lose ministerial berth or membership of either House of Parliament.Govt resorts to issuing eviction notices, if the allottees don't move out within the deadline. Sources said so far none has officially sought any extension to keep their official accommodation.",At least four senior ministers have pitched for allotment of a particular bungalow on Akbar Road. Sprawling bungalows and the ones with better interiors are in high demand. All cabinet ministers are eligible for the top category of Bungalows known as Type-VIII.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111669784,imgsize-1731150,width-400,resizemode-4/111669784.jpg"
Ex-IAF chief RKS Bhadauria explains compensation structure of Agniveers amid controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-iaf-chief-rks-bhadauria-explains-compensation-structure-of-agniveers-amid-controversy/articleshow/111651226.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Indian Air Force (IAF) chief RKS Bhadauria spoke about the settlement of ex-gratia to a deceased Agniveer soldier's family, explaining that the process takes time due to comprehensive guidelines that usually span two to three months. He detailed the steps involved in the ex-gratia compensation process and addressed concerns regarding the time required to finalize payments.""There is a process for ex-gratia and other amounts because if it is a battle casualty or physical casualty which is attributable, it is managed by the government and therefore it has to be established. That process of establishment follows certain guidelines. The post-mortem report should come, all the incident reports, the court of inquiry, and the report from the police--these are the major elements. This process needs to be completed. It is no different in the case of a normal soldier or an Agniveer. It is the same,"" Bhadauria said in an interview with ANI.Speaking about the time taken to settle all payments to the deceased soldier's next of kin, he said, ""Normally it takes two to three months because there is an inquiry involved.""Bhadauria denied allegations that families of Agniveers are kept in the dark about the compensation process, saying that defence personnel in the unit take care of the family and explain the process in detail.""Every unit takes great care. They are at pains to be in touch with the family. They are always in touch with the family and they explain at length,"" he said.Bhadauria reasoned that due to the trauma experienced by the family of the deceased, a sense of ""confusion"" might arise.""You must imagine a family that has gone through this trauma. There are a lot of people interacting and advising. So it is that which leads to a sense of confusion to get created,"" he said.Bhadauria also pointed out that, in the event of a soldier's death, a sizeable portion of the insurance amount is credited to the next of kin.""Whenever such an incident happens and somebody loses their life, in all cases--whether it is a battle casualty, physical casualty, attributable, or non-attributable--the insurance amount gets credited straightaway. In the case of a normal soldier, they have their policies. They normally credit 50 per cent straightaway within 24 or 48 hours, and then they meet the family and ask how they would like the rest, whether in their name or children's name,"" he said.Bhadauria stressed that there is no confusion about the next of kin for the soldier, as they are clearly defined in advance. He also said that the deceased soldier's family is provided with financial guidance.""The next of kin is clearly defined. There is no confusion. The money can only go to the account of the next of kin. There is a lot of financial guidance given to the family, which many of the soldiers' families would need. This is also provided by the insurance company through our officers and men,"" he said.Sharing an attribute of the insurance payable to all enrolled under the Agnipath scheme, the Retired Air Chief Marshall said that unlike regular soldiers the Agniveers do not need to contribute any portion of their salary towards insurance and the entire amount is paid by the Government of India.""In the case of Agniveer in particular, the insurance is paid by the Government of India. The Agniveers don't even contribute. In the case of a regular soldier, every month roughly Rs 5000 is cut. You are into a contributory insurance scheme, in all three Services. Roughly Rs 5000 is charged for sepoys, which is Rs 60000 per year and you get insured. The insurance figures are a little different in the three services but of the order of around Rs 50-60 lakhs for sepoys. That is contributory. In the case of Agniveers, they do not contribute. Government of India pays the insurance, should something happen,"" Bhadauria said.Amid the ongoing controversy overcompensation for Agniveer Ajay Kumar's family, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria (Retired) has clarified the situation. He explained that while a portion of the compensation has already been disbursed, the remainder will be settled once the necessary paperwork is completed. Bhadauria addressed the controversy surrounding financial aid, explaining the current status of payments and the steps needed for finalizing the ex-gratia compensation.""I think the recent controversy has been around financial aid or whatever payments have been made, whether they have been made or not. The Army has released a media brief stating that Rs 98.39 lakh have been paid. This is primarily the insurance from the Government of India, and there is a DSP account with the bank which ensures that the payment of Rs 50 lakh and Rs 48 lakh from the Government of India also goes through. That has already been cleared,"" the Retired Air Chief Marshal said in an exclusive conversation with ANI.Bhadauria said that unless the police report comes through and it is settled that the case is ""battle casualty"" attributable, the ex-gratia cannot be paid from the central welfare fund.""You have to wait for the paperwork to be over for all the final settlement of account that takes place. For that, one of the critical things is the police report. Based on that final thing...whether it is battle casualty attributable unless the attributability comes, the ex-gratia cannot be paid from the central welfare fund. That is a complete fund. The Ministry of Defence does it. It is also dependent on the reports that come from the police. In this case, the Jammu and Kashmir Police will send its report. I think those actions should have been completed. It was in the final stages as I knew last week,"" the Retired Air Chief Marshall said.Bhadauria said that Agniveer Ajay Kumar's family will receive an additional Rs 67 lakh, and the total emoluments for his next-of-kin will amount to Rs 1.65 crore.""Some more money will be transferred. That will be the ex-gratia from the Army central welfare fund and his balance of payment for the unserved portion and the Seva Nidhi package. So over Rs 67 odd lakhs further will go. So total emoluments that his next-of-kin will get is of the order of Rs 1.65 crores. So these are the hard facts,"" he said.Agniveer Ajay Kumar was killed in a landmine blast near the Line of Control in the Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir. The confusion over the financial compensation paid to the deceased Agniveer led to a political slugfest between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition parties.",Former IAF chief RKS Bhadauria spoke about the settlement of ex-gratia to a deceased Agniveer soldier's family. He explained that the process takes time due to comprehensive guidelines that usually span two to three months. He denied allegations that families are kept in the dark about the compensation process.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111651950,imgsize-748097,width-400,resizemode-4/111651950.jpg"

The Nov 8, 2016, notification had allowed deposition of demonetised currency notes in banks till Dec 30, 2016. Another notification issued on Dec 31, 2016, made it an offence to hold demonetised currency notes after Dec 30 and made the holder liable for penaltyKohli said apart from the bank being obliged to receive demonetised currency notes presented before it by the KYC-compliant company, it was also obligatory for RBI to ensure that the company received the amount in exchange of valid currency notes as each demonetised note contained a written promise by RBI governor to pay the bearer an amount specified on the currency note. The bench issued fresh notice to Axis Bank and asked it to respond within three weeks after RBI counsel said court would have to hear the bank and find out whether it had a valid reason not to accept the demonetised notes. A bench of Justices S Abdul Nazeer, Gavai, A S Bopanna, V Ramasubramanian and B V Nagarathna had by four to one majority on Jan 2, 2023, validated the Nov 8, 2016, demonetisation decision carried out through an ordinance. Justice Nagarathna had dissented.","A company complained that Axis Bank had refused to accept demonetised notes worth Rs 3.2 crore in breach of RBI guidelines.

Williams added, ""I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem.""The astronauts have been keeping themselves busy on the ISS, carrying out various tasks and experiments, such as changing the pump on a machine that recycles urine into drinking water and conducting gene sequencing in microgravity.Before Wilmore and Williams can return to Earth, engineering teams need to conduct more simulations on the ground to better understand the root causes of the technical issues Starliner experienced and modify the spacecraft's flight plan if necessary.The spacecraft had a known helium leak before launch, but additional leaks emerged during the flight. Additionally, some of Starliner's thrusters, which provide fine maneuvering, initially failed to engage during its approach to the station, delaying docking. Engineers are still investigating the reasons behind these issues.Despite the challenges, Nasa and Boeing maintain that Starliner could safely return to Earth in case of an emergency, particularly since the problems affected only certain orientation-controlling thrusters. They have no concerns about the more powerful thrusters responsible for the ""deorbit burn"" that will bring the spaceship back.However, much remains uncertain, including whether the malfunctioning thrusters have become degraded, which would necessitate relying on other thrusters during descent.","Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams are currently waiting to depart from the International Space Station.

Tips to stay protected from online trading scam

A woman from Mangaluru, has fallen victim to an online stock trading scam , losing Rs 74 lakh. The incident highlights the growing risk of investment scams lurking on social media platforms .The victim's ordeal began in March 2024 when she saw an enticing advertisement for share trading on Instagram. Intrigued by the promise of high returns, she clicked on the link, which led her to a webpage with information about stock trading.The victim then contacted the number provided on the webpage.This connected her with an unknown individual via WhatsApp, who presented themselves as a knowledgeable investment advisor . This individual likely built rapport with the victim, offering ""expert"" guidance and potentially creating a sense of urgency to invest.The advisor then directed the victim to a seemingly legitimate online trading platform . However, this platform was likely a cleverly designed fake, controlled by the scammers. The victim, trusting the advisor, made an initial investment of Rs 10,000.The scammers then manipulated the fake platform to show initial profits, further convincing the victim of the legitimacy of the operation. This tactic, known as ""pump and dump,"" is a common ploy used by online scammers to lure victims into investing larger sums.Over the next few months, the victim, enticed by the staged profits and the supposed expertise of the advisor, gradually transferred a total of Rs 73.6 lakh into various bank accounts controlled by the scammers.Only after discussions with friends and family did the victim realise she had been scammed. She then filed a complaint with the police, hoping to recover her lost funds.- Be wary of promises of high returns: If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Legitimate investment opportunities typically involve a degree of risk.- Do your research: Before investing in any platform or scheme, thoroughly research the company, its legitimacy, and any regulatory oversight.- Never invest based on pressure or urgency: Legitimate investment advisors won't pressure you to invest quickly.- Beware of fake platforms: Be cautious of websites or apps that seem unprofessional or lack proper security measures.- Never share financial information with strangers: Never disclose personal financial details, bank account numbers, or passwords to unknown individuals online.","A woman from Mangaluru, has fallen victim to an online stock trading scam.

A senior BMC official said that construction of bridges in the Bhandup-Nahur stretch may be among the reasons which led to slower drainage of water from waterlogged areas.A meeting under Ashwini Joshi, Additional Municipal Commissioner and ex-officio chairman of District Disaster Management Authority and Additional Municipal Commissioner Amit Saini was held on Thursday.The officials also directed to install more pumps or pumps of higher capacity at locations, which witnessed slow draining of water, and ensure that Railway services and traffic movement on roads remains smooth.While acknowledging that various measures were carried out to drain water at these locations, the senior officials said that in future it had to be done in a better manner and promptly.The officials also directed BMC administration to carry out checks and ensure that the 400 pumps that have been installed to drain water are in working condition, besides making arrangements for additional manpower, pumps for pumping water, as well as towing vans for transporting pumps. In view of the possibility that the generators may shut down during heavy rains, a direct grid connection should be taken from the power distribution companies for these pumps and diesel generators should be kept operational as an alternative. Joshi also asked BMC officials to conduct a joint inspection with railways of all the places where water logging was taking place.","BMC administration has asked officials to carry out better planning and ensure readiness in terms of men and equipment.

MUMBAI: A retired hotel management professional from Andheri (West) fell victim to a sophisticated online scam when he was enticed into investing Rs62,500 after encountering a deepfake video on YouTube featuring Mukesh Ambani endorsing a stock market forum and providing investment advice . Amboli police registered the case based on the complaint filed by PS Jerome (77) on July 9 after he discovered that he was deceived when he stumbled upon the clip on June 14, created using advanced artificial voice cloning technology, which showcases Ambani promoting the forum.This marks the third such incident that has emerged since March, where fraudsters have exploited the chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries' deepfake clip to lure unsuspecting individuals into investing in the stock market, resulting in financial losses for the victims.""The cyber team is tracking the internet protocol (IP) address and the origin of the clip from where it was uploaded to apprehend the perpetrators. We have requested details of the Moradabad bank account to which the fraudster coerced Jerome to transfer the funds,"" said a police officer from the Amboli police station.Jerome was swindled between June 15 and 18 when he made two fund transfers of Rs12500 and Rs50000 from the savings he had accumulated from the interest he received from his retirement fund.

I contacted a number that was displayed in the video. Subsequently, I began receiving incessant calls urging me to invest.""Jerome grew suspicious when the caller started aggressively pushing him to invest more. ""Jerome demanded a refund of his investment. The fraudster refused to refund the money and instead insisted that Jerome invest more to recover his initial investment.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.
