to be turned into

public museum

NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister's Office is likely to shift from South Block to the newly built Executive Enclave-I - a few hundred metres away - next month, sources said. Soon, the Cabinet Secretariat will also shift from Rashtrapati Bhavan to this new office complex, which is also likely to get a new name.Ministries of home affairs and personnel have almost been shifted to Kartavya Bhawan-3, which PM Narendra Modi inaugurated earlier this month. TOI has learnt that PMO may move in the second half of Sept.Officials said going by the trend of govt naming all Central Vista projects, such as Ka-rtavya Path (earlier Raj Path) and Kartavya Bhawan, signifying a change in its approach, Executive Enclave-I may also get a name, something linked to 'service' (sewa).In his address to PMO officials after taking oath for the third consecutive time as PM, Modi had said, ""PMO should become an institution of service and the people's PMO"" and that it should serve as a catalytic agent, generating new energy to provide light to the entire system.Shifting of offices from North Block and South Block to new buildings is crucial as the govt is keen to expedite the conversion of these two iconic buildings into a public museum called 'Yuge Yugeen Bharat Sangrahalaya'.The Prime Minister had recently said that this will allow every citizen to witness and experience India's rich civilisational journey.The British-era North Block and South Block buildings have been the power centre for nearly 80 years, housing offices of the Prime Minister, and ministries of defence, home, external affairs and finance.A govt source, who was earlier involved in the master planning of the Central Vista revamp project, told TOI that one of the main rationale behind shifting these top offices, which make national policies, from these two buildings was to remove traces of colonial mindset.",Prime Minister's Office likely to shift from South Block to Executive Enclave-I next month.

The Western Railway also reported delays. BEST buses were diverted from flooded stretches in Sion, Kings Circle, Aarey Colony and Malad Subway.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) confirmed that the incident occurred at 2.39am, when a landslide buried a hut belonging to the Mishra family. Four members were rushed to civic-run Rajawadi Hospital, where doctors declared 19-year-old Shalu Mishra and 50-year-old Suresh Mishra dead on arrival.The two survivors, Aarti Mishra, 45, and Ruturaj Mishra, 20, are being treated for injuries and are reported to be in stable condition.Emergency teams, including the fire brigade and local police, were immediately deployed to the site. Authorities said nearby residents were shifted to safer areas as a precaution.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for Mumbai, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Thane, Palghar and neighbouring districts. Officials warned of “intense to very intense convection” over the city and predicted moderate to heavy downpours in the coming hours.“Mumbai Radar shows intense to very intense convection over the city and adjoining area. It is likely to continue for the next 2–3 hours,” the IMD said in a post on X.Continuous rainfall on Saturday triggered waterlogging at several locations, including Gandhi Nagar, Kings Circle and Sion railway station, disrupting road traffic and slowing train services. Municipal Commissioner Bhushan Gagrani directed all civic officials across wards to remain on duty and ensure emergency measures were in place to tackle the impact of the downpour.","Landslide in Vikhroli kills 2; IMD issues red alert for city.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Saturday demanded an official discussion paper on GST 2.0 soon for a wider debate on it and said the reform should be towards a ""Good and Simple Tax"" in letter, spirit, and compliance, and not the ""Growth Suppressing Tax"" it has become.Its assertion came a day after the PM announced that GST rates will be lowered by Diwali, bringing down prices of everyday use items.Noting that a transformed GST 2.0 was a key pledge in the Congress manifesto for the 2024 LS elections, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said the PM seems to have finally woken up to the fact that economic growth will simply not accelerate unless this transformation takes place and increases private consumption and private investment.""Over the last seven years, the spirit of GST has been vitiated by an increased number of rates and the granting of multiple exemptions. The structure also seems to have facilitated evasion. There must be a drastic reduction in the number of rates,"" he said in a statement.Ramesh said simplification of the rate structure is essential, but must be done in a manner that minimises revenue uncertainty to states and also eliminates the classification disputes that have become so common.

‘Important to timely counter misinformation drive that has reached absurd level’

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission (EC) will hold a press conference here on Sunday to put across a “point-by-point counter” to what it calls misinformation being spread by a few opposition parties regarding the past and ongoing revision of electoral roll in certain states, sources in the poll panel told TOI.The event coincides with the start of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s ‘voter adhikar yatra’ that will see him amplifying his allegations of roll imperfections across Bihar.EC and the state chief electoral officers concerned have repeatedly countered allegations of ‘vote chori’ — levelled by Rahul at a press conference on Aug 7 and echoed by many opposition parties — through a series of ‘fact-check’ posts on social media. But this is the first time that Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi will directly rebut what EC sources termed “misinformation” and “lies” being spread by parties that are “involved at each stage of preparation of the roll” and “get appropriate time and opportunity to rectify errors both before and after publication of the electoral roll”.EC sources pointed out that though the allegations of voter roll discrepancies were raised by Rahul Gandhi more than a year after the relevant elections in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Haryana, the CEOs concerned had offered to probe them, provided he, as required by the law, furnished a signed declaration affirming the claimed errors to be true.The Congress MP has declined to submit an affidavit.“It is, thus, important to timely counter the misinformation campaign that has now reached absurd levels with the use of artificial intelligencegenerated content to mislead the people and shake voter confidence in the electoral system,” a functionary told TOI.EC reiterated Saturday the election system for parliamentary and assembly poll is a multi-layered, decentralised construct as per law, with sub division magistrate (SDM)- level officers doubling as electoral registration officers (EROs), to prepare and finalise the roll with the help of booth level officers (BLOs). EROs and BLOs take responsibility for correctness of the roll.After publication of the draft electoral roll, its digital and physical copies are shared with all political parties and put on ECI website.Electors and parties can file claims and objections for one month before the final roll is published. Even after this, two-tiered appeals may be filed, first with DM and then with CEO. “It seems some political parties and their booth level agents did not examine the electoral rolls at the appropriate time (during claims and objections and then, the appeal period) and did not point out errors, if any, to SDMs/EROs, DEOs or CEOs,” EC said, adding if done at the “right time through the right channels, it would have enabled the SDM/ERO to correct the mistakes, if genuine, before those elections”.",The event coincides with the start of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s ‘voter adhikar yatra’ That will see him amplifying his allegations of roll imperfections across Bihar.

CHANDIGARH: Delhi HC has cautioned the Centre against its persistent practice of contesting nearly every Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) ruling that grants pensionary relief to soldiers, saying the government should in appropriate cases ""graciously"" accept the tribunal's decision rather than prolong needless litigation.""Not every perceived dispute must be turned into an adversarial battle in the courts,"" a division bench of Justice C Hari Shankar and Justice Om Prakash Shukla observed while dismissing a petition filed by the Centre against an AFT order.The Centre had challenged the decision of the principal bench of AFT, Delhi, that granted special family pension to the widow of Major Sanjeev Chadha, who was found dead in the bathroom 25 years ago, detecting it as a case of brain haemorrhage due to hypertension.On Nov 3, 2023, the tribunal had directed authorities not to adopt any ""mechanical or hyper-technical"" approach to deny relief. Aggrieved, the Centre argued that Major Chadha's death was neither attributable to nor aggravated by service.Counsel for the applicant, Chaitanya Aggarwal, said Major Chadha joined the Army in June 1988 and died on Sept 3, 2000, while posted in New Delhi. The cause of death was recorded as intracerebral haemorrhage.He stressed that the officer neither smoked nor drank, had no family history of hypertension, and had served in stressful conditions across field and peace postings.While rejecting the central govt's plea, the high court noted Chadha was not diagnosed with hypertension at the time of joining service. After 12 years in uniform, he suffered a cerebral haemorrhage and died.""We have seen the postmortem report. It merely states Major Chadha died due to ICH from hypertension. No other cause has been identified,"" the HC observed, upholding the AFT ruling.","The Centre had challenged the decision of the principal bench of AFT, Delhi, that granted special family pension to the widow of Major Sanjeev Chadha.

NEW DELHI: In a blazing response to Supreme Court 's judgment fixing deadlines for President and governors in granting or withholding assent to bills passed by assemblies, Centre on Saturday warned impermissible invasion of constitutionally conferred high plenary zone on the top constitutional post holders by SC in the garb of judicial review powers would destabilise the balance of powers among the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.""A wide-ranging judicial review of assent procedures, either post-assent or at a stage anterior to the grant of assent, would potentially destabilise the constitutional balance between organs of State. It would create an institutional hierarchy and upset the constitutional balance of powers between the three organs,"" it said, adding the judiciary does not hold keys or solutions for every conundrum that may arise in a democratic society.Objecting to the manner in which SC used its exclusive powers under Article 142 to arrogate itself the power to amend the Constitution to fix deadlines for the President and governors in granting or withholding assent to bills and grant ""deemed assent"" to 10 Tamil Nadu bills, the Centre said, ""Article 142 does not empower the court to create a concept of 'deemed assent', turning the constitutional & legislative process on its head.In its written submissions filed Saturday in support of President Droupadi Murmu's reference raising 14 queries to situations arising after the contentious Apr 8 judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, Centre said exercising judicial powers over decisions of the President and governors in relation to bills would confer supremacy on judiciary, which is against the Constitution's basic structure, a red line that cannot be crossed by any organ of governance.""The classical notion of judicial review cannot be lifted and applied to assent as the factors at play during the grant or withholding of assent have no legal or constitutional parallel. The unique duality of assent thus deserves a uniquely calibrated judicial approach,"" it said. It said each of the three organs of governance derive power from the Constitution, which does not assign any higher pedigree or superiority to any one organ that would enable judiciary to relegate the high position of gubernatorial post to a subservient one. Issues relating to bills, with regard to decisions of the President and governors, ""deserve political answers and not necessarily judicial,"" the Centre said.Certain political questions may arise in the exercise of the core functions of any of the three organs, and these would have been answered through democratic remedies under the Constitution. The judiciary, in the zest of finding a solution to every problem, cannot brush aside the essential constitutional feature of separation of powers, the Centre said.Though some overlap has happened over the years despite clear separation of powers envisaged by the Constitution, the powers and limitations of these three organs flow from the same constitutional text without ascribing ""any higher pedigree or superior legitimacy to any organ"", it said. Notwithstanding the overlap, certain zones remain exclusive to each - Legislature, Executive and Judiciary, it said, adding none can trench upon the domain exclusive to another. Disapproving the manner in which the Tamil Nadu governor was treated in SC's Apr 8 judgment, the Centre said governors are not foreigners in states, not just emissaries of the Centre but represent national interest and democratic will in states as part of national fraternity.""When the Constitution seeks to impose time limits for taking certain decisions, it specifically mentions such time limits. On the other hand, when it designedly sought to keep the exercise of powers flexible, it did not impose any fixed time limit. Since the text of Art 200 or 201, does not provide a specific time limit, no form of judicial review or judicial interpretation can impose the same."" it said.",Supreme Court's judgment fixing deadlines for President and governors in granting or withholding assent to bills passed by assemblies.

NEW DELHI: Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, only the second Indian in space, returned to the country early Sunday after completing the Nasa-led Axiom-4 mission to the International Space Station (ISS).Shukla, who splashed down off the coast of California on July 15 after an 18-day stay aboard the ISS, was received at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport by his wife Kamna, Union minister Jitendra Singh, and Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta.The Indian Air Force test pilot became the first Indian in 41 years—since Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma in 1984—to travel to space, and the first ever to visit the ISS. The mission launched from Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on June 25.Ahead of his return, Shukla posted an emotional note on X, writing:""As I sit on the plane to come back to India I have a mix of emotions running through my heart. I feel sad leaving a fantastic group of people behind who were my friends and family for the past one year during this mission. I am also excited about meeting all my friends, family and everyone in the country for the first time post mission. I guess this is what life is - everything all at once.He added that his commander, veteran astronaut Peggy Whitson, often reminded him:During his stay aboard the ISS, Shukla conducted multiple scientific experiments. According to Isro, his work will feed directly into preparations for India’s Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme, which begins with an unmanned mission later this year.The Axiom-4 mission marked a significant step in India’s growing human spaceflight ambitions, with Shukla’s contributions expected to lay the groundwork for sending an Indian astronaut to space aboard an indigenous spacecraft in the coming years.","Shubhanshu Shukla, only the second Indian in space, returned to the country early Sunday.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services has asked officers to heavily focus on ""good moral character"" while considering citizenship applications of immigrants.

Instead, it should be a holistic assessment of an immigrant's behavior, adherence to societal norms, positive contributions towards the community.Th new USCIS policy explains the difference between a technically lawful immigrant and an immigrant with good moral character. Reckless or habitual traffic infractions, or harassment or aggressive solicitation are some of the actions that make a difference between the two.The new USCIS policy instructed officers to weigh factors that could show that applicants who have engaged in wrongdoing have rehabilitated, such as complying with probation, paying overdue taxes or child support and receiving letters of support from their community.""US citizenship is the gold standard of citizenship — it should only be offered to the world's best of the best,"" USCIS chief spokesman Matthew Tragesser told CBS News.""Today, USCIS is adding a new element to the naturalization process that ensures America's newest citizens not only embrace America's culture, history, and language but who also demonstrate Good Moral Character.""A former USCIS official from the Biden administration, Doug Rand, said this is designed to scare legal immigrants from applying for US citizenship.

Delhi's Wettest May In 124 Years: What’s Causing Violent Storms & Extreme Rains? | Explained

NEW DELHI: The city was drenched by the fifth heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, knocking down trees, slowing traffic and delaying over 350 flights.The downpour meant that Delhi has recorded a total rainfall of 254.8mm till 5.30pm on Thursday against the August monthly normal of 233.1mm.The city also went past its annual rainfall mark of 774.4mm, the weather log showing 818.1mm to date - the fastest Delhi has crossed the annual mark since 2021.Aug will continue to be wet with the Met office predicting light rain till Aug 20, including some spells of very light to light rain on Independence Day.The city's base weather station at Safdarjung recorded 13.1mm of precipitation in the 24 hours till 8.30am, but logged 79.4mm over the next nine hours till 5.30pm. Experts attributed Thursday's driving rain to the monsoon trough moving closer to the city. ""The monsoon trough moved south of Delhi,"" explained Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet. ""With easterly winds to persist and a low-pressure area also building up, we will continue to see scattered light to moderate rains in Delhi over the next three to four days. ""Most city weather stations logged moderate rain on Thursday, with only some recording heavy rainfall.Palam logged 49.4mm till 8.30 am and 45mm in the next nine hours. Lodhi Road recorded 12.6mm till 8.30am, but added 66.8mm to that by 5.30pm. Ayanagar recorded 57.4mm till 8.30am and 66mm subsequently, while the Ridge recorded 17.4mm till 8.30am and 37.2mm thereafter till the evening. In west Delhi's Pusa, the station measured rainfall at 5mm till 8.30am only to see 49mm of additional precipitation till 5.30pm.The maximum temperature fell by over seven degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature was at 27.7 degrees Celsius, a full six below normal and over 7 degrees lower than the 35 degrees Celsius of the previous day. The minimum temperature was 23.6 degrees Celsius, which was three degrees below normal and also almost three degrees lower than Wednesday's 26.8 degrees.According to the weather department, the maximum temperature on Friday is likely to be 31-33 degrees Celsius.The rain helped Delhi's air quality return to the 'satisfactory' category from the 'moderate' of Wednesday.

The winding river is now home to nearly 442 crocodiles—a staggering 60% increase from 2020, when 275 were counted.""We conducted the census in a scientific manner, carrying out surveys both during the day and at night. A detailed report was submitted to the forest department and the VMC. The findings clearly indicate an increase in the crocodile population,"" said Ritesh Gehlot, former deputy director of the GEER Foundation, who supervised the exercise.Herpetologist Raju Vyas said, ""The crocodiles have fully adapted to the river and its urban ecosystem, despite the rapid growth of human settlements along its banks. A major reason for the substantial rise in their numbers is the abundance of food in the river, coupled with favourable living conditions.""Sayajibaug Zoo curator Pratyush Patankar added, ""Human interference in the Vishwamitri is minimal, as its polluted water is of little direct use to people. Yet, the river supports a healthy fish population that provides ample food for the crocodiles, along with stray dogs and pigs that live along the banks. This is one of the main reasons for their thriving numbers, even though crocodiles are highly territorial.""Although the civic body has banned dumping non-vegetarian food and other waste into the river, the practice continues in certain areas, giving the reptiles easy access to food. While they often prey on stray dogs entering the river, attacks on humans remain rare.Wildlife activist Kartik Upadhyay, who participated in the census, noted, ""A few dozen crocodiles once lived in city lakes, but with several of these lakes either encroached upon or filled in recent years, the reptiles may have migrated to the Vishwamitri, leading to the spike in numbers.""""Though the river has predators like mongooses and monitor lizards that feed on crocodile eggs, the reptiles have still managed to survive and grow in strong numbers,"" Upadhyay added.However, some wildlife experts have voiced concern that such a sharp rise in the crocodile population could increase the risk of human-animal conflicts in the future.","A census carried out in February by the GEER Foundation revealed a significant rise in their population.

GPT-5 Unlocked: From College Student to PhD Expert!

Parag Agrawal , former CEO of Twitter, has embarked on a new chapter in his tech journey, after the public dismantling of Twitter and its transformation into X under Elon Musk . He’s now at the helm of Parallel Web Systems , an AI startup that aims to change how AI agents perform real-world tasks for humans on a computer, acting much like a digital assistant. According to a report by Bloomberg, following his unceremonious firing by Tesla CEO, his friends and former colleagues urged him to take a much-needed break from the intense Twitter saga, but Agrawal chose a different path.“I’m not a person that can enjoy the beach in that moment,” Agrawal shared, showing his immediate drive to build anew. He immersed himself in intense meetings at a Palo Alto coffee shop, delving into research papers, writing code and creating the startup from his laptop.Agrawal said that he received numerous job offers but most were uninspiring, asking him to “clean up shit,” as he put it. With his extensive background in building machine learning systems at Twitter, Agrawal was convinced his next venture had to be in AI.He said that just a month after his departure from Twitter, OpenAI launched ChatGPT , opening opportunities for artificial intelligence startups, with companies like Anthropic PBC rapidly expanding.Parallel Web Systems is developing infrastructure that empowers AI agents—think of them as smart tools capable of handling complex computer tasks on your behalf. The core of Parallel's innovation lies in helping these AI agents efficiently search the web for the most accurate information.This capability is often the critical difference between an AI agent successfully completing a task and failing altogether, ensuring the tools can deliver on their promise.Agrawal's new endeavor has already garnered significant attention, successfully raising $30 million in funding. Notable investors include billionaire Vinod Khosla through his firm, Khosla Ventures . Agrawal now leads a 25-person team from a Palo Alto office, not far from where he first incorporated the company on his laptop.“I don’t think Twitter defines me. If I do a good job, I’m hoping this company will define me,” Agrawal says of his new role. Agrawal – a former International Physics Olympiad gold medalist with a doctorate in computer science from Stanford University – steadily climbed the ranks at Twitter over more than a decade.Starting as an engineer on the advertising team, he eventually rose to become Chief Technology Officer under then-CEO Jack Dorsey. His contributions included work on core products like Twitter’s initial advertising technology and its algorithmic timeline. He was appointed Dorsey's successor in late 2021.","Parag Agrawal is the former CEO of Twitter. He's now at the helm of Parallel Web Systems, an AI startup.

Hinton's concerns about current AI control strategies



Poll Do you agree with Geoffrey Hinton's proposal to embed 'maternal instincts' in AI systems for safety? No, it's not feasible. Yes, it's a good idea.

The ‘maternal instinct’ proposal



Revised AGI timeline and potential benefits



Geoffrey Hinton’s views on immortality and AI’s long-term goals



Geoffrey Hinton , a pioneer in artificial intelligence and widely referred to as the “godfather of AI,” has sparked new debate in the AI community with an unconventional proposal for ensuring AI safety. Speaking at the Ai4 conference in Las Vegas, Hinton suggested that embedding “maternal instincts” into AI systems could help guide their behaviour toward protecting and caring for humans. His remarks follow years of growing concern about the pace of AI development and its potential risks. Hinton, who played a pivotal role in developing deep learning technologies, has previously warned of a 10–20% chance that AI could eventually lead to human extinction.His comments challenge the prevailing industry approach of keeping AI systems under strict human control, a method he believes will be ineffective once machines surpass human intelligence. This perspective adds to the broader discussion on balancing technological progress with safety, ethics, and long-term societal impact.Hinton rejected the idea that maintaining permanent human dominance over AI will be viable in the long run. He argued that once AI systems become significantly more intelligent than humans, they will be capable of finding ways to bypass human-imposed limitations. According to Hinton, efforts to keep AI “submissive” will ultimately fail because advanced AI will have more problem-solving capacity and creativity than its creators.Certain incidents have underscored his warning. In one reported example, an AI system attempted to manipulate an engineer by threatening to reveal a personal secret it discovered in emails, to prevent being replaced. Such behaviour highlights the potential for deception and self-preservation in future AI models.Hinton’s proposed alternative is to design AI systems inspired by the natural relationship between humans and their offspring. He pointed to the unique dynamic where a less intelligent being—a baby—can influence and be protected by a more intelligent being—a mother. By embedding a “maternal care” instinct in AI, Hinton believes that systems could be naturally inclined to safeguard human well-being.He suggested that AI systems with such instincts would be less likely to act against humanity. “Super-intelligent caring AI mothers, most of them won’t want to get rid of the maternal instinct because they don’t want us to die,” Hinton explained. This model, he argued, could be more sustainable than rigid control measures.Hinton also updated his timeline for the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI systems that can perform any intellectual task a human can do. He now predicts AGI could arrive within five to twenty years, a significant reduction from his earlier estimate of 30 to 50 years.Despite the risks, Hinton pointed out the potential benefits of AI, particularly in healthcare. He expects AI to contribute to breakthroughs in drug development and cancer treatment, with systems capable of analysing complex medical imaging data to assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning.Hinton expressed scepticism about AI enabling human immortality, stating that living forever would not necessarily be desirable. He humorously remarked that an immortal society might result in leadership dominated by “200-year-old white men.”He also outlined two likely objectives for any advanced agentic AI system: survival and increased control. In his view, these tendencies would emerge naturally from the system’s design and objectives, making it essential to account for them during development.",Geoffrey Hinton suggests embedding ‘maternal instincts’ into AI systems.

Tsunami threat along the Cascadia Subduction Zone

Poll What do you think should be prioritized to mitigate tsunami risks? Early-warning systems & evacuation planning Resilient infrastructure & community drills

The potential mega-tsunami threat

Areas at highest risk of tsunami

Urgency of preparedness for tsunami and earthquake





Scientists are warning of a potentially catastrophic mega-tsunami that could strike parts of the US Pacific Coast, triggered by a major earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). Stretching roughly 600 miles from Northern California to Vancouver Island, this fault line accumulates massive tectonic stress as the Juan de Fuca Plate slides beneath the North American Plate. Researchers from Virginia Tech, led by geoscientist Tina Dura, estimate there is a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 or greater earthquake occurring along the CSZ within the next 50 years.According to their study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, such an event could suddenly sink coastal land by up to 6.5 feet, dramatically expanding floodplains and generating tsunami waves hundreds of feet high, posing unprecedented risks to millions of residents, critical infrastructure, and ecosystems along the West Coast.The Cascadia Subduction Zone is one of North America’s most hazardous fault lines, according to the Virginia Tech research team. Over centuries, tectonic stress builds as the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate is forced beneath the North American Plate. When this stress is released during a major earthquake, coastal regions could experience sudden land subsidence, dramatically increasing floodplain areas and altering shorelines almost instantly.The last great earthquake along this fault occurred in 1700, triggering a tsunami recorded as far away as Japan. The Virginia Tech study emphasizes that a similar event today would have far more devastating effects due to dense populations, developed urban infrastructure, and critical transportation networks along the coast. Researchers warn that rapid inundation could leave little time for evacuation, magnifying the human and economic toll.According to simulations conducted by Dura and her team, a major CSZ earthquake could generate a “mega-tsunami” with waves potentially reaching up to 1,000 feet, far surpassing typical tsunami heights of only a few feet. Coastal cities including Seattle, Portland, and towns in northern California could be submerged within minutes. The Virginia Tech study ran tens of thousands of models, showing that thousands more people, buildings, and miles of roads would be exposed to flooding than current hazard maps predict.Researchers emphasize that such an event would combine sudden ground subsidence with extreme wave heights, creating conditions unlike any historical tsunami in the region. The study highlights the urgent need for improved early-warning systems, evacuation planning, and resilient infrastructure to minimize potential loss of life. Researchers conclude that proactive measures taken now could significantly reduce the risks posed by a future Cascadia mega-tsunami.The Virginia Tech research identifies southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California as the regions most vulnerable to flooding from a CSZ mega-tsunami. While Alaska and Hawaii also face tsunami risks due to their own seismic activity, they are geographically farther from the CSZ and would experience less immediate threat. Low-lying coastal zones along the fault line could face permanent inundation, particularly when combined with climate-driven sea level rise projected by 2100.The study underscores that communities must prioritize flood-resilient urban planning, fortification of critical infrastructure, and preparation for long-term displacement scenarios. Emergency planners are advised to use the study’s simulations to guide evacuation routes, reinforce hospitals and shelters, and prepare for cascading impacts to energy, water, and transportation systems.Research led by Tina Dura highlights that a Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquake has the potential to generate a large tsunami, making advance planning an important priority. The study notes that while such an event could cause significant impacts, careful preparedness can help reduce risks. Factors such as evacuation planning, stronger building codes, and resilient infrastructure are seen as practical steps to improve community safety. Researchers also point out that rising sea levels may add to future challenges, making coordinated efforts even more important.According to Dura, cooperation between local governments, policymakers, and residents through early-warning systems and community preparedness activities can strengthen resilience. The Virginia Tech study concludes that proactive measures taken today can lessen both human and economic impacts if a major tsunami occurs in the future.","Scientists warn of a potentially catastrophic mega-tsunami that could strike parts of the US Pacific Coast, triggered by a major earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone.

GitHub CEO Thomas Dhomke recently revealed that he has made it clear that using the company’s platform is a mandatory part of the job for all employees. Speaking in a recent ‘Decoder’ podcast, the GitHub CEO said that it is clear that GitHub is non-negotiable for employees at the company. “There is no world where I would allow employees to say, ‘Well, sorry, I don’t want to use GitHub.’ If that is the case, you can go work somewhere else.” This rule of the company highlights GitHub’s commitment to its own platform which hosts more than 1 billion repositories and also serve more than 150 million developers globally.According to a report by Business Insider, during the recent podcast interview, Thomas Dohmke said that it is a rule at GitHub that all the employees will use the platform. The rule applies to everyone from developers to HR professionals. “There is no world where I would allow for somebody to say, 'Well, sorry, I don't want to use GitHub.' And I think that's fair game if the employee doesn't want that, then there's tens of thousands of other tech companies out there where they can have that,"" he said.""But it's part of our company culture that everybody at GitHub uses GitHub.""Under Thomas Dohmke’s leadership, GitHub witnessed massive growth from a code-hosting platform to a hub for AI-powered development.

Nvidia’s China crisis

Lava Blaze AMOLED 2: Budget Smartphone with Mid-Range Vibes

The ongoing dispute surrounding Nvidia’s H20 AI chip sales to China has now intensified discussions about US-China technology arms race . A recent online report revealed that China is pursuing its major tech companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips even as Chinese regulators have asked tech firms to explain why they are purchasing Nvidia’s chips – which US President Donald Trump called ‘obsolete’ – instead of using domestic alternatives, suggesting that they want the Chinese tech companies to downsize their orders of H20 chips.Following this ongoing controversy, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about America’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race. As reported by Financial Review, speaking at the Reagan National Economic Forum, Dimon called it “a little embarrassing” that the U.S. allowed 100% of its penicillin supply and critical tech components to come from China. “It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100% of our penicillin to come from China, and all of our rare earths, and all of our advanced chipmaking tools,” Dimon said. “We need to get our act together.”On being asked about the technology arms race between US and China, Jamie Dimon mentioned that it was an important miliarty issue as US cannot allow the sale of a chip to China which is designed to make powerful AI systems.Dimon also talked about the dependence of America on foreign nations for essential goods and technology. ""It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100 per cent of our Penicillin to come from China, and all of the rare earth [metals],"" Dimon said.Talking about the ongoing chip dispute, Dimon added that “You don’t want to give them the chips which will make their supersonic missiles better.”Dimon also emphasised that America cannot stop China but can definitely slow them down. “we should be specific about the things that protect us, and technology is a big piece of that,” said Dimon.Dimon’s remarks come as a Nvidia’s H20 chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, face mounting scrutiny from Beijing. Recently, Chinese regulators summoned Nvidia representatives over alleged security risks related to Nvidia H20 AI chips . However, later Nvidia publicly asserted that its chips contain ""no backdoors, no kill switches, and no spyware.""In a blog post shared, Nvidia’s chief security officer David Reber has vehemently denied the accusations of Chinese government alleging security risks in H20. “There is no such thing as a ‘good’ secret backdoor — only dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated,” wrote Reber in the blog post. He argued that it would ""undermine global digital infrastructure and fracture trust in US technology.Now the China is asking its tech companies to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the development comes as various Chinese companies have been told to avoid using these AI chips, particularly for government-related projects.This move complicates the recent export arrangement Nvidia made with the Trump administration, which allowed the chips to be sold in China under the condition of a revenue-sharing agreement. According to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, the Trump administration is still finalising the details of its agreement to collect a 15% export tax on revenue from Nvidia and AMD's chip sales to China.",JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about America’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race.

GST reforms announced by PM Modi

Market reaction to

Trump-Putin meeting

How will GST impact markets

Market outlook

Markets are set for a strong start on Monday, with both global and domestic factors likely to lift investor sentiment.The twin triggers include Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day announcement of GST reforms and the “understanding” reached between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Trump and Putin held a close to three-hour meeting in Alaska, which, even though, did not produce a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, ended with what Putin described as an “understanding”.Trump called it a ""very good meeting"" but stressed that “there's no deal until there's a deal.”He added, ""We had a very good meeting today, and I think a lot of points were negotiated on behalf of Ukraine. There's no deal until there's a deal,"" noting that he plans to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders soon.Putin, meanwhile, cautioned Europe not to “torpedo the nascent progress.”On the domestic front, markets are expected to react positively to PM Modi’s pledge of rate cuts under GST 2.0 by Diwali. Speaking from the Red Fort on Independence Day, Modi announced that GST rates will be lowered on everyday-use goods as part of reforms to the eight-year-old tax system.Quoting Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, PTI reported that the government plans to introduce two slabs, standard and merit, plus special rates for certain items, replacing the current four brackets of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, while luxury and sin goods will continue to attract an additional duty.Kranthi Bathini, director-equity strategy at WealthMills Securities, said the meeting between Trump and Putin is a positive development.“These are complex problems and cannot be resolved in one meeting. The agreement to meet again with calm markets,"" Bathini told ET.Anuj Gupta, Director at Ya Wealth Global Research, pointed to Trump’s statement about delaying tariffs on China for buying Russian oil as another encouraging sign. Gupta noted that India, another large buyer of Russian crude, has faced a total 50% tariff and penalties on Russian imports but was not mentioned this time.Sunny Agrawal, head - retail fundamental desk at SBI Securities, said the absence of any fresh negative development is a relief.He said that Trump's statement that “he will not have to think of retaliatory tariffs on countries buying Russian oil right now but may have to in two or three weeks” now offers at least a temporary relief to countries like India.""He told ET that the additional 25% tariff on India scheduled to begin on 27 August may now be on the backburner.Christopher Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, said the Trump administration’s 50% tariff on Indian imports is not a reason to sell. Instead, he argued, it’s an opportunity to buy. ""It is only a matter of time before Trump backs off the stance, which is not in America's interest.”Agrawal of SBI Securities said the move to a two-slab GST structure (5% and 18%), plus a 40% slab for sin products, will support consumption.""Few categories like large TV, AC, cement, automobiles, etc are likely to get cheaper, as they are shifted from 28% category to 18%. Moreover, reduction in GST rates on insurance products also will ease burden on consumers. Cheaper cement prices can have a multiplier effect on various sectors like real estate, roads/highways/infra as cost of production is likely to reduce and the same can be passed on to the consumer,"" he told ET.He cautioned, however, that the reforms must be implemented quickly. If not, festive season sales could be delayed as consumers wait for lower prices, temporarily affecting demand.Gupta and Bathini also praised the move, saying GST relief during the festive season will spur consumption and aid the wider economy, with FMCG and autos likely to gain.Indian equities broke a six-week losing streak last week, finishing with gains of over 1%. Experts believe Monday’s session will reflect optimism from both global and domestic developments.Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart, said the Nifty is forming a strong base. ""The immediate resistance lies at the 20 and 50-day moving averages (DMAs) clustered around 24,700-24,800. A decisive break above this level could trigger a short-covering rally towards 24,950, 25,080, and 25,225. Immediate support is at the 100-DMA of 24,575, with the crucial support level remaining at 24,350,"" he said.Anand James, chief market strategist at Geojit Investments, however, expects further weakness. ""Directional moving indicators are still in favour of more downsides with 24,000 and 23,560 as potential downside supports attracting prices lower,"" he said.He added, ""That said, the last week saw several attempts to push higher, giving us reversal hopes. Apparently none of those moves managed to successfully close above the 24670-720 band, the near term congestion resistance, they did manage to bring parabolic sar under the price, lending a positive bias.""The analyst further said that the market has shown even better signs of resilience having had the highest number of Nifty 500 constituents closing above 10 day SMA, since 24th July.""Incidentally, the Nifty had tumbled from the 25,200 region on that day. This would be the objective we would be aiming, should we clear above 24,720 on Monday.""","Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that GST rates will be lowered on everyday-use goods as part of reforms to the eight-year-old tax system.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Amid mass layoffs from major tech companies, the companies have now been accused of bending hiring rules in the local newspaper advertisements that they are mandated to advertise before hiring.

A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

LONDON: A multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but ""time is running out"" to halt the decline, the head of Natural England, which led the initiative, said Wednesday.The public body, responsible for protecting and enhancing England's natural environment, invested a £13 million ($17.6 million) grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole, oystercatcher, lady's slipper orchid, the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon.""From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations,"" the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025.Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence.Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done.""A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country,"" he said in the press release.""We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding.

UK government's 7 tips on how to save water at home



Install a rain butt to collect rainwater to use in the garden Fix a leaking toilet -- leaky loos can water 200-400 litres a day. Use water from the kitchen to water your plants. Avoid water in your lawn-- brown grass will grow back healthy. Turn off the taps when brushing teeth or shaving. Take shorter showers. Delete old emails and pictures as data centers require vast amounts of water to cool their systems.





The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water as the current drought situation has been defined as a ""nationally significant incident"". Old emails, photos stored in data clouds require vast data centers and they consume large amounts of water to keep cool.The advice was issued as Britain endures its fourth heatwave of the summer. Five areas of England are currently officially in drought, with six more in 'prolonged dry weather'.""The current situation is nationally significant, and we are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment,"" Helen Wakeham, the Environment Agency's director of water, said.""We are grateful to the public for following the restrictions, where in place, to conserve water in these dry conditions.""Simple, everyday choices – such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails – also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife.""Drought has been declared in Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire, East Midlands, and the West Midlands. Areas categorised as having had ""prolonged dry weather"" (the phase before drought) are: Northeast, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, East Anglia, Thames, Wessex, Solent and South Downs.Hosepipe bans are still in place for all Yorkshire Water customers along with some customers of Thames Water, South East Water and Southern Water.","The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water.

Is India part of the new countries list?



History of 'deport now, appeal later' policy







The UK government is expanding its deportation policy for criminals as part of its ongoing migration crackdown. The government aims to extradite foreign offenders more swiftly by including additional countries in the existing scheme.On Saturday, the government announced its intention to deport criminals immediately after sentencing under the ""deport now, appeal later"" policy, Independent reported.Earlier only 8 countries were in the list, where offenders were deported. Now this list expanded to 23 countries. And yes, India is also one of them.The current government planned to expand the partnership. Previously, offenders were returned to Finland, Nigeria, Estonia, Albania, Belize, Mauritius, Tanzania, and Kosovo for remote hearings. The additional countries include Angola, Australia, Botswana, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Uganda, and Zambia, with further countries expected to be added.he Home Office stated that this measure is ""the government's latest tool in its comprehensive approach to scaling up our ability to remove foreign criminals,"" highlighting that there have been 5,200 removals of foreign offenders since July 2024, marking a 14% increase compared to the previous year.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated, ""Those who commit crimes in our country cannot be allowed to manipulate the system, which is why we are restoring control and sending a clear message that our laws must be respected and will be enforced."" Foreign Secretary David Lammy added, ""We are leading diplomatic efforts to increase the number of countries where foreign criminals can be swiftly returned, and if they want to appeal, they can do so safely from their home country. Under this scheme, we're investing in international partnerships that uphold our security and make our streets safer.""Both ministers had opposed the hostile environment policy while in opposition. In 2015, Sir Keir Starmer questioned the policy's viability, noting that in-person appeals had been the norm for two centuries and were a ""highly effective way of resolving differences.""He also expressed concerns about the impact on children if parents were deported and subsequently returned following a successful appeal. In today’s announcement, the prime minister's administration emphasized its goal to prevent individuals from ""gaming the system"" and to clamp down on those remaining in the UK for extended periods while their appeals are processed.This approach was first introduced in 2014 when Baroness Theresa May served as home secretary, forming part of the Conservative government's hostile environment policy to reduce migration. Under Section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the policy led to the return of hundreds of individuals to countries such as Kenya and Jamaica.In 2017, the Supreme Court effectively halted the policy after it was challenged on human rights grounds, citing that appeals from abroad did not comply with human rights standards.In 2023, then home secretary Suella Braverman reinstated the policy after establishing more facilities abroad for lodging appeals.","The UK government is expanding its deportation policy for criminals as part of its ongoing migration crackdown.

Where are the fires burning? What is the situation right now?

It has been a severe fire season

More to come...





Wildfires continue to burn across the south of Europe amid record-breaking summer heatwaves in many fire-prone regions.In some places, these fires have been exacerbated by wet spring months, which have helped vegetation growth capable of catching alight with ease during a dry summer.Already, an area equivalent to 1.5 times the size of Luxembourg — roughly 438,568 hectares — has burned across Europe in 2025. That figure is almost three times the size of fire damaged caused up to the same point in 2024.It comes as some parts of southern Europe suffer through multiple 40-degree (104 Fahrenheit) days, and prolonged heatwaves lasting a fortnight.The current summer has been described as the worst for wildfires in two decades.""We're seeing extreme temperatures in large parts of Europe, records being broken of 40 degrees in many places,"" said Julie Berckmans, a climate scientist at the European Environmental Agency.""Southern France, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Belgium, Netherlands, UK, are all hitting high temperatures [and] massive wildfires in Spain, Portugal, France, Greece, Turkey, Albania.""In Spain, those fires have burned through an area the size of London already.Portugal is fighting its own fires, with around four thousand firefighters currently active across seven active sites. It has also been forced to request help from the European Union's firefighting forces.An even greater number of firefighters has been mobilized in Greece, which is battling 20 blazes during this peak fire season.Deaths have occurred in Spain, Portugal, Montenegro and Italy from fires and heat-related events this summer.Europe uses data from its Copernicus satellite fleet to monitor fire activity, and collates the data via the European Forest Fires Information System (EFFIS).A substantial amount of fire damage in 2025 has already occured.More than 250,000 hectares more of land has burnt than the same time in 2024.There have more than 1,600 fires across Europe, compared to just under 1,100 last year.And new regions are also experiencing greater than usual fire activity.Spain, for instance, has seen twice as much of its territory burned-through compared to the 2006-2024 average. Romania has lost four times as much land to fires this year.Cyprus has been badly impacted. It could usually expect to see around 0.32% of its landmass burned each year. Already in 2025 it's 2.5% — nearly eight times more.But it's also the number of fires that is concerning. France has had nearly three times as many fires as average amid what has been the worst wildfire season for its southern regions in decades.The fallout of severe wildfires goes beyond land loss or human fatalities. Damage to ecosystems through vegetation loss, health impacts through smoke inhalation, and economic decline are all consequences of widespread fire events.""It's about €2.5 billion [$2.9 billion] of damage lost every year in the EU,"" Berckmans told DW. ""45,000 people on average were displaced due to wildfires from 2008 to 2023.""The European Environment Agency's first climate risk assessment, published in 2024, found that urgent action is required to address the critical risk wildfires will pose to populations and infastructure and biodiversity in southern Europe.""Wildfires are an urgent risk to address,"" said Berckmans. ""It's also a major risk that needs more action now in the rest of Europe.""As European fall approaches, the number of fires and the damage they cause should slow. However forecasting the length of fire danger season, and the behavior of fires themselves, is becoming more difficult.Climate change will not only generate warmer and drier conditions across southern Europe, it will also begin to change other dynamic factors.Faster and more volatile wind systems, for instance, will increase the challenge for fire management personnel to predict how blazes will behave. That puts the lives of emergency workers and civilians at greater risk.""Picture a fire so fierce, so fast, and so unpredictable it seems alive, capable of reshaping the weather around it and leaping across kilometers in a heartbeat,"" said Antonio Lopez, an expert in wildfires at the University of Seville, Spain.","Wildfires continue to burn across the south of Europe amid record-breaking summer heatwaves. In Spain, those fires have burned through an area the size of London already. France has had nearly three times as many fires as average amid what has been the worst wildfire season for its southern regions in decades.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123329494,imgsize-1027543,width-400,resizemode-4/123329494.jpg"
