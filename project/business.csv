RBI Slashes Rates After Rupee Fall, Boosts Liquidity And Lifts India’s GDP Forecast To 7.3%

MUMBAI: The rupee weakened on Friday due to dollar demand from maturing offshore positions and corporate hedging. It closed at 90.16 per dollar, 14 paise down from its previous close. Falling equities added to the pressure. Elevated dollar demand weighed intraday, though sporadic dollar sales near the lows capped losses and kept sentiment cautious.“The rupee weakened, pressured by weakness in domestic equity markets and continued foreign investor selling. Volatility in the dollar index, driven by key US economic data, has further weighed on the currency,” said Jateen Trivedi of LKP Securities.","The rupee closed at 90.16 per dollar, 14 paise down from its previous close.

Debut debacle: It’s raining startup IPOs but stock prices are in slump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/debut-debacle-its-raining-startup-ipos-but-stock-prices-are-in-slump/articleshow/126446165.cms,".

MUMBAI: Even as startups are increasingly rushing to Dalal Street, buoyed by a booming primary market, many of the large, listed companies are trading below their IPO offer price, raising concerns over the long-term value they can generate for investors.Stock prices of close to 10 startups including Swiggy, FirstCry, Paytm, Ola Electric and Delhivery are trading below their offer price, data sourced from the exchanges and Prime Database showed (see graphic) . While market volatility and a broader correction have somewhat had a bearing, a bigger overhang has been the tepid growth of the companies which failed to keep pace with the expectations of the street, said analysts tracking the space.“The realisation (on part of investors) that performance is not meeting expectations is resulting in disappointment and value correction,” said Nikunj Doshi, of Bay Capital. For many startups, acquisitions have been the way of reporting topline growth but whether they are getting reflected in the bottom line remains to be seen, said Doshi.Since 2021, over 30 startups have debuted on the exchanges, ditching larger private fundraises as regulatory easing and higher valuations in public markets made it smoother for firms to go for an IPO.Following a clutch of billiondollar startup listings floated by players such as Lenskart, Groww and Meesho last year, PhonePe, Zepto, Oyo and Flipkart, among others are gearing up for a debut in 2026.To be fair, most of the recently listed startups are trading above their offer price, but analysts said that the performance of digital companies should be weighed after six months of listing. “These companies are largely funded by VC, PE/HNI investors whose lock in expires after six months of listing and the floodgates of supply open. Some startups saw correction in their prices after six months,” said Doshi. A lock-in expiry is the time when restrictions on selling share ends, allowing shareholders to sell their stakes, increasing supply in secondary market which can be difficult to absorb.Public market valuations for tech-led businesses have meaningfully reset from the peak cycle. For instance, in the case of high-quality SaaS companies, which were earlier trading at mid-teens revenue multiples, current market benchmarks are materially lower, reflecting both multiple compression and a moderation in growth rate versus earlier expectations, said Mehekka Oberoi, fund manager at IIFL Fintech Fund. The next batch of startups may have to list at lower valuations compared to their last private fundings.","Stock prices of close to 10 startups including Swiggy, FirstCry, Paytm, Ola Electric and Delhivery are trading below their offer price.

US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick made a big statement over why the India-US trade deal is not sealed yet, claiming that it was due to PM Modi not calling Trump. Speaking at the All-In Podcast, hosted by Chamath Palihapitiya, Lutnick said, ""Let's be clear, it's his deal. He's the closer. He does the deal. So I said, you got to have Modi. It's all set up. You have to have Modi...they were uncomfortable doing it.""""So Modi didn't call,"" he claimed.This statement comes after US President Donald Trump, on Thursday, approved a bill that can impose at least 500% tariffs for countries buying Russian oil, aiming to ""punish them."" US senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill would give US tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil.In February, leaders from both countries directed officials to begin negotiations, setting an initial goal of completing the first phase by autumn 2025. However the deal still remains stalled with India's trade with Russia remaining a major flashpoint.Back in August, US imposed additional tariffs on Indian imports to the country alleging that New Delhi's purchase of Russian oil was fueling Moscow's 'war machine' in Ukraine.Since then total tariffs on Indian goods stand at 50%, including 25% of additional tariffs and 25% of Trump's reciprocal tariffs.Since then, two nations have held many rounds of trade talks with the meeting back from December 10 to December 12, when US officials visited New Delhi. India and the US are engaged in parallel negotiations, aiming to develop a framework trade deal to address tariff issues, and focus on a comprehensive trade agreement.The proposed agreement aims to more than double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 from the current $191 billion.The US remained India’s largest trading partner for the fourth consecutive year in 2024–25, with bilateral trade standing at $131.84 billion, of which $86.5 billion came from Indian exports. The American market accounts for roughly 18% of India’s total goods exports, 6.22% of its imports, and 10.73% of overall merchandise trade.Exporters have highlighted the need to finalise the agreement, noting that India’s merchandise exports to the US fell for a second straight month in October, declining 8.58% to $6.3 billion, largely due to the steep tariffs imposed by Washington.","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick made a big statement over why the India-US trade deal is not sealed yet.

In Fiery UK Conclave Speech, Suhel Seth Says India Has Evolved Beyond 1947, Now Shapes Global Power

NEW DELHI: In a move to shed yet another colonial relic, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Friday announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj — black prince coats (bandhgala coats) — saying that “we have to find every trace of colonialism and banish them”.TOI has learnt that govt is carrying out a larger exercise across the board to identify similar colonial hangovers — attire and ceremonial rites — such as convocation gowns and caps (robe and mortarboard) which are de rigueur at university conovations and bandhgalas officers have to mandatorily wear at formal receptions. In some states personnel attached to district collectors and mayors in some states are required to wear a certain pattern of dress.Speaking at an event to honour railway officials and the zone for their exemplary works, Vaishnaw said, “We have to get rid of all colonial mindset. We need to find each of them and remove them whether it’s in our working style or dressing style. Today (Friday) I am making the first announcement. Humare jo band gale ka kala suit angrezon chalu kiya tha, aaj se yeh railway mein formal dress nehin rahegi. (From today onwards, the black prince coats that the British introduced will no longer be a part of formal dress in railways).Officials said that PM Narendra Modi has asked ministers and top bureaucrats to identify the colonial practices and to suggest alternatives that are of Indian origins and reflect the country's culture.While the practice of convocation gowns and caps has been fading, some institutions have held on to it despite the ceremonial gear not being suited for India’s hot and humid conditions and despite protests from students and faculty. Officials said that more practices, which are not commonly known to many, may be identified during consultations.Sources did not rule out the possibility of a nudge to do away with black coats and gowns that lawyers are required to wear as per Advocates Act, 1961 continuing a tradition inherited from the British legal system where it symbolised authority, dignity, and a commitment to justice. This law formalised the British-era custom, requiring advocates to wear the black robe with a white neckband for uniformity and gravity in court.",Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj.

NEW DELHI: One of the country's largest central govt hospitals is functioning with a significant shortage of teaching faculty, potentially straining patient care and medical education.An RTI reply from Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital administration on Dec 27, 2025, shows that 70 out of the 398 sanctioned teaching posts are vacant.While department-wise data show while 365 faculty members are currently in position - 346 are occupied by regular faculty members and 19 by contractual faculty - 37 are posted in excess in some departments, leaving the 70 posts vacant elsewhere due to uneven faculty distribution.This has resulted in persistent staffing gaps in several critical departments as well as internal imbalances, rather than uniform faculty deployment.Among the core clinical disciplines facing acute shortages, clinical haematology has nine vacancies out of 11 sanctioned posts, while neurology is short of eight faculty members. Cardiology, a high-burden tertiary-care service, has seven vacancies out of 12 posts, and neurosurgery is functioning with five vacant posts.Anaesthesia, central to surgical services, has six vacancies.There are also gaps in departments linked to cancer care and advanced diagnostics. Medical oncology has two sanctioned posts but none currently in position, while nuclear medicine and urology have three and four vacancies, respectively. There are similar shortages in pathology, physiology, pulmonary medicine, endocrinology and forensic medicine, according to the RTI reply.Responding to the RTI findings, Sakshi Chhugh, public relations officer, VMMC & Safdarjung Hospital, said the hospital has a sanctioned strength of 398 teaching posts, of which 345 are presently occupied by regular faculty and 18 by contractual faculty. She said interviews for the remaining 35 posts had already been conducted, and appointments would be finalised in due course as per prescribed recruitment procedures.""The hospital continues to ensure that academic activities, teaching programmes and patient care services remain uninterrupted,"" Chhugh said.Health experts warn that sustained faculty shortages in teaching hospitals can translate into longer waiting times, heavier clinician workload and reduced teaching and supervision for medical students, with direct implications for service delivery at high-volume centres like Safdarjung.","One of the country's largest central govt hospitals is functioning with a significant shortage of teaching faculty.

The row involves land in what used to be ‘Hathroi village’ in official records

JAIPUR: Supreme Court has reopened proceedings in a Rs 400-crore land dispute between Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) and the family of former royal and deputy CM Diya Kumari, setting aside a Rajasthan high court order that allowed a 2011 trial court decree in favour of the princely estate to ""stand without examination on merit"".The bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Vishwanathan held that there was no justification in the high court declining to consider JDA's appeal on technical grounds. The judges directed the HC bench to decide JDA's first appeal on merit within four weeks and submit a compliance report.The dispute involves land in what used to be ""Hathroi village"" in official records before becoming part of central Jaipur's urban sprawl, including prime real estate, schools, hospitals and other civic infrastructure.JDA pegs the value of the land parcel, mentioned in revenue records as ""Siwai chak"" (uncultivable govt land), at Rs 400 crore. The petition says the civic administration took possession of the land in the 1990s, challenging the erstwhile royal family's claim that it was registered as private property under the 1949 Covenant linked to Jaipur's accession to the Indian Union.JDA insists the land was never listed as the former royal family's private property in the covenant schedule, and that swathes of land were lawfully acquired between 1993 and 1995 after paying compensation.In 2005, the royal family filed a civil suit, seeking declaration of ownership. On Nov 24, 2011, the trial court decreed the suit in their favour, declaring them owners. The court set aside revenue entries in favour of the state and restrained JDA from interfering with possession.JDA filed its first appeal in 2012. It was dismissed in Nov 2023, before being restored just over a year later.On Sept 15 last year, HC declined to intervene in the dispute, leaving the trial court decree intact without appellate scrutiny. JDA approached Supreme Court on Dec 10, arguing that public land was lost on technical grounds despite issues involving public title, completed acquisitions, settled revenue records and a constitutional bar under Article 363.","The row involves land in what used to be ‘Hathroi village’ in official records.

'PM Modi-Trump Held 8 Calls In 2025': India Rejects Lutnick's Claim On Stalled Trade Agreement

In the wake of US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick's claim on a podcast that the bilateral trade deal wasn't signed as PM Modi didn't call President Donald Trump, the Indian authorities have maintained that the deal could not materialise last summer due to the Trump administration's insistence on lowering tariffs on farm and dairy products and demands for allowing genetically modified products, which are ""no-go areas"" for govt. With New Delhi not agreeing to Trump's terms, US slapped a 50% tariff on Indian goods, citing Russian oil and defence imports, and has refused to move on fresh offers shared by India.Asked about the US president clearing a bill allowing up 500% tariff on countries importing Russian oil, MEA said India's energy policy was guided by market dynamics and securing energy from diverse sources to meet its requirements. In the past, govt has said that it is open to higher energy imports from US to address concerns over India having a large trade surplus.Lutnick had said on the podcast that India ""did not grab the opportunity the US presented"" and waited too long to conclude negotiations, only to later seek terms comparable to those secured by UK. By then, he said, the moment had passed.At the heart of Lutnick's explanation is what he called Trump's ""staircase"" model of trade negotiations - a strategy designed to reward speed and decisiveness while penalising hesitation.The first country to conclude a deal gets the most favourable terms, setting a baseline subsequent agreements must exceed. Each new deal, Lutnick said, moves ""up and to the right"", making later bargains more expensive or restrictive. ""The first stair gets the best,"" Lutnick explained. ""After that, everyone says, 'I want the UK deal.' And the answer is no - they were first.""UK, he said, moved quickly. Lutnick recalled telling British officials they had ""two Fridays"" to finalise the agreement. PM Keir Starmer, he said, personally called Trump as the deadline approached, and the deal was announced within days.India was given what Lutnick described as three Fridays - a ""shot clock (countdown timer)"". In that window, Trump signalled India could be next, a message Lutnick said was mea-nt to encourage urgency. ""I said, you've got to have Modi call the president,"" Lutnick recounted. ""They were uncomfortable doing so. Modi didn't call.""As the deadline passed, the administration moved on. Over the following weeks, Washington announced a series of trade deals across Asia, including with Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Those, Lutnick said, were negotiated at higher tariff and market-access levels than what India was offered, because the staircase had moved upward.When Indian officials later returned to the table, Lutnick said, they were seeking terms that no longer existed - effectively asking for a deal ""in between the UK and Vietnam"", which would have between 15% and 20% tariff. ""They said, 'But you agreed',"" Lutnick recalled. ""And I said, 'Then - not now'.""Lutnick framed India's predicament through an extended metaphor drawn from his early career as a trader, likening it to being stuck on the wrong side of a seesaw - a position where every move seems to make matters worse.Despite the sharp tone, Lutnick suggested the breakdown was not the result of hostility but of misaligned timing and domestic political constraints. He acknowledged trade negotiations are ""deeply complex"", often requiring parliamentary approval and consensus-building that can slow decision-making. Still, he emphasised that the Trump administration had little patience for delay. ""There are a lot of countries,"" Lutnick said, ""and each has its own deep internal politics. But the train doesn't wait.""The episode underscores a shift in US trade policy under Trump, one that prioritises leverage, speed and visible wins over protracted negotiations. Lutnick portrayed the president as the ultimate ""closer"", with himself as ""table setter"". While Lutnick expressed confidence US and India would ""work it out"", his remarks make clear any future agreement would come on less favourable terms. Trump, too, has not expressed any overt hostility towards India, insisting that the PM is a ""great guy"" and a ""good friend"".(Inputs from New Delhi)",US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick claimed on a podcast that the bilateral trade deal wasn't signed as PM Modi didn't call President Donald Trump.

Amit Shah Outlines Foolproof NIDMS Mechanism To Counter Future Terror Attacks

NEW DELHI: Asserting that the Modi govt over the past six years has created a next-generation shield against terrorism , home minister Amit Shah on Friday virtually inaugurated the National IED Data Management System (NIDMS) - a repository of data on attacks involving improvised explosive devices (IED), designed to aid investigation of terror blasts, analyse patterns and evolve deterrent strategies.Highlighting that the single-click access platform will connect with other security databases, Shah said NIDMS will serve as a two-way window, enabling anti-terror agencies like NIA, anti-terrorism squads, central armed police forces (CAPFs) and the state police forces to upload data on any blast or IED incident occurring within their jurisdiction, while also diving into the existing database - chronicling all bomb explosions since 1999 - for better investigation of terrorist incidents, understanding patterns regarding the modus operandi and explosives used and formulating effective strategies to deal with future blasts.Addressing the inauguration event at the NSG garrison in Manesar near Gurugram through video conferencing, Shah said that the Modi govt has, over the last six years, done significant work on creating varied security databases - CCTNS, which connects the country's 17,741 police stations; ICJS-2 that assimilates data from 22,000 courts; e-prisons database with records of over 2.2 crore prisoners; e-prosecution database on 2 crore prosecutions; e-forensics with 31 lakh samples and NAFIS that onboards over 1.2 crore fingerprints; and now NIDMS.Shah said work is underway to ensure that these databases don't exist is silos but ""talk to one another"".

‘India Will Not Be Anybody’s Vassal’: French President Macron’s Remark During Jaishankar Meet

NEW DELHI: Amid a shift in global power dynamics, India will back a rules-based global order while forging partnerships and strategies to secure its national interest, a top govt official said Friday.Delivering the inaugural Bibek Debroy Memorial Lecture, principal secretary to PM Shaktikanta Das said that India is adapting to the new alignment and reiterated the need to revitalise the multilateral system.""Today we stand at an inflection point where shifting geopolitical winds and trade policies are reshaping the global economic order. Traditional multilateralism, once a cornerstone of global governance, is under severe strain. It is increasingly being sidelined by geopolitical rivalries, protectionism and fragmentation. Key international institutions are struggling to deliver on their mandates. Institutions, which were once the bedrock of rules-based system, are underperforming in their core mandates,"" he said while pointing to disruption in supply chains and trade tensions.Das, however, argued that India was well placed to deal with the challenges thanks to a series of reforms undertaken in the last few years.""India stands today at the cusp of a historic journey - from being an 'Incredible India' to a credible India. There will be headwinds and challenges emanating from known and unknown sources. In the recent past, India has successfully emerged out of what appeared to be perfect storms caused by multiple global shocks since the Covid-19. And now with policies that the country has adopted, the wind is in our sails,"" he said.The former RBI governor listed out a raft of reforms - from GST, and its recent revamp, to the insolvency law, labour codes and RERA - to argue that there was a fundamental shift in the economy, which was resulting in faster economic expansion. He also said that India had managed to successfully pull back from the expansionary monetary and fiscal policy post-Covid, unlike a delay in several countries.Das said govt's push for atmanirbharta or self-reliance will enable the country to be an architect of global growth. ""Atmanirbharta is not being isolationist, but a strategy to build core competence and resilience. Economic Atmanirbharta means developing the capacity to produce critical goods and technologies at home and reducing over-reliance on foreign sources.""Atmanirbharta has two complementary dimensions: economic self-reliance and geopolitical autonomy. A self-reliant economy, with strong domestic capabilities, gives us greater strength to sustain our economic growth; and an autonomous foreign policy enables us to deal with the external environment in our best national interest. Together, they ensure that India's rise is resilient, sustainable, and beneficial to us and to the world,"" he said.Envisioning India 10 years from now, Das spoke of a young workforce highly skilled in digital tools; seamless transactions and innovations on a world-class digital infrastructure; economic activity increasingly getting formalised; and Indian-led innovations in AI, health, and space driving productivity gains.",Principal secretary to PM Shaktikanta Das said that India is adapting to the new alignment.

Amit Shah Outlines Foolproof NIDMS Mechanism To Counter Future Terror Attacks

NEW DELHI: In a significant escalation of govt's anti-narcotic approach, home minister Amit Shah on Friday announced a three-year war on drugs - set to commence on March 31 this year. Chairing the Narco-Coordination Centre (NCORD) meeting at Vigyan Bhawan, Shah reframed the drug menace as a matter of ""narco-terrorism"" rather than a mere law-and-order or crime issue, labelling it a strategic conspiracy to ""destroy the country's future generations"".To cement this offensive, Shah directed all govt departments to finalise a comprehensive ""Drug-Free India"" roadmap by 2029. ""As India targets 2047 for its centenary of independence, the administration views this upcoming three-year window as a critical inflection point to purge the nation's social fabric of narcotics and secure the health and performance of its youth,"" he said.Shah also informed that between 2014 and 2025, India seized drugs worth over Rs 1.71 lakh crore, a massive jump from the Rs 40,000 crore seized in the preceding decade. To sustain this momentum, the home ministry has now mandated the use of AI and advanced forensics to increase conviction rates and track evolving digital payment models used by international cartels.The minister asked officials to focus on the ""ruthless"" dismantling of supply chains and the financial backbones of drug kingpins.The central pillar of the 2026-2029 campaign is a ""three-pronged"" tactical approach involving a merciless crackdown on traffickers, a strategic push for demand reduction through awareness, and a humane, medical-first approach for harm reduction among users.""There should be no leniency for those who manufacture and sell drugs, but a humane approach must be adopted toward those who have fallen into usage,"" Shah said, clarifying govt's clear policy distinction between victims and perpetrators.He also directed state DGPs to transition into ""mission mode,"" creating permanent specialised teams to monitor intelligence and coordinate drug destruction efforts.By integrating Forensic Science Laboratories more deeply into the investigative process, govt aims at ensuring timely chargesheets and higher conviction rates. The deliberations also centered on the escalating challenges of darknet-based drug commerce and the illicit use of cryptocurrency.Shah emphasised that the anonymity of these digital platforms necessitates advanced technological interventions, including the deployment of darknet analysis tools and machine learning models to trace anonymous transactions and secure the country's borders against cyber-enabled trafficking.A major portion of the meeting was dedicated to disrupting the financial lifelines of narco-terror networks. The stakeholders discussed a ""360-degree investigation"" model, which integrates traditional law enforcement with forensic financial audits to target hawala operations and freeze assets tied to the drug trade.","Home minister Amit Shah announced a three-year war on drugs - set to commence on March 31 this year.

Explained: The land-for-jobs scam for which CBI raided RJD supremo Lalu Yadav and his family

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court Friday ordered framing of charges against RJD chief Lalu Prasad and 40 other accused in alleged land-for-jobs scam, observing that there existed ""an overarching criminal conspiracy, mentored by Lalu Prasad,"" in which he is accused of giving away railway jobs in exchange for land parcels from candidates during his tenure as railway minister from 2004 to 2009.The Rouse Avenue court held that ""public employment was being used as a bargaining chip"" by Lalu to receive immovable properties through his wife Rabri Devi and daughters. Opening the way for trial in the case, judge Vishal Gogne said Lalu, along with accused family members, appeared ""to be operating as a criminal enterprise aimed at usurping private land by bartering away government posts"".Rejecting pleas seeking discharge, the court said such arguments were ""completely unwarranted,"" particularly when ministry of railways was allegedly being ""lorded over as a personal fiefdom."" According to chargesheet filed by CBI, court noted, ""land parcels were transferred"" either in the name of Rabri Devi or other family members and close associates.The court recorded that several accused general managers of Indian Railways had emerged as having made appointments ""by abuse of their discretion,"" particularly by engaging Group D substitutes in violation of norms. However, with respect to chief personnel officers, the court held they were liable to be discharged as they ""neither possessed the discretion to make such appointments nor were they under the influence"" of ministry.","Delhi court orders framing of charges against RJD chief Lalu Prasad and 40 other accused in alleged land-for-jobs scam.

Gold February futures on MCX are trading near ₹1,37,800 after a sharp pullback from higher levels. The recent recovery attempt appears corrective in nature, with price facing strong resistance near the previous breakdown zone. Technical indicators suggest that upside momentum is losing steam, making higher levels vulnerable to fresh selling pressure. The intraday setup favors a sell-on-rise approach in the ₹1,37,800–₹1,38,000 range.Prices are trading below the short-term EMA cluster, with EMA 8 failing to sustain above EMA 21. This indicates weak short-term structure and suggests that rallies are likely to be sold into rather than extended.Gold has moved back toward the mid-Bollinger band after testing lower levels, but the upper band near ₹1,38,000 continues to act as a firm resistance. This positioning supports the view of capped upside in the near term.• Resistance Zone: ₹1,37,800 – ₹1,38,000• Support Levels: ₹1,36,800 followed by ₹1,36,400Failure to sustain above pivot resistance keeps the intraday bias tilted to the downside.RSI is around 60, indicating a short-term recovery but not strong enough to confirm trend reversal. This level often precedes consolidation or pullback when price approaches resistance.MACD has shown a brief positive crossover, but histogram bars are flattening, signaling waning bullish momentum. This increases the probability of a rollover from higher levels.The recovery has been accompanied by moderate volume, while open interest remains soft, hinting that the move lacks strong long buildup and is prone to reversal.• Strategy: Sell on rise• Sell Zone: ₹1,37,800 – ₹1,38,000• Stop-Loss: ₹1,39,100• Downside Target: ₹1,36,400• Bias: Bearish below ₹1,38,000; strength only above ₹1,39,100.Gold’s intraday technical structure remains vulnerable as prices trade below key moving averages and momentum indicators fail to confirm sustained strength. The resistance band near ₹1,38,000 is likely to attract selling pressure. Traders are advised to sell on rise around ₹1,37,800–₹1,38,000, keep a strict stop-loss at ₹1,39,100, and look for a move toward ₹1,36,400 during the session.","Gold price rally appears to be losing steam for now, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

A remark by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick blaming the lack of a personal phone call from PM Narendra Modi for the stalled India–US trade deal does not stand up to scrutiny and diverts attention from substantive policy differences, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said in a report released on Friday.In an interview on the All-In Podcast on January 8, Lutnick said the long-pending trade agreement failed to materialise because Prime Minister Modi did not personally call then US President Donald Trump to close the negotiations. According to Lutnick, by the time Modi agreed to make the call, the US had already moved on to concluding trade deals with Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, leaving India out of that sequence.However, GTRI noted that while the US did conclude agreements with those countries around July 2025, India–US trade negotiations continued well beyond that period. The report pointed out that multiple official-level engagements on market access, tariffs and regulatory issues took place after those deals were signed, undermining the claim that Washington had already decided there would be “no deal” with India at that stage.“If the absence of a leader-level phone call had decisively ended the negotiations in mid-2025, there would have been little reason for both sides to continue talks for months thereafter,” the report said, calling Lutnick’s explanation more of a retrospective justification than a contemporaneous reason.GTRI also said framing the impasse as a failure of personal diplomacy misunderstands how large trade agreements are concluded. Such deals hinge on convergence over policy issues including tariffs, agriculture, digital trade and regulatory autonomy, rather than symbolic gestures between leaders, it noted.The report concluded that the prolonged delay in the India–US trade deal reflects unresolved structural and policy disagreements rather than a missed phone call, warning that oversimplifying the issue risks trivialising one of the most significant trade relationships in the global economy.",US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick blamed the lack of a personal phone call from PM Narendra Modi for the stalled India–US trade deal.

Dubai cancels flights to Iran amid regional tensions and airspace concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/breaking-dubai-cancels-flights-to-iran-amid-regional-tensions-and-airspace-concerns/articleshow/126433793.cms,"Dubai cancels multiple flights to Iran amid regional disruptions / Image: file

Iran Burns As Protests Explode, Regime Elites Quietly Seek French Exit: Report

Dubai suspends key flight paths to Iran

Airline Status Impacted Cities flydubai 6 Flights Cancelled Tehran (IKA), Shiraz (SYZ), Mashhad (MHD) Emirates Transit Suspended Passengers starting from other cities cannot board for Iran. Air Arabia Reviewing Schedule Expect delays or short-notice cancellations for Sharjah routes.

The ""Transit Rule""

Why your flight was cancelled?

What travellers should do?

Check flight status before leaving for the airport: Airlines and airport authorities recommend confirming your scheduled flight online or via the airline’s app.

Stay updated with official notifications: Airlines often send updates via email or SMS, ensure your booking contact information is current.

Prepare for possible rebooking or refund: If a flight is cancelled, passengers usually qualify for free rebooking, changes, or full refunds under airline policies when cancellations are initiated by the carrier.

Monitor travel advisories: Government travel warnings and airspace updates may influence airline operations and security protocols, check with official sources before planning.





In a swift response to shifting regional dynamics, Friday, January 9, 2026, became a day of unexpected ""grounding"" for hundreds of travelers. At least six major flights scheduled to depart from Dubai to various Iranian hubs were abruptly cancelled.According to data from the Dubai Airports website, these cancellations aren't just minor delays; they represent a cautious, safety-first response to ""heightened regional uncertainty"" and ongoing civil unrest within Iran.The atmosphere at Dubai International (DXB) remains calm but busy as ground staff work to reroute passengers. For the ""common traveler,"" this means the usual hop across the Gulf has become a waiting game. These disruptions follow a pattern seen across the Middle East this week, where airlines like Turkish Airlines also scrapped seven flights to Tehran, signaling a broader industry-wide pivot toward caution as regional stability fluctuates.The cancellations have primarily targeted the most popular gateways into Iran. If you are flying with flydubai, a total of six flights have been officially removed from today's schedule.Emirates has taken a different approach, focusing on its transit network to manage the flow of passengers during this volatile window.For those traveling from London, Paris, or New York with a connection in Dubai to Iran, the rules have changed overnight. Emirates has officially stated that customers transiting through Dubai with a final destination in Iran, Iraq, or Jordan will not be accepted for travel at their original point of departure.This is a strategic move to prevent thousands of travelers from becoming ""stranded"" inside Dubai International Airport (DXB). If your ticket starts outside the UAE, your journey will likely be paused at your home airport until the regional safety assessment is cleared.The decision is purely a precautionary measure driven by ""heightened regional uncertainty"" and the need to ensure airspace safety. The primary driver behind today's cancellations is a massive wave of civil unrest sweeping through Iran.Since late December 2025, a sudden 30% devaluation of the Iranian Rial and soaring inflation sparked protests that have now spread to over 150 locations across 27 provinces, including Tehran, Isfahan, and Mashhad.This isn't just a local protest; it has evolved into a significant political challenge.Protesters have been seen chanting slogans like ""Not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran,"" expressing frustration over the government's focus on regional proxy conflicts while the domestic economy struggles.For airlines, flying into major cities where street battles and ""debris-strewn roads"" are being reported on state TV poses a high operational risk for both crews and passengers.If you’re planning to travel between Dubai (or other UAE airports) and Iran, here’s what you should do:Flight cancellations between Dubai and Iran highlight the importance of staying informed, checking live flight updates, and planning flexible travel arrangements. While some flights are resuming as airspace reopens, schedules can still be affected by regulatory decisions and safety precautions.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ However, he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

2026 brings no new tailwinds: Bernstein cuts India 2026 equity outlook to Neutral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/2026-brings-no-new-tailwinds-bernstein-cuts-india-2026-equity-outlook-to-neutral/articleshow/126447467.cms,"2026 brings no new tailwinds: Bernstein cuts India 2026 equity outlook to Neutral

Global brokerage firm Bernstein has revised its outlook on Indian equities to 'Neutral' from 'Selective Buy', citing stretched valuations, limited policy headroom, and a lack of fresh macro catalysts to drive outsized returns in 2026.According to Bernstein, 2026 brings no new tailwinds to Indian equity markets. By definition, a Neutral rating means that returns on investments are likely in line with broader market returns.The downgrade comes after several years of strong market performance fuelled by government-led capital expenditure, robust domestic inflows and optimism around the China+1 manufacturing narrative.In its India Strategy Outlook published recently, Bernstein said the Indian equity story is not turning negative but is instead entering a quieter phase.""Enter 2026, and the ink is beginning to run thin. In our view, this is not a crisis moment, but rather burdened by its own past. It's the year that promises many things: few rate cuts, a slight return of private capex, and a tentative trade deal - but we believe these ""little bits of everything"" do not carry enough momentum to keep the India story at heights we've been used to seeing,"" the Bernstein report read.""So we're cutting India from our selective buy view last year to a neutral view, not because the franchise has lost appeal, but because policy levers are largely exhausted and macro as reflected by real GDP growth is closer to a peak.""Bernstein highlighted that the government's aggressive post-pandemic capex cycle is nearing its limits.With fiscal deficits still elevated and tax collections relatively softened, room for further large-scale public spending is constrained, it noted.While another 50-75 basis points of rate cuts may be possible, analysts believe these would be insufficient to reignite strong momentum, especially as private sector capital expenditure remains subdued due to moderate capacity utilisation levels.Valuations were a central concern behind the downgrade by Bernstein.India remains among the most expensive equity markets globally, trading above 20 times forward P/E ratio, compared with an average of about 15 times across major economies tracked by Bernstein.In such an environment, the firm expects returns to be capped, with the Nifty 50 projected to deliver a modest 7.5 per cent return in 2026 for Nifty, with a target of 28,100.External risks also loom large. Bernstein flagged uncertainty around US trade policy, including the durability of any India-US trade framework, and warned that tighter H-1B visa norms could weigh on India's IT services sector.Overall, Bernstein said 2026 is likely to be a year of ""little bits of everything,"" but without a single dominant theme powerful enough to justify a firm market stance.Bernstein starts the year with continuing its overweight rating on financials, Telecom and select picks in consumption sectors (discretionary).""We move to a modest overweight on IT, as we see modest expectations. We introduce real estate as an overweight sector. IT and real estate were the worst performers in 2025. We downgrade consumer staples to equal-weight on staples given most catalysts have played their part already and given continued disruption risk as organized channels accelerate fund raise. We retain equal weight on metals, healthcare and utilities and stay underweight Industrials,"" the report stated.","Bernstein has revised its outlook on Indian equities to 'Neutral' from 'Selective Buy' The brokerage firm cited stretched valuations, limited policy headroom, and a lack of fresh macro catalysts to drive outsized returns in 2026.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126447471,imgsize-221700,width-400,resizemode-4/2026-brings-no-new-tailwinds-bernstein-cuts-india-2026-equity-outlook-to-neutral.jpg"

Q: We elect political representatives to a local body, but we can never pick a bureaucracy. Can you reform the bureaucracy at the lower levels in BMC?

A:







In an exclusive pre-poll interaction with the Times group on Friday, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis spoke on a range of subjects. Excerpts:Who understands Mumbai? One of the great names that comes up is the late Balasaheb Thackeray, but he was not born in Mumbai. His father Prabhodankar Thackeray too was not born in Mumbai. The understanding of Mumbai which Balasaheb Thackeray had, no one has. Those born in Mumbai administered the BMC for several years, what did they do? Mumbai may not be my janmabhoomi but it’s been my karmabhoomi since 1999.Though we are strong, taking the Shiv Sena along is our moral responsibility because today when we see the legacy of Balasaheb Thackeray, it is clearly with (Eknath) Shinde. In such circumstances it is not proper to fight against each other. Secondly, they have created a vote bank, we also have a big vote bank. It is a win-win situation for both. So when we sit for seat sharing talks, it’s a give-and-take. We compromised in KalyanDombivli; in Jalgaon we had won 57 seats earlier, but we settled for 47 seats.Why 2.5 years? We can give it to them for any number of years. We can give them the mayor's post for five years also.The mayor will be of the Mahayuti.Yes absolutely. This election has no effect on our alliance. We sat together and decided that in several municipal corporations we will contest separately because the entire political space is with us. Why should we concede political space to somebody else? That's our understanding. We are together till 2029 and hopefully thereafter also.We carefully thought it over before forming an alliance with the NCP. In one city when we come face to face, I have decided not to speak against our alliance partners. He does speak but Ajit Pawar is a practical person. He knows where to go forward, where to step back, stay flexible… we live in political realism. In 2019 all came together and distanced us....we were the single largest party and they still made us sit in the opposition. If we simply sit with our principles then in our lifetime we will never come to power to implement our principles. Therefore, we made some compromises.After every election a new generation (of political workers) is created. This happened in 2017 and then in 2022 but there were no elections in between. So now there are two generations of party workers and the number of seats is constant. For every seat there are four contenders and whosoever is given a seat, others feel betrayed. Earlier it would not come out in the media. But that is not a bad thing. Women have become assertive. There is 50% reservation for women, but 55% seats have been given to women.It was 100% wrong. Sometimes what happens is local leaders have their enemies and artificially you cannot bring them together. In Ambernath, our party president who was elected, Sena candidates fought against his family members and the enmity is very strong. I had made it clear: wherever required, go with Shinde Sena or NCP, but here they decided not to go with Sena. Some of those elected on Congress tickets are BJP rebels and came back (to BJP). Congress pre-empted them by removing them from the party. Even the alliance with AIMIM was wrong. In Akot, our nagar president was elected. We needed 2-3 people for a majority. We did an alliance with the NCP which had an alliance with the AIMIM. Technically they (AIMIM) became our alliance partners. The people at the lower level do not realise the repercussions. As soon as I learnt of it, I told them to break it and we even served suspension notices.If muscle and money power were being used, it would have happened in Mumbai also. Maximum unopposed elections happened in Kalyan-Dombivli because…Congress has been wiped out there, so also NCP. Even an Islamic party independent candidate got elected unopposed there. We are such big parties and we had no candidate against him.The DCPR-2034 takes care of every aspect. All DP roads will be concretised. We have a new design for footpaths. Mumbai is landlocked and there is no option but to go vertical but there is a limit to it. All global cities have used this strategy. For BMC a platform for clearing building proposals using artificial intelligence is on the way. Unlike Auto DCR where 4-5 human interventions are required and there is human subjectivity, on this platform it won’t happen. The proposal will be scrutinised by AI, flag provisions that are not as per DCPR, and even provide a 3D model of the project. Using technology we shall try to make it transparent.Ease of living comes from ease of commuting, which means you need clean means of transportation and so we have planned over 400 kms of metro. Improved suburban railway services, improved frequency of trains, passenger amenities are being provided with 50% funding by the state. For second class passengers, the train fare will remain the same. We have also introduced electric buses, new roads which will decongest Western Express Highway. The Worli-Sewri connector will be ready by Dec 2026. To clean up sewage flowing into the sea, treatment plants have got approvals.Whatever happened in Mahul was a scam. All those who are eligible will be rehabilitated in Dharavi. Those ineligible, if we simply remove them, then that is no solution because they will settle elsewhere. So we decided to provide them 12 years of rental housing in different places, thus abiding by the court order. One of the places is the dumpyard…in Nagpur there is a Symbiosis and next to it is the NM campus. Both have come up on Nagpur's dumping yard. We did bio-mining, capping and reclaimed the land. There is no smell, no gases.We are in talks with the Centre for redevelopment of slums on central govt. For airport land we have almost convinced the Centre that if slums are redeveloped in-situ then we shall free up 50-100 acres. Our efforts are on for railways as well. They will never be able to remove all the slums on railway land. But as long as railways has enough and a little more for its projects, it should do.It is a challenge. They know we (politicians) are around only for 5 years…we are working on inter-corporation staff transfers – from Thane to Pune, etc – but there is no other corporation in the state of the size and scale of the BMC.","Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis spoke on a range of subjects.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

He continues to receive treatment at AIIMS for neurological complications, plastic surgery and eye procedures. According to his family, long wait for appointments, limited clinic hours and difficulty accessing specialists have made the process exhausting.

They are still not released, and insurance companies are not settling the claims,” he said.Randhawa added that the matter was raised repeatedly with Delhi govt, but compensation for the injured remains pending.","Two months after a blast near the Red Fort injured over 30 people, 10 survivors said the promised compensation has still not reached them.

‘India Outperforming Emerging Markets’: Economist On India's 7.4% FY26 GDP Growth Estimates

India's economy is expected to remain one of the fastest-growing major economies globally, with growth projected at 7.4 per cent in 2025, according to the United Nations' World Economic Situation and Prospects 2026 report.Speaking after the report's release, UN Country Economist for India Chris Garroway said the growth projection aligns with India's strong recent performance, noting that the figure coincides with the advance estimates released this week by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) for fiscal year 2025-26.The UN expects India's growth momentum to moderate slightly in the coming years, with economic expansion projected at 6.6 per cent in 2026, followed by a marginal uptick to 6.7 per cent in 2027.According to the UN report, India's robust growth outlook is underpinned by strong private consumption and the front-loading of exports in the previous year. However, the UN anticipates some softening in export performance next year as new tariffs take effect.The report also highlights domestic policy measures as key contributors to sustained growth. Tax reforms and monetary easing have supported economic activity, while continued government spending on infrastructure, defence, digitalisation, and renewable energy has boosted fixed capital formation across the economy.""These numbers are supported by assumptions of strong private consumption, as well as the front loading of exports last year, and an expected dip in the coming year as tariffs come into place. The report also cites tax reforms and monetary easing in India as one of the reasons for the continued strong growth. The report also refers to important government spending on infrastructure, defence, digital and renewable energy projects, all of which boosted fixed capital formation in the country,"" Garroway said.According to the World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) 2026, released by the United Nations earlier this week, the economic growth in India is projected to moderate from an estimated 7.4 per cent in 2025 to 6.6 per cent in 2026. Resilient household spending, strong public investment, and lower interest rates are expected to underpin economic activity.While higher US tariffs may weigh on select product categories, key export segments are likely to remain largely unaffected. Moreover, strong demand from other major markets is expected to partially offset the impact, the UN report had asserted.Trade policy uncertainty is a key near-term risk, even though recent US tariff increases on Asian economies were smaller than initially anticipated and some trade agreements have been reached.Against that backdrop, the report underscored that navigating an era of trade realignments, persistent price pressures, and climate-related shocks will demand deeper global coordination and decisive collective action at a time when geopolitical tensions are rising, policies are becoming more inward-looking, and impetus towards multilateral solutions is weakening.","India's economy is expected to remain one of the fastest-growing major economies globally, with growth projected at 7.4% in 2025.

How social media takes things out of context

America's evolving caste debate





Current Ohio gubernatorial candidate and former Republican presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy recently went into a social media exile, announcing his decision to quit his personal social media accounts on X (Formerly Twitter) and Instagram. Citing the reasons that modern social media is becoming ""increasingly disconnected from the electorate"" and the messages being ""negative and bombastic,"" he shared the decision in an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal on Monday.At the same time, an excerpt from his 2021 book 'Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam' has resurfaced on Twitter and has been circulating all over the social media app. A post on the app, shared a photo of the excerpt written back in the day, highlighting Ramaswamy's description of Indian caste society and his experience with it. What followed was a familiar social media cycle: selective emphasis, rising outrage, and a narrative that quickly hardened into accusation.""Did you know that @VivekGRamaswamy was born into the highest caste of Indian, so special even royalty is below him? That his childhood servants can't walk through the same doors as him? That he wears a magic rope ""Poonal"" so he can be special even when naked?,"" called out the post, inciting numerous X users into criticising the politician.The post, which has received 94.3K views on the social media app, had parts of the excerpt strategically underlined to create a narrative where Ramaswamy boasted of himself being Brahmin, the highest caste in the Hindu society and that the people who provided service to his family were of the lower caste and entered the house through different gates. That every person who was a part of the society understood its values and principles. It portrays Ramaswamy as an extremely proud casteist, thus leading to comments such as: ""talking about discrimination with zero knowledge"" and "" Vivek is quite literally the worst type of human.""The book which the excerpt belongs to was published back in 2021 and was Ramaswamy's debut as an author. What the post described as a casteist lens is actually an attempt to explain a larger subject through a more comprehensible and personal anecdote.'Woke, Inc.' is a book about American corporate identity politics and caste is used as an illustrative example, not the subject. In the writing, Ramaswamy clearly explains how hierarchy does not always align with wealth or power across societies.He gives the example of an Indian society, mentioning the four castes, Brahmins the priests, Kshatriyas the kings, Vaishyas the commercial class and Shudras the service caste.He added that caste was a description of social and occupational hierarchy. Brahmins were obligated to pursue knowledge, which didn't come with money or political power. Thus, his grandfather worked as a farm manager, his father as an engineer and his uncle as a doctor. Social customs required the caste to wear a sacred string, Poonal, which was a cultural marker of caste, not a symbol of power.He shared the anecdote of his domestic help who lived with them like relatives and was respected just like family members, unbeknownst as a child that they belonged to a said lower caste. The distinction, he argues, was social rather than economic, a legacy of inherited norms rather than personal animus.It was these social values that led to the formation of rules. They were unfair, but for the people at the time they were associated with a 'proper understanding of the world'.Higher social rank did not mean an escape from the economic troubles for anyone who was a part of the society. The excerpt was a description, not the norm. But reading only the underlined parts of it could have anyone carrying a brick and walking towards the political leader.Numerous times social media screenshots are taken out of context, especially when they are targeted at non-Indian audiences who lack the social context. Explanations are reduced to screenshots, writings to advocacy and context disappears.Caste has become politicised in parts of the US, especially California. Back in 2023, Senate Bill 403 or SB403 was passed by the state legislature to explicitly ban caste discrimination. Although the bill was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom, it reflected growing concern about caste dynamics within South Asian immigrant communities, by adding caste as a protected class to the state's existing anti-discrimination laws.The same year Seattle became the first US city to outlaw caste discrimination with followed by Fresno. As per activists, the issue is more prominent in Americans of Indian descent and Hindus. Since most of them move to Silicon Valley and California, these places confront the issue of caste discrimination.But is it true? A 2018 report from Equality Labs, a California-based non-profit, stated that 25% of Dalit respondents said they had faced verbal or physical assault based on their caste; 50% of Dalits live in fear of their caste being outed; 67% reported being treated unfairly at their workplace.However, the survey was web-based, self-reported, and conducted among respondents already engaged with anti-caste advocacy.By contrast, a report by the Carnegie Foundation and YouGov, found only 1% of Hindu Indian Americans who identified themselves with a caste were Dalit. 80% of Hindus in America who identified with a caste, are upper caste.

Q. Who needs an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) to travel to the UK?

Q. When does the ETA requirement become compulsory?

Q. What should UK visa holders using physical documents or expired BRP cards do?

Q. What must travellers with an existing e-visa do before travelling?





Planning a trip to the United Kingdom from the UAE will soon require more than just a passport and ticket. Emirates has warned travellers that the UK is rolling out major changes to its immigration system, and missing a new digital requirement could mean being denied boarding altogether.Dubai-based Emirates has issued an official advisory for UAE residents traveling to the United Kingdom, urging them to familiarize themselves with new British entry requirements as the country transitions to a fully digital immigration system.According to the airline, the UK authorities are replacing physical immigration documents with electronic visas, known as e-visas, and introducing the Electronic Travel Authorisation, or ETA. The ETA is a digital permission to travel and will be mandatory for certain visitors who previously did not require a visa.These changes apply across multiple traveller categories and are being phased in ahead of a firm enforcement deadline.Emirates clarified that travellers who do not need a visa for short stays in the UK of up to six months will now need to obtain an Electronic Travel Authorisation.Passengers can check whether they need an ETA and apply through the official UK government website at www.gov.uk/electronic-travel-authorisation.The airline highlighted a critical date tied to this requirement. From February 25, 2026, eligible visitors who do not hold a valid ETA will not be allowed to board their transport and will not be able to legally travel to the United Kingdom.Emirates strongly advised customers to apply well in advance of their flight date to avoid disruptions at the airport.The advisory also targets travellers who already hold UK visas but rely on physical documents to prove their immigration status.According to Emirates, passengers who use paper immigration documents, or those who have an expired biometric residence permit (BRP) or biometric residence card (BCP), must take immediate steps to access their digital immigration status.These travellers are required to create an account with UK Visas and Immigration to convert their status to an eVisa. This can be done at www.gov.uk/eVisa.The airline emphasized that relying on outdated or physical documents could cause problems during travel as the UK moves away from paper-based verification.Emirates also addressed travellers who hold indefinite leave to remain in the UK. Passengers who currently prove their ILR status using a passport stamp or vignette are eligible to apply for a free No Time Limit application in order to access an e-visa.For travellers who already have an e-visa, the airline stressed the importance of keeping passport details up to date. If the passport intended for travel is not already linked to the eVisa account, travelers must notify UK authorities through www.gov.uk/update-uk-visas-immigration-account-details.Failing to update passport information could result in delays or complications during boarding or entry into the UK.Travelers who do not require a visa for short stays in the UK of up to six months must obtain an Electronic Travel Authorisation before travelling.From February 25, 2026, eligible visitors without a valid ETA will not be allowed to board their transport or legally travel to the United Kingdom.They must create a UK Visas and Immigration account to access their immigration status digitally through an e-visa.They must ensure the passport they intend to use is linked to their UK Visas and Immigration e-visa account and update it if necessary.","Emirates has issued an official advisory for UAE residents traveling to the UK.

'Embarrassingly obvious': H-1B spouses sue US over ending automatic work permit extensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/embarrassingly-obvious-h-1b-spouses-sue-us-over-ending-automatic-work-permit-extensions/articleshow/126443276.cms,"U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH





A new lawsuit filed by the spouses of H-1B visa holders has challenged the new US rule of ending the automatic extension of work permits. On October 29, 2025, the US Department of Homeland Security issued an interim final rule that ends the practice of automatically extending EADs for certain individuals who apply for renewal. The lawsuit said it violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it was arbitrary and capricious and failed to establish good cause for skipping notice and comment rulemaking, Bloomberg reported.The intention behind the new rule was more screening and vetting, the USCIS said in October. “USCIS is placing a renewed emphasis on robust alien screening and vetting, eliminating policies the former administration implemented that prioritized aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security,” said USCIS director Joseph Edlow. “It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate vetting and screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorization or documentation is extended. All aliens must remember that working in the United States is a privilege, not a right.”Under the new rule, individuals have to seek a timely renewal by properly filing a renewal application up to 180 days before their EAD expires. The longer an alien waits to file an EAD renewal application, the more likely it is that they may experience a temporary lapse in their employment authorization or documentation, the USCIS said.The lawsuit said the true rationale behind the move is embarrassingly obvious. “The administration’s true rationale, stripping the ability of people lawfully in the US to sustain themselves, is embarrassingly obvious,” it said.Although it failed to complete a rule ending work permits entirely for H-1B spouses, the administration “accomplished the same end by creating processing burdens, and pretextual biometric collections,” according to the suit.Spouses of H-1B visa holders are admitted on H-4 visa s to the US. They can only seek work permits after their spouse on an H-1B visa completes the initial steps to secure a permanent immigrant visa. For H-4 visa holders, the timeline for renewing can be even tighter because their legal status and employment authorization must coincide with their spouse’s status.","A new lawsuit filed by the spouses of H-1B visa holders has challenged the new US rule of ending the automatic extension of work permits.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

"India, Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations: All about the 1988 agreement; what purpose does it serve — explained",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/india-pakistan-exchange-list-of-nuclear-installations-all-about-the-1988-agreement-what-purpose-does-it-serve-explained/articleshow/126285395.cms,"What the agreement says



Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump





ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

Bangladesh Slipping Into Pakistan’s Pocket: Sushant Sareen Warns India Of New Eastern Security Front





Bangladesh’s national airline will resume nonstop flights between Dhaka and Karachi later this month, restoring direct air links between Bangladesh and Pakistan after a gap of more than 10 years, officials said on Wednesday.Biman Bangladesh Airlines will begin operating the Dhaka–Karachi service from January 29.Initially, the airline will run two flights a week, on Thursdays and Saturdays, Bengali daily Prothom Alo reported, citing a press release from Biman.According to the schedule shared by the airline, the flight will leave Dhaka at 8 pm local time and reach Karachi at 11 pm.The return service will depart Karachi at midnight and land in Dhaka at 4.20 am.Direct flights between the two cities were last operated in 2012.News portal tbsnews.net, quoting Biman officials, said discussions with Pakistani aviation authorities had been underway for several months to reopen the route. The relaunch has now received formal clearance from the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority, which has approved Biman to operate flights and use designated air corridors within Pakistani airspace.The move comes amid improving ties between Dhaka and Islamabad following the fall of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s government in 2024.Since then, both sides have taken steps to rebuild diplomatic, trade and people-to-people relations after years of strained ties. Bangladesh became independent from Pakistan in 1971.However, it remains unclear whether Bangladesh has obtained overflight permission from India, as the shortest air route between Dhaka and Karachi passes through Indian airspace, according to news agency PTI.In a statement, Biman said the new service is expected to make travel between Bangladesh and Pakistan “easier and more convenient” and could also support business, tourism and family travel.The airline added that the flights will be operated using modern aircraft and experienced crews.As per bdnews24.com, the aerial distance between Dhaka and Karachi is around 2,370 km. Currently, passengers travelling between the two cities have to rely on connecting flights via Middle Eastern hubs.Airlines such as Emirates, Qatar Airways, Flydubai, Gulf Air and Air Arabia operate these services, with total travel times ranging from eight to 12 hours, and sometimes extending to over 18 hours due to long layovers.Plans to revive direct air connectivity were first announced in August last year during the visit of Pakistan’s deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar to Dhaka.His trip marked the first high-level visit from Pakistan to Bangladesh in more than a decade, reported PTI.","Biman Bangladesh Airlines will begin operating the Dhaka–Karachi service from January 29.

LONDON: Individuals from white British and Indian ethnic groups have seen substantial increases in median wealth in Britain since 2012, whilst the wealth of those of Pakistani ethnicity has seen a marked decline, a new report from the London School of Economics (LSE) shows.Individuals from Asian Other and white Other ethnic groups also experienced substantial increases in median wealth from 2012/2014 up to 2021/2023, In contrast, wealth among individuals from the Pakistani ethnic group dropped sharply and black African, black Caribbean, and Bangladeshi ethnic groups remained with “almost no accumulated household wealth throughout”, it said.The largest gains were experienced by the Indian and Asian Other groups, with median wealth rising by £93,000 for the Indian ethnic group.UK-born adults from the Indian group “have a clear wealth advantage” over both non-UK-born Indians and the white British group, it said.The report, titled “The Ethnic Wealth Divide in the UK: Mapping Disparities Across Time, Age and Immigrant Generations”, by Eleni Karagiannaki, research fellow at LSE, used data from the UK Household Longitudinal Survey to show how ethnic wealth gaps have widened in 24-month periods from 2012/14 to 2021/2023.Adults from Pakistani, Bangladeshi, black Caribbean, and black African ethnic groups reported significantly lower savings than those from the white British, Other Asian, and Indian ethnic groups, with PIOs recording the highest levels. More than 50% of adults among the Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and black African groups had no savings.Whilst white British, white other, and Indian individuals are more likely to move up from the bottom quartile, Pakistani and black African individuals are more vulnerable to downward mobility from the top, it said.In 2012/14, adults in the white British, Indian, and Asian Other groups already had higher rates of home and investment ownership compared to other groups. By 2021/23, these gaps had widened further, as these groups increased ownership while Bangladeshi, black Caribbean, and Pakistani groups saw sharp declines, particularly in home ownership.“Indian and white British groups typically experience steadier income growth across the life-course, enabling earlier asset accumulation. Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups exhibit the widest income gaps relative to the white British group than any ethnic minority group,” it said.","Individuals from white British and Indian ethnic groups have seen substantial increases in median wealth in Britain since 2012.

China’s Condom Tax Shocks the World Amid Birthrate Drop as India Surges Ahead in Population Rankings

From birth control to pro-natal push

Subsidies fall short of family costs





China has begun taxing condoms and other contraceptives, ending a three-decade exemption as the government intensifies efforts to reverse a deepening demographic decline. From January 1, condoms and contraceptive pills are subject to a 13% value-added tax, the standard rate applied to most consumer goods, according to Reuters.The move marks another sharp turn in Beijing’s population policy as China struggles to lift birth rates in the world’s second-largest economy. The population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, and experts have warned the decline is likely to continue. Last year, China recorded just 9.54 million births, roughly half the number seen in 2016, the year the one-child policy formally ended.China’s leadership has repeatedly linked population decline to long-term economic risks, with officials warning the country could “get old before it gets rich” as the population ages rapidly. Nearly 310 million people in China were aged 60 and above in 2024.The decision to tax contraceptives highlights the scale of Beijing’s policy reversal. When China’s population neared one billion in the late 1970s, then leader Deng Xiaoping introduced the one-child policy, enforced through fines, surveillance and, in some cases, forced abortions and sterilisation.That approach remained in place for decades before being loosened to allow two children in 2016 and three in 2021.Despite those changes, birth rates continued to fall, driven by rising living costs, rapid urbanisation and changing social attitudes.Now, authorities are promoting marriage and childbirth as national priorities. Colleges and universities have been urged to offer “love education” portraying marriage, fertility and family life positively. At last month’s Central Economic Work Conference, top leaders again pledged to promote “positive marriage and childbearing attitudes” to stabilise population growth.Alongside taxing contraceptives, Beijing has rolled out cash incentives.
