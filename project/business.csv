Chanda Kochhar got Rs 64 crore bribe to OK Videocon loan: Tribunal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chanda-kochhar-got-rs-64-crore-bribe-to-ok-videocon-loan-tribunal/articleshow/122801576.cms,"Chanda Kochhar

NEW DELHI: Holding Chanda Kochhar , former CEO of ICICI Bank , guilty of receiving bribes of Rs 64 crore through her husband from Videocon group, an appellate tribunal here in an order dated July 3 observed that the money was paid as quid-pro-quo for sanctioning a loan of Rs 300 crore to the Videocon group.“The history given by the appellants (ED) has been narrated and supported by the evidence in the light of the reference of the statements under Section 50 of the PMLA Act which are admissible and can be relied upon. The allegation made by the appellants stands because on paper ownership of NRPL is shown to be of V N Dhoot (CMD of Videocon group) but according to him also, the entire control of the company was of Deepak Kochhar (Chanda Kochhar’s husband). Thus, the allegations were made for quid-pro-quo to Chanda Kochhar for sanction of loan to Videocon group of industries,” the tribunal said in its order.The appellate tribunal slammed the adjudicating authority that had earlier in Nov 2020 given relief to the accused in releasing the attached assets worth Rs 78 crore.“The adjudicating authority has ignored the material facts while drawing the conclusions which are coming out on the face of the record and, therefore, we cannot endorse the finding of the adjudicating authority going against the record and ignoring the relevant facts.Thus, we find substance in the allegation of the appellants for quid-pro-quo to Chanda Kochhar for sanction of loan of Rs 300 crore to Videocon group and thereupon, a sum of Rs 64 crore was transferred to NRPL, a company managed by Deepak Kochhar and, in fact, he was the managing director of the said company. The factual issues narrated above clarifies that the appellants have taken up the matter to justify the attachment of the property,” the tribunal said, justifying the ED’s attachments.The tribunal noted that the sanction of a loan of Rs 300 crore by ICICI Bank to the Videocon group where Chanda Kochhar remained part of the committee was against the rules and policy of the bank. “The issue remains about the transfer of Rs 64 crore by Videocon group through its entity SEPL to NRPL day after the disbursement of loan by ICICI Bank,” it said while validating the evidence produced by the ED.

NEW DELHI: The new alternative 130-km road to the country's strategically located Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) military outpost in eastern Ladakh is now in the final stages of construction in the forbidding high-altitude region, with the entire stretch likely to be fully operational by Oct-Nov next year.The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has been working hard to complete this much-needed alternative road to the crucial sector - which includes Depsang Plains where Indian and Chinese troops disengaged in Oct last year - from Sasoma in the Nubra Valley through Saser Brangsa to the DBO outpost, as reported by TOI earlier. DBO, which includes an advance landing ground (ALG) at an altitude of 16,614 feet, overlooks the Karakoram Pass and is just a few km from the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the China-occupied Aksai Chin region.All connectivity work from Sasoma to Saser Brangsa on the new road, including black-topping, and around 60%-70% of it eastwards towards Murgo and Gapshan has been completed by BRO, said sources.""Some heavy military equipment, including artillery guns like Bofors, have been moved on the completed stretches to test their load-carrying capacity. The entire 130-km road (Sasoma-Saser La-Saser Brangsa-Gapshan-DBO) should be ready by Oct-Nov 2026,"" a source said.It will enhance the capacity to move soldiers, weapons and logistics faster to the frontier. A seven-km tunnel under Saser La (La means pass), which is at an altitude of 17,660 feet, is also planned for all-weather connectivity.The People's Liberation Army will not be able to easily track military movements on the new road, unlike the existing 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-DBO road that runs almost parallel to the LAC before ending around 20 km short of the Karakoram Pass.

NMC again threatens action against medical colleges not paying stipend,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-again-threatens-action-against-medical-colleges-not-paying-stipend/articleshow/122802244.cms,"Representative image

National Medical Commission (NMC) has yet again issued a public notice threatening to take action against medical colleges that do not pay stipends to interns and resident doctors.With no evidence of any action being taken after similar threats in 2023 and 2024, it remains to be seen whether change in chairman of the commission leads to action this time.Three months back, NMC had threatened to impose Rs 50,000 as penalty on medical colleges which save several crores of rupees every year by not paying stipend. NMC’s regulations stipulate that all medical colleges have to pay interns and resident doctors stipend equivalent to what state govt medical colleges are paying.Just three days before the latest public notice dated July 11, NMC had issued another notice shifting the responsibility of addressing grievances of medical students to medical colleges, universities and directorates of medical education of the respective states. Yet, it is now threatening to take action including imposition of financial penalties, withdrawal of course recognition and suspension of admissions.The latest notice reminded medical colleges that, in keeping with SC order of April 29, all private and deemed universities must disclose detailed information regarding tuition fees, hostel charges, caution deposits and all miscellaneous charges at pre-counselling stage. Citing another order of SC in 2022 and the commission’s own regulations, it said payment of stipend was mandatory.NMC threatened that non-compliance would attract action under Establishment of Medical Institutions, Assessment and Rating Regulations, 2023, Maintenance of Standards of Medical Education Regulations, 2023, and Post Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2023. It added that these measures to ensure payment of stipend and for disclosure of various kinds of fees well before counselling were “a part of NMC’s commitment to fostering fair, ethical and transparent practices in medical education across the country”.In April 2023, NMC did a survey among medical college students on stipend being paid to them. An RTI query to NMC revealed the survey showed that over 60 colleges were not paying stipend, while about 50 were paying less than Rs 5,000 a month.In Aug 2023, NMC issued “an advisory” to all colleges regarding payment of stipend. With SC cracking down on NMC regarding non-payment of stipend, in Nov 2024, the commission issued show cause notices to 198 medical colleges for failing to submit stipend payment data.NMC has written to colleges threatening “strict action” in Aug 2023, Nov 2024 and now on July 11, 2025. Yet, there is no record of any action being taken against any college for non-payment of stipend till now.",National Medical Commission (NMC) has yet again issued a public notice threatening to take action against medical colleges.

NEW DELHI: From now on, those filing bail petitions before any court will be required to disclose their criminal antecedents to enable the judge to take a holistic view of the nature of the person and consider whether he/she can pose danger to society on release from jail.A Supreme Court bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta said that it would be appropriate for all high courts to amend their rules and adopt the Punjab and Haryana high court model which mandates bail applicants to disclose their criminal antecedents.The Punjab and Haryana high court rules on bail application state: ""In every application for bail presented to the high court, the petitioner shall state whether similar application has or has not been made to Supreme Court, and if made shall state the result thereof. The petitioner/applicant shall also mention whether he/she is/was involved in any other criminal case or not. If yes, particulars and decisions thereof. An application which does not contain this information shall be placed before the bench with the necessary information.""The bench said, ""We feel that every high court in the country should consider incorporating a similar provision in the respective high court rules and/or criminal side rules as it would impose an obligation on the accused to make disclosures regarding his/her involvement in any other criminal case(s) previously registered.""Asking the SC registry to send a copy of the judgment to registrars general of all high courts to enable incorporation of a rule on the lines of Punjab and Haryana HC, the bench said, ""Accounting for criminal antecedents of the accused while considering bail applications has been the subject matter of concern for courts across the country.""This direction came in a case where a magistrate was misled to grant bail to the main accused in a criminal case by making him believe that Rajasthan high court had granted bail to a co-accused. The HC had granted bail to an accused who was charged with a lesser offence in the case. While overturning the magistrate's order, the HC had strictured the judicial officer.On an appeal by the judicial officer, Supreme Court said the strictures were uncalled for as it was done without calling for an explanation from the judicial officer, which is a breach of the principle of natural justice.","Supreme Court bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta said it would be appropriate for all high courts to adopt the Punjab and Haryana high court model.

Cardiac medication sales shoot up 50% in five years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cardiac-medication-sales-shoot-up-50-in-five-years/articleshow/122801987.cms,"Representative photo

7 lakh die of sudden cardiac arrest in a year

MUMBAI: India's heart disease burden is evident not only from the spate of heart attacks among young celebrities in the past five years, but also in the over-50% rise in cardiac medication sale in the same period.Be they lipid-lowering drugs, heart-failure medications or anti-anginal treatments, cardiac medications sell more than drugs meant for any complications, including the gastro-intestinal tract, infections or diabetes.According to June report of Pharmarack, which analyses sales figures from 17 prominent Indian pharmaceutical companies representing more than half of the sector, sales of cardiac medicines rose from Rs 1,761 crore in June 2021 to Rs 2,645 crore by June 2025. There has been a consistent yearly growth rate of 10.7% in this sector, showed the report.Experts offer a slew of reasons for this rise, ranging from better awareness of heart diseases, new parameters for measuring hypertension as well as the increasing population of senior citizens. “There is no doubt that cardiovascular diseases are on the rise, but at the same time, access to care and diagnostic tools has improved,"" said Dr Ajay Mahajan, head of the cardiology department at KEM Hospital.Centre's data suggests that 63% of total deaths in the country were due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) accounting for 27%.Dr Suraj Nagre, associate professor at JJ Hospital's cardiovascular and thoracic surgery department, offers another reason: “A few years ago, the threshold for hypertension was a reading of 130-140. Medical guidelines have since changed and even readings above 120 are considered hypertensive.”While heart care until a few years back mainly meant lipid-lowering medications, the prescriptions for other drugs meant to control unstable heart rhythm or heart failure have also increased. “Cardiovascular medications are interrelated because they target different but connected pathways of disease,” said senior cardiac surgeon Dr Ramakanta Panda. “For example, anti-hypertensives lower blood pressure to reduce the strain on arteries and the heart. Lipid-lowering drugs like statins reduce cholesterol helping prevent arterial blockages. Anti-anginals improve blood flow to the heart muscle, relieving chest pain caused by narrowed arteries. These medications are often prescribed together,"" said Dr Panda.Referring to the frequent reports of cardiac arrest deaths among common people as well as celebrities and fitness enthusiasts, KEM cardiologist Dr Charan Lanjewar said underlying factors are almost always involved. “There’s a lack of data to identify a single cause in many cardiac arrest cases. The reasons are multifactorial, but lifestyle, stress, and consumption habits play a vital role,” Dr Lanjewar said.The aging population is more prone to heart conditions. Senior cardiologist Dr Akshay Mehta said, “The lifespan of the Indian population has increased and with a growing aging population, we are seeing a higher incidence of heart disease. Along with rising incidence, we also have better diagnostic tools now.”","Sales of cardiac medicines rose from Rs 1,761 crore in June 2021 to Rs 2,645 crore by June 2025.

"Chandra Barot, original ‘Don’ director, passes away at 86",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chandra-barot-original-don-director-passes-away-at-86/articleshow/122800796.cms,"Mumbai: Film director Chandra Barot , best known for the blockbuster classic, Don (1978), which prompted multiple remakes in southern languages and spawned a series of sequels decades later, passed away due to medical complications at Guru Nanak Hospital in Bandra (east) on Sunday. He was 86.""My husband was suffering from pulmonary fibrosis for the past seven years. He died due to a cardiac arrest at 6.30 am,'' his wife Deepa Barot told TOI.Barot also directed the Bengali superhit, ‘Ashrita' (1990), starring Mithu Mukherjee.Barot's family lived in Tanzania, but was forced to come back to India following racial conflicts in the East African country in the 1960s. His sister, Kamal Barot, was a playback singer in Bollywood. He assisted Bollywood biggie Manoj Kumar in films such as 'Purab Aur Pachhim', 'Shor' and 'Roti Kapada Aur Makaan'.The making of the original ‘Don' is a legendary Bollywood tale. Barot's cinematographer-producer friend, Nariman Irani, was reeling under a debt of nearly Rs 12 lakh after his first film as producer, 'Zindagi Zindagi', had flopped. Barot offered to help. He was friendly with Amitabh Bachchan and Zeenat Aman having worked with them in 'Roti Kapada Aur Makaan'.They all decided to work in ‘Don' to help Irani. Tragically, Irani passed away in 1977, before Don could hit the screen. Amitabh Bachchan, who won the Best Actor Filmfare award, dedicated the award to Irani and his wife.In the 1970s, 'Don' was an unusual title for Hindi films. Barot's mentor, Manoj Kumar, had asked him with a quizzical tone if he was making some film called ``Down''! Barot explained that it was a Spanish word `Don' which actually meant `gentleman'. Kumar understood and suggested that the pacy second-half needed a song. The advice led to the birth of the chartbuster, ‘Khai ke paan Benaraswala.'Don, which celebrated platinum jubilee, was remade in Tamil as Billa (1980) with Rajinikanth as hero. A year earlier, NT Rama Rao was the lead in Yugandhar, the film's Telugu version. In Malayalam, the film was remade as Shobharaj (1986) with Mohan Lal in lead. Later director Farhan Akhtar reinterpreted the movie in Don: The Chase Begins Again (2006) and Don 2: The Chase Continues.Several Bollywood personalities such as Farhan and Kunal Kohli mourned his passing on social media. ""Saddened to learn that the director of the OG Don is no more. RIP Chandra Barot-ji.

The “carbon black” as known colloquially is a sooty ingredient used in car tires that stretches back the family’s roots in the region for ten generations.In Boston, the Cabot family's prominence is so legendary that locals often say, “The Cabots talk only to God.””And this is good old Boston/ The home of the bean and the cod/ Where the Lowells talk only to Cabots/ And the Cabots talk only to God.” says a well-known local poem, reports the New York Post.The Cabots were a family of seafarers and merchants with historical records indicating their involvement in both slave trade and opium trade.Over the years, various family members have played key roles in a wide range of businesses throughout New England, including the rum company.The Cabot family fortune has endured across generations and was estimated at $200 million in a 1972 New York Times profile, the equivalent of approximately $15.4 billion in 2025.Kristin Cabot was a member of the “advisory board” at Privateer Rum since 2020 as per her now-deleted LinkedIn profile.She joined Astronomer approximately seven months ago as Chief People Officer.Cabot was previously married to Kenneth Thornby and they divorced in 2022.","Kristin Cabot, the HR executive of Astronomer embroiled in a “cheating” scandal as she was caught cuddling the company’s CEO Andy Byron in a video that is now going viral on social media.

H-1B: Lottery versus weighted selection process







The Donald Trump administration is considering introducing a new process for H-1B hiring under the capped part of the system. The Department of Homeland Security sent the proposal to the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for review. The capped part of the system means the statutory cap decided by Congress for every year. The cap is 85,000 slots, including 20,000 reserved for workers who have a master's degree.Universities and research institutions are eligible for cap-exempt visas.For 2026, the USCIS has already closed the process as they announced Friday that enough petitions had been submitted to reach the annual cap, which means there will be no lottery for FY 2026.In the present system, there's a random lottery each year for visas subject to the cap. After the lottery, employers with winning entries submit petitions to sponsor workers who will join their companies around October.In Donald Trump's first term, the DHS came up with a selection process based on the wage offered for a position instead of the random lottery so that companies hire more high-skilled workers instead of filling their positions with low-wage foreign workers.That rule, one of several offered as part of a “Buy American, Hire American” initiative, was later shelved by the Biden administration in 2021. The draft regulations drew more than 1,000 public comments, including many that argued it would drastically reduce the number of available H-1B workers, Bloomberg reported.The lottery system was brought in so that no company or applicant would get any favor. But larger companies can apply for more visas resulting in such companies getting more H-1Bs.In January, the Institute for Progress, a nonpartisan think tank examining innovation policy, floated the idea of eliminating the H-1B lottery. It argued that the economic value of the visa program could be increased by 88 per cent of applicants were evaluated based on seniority or salary.","The Department of Homeland Security sent the proposal to the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for review.

Poll Do you support the proposal to double penalties for traffic rule violations involving children? Yes, it's necessary for safety. No, it may not address the root issue.

NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has proposed doubling of penalty for traffic rule violation by people driving with children, a move that will ensure safety and responsibility. It has also proposed a ""merit and demerit (positive and negative) point system"" for all drivers based on their compliance with or violation of traffic rules.The changes have been proposed as part of amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act, and these have been circulated among ministries for their feedback, TOI has learnt. Sources said the proposal of doubling penalty for traffic rule violation has been made considering rampant non-compliance of norms by parents and family members driving with children and by buses owned or hired by schools to transport students. The higher penalty is aimed at making both drivers and vehicle owners responsible.However, a section of road safety experts feel that any addition to the list of offences may end up only as a ""better"" legislative exercise and another avenue for corruption, if not implemented objectively.""Even now traffic cops catch and penalise drivers only for half a dozen offences such as speeding, drunk driving, jumping red signal, using phone and not wearing seatbelt or helmet, while the MV law covers over 100 offences.How will cameras installed identify if a juvenile is sitting in the rear seat of a car and will police personnel stop vehicles and check the age of people sitting inside? While framing laws and policies we don't think of India but Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and big cities,"" an expert said.As far as the proposal of ""merit and demerit"" points system for drivers is concerned, govt will set a threshold for demerit points and any driver accumulating negative marks beyond that will face the risk of suspension and cancellation of his/her driving licence. The ministry has also proposed to link insurance premium to behaviour of drivers, which will be reflected through positive and negative points.Sources said the proposed amendments include mandatory driving test for DL holders applying for renewal before expiry of licence, if they have violated traffic rules.","Road transport ministry has proposed doubling of penalty for traffic rule violation by people driving with children.

India at growing risk of gastric cancer: New WHO study projects 1.6 million cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/india-at-growing-risk-of-gastric-cancer-new-who-study-projects-1-6-million-cases/articleshow/122380231.cms,"India and China could see 6.5 million gastric cancer cases combined



Helicobacter pylori infection causes most gastric cancer cases in India



Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions



Early detection could prevent most gastric cancer cases



Younger populations in India face rising gastric cancer risk



Nationwide screening campaigns to detect and treat H. pylori early

Public education initiatives to raise awareness of gastric cancer symptoms, such as persistent indigestion, bloating, and unexplained weight loss

Promoting healthy dietary and lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt-preserved foods, stopping tobacco use, and increasing intake of fruits and vegetables

A recent study published in Nature Medicine by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialised agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), has issued a stark warning: the world is facing a significant surge in gastric cancer cases, with Asia—and particularly India—bearing the brunt. The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk.Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.India must take public health action against gastric cancerTo reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.",Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions.

Mumbai: Dubbing them ""a selfish lot"" who are not bothered about people's lives, Bombay HC has directed occupants of the top 18 floors of a 34-storey building in Tardeo which do not have an occupation certificate (OC) to vacate their flats in two weeks.A bench of Justices Girish Kulkarni and Arif Doctor said it is ""brazen illegality"" on the residents' part to occupy the flats in Willingdon Heights without an OC, and directed BMC to initiate appropriate action if the order is not complied with. It said ""affluent"" flat buyers ""who have taken the law into their own hands in occupying construction which has no OC are a selfish lot who not only with open eyes are acting contrary to the building regulations but also have the means to defeat legal action"" being taken by BMC.Slamming the residents for setting a ""very bad example"" to protect construction that has no OC, HC said they appear to be least bothered about their own lives. ""If this be so, how can they be bothered about anybody else in the event of any untoward incident taking place?"" it said, adding that such an approach, which is wholly contrary to the law, ""needs to be deprecated"". ""We clarify that such members would be entitled to reoccupy the tenements only after an OC is granted,"" it said on July 15.The order was uploaded on Saturday.The petition was filed by Sunil Jhaveri, a resident of the building, also known as Thakkar Tower, at Tulsiwadi, alleging gross illegalities. The building has no fire NOC and only a part OC for floors 1-16. BMC had flagged illegalities in the construction of floors 17-34, including amalgamation of the 26th and 27th floors. On March 27, HC had granted ad interim protection.Senior advocate Sharan Jagtiani, for Jhaveri, submitted notices issued by BMC from 2011, including over lack of a fire NOC and directing removal of unauthorised constructions. In Jan 2020, occupants of floors 17-34 were directed to vacate their flats in seven days. Jagtiani argued that while steps are being taken from floors 1-16 to regularise the violations, there can be no justification for persons to occupy floors 17-34 without an OC.Senior advocate S U Kamdar, for BMC, said the illegalities would be required to be restored in conformity with the original plans. There is no justification for the building's residents, particularly those on floors 17-34, to continue their occupation, he said, adding that the occupation of the entire building in the absence of a fire NOC is extremely dangerous.Senior advocate Dinyar Madon for the housing society urged HC to permit residents to continue occupation for some time on humanitarian grounds so that they can seek regularisation of illegalities and obtain an OC.

The judges said if the proposition is accepted, ""we would render the entire statutory regime requiring strict compliance wholly nugatory and inconsequential"".

"Himachal Pradesh Marriage Incident: ‘We made the decision together’ Two brothers marry same woman in Himachal Pradesh, revive rare Hatti tribe tradition of polyandry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/we-made-the-decision-together-brothers-marry-same-woman-in-himachal-pradesh-revive-rare-hatti-tribe-tradition-of-polyandry/articleshow/122792864.cms,"In Himachal Pradesh's Shillai village, a Hatti tribe wedding saw bride Sunita Chauhan marrying brothers Pradeep and Kapil Negi, embracing the tradition of polyandry. The three-day celebration, filled with local customs, highlighted the practice legally recognized as ""Jodidara.""





SHIMLA: Two brothers of the Hatti tribe tied the knot with the same woman in Shillai village of Himachal Pradesh, drawing hundreds of people to witness the three-day wedding steeped in the tradition of polyandry.Bride Sunita Chauhan and grooms Pradeep and Kapil Negi said the marriage was a mutual decision taken without any external pressure.The wedding, held in the Trans-Giri area of Sirmaur district, began on July 12 and was filled with local folk songs, traditional dances, and cultural rituals.Videos of the ceremony have gone viral on social media, sparking renewed discussion on the tribal practice, legally recognised under Himachal Pradesh’s revenue laws as ""Jodidara"".In Badhana village alone, five such polyandrous weddings have taken place in the last six years.Sunita, a native of Kunhat village, said she was aware of the tradition before entering the marriage. “I made my decision without any pressure,” she said, adding, “I respect the bond we have formed.”Pradeep, who works in a government department, hails from Shillai. His younger brother Kapil has a job abroad.“We followed the tradition publicly as we are proud of it and it was a joint decision,” said Pradeep.Kapil added, “We may live apart, but through this marriage, we're ensuring support, stability and love for our wife as a united family.”“We’ve always believed in transparency,” he said.The Hatti community, which resides along the Himachal-Uttarakhand border, was declared a Scheduled Tribe three years ago. Polyandry has long been part of its tradition, although it has become increasingly rare with growing literacy and economic development in the region.While such marriages still take place, elders say many are now solemnised discreetly, though society continues to accept them.Experts attribute the origin of the practice to the need to preserve family land holdings. Division of ancestral land among siblings was avoided through polyandry, while the share of tribal women in property remains a contentious issue in many areas.Around three lakh members of the Hatti tribe live across nearly 450 villages in the Trans-Giri belt of Sirmaur. Though declining, polyandry is still practiced in select areas. Similar traditions were historically observed in Jaunsar Babar in Uttarakhand and the Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh.Kundan Singh Shastri, general secretary of the Kendriya Hatti Samiti — the apex body representing the community — said the practice originated thousands of years ago.“This tradition was invented to save a family's agricultural land from further division,” he said.Another reason, he explained, was to strengthen brotherhood and foster unity in joint families by allowing even half-brothers to marry the same woman.“The third reason is a feeling of security. If you have a bigger family, more men, you are more secure in a tribal society,” Shastri said, adding it also helped in cultivating and managing scattered farmlands in remote hilly areas.“These requirements of tribal families have kept the polyandry system for thousands of years in practice, though these traditions are slowly dying,” he added.In this unique tradition, known locally as “Jajda”, the bride is brought to the groom’s village in a procession. At the groom’s residence, a ritual called “Seenj” is performed.A priest chants mantras in the local dialect, sprinkles holy water on the couple, and offers jaggery — a symbolic gesture for sweetness and harmony in their married life, invoking blessings from the family deity, or Kul Devta.","Bride Sunita Chauhan and grooms Pradeep and Kapil Negi said the marriage was a mutual decision taken without any external pressure.

Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd shares his outlook on gold prices and strategy for gold investors:

Gold Price Outlook:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are expected to remain steady as global economic events continue to shape the yellow metal’s price outlook.Silver took centre stage last week, outshining most commodities by hitting an all-time high of ₹1,15,000 domestically and marking its highest COMEX level since 2012 near $40, before facing some profit booking. The rally was driven by strong industrial demand, supportive ETP flows, and a catch-up move relative to gold. Meanwhile, gold traded steady, supported by safe-haven flows after US President Trump threatened a 30% tariff on EU and Mexico imports from August 1.The EU responded by extending its suspension of countermeasures in hopes of a negotiated settlement. Tensions cooled somewhat as Trump later signalled openness to further talks. Market attention also turned to US inflation, which rose the most in five months in June, hinting that tariffs may be seeping into prices. Despite this, producer prices softened and industrial production showed modest recovery. Comments from Fed officials signaled a cautious stance, with expectations of rate cuts by year-end still intact.Brief uncertainty also rose as rumour rose that US President Donald Trump might initiate the process of firing Governor Powell, but quickly denied the same.Amid these developments, India's gold imports in June fell to a two-year low as high prices dented demand. It will be important to check how the negotiations between the US and other countries go, esp. China, EU, India, Russia and other major trading nations.This week’s key triggers include US durable goods orders, manufacturing and services PMIs, China’s loan prime rate decision, and Fed Chair Powell’s speech—all of which could provide clarity on the Fed’s next steps and impact precious metals momentum.Recovery in China is boosting the overall optimism in the market, however now it will be important to see along with economic numbers whether they loosen their policy further or leave it as it is. Lastly, it will be important to see whether Governor Powell’s speech shows President Trump’s recent threat or does he stay put on his “wait-and-watch” stance. Any sign of pressure could support bullion from lower levels.Stance: Sideways to Higher - Rs 96,000 to 99,500","Gold prices are expected to remain steady as global economic events continue to shape the yellow metal’s price outlook.

‘Access denied’: Mumbai University can’t see its digital infra as five staffers ‘protect’ passwords; cyber audit hits a wall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/access-denied-mumbai-university-cant-see-its-digital-infra-as-five-staffers-protect-passwords-cyber-audit-hits-a-wall/articleshow/122805956.cms,"



MUMBAI: Five employees from Mumbai University's Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) have been holding on to the access of the university's digital infrastructure, including the IT systems, email systems, software, and servers, among other things, for a while. As a public entity, control of the university's entire infrastructure - physical or digital - is, by law, with the registrar. The university has written to these employees multiple times to seek handover of the access, but to no avail.A university representative said the employees, who had moved the industrial court against the university over unfair labour practices, have been claiming they have access to the digital infrastructure as network and system administrators of the university and have been carrying out their work as per norms and have withheld the passwords due to the confidentiality involved.The Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016, mentions that the university's registrar is 'the custodian of records, the common seal and any such other property of the university as the management council may commit to his charge'. Moreover, the act also bestows on the university's management council the right 'to control and arrange for administration of assets and properties of university'.""There were reports of cyber attacks that were reported by a govt agency, following which the university had to carry out a probe.But as the administration did not have any access credentials, they could not carry out any audit or even implement preventive measures for cyber security,"" said a university source, adding the employees also have control over office-suite products used by the university. The employees, however, claimed that they have access controls by virtue of being the system and network administrators and that they are working in the varsity's best interest, said the source. They also said they filed a complaint with BKC police station after the university informed them about the cyber attacks and have extended help when required, the source added.The industrial court, in the matter filed by the four employees seeking permanency in employment along with all consequential benefits and arrears of salary, had ruled in an interim order on Nov 25, 2022 that prima facie the university 'had engaged in unfair labour practice'. The court also directed the university to not terminate services of the complainants without following due process of law till final disposal of complaint and also restrained it from appointing new employees through a private agency or directly in place of the complainants, apart from restraining it from changing existing service conditions of the complainants.While a senior university official said 'whenever necessary, the university takes and will take necessary action', messages and calls made to four of the employees went unanswered. One employee refused to disclose information but told TOI they are doing work as per the court's directive.","As a public entity, control of the university's entire infrastructure - physical or digital - is, by law, with the registrar.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Is Yellowstone’s supervolcano about to erupt? Truth and rumours behind the viral bear video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-yellowstones-supervolcano-about-to-erupt-truth-and-rumours-behind-the-viral-bear-video/articleshow/122799594.cms,"The viral bear video and Yellowstone supervolcano panic: where it actually came from

Yellowstone supervolcano’s current volcanic status

Are hydrothermal changes a cause for concern?

What scientists expect before a real eruption

A sharp increase in earthquake frequency and magnitude

Broad and rapid ground uplift

Elevated emissions of volcanic gases like sulphur dioxide

Unusual heat patterns across large areas

The reality of Yellowstone’s eruption cycle

Final word: Yellowstone remains safe





Yellowstone National Park has once again become the centre of global attention, not because of its geysers or wildlife, but due to viral social media claims suggesting an imminent supervolcano eruption. A widely circulated video appears to show a group of bears “fleeing” the park, stirring alarm across platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Users speculated that the animals were reacting to seismic activity beneath the surface. However, scientific evidence and expert monitoring tell a very different story. As of July 2025, the US Geological Survey and Yellowstone Volcano Observatory report no signs of impending volcanic unrest. Here’s a closer look at what’s really happening beneath Yellowstone’s surface — and what isn’t.The now-viral bear video, which triggered fears of an impending eruption, has been thoroughly debunked.Contrary to claims, the footage was not filmed in Yellowstone. It originated in January 2025 at Bear Country USA, a wildlife park in Rapid City, South Dakota. Wildlife experts confirm that the bears shown were part of a controlled, fenced environment and were not exhibiting unusual behaviour.Animal migrations in Yellowstone show no signs of panic. Experts note that bears and other animals tend to follow seasonal patterns, and there’s been no verified mass exodus from the park. Authorities urge the public to verify facts before sharing panic-driven posts online.The Yellowstone supervolcano remains at background levels of activity.According to the USGS and Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, the volcano alert level is NORMAL, and the aviation colour code is GREEN. These designations indicate that seismic and geothermal activity are within expected norms.In June 2025, 60 small earthquakes were recorded in the region. The largest measured magnitude 2.7 — well within Yellowstone's historical patterns and not linked to heightened volcanic risk. Regular geothermal features such as geysers and hot springs continue to operate without any unusual changes.Hydrothermal activity in Yellowstone is dynamic and constantly changing.Events like a new hydrothermal vent forming in Biscuit Basin (July 2024) or minor steam explosions are not uncommon. These phenomena result from shallow underground water interactions and do not suggest deeper magma movement.USGS scientists clarify that such changes, while sometimes dramatic, are part of Yellowstone’s geothermal landscape and are not considered precursors to a supervolcano eruption.If Yellowstone were approaching a major eruption, multiple early warning signs would occur.Experts expect precursors like:None of these indicators are currently present. Continuous monitoring through GPS, seismic networks, and gas sensors provides scientists with real-time data capable of detecting any significant changes.The last supervolcanic eruption at Yellowstone occurred around 640,000 years ago.While some speculate on eruption intervals, scientists stress that supervolcanoes do not follow predictable schedules. Estimates suggest no such eruption is due for at least another 60,000 years.Recent studies also show the magma chamber beneath Yellowstone is not as full or pressurised as previously believed, further lowering the likelihood of sudden catastrophic activity.Despite social media rumours, there is no scientific basis for fears of an imminent Yellowstone supervolcano eruption.The viral bear video was misleading and not filmed in the park. Experts remain vigilant through advanced monitoring systems and have found no signs of escalating volcanic hazard.Yellowstone continues to be a safe destination for visitors, with its geothermal marvels and wildlife providing awe and inspiration — minus the eruption panic.","Despite social media rumours, there is no scientific basis for fears of an imminent Yellowstone supervolcano eruption.

‘Most consequential 3 seconds’: Ex-Alaska Airlines pilot recalls attempting to shut off flight’s engine mid-air; feared fatal end,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/most-consequential-3-seconds-ex-alaska-airlines-pilot-recalls-attempting-to-shut-off-flights-engine-mid-air-feared-fatal-end/articleshow/122691296.cms,"ANI file photo





Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson, recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059, reports CBS News. He had reportedly been under the influence of “magic mushrooms” and lost sense of reality.Emerson boarded the flight bound for San Francisco as a passenger from Everett, Washington with 83 other passengers and crew on board. He was assigned the cockpit jump seat located behind the pilot and first officer.""I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,"" he said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday.At that time he was grieving the death of his best friend and reportedly experimented with the psychedelic drug.""You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,"" he said recalling the incident. ""I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life.”""I know what those levers do in a real airplane and I need to wake up from this. You know, it's 30 seconds of my life that I wish I could change, and I can't,” he was quoted saying by ABC News.The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was taken into custody. He is scheduled to face trial next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and also faces numerous state charges, including 83 misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment and one felony count of first-degree endangering an aircraft, reported CBS News.Since then the National Transportation Safety Board has since hosted a first-of-its-kind forum focused on pilot mental health to examine current regulations.The FAA launched its own policy review, with both agencies advocating for reforms to remove barriers to mental health care.""Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,"" said Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber, reported CBS News.Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are spearheading a bipartisan push in Congress to implement reforms within two years through the Mental Health in Aviation Act. The legislation aims to improve access to mental health care for pilots and air traffic controllers and expand the number of medical examiners available.","Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059.

In a remarkable twist of luck, a Massachusetts man won $2 million after unknowingly purchasing two identical Powerball tickets for the same drawing, from two different stores.Paul Corcoran, from Fitchburg in north-central Massachusetts, originally bought a multi-draw Powerball ticket for seven games in the run-up to the July 9 draw, CNN reported.However, thinking the final draw on that ticket had already taken place, Corcoran picked up another seven-draw ticket just minutes away from the first store, inadvertently including the same July 9 draw twice.That simple mistake turned into a fortune.According to the Massachusetts State Lottery and Powerball, both of Corcoran’s tickets matched all five white balls drawn, 5, 9, 25, 28, and 69, earning him $1 million per ticket before taxes. He missed the full $217 million jackpot by just one number, the red Powerball 5.Corcoran told officials he has been playing the same set of random numbers “for quite some time”. He claimed his double prize at the Massachusetts State Lottery headquarters, though said he has no immediate plans for the winnings.The tickets were purchased at two locations: a Market Basket supermarket in Fitchburg and a Country Farms convenience store in nearby Leominster.Both retailers will receive a $10,000 bonus for selling a $1 million winning ticket.According to the lottery office, these were the first $1 million Powerball wins ever recorded in Fitchburg and Leominster, CNN reported.The odds of hitting the Powerball jackpot stand at a staggering 1 in 292.2 million. The next drawing is scheduled for 21 July, with an estimated top prize of $308 million.","Paul Corcoran, from Fitchburg in north-central Massachusetts, originally bought a multi-draw Powerball ticket for seven games in the run-up to the July 9 draw.

US' biggest wildfire of the year has consumed over 95,740 acres, according to central Oregon fire authorities on Sunday, with ground teams achieving partial containment of the blaze, which still has potential to expand into a megafire.Officials, quoted by NBC News, revised the Cram Fire's size slightly lower from Saturday after completing more precise mapping. The extensive fire, which has involved more than 900 firefighting personnel, destroyed several homes and led to evacuations across two counties, is now 49% contained following last week's challenging containment efforts.""Yesterday was another favorable day with us with the weather, and so a lot of good work was done,"" Scott Stutzman, operations section chief of the Oregon State Fire Marshal, said Sunday in a Facebook video. ""We'll have those crews out there continuing to maintain a presence mopping up, and also assisting our wildland partners on the perimeter.""The weekend's lower temperatures and increased humidity are forecast to persist into early week, potentially supporting firefighting operations. The fire's extent remains significant: reaching 100,000 acres would classify it as a megafire, marking the first in the USA for 2025, according to Stanton Florea, spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, which oversees national wildland firefighting operations.Federal data indicates Oregon experienced six megafires last year.This occurrence, while previously uncommon, has increased in frequency alongside the general expansion and intensification of wildfires.According to Florea, megafires are increasingly frequent, with extended fire seasons - now termed 'fire year' - and more intense, longer-lasting fires.This year has witnessed 40,934 wildfires, the highest count in at least ten years, according to National Interagency Fire Center statistics.A 2023 Congressional Research Service report noted that of 1.6 million wildfires since 2000, only 254 exceeded 100,000 acres, with merely 16 reaching 500,000 acres. ""A small fraction of wildfires become catastrophic, and a small percentage of fires accounts for the vast majority of acres burned,"" the service said, according to NBC. ""For example, about 1% of wildfires become conflagrations — raging, destructive fires — but predicting which fires will 'blow up' into conflagrations is challenging and depends on a multitude of factors, such as weather and geography. ""Recent studies suggest human-induced global warming increases the likelihood of extreme weather conditions, including extended drought and strong winds. This enables wildfires to ignite unexpectedly and rapidly increase in intensity.The Cram Fire, causing evacuations in Jefferson and Wasco counties, began a week ago, expanding rapidly amid extremely hot, dry and windy western conditions. The cause remains uncertain.While 88 engines and eight helicopters remain deployed to contain the Cram Fire, Sunday's announcement from the Oregon State Fire Marshal indicated plans to adjust their response as containment improves.The fire has destroyed four homes and two additional structures. Officials report reduced threat to residential areas.","Cram Fire in central Oregon has burned 95,740 acres and is 49% contained.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

India Lost 1 Rafale Jet During Op Sindoor, But Pakistan Did Not Do It: Dassault CEO's Fresh Claim

Poll Should passengers receive more training on recognizing flight details? Yes, it’s important No, it's the airline's job





In a major goof-up, a Pakistani airline flew a passenger to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead of Karachi, his actual destination.Shahzain, the affected passenger, alleged that he was not informed that he had boarded the wrong flight despite showing his ticket to the air hostess, ARY News reported.The passenger had to travel from Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city, to Karachi, the largest.According to Shahzain, two planes were parked at Lahore airport's domestic terminal gate, and he was not aware of the mistake until it was too late.He has now sent a legal notice to the carrier, accusing it of causing him distress by its negligence.He demanded that the airline cover the additional travel expenses he incurred. He also sought compensation for the inconvenience and trouble he faced.Additionally, Shahzain confirmed he did not have a passport or visa for international travel.Two hours into the flight, I questioned why the plane had not yet reached Karachi. This caused panic among the crew, who then blamed me for the mistake,"" he said, adding that when he asked to be taken to Karachi, he was told it would take two to three days.""I was told that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) would conduct an inquiry to which I assured to cooperate,"" he further stated.The Pakistan Airport Authority has already taken notice of the incident, with the Lahore Airport Management holding the airline responsible.The manager said that the passenger's arrival in Jeddah instead of Karachi was a result of the carrier's 'negligence and carelessness'.He noted that a request for action has been submitted to the authorities.","A Pakistani airline flew a passenger to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead of Karachi.
