NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Brajesh Pathak hailed the central government's Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), which he said helped to improve the water supply mechanism significantly in the country.Speaking at TOI's Water Summit 2025, the deputy CM said Uttar Pradesh made a major stride in the implementation of the scheme.Pathak highlighted how the increase in population led to water shortage and shed light on the ways Uttar Pradesh has been adopting to meet water demand.""When humans made progress, we tried moulding the environment as per our wishes. Humans would not have had to build reservoirs as natural reservoirs like rivers, waterfalls or rainwater fulfilled our daily needs. Then the population was less. But an increase in the population led to a rise in water consumption, melting of glaciers and reduction of rainwater in monsoons,"" Pathak said.The deputy CM thanked PM Modi for the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), saying the Prime Minister has made efforts to ensure on-ground implementation of JMM for the completion of a bigger goal.He said UP has ""done wonders in the implementation"" of JJM, adding ""we have witnessed the implementation of the scheme and he congratulated ""all officials linked to JJM and irrigation"".""Earlier houses had small water tanks for water storage, but PM Modi ensured the availability of fresh drinking water in every house. Uttar Pradesh has been number one in the effort. We are moving forward with a purpose,"" Pathak said.Claiming that the UP government, under CM Yogi Aadityanath, made unprecedented progress in JMM implementation, Pathak said: ""As of now, water supply is being ensured in 24,050 villages. Our connection has reached 2.36 crore houses, 37, 462 pump houses have been made. We have done a deep boring of 38,456 tubewells.""He said that the UP government has also given importance to an alternative source of energy.""Our team was aware of how would water be accessible in the absence of electricity. Therefore, the entire system is based on solar. We produce electricity, run our pump houses, supply water, and send extra electricity to the grid. This is a great effort under JJM,"" the minister said.",UP deputy chief minister Brajesh Pathak hailed the central government's Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) Pathak highlighted how the increase in population led to water shortage and shed light on the ways Uttar Pradesh has been adopting to meet water demand.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119311281,imgsize-465603,width-400,resizemode-4/119311281.jpg"
TOI Water Summit 2025: Experts call for grassroots action on water crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toi-water-summit-2025-experts-call-for-grassroots-action-on-water-crisis/articleshow/119313786.cms,"NEW DELHI: Key experts and policymakers came together at The Times of India Water Summit 2025 to discuss grassroots awareness and the role of behavioural change in ensuring access to safe drinking water . The discussions centred on the Jal Jeevan Mission , highlighting community-driven solutions for sustainable water management.Smriti Singh, State Programme Director of WaterAid UP, spoke about the critical role of community involvement in the success of the Jal Jeevan Mission. "" Water conservation is a concept that is deeply linked to behavioural change. It has to start at the household level,"" she said. Highlighting the challenges of implementation, she added, ""Ensuring access to safe drinking water requires women’s participation at the community level. Historically, women have had to travel long distances to fetch water, increasing their workload and affecting their livelihood opportunities. Community engagement is essential to overcoming these challenges.""She also cited successful grassroots initiatives, such as the development of village action plans and water security mapping. ""By involving men, women, and children in the planning process, we were able to identify water sources, assess their sustainability, and introduce measures like rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge,"" she explained.Environmentalist Ramveer Tanwar, popularly known as the 'Pond Man' of India, emphasised the role of youth in water conservation. ""If we don't act now, future generations will only inherit polluted water bodies. The youth must step up and take responsibility,"" he said. He recounted his initiative, ‘Selfie with Pond,’ which encouraged young professionals working in cities to reconnect with their village water bodies. ""We challenged youth to visit their ancestral villages, take a selfie with a pond, and share it on social media. Thousands participated, realising the dire condition of these water bodies,"" he added.Brijraj Singh Yadav, IAS, Executive Director of S.W.S.M. (UP), highlighted the increasing stress on water resources due to rising consumption. ""Water is vital not just for drinking but also for irrigation and industry. As our population grows, so does our demand, making conservation even more urgent,"" he noted. Addressing the declining condition of traditional water bodies, he said, ""Many ponds have deteriorated over the last decade, turning into garbage dumps. We must take urgent measures to restore them before the damage becomes irreversible.""Venkatesh Dutta, Head of the Department of Environmental Science at Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow, underscored the necessity of a mindset shift in both rural and urban areas. ""We need to rethink how we manage water. Villages traditionally relied on ponds and wells, but urbanisation has altered these dynamics. We must implement structured recharge systems and geo-tagging to ensure sustainability. In cities, water is either drained into sewer systems or wasted. We need to adopt a circular approach—reuse, conserve, and return water to nature in its purest form. Pricing water appropriately could also drive conservation, as clean water is costlier than petrol,"" he explained.Radha Krishna Tripathi, Senior Media Advisor at S.W.S.M. (UP), discussed the role of the media in spreading awareness about water conservation. ""Every city has rivers and water bodies that are often neglected or misidentified as drains. Recognising their value is the first step toward conservation,"" he said. He stressed the importance of educating rural and urban populations about water quality and management. ""For decades, many villages lacked access to clean water. Now, as we introduce chlorinated water, it takes time for people to understand its benefits. Behavioural changes don’t happen overnight. Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, we are working at the grassroots level to promote awareness and community participation,"" he added.","Key experts and policymakers came together at The Times of India Water Summit 2025 to discuss grassroots awareness.

He noted that these technologies have helped improve water quality and ensure effective wastewater treatment, particularly during large-scale events like the Maha Kumbh.Discussing the Jal Jeevan Mission , which aims to provide tap water to every rural household, he said, “When the mission was launched, UP had only 1.96% tap water coverage in rural homes. Today, we have made significant progress, and the state is even in contention for a national award.”He also addressed major challenges, including arsenic and fluoride contamination in Bundelkhand and Gorakhpur, which previously caused high fatalities. Improved planning and solar-powered water supply schemes, he said, have significantly improved the situation. “By integrating solar energy, we are not only reducing electricity costs but also cutting down carbon emissions,” he noted.Srivastava further pointed out that improved water access has enhanced public health, boosted school enrolment rates, and raised the overall quality of life, especially for women. A streamlined online payment system for contractors, he added, has also ensured faster project execution.Looking ahead, he stressed the need for continuous innovation and active community participation to prevent water misuse and sustain conservation efforts.","Anurag Shrivastava, Additional Chief Secretary, Namami Gange and Rural Water Resources Department, emphasised that strengthening water governance in Uttar Pradesh requires policy innovation and technology.

The session, moderated by Daksh Sethi, Founder of Guby Rogers & The Wolf Media Co., brought together key voices from government, research, and civil society to discuss challenges and solutions.The panel featured Heera Lal, IAS, State Nodal Officer, Prime Minister Agriculture Irrigation Scheme; Divyendu Kumar Singh, Unit Coordinator (Technical), S.W.S.M. (UP); Prashansha Gupta, CEO, Institute for Water & Climate Initiatives; and Mr Hari Prakash Haihyvanshi, Deputy Programme Manager, Water & Wastewater, CSE India.Prashansha Gupta highlighted gaps in water supply infrastructure, particularly in high-altitude regions where pipeline maintenance remains a challenge. She advocated for community ownership and education to ensure efficient water use and reduce wastage. “A well-built system is only as good as its users,” she noted, emphasising the importance of solar-powered water pumping stations as a sustainable alternative.Divyendu Kumar Singh provided insights into Jal Jeevan Mission , launched in 2019 to provide tap water connections in rural India. He detailed Uttar Pradesh’s progress, citing the laying of 51,000 km of pipelines, connecting 48,000 villages to the network, and certifying 24,000 villages as ‘Har Ghar Jal’ (Every Home with Water). He also highlighted the adoption of solar energy for water supply schemes, stating that 900 MW of solar panels have been installed across 33,000 schemes, reducing operational costs and ensuring sustainability.While infrastructure is crucial, experts agreed that sustainability depends on community participation. Ms Gupta stressed that awareness campaigns, especially targeting children and social media, could drive a shift in water conservation practices. “The mindset needs to change. If people don't value water, no system will work efficiently in the long run,” she added.Heera Lal called for rethinking large-scale water storage and instead prioritising localised conservation efforts. Citing research from IIT Kanpur, he said, “Big dams are no longer the solution. Small-scale groundwater recharge and rainwater harvesting must be prioritised.”The discussion concluded with a consensus that a combination of infrastructure, policy innovation, and public awareness is critical to addressing India’s water challenges. Sustained government investment, solar-powered solutions, and community-led conservation efforts will be key to securing safe and accessible water for all.","Experts and policymakers underscored the need for a multi-pronged approach to ensuring safe water access at the ‘Water Sanitation & Public Health – Safe Water for All’ panel discussion.

Sahil's room

'Made Muskan an addict'

'Directed her to stab Saurabh's heart thrice'

NEW DELHI: As hesitant Muskan sat on the chest of her unconscious husband, her lover Sahil handed her a knife and showed her how to wield it. ""You have to stab him in the heart three times,"" he instructed her with a promise of a new life after all this.Sahil, along with his lover Muskan Rastogi, stands accused of the murder of Muskan's husband, former Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput.Sahil's room offered a glimpse into his dark and disturbing psyche. A dimly lit space with broken walls, filled with satanic symbols, cigarette boxes, and artwork depicting drug consumption. The victim's family believe that Sahil’s obsession with the occult played a role in the murder, with Saurabh Rajput’s mother, Renu Devi, claiming that her son was killed as part of a tantric ritual.In Sahil's room a bed sheet covered the window, and a sofa stood against the wall. Among the graffiti was a message: ""You can't trip with us."" The room had liquor cans scattered.On March 4, Rajput was allegedly drugged, stabbed, dismembered, and his remains sealed inside a cement-filled drum. Muskan and Sahil then embarked on a vacation to Himachal Pradesh, using Saurabh’s phone to mislead his family. The crime was discovered two weeks later when Muskan finally confessed to her parents, who then informed the police.Police sources told news agency PTI suggest that Sahil exercised psychological control over Muskan, isolating her from her six-year-old daughter and turning her into an addict. Muskan's parents accused him of trapping her in his web of superstitions. Neighbours also recalled his eerie behaviour—wearing kurtas with 'Mahakal' inscriptions, feeding stray cats, and keeping his room shrouded in darkness. Sketches of ominous figures adorned his walls, reinforcing his unsettling presence.""Sahil's occult practices dominated Muskaan's mind in such a way that she started keeping her six-year-old daughter away. Sahil had made Muskaan an addict and completely superstitious,"" the victim's mother said.Muskan, in her statement to police, admitted that Sahil coerced her into committing the murder. He allegedly told her, ""You have to kill Saurabh if we are to start a new life."" On the night of the crime, he directed Muskan to sit on Saurabh’s chest before handing her a knife. When she hesitated, he guided her hand to stab her unconscious husband three times in the heart.""Sahil got Muskan to kill her husband. First, he made her sit on Saurabh's chest. Then he brought a knife from the kitchen, showed her how to wield it and directed her to insert the knife in Saurabh's heart thrice,"" the source told PTI.Investigations also revealed that Muskan manipulated Sahil by creating a fake Snapchat ID impersonating his deceased mother. Through this, she convinced him that his mother wanted Saurabh dead.Investigators uncovered that Muskan and Sahil had reconnected in 2019 through a school WhatsApp group, reigniting an old relationship. By November 2023, Muskan had allegedly begun plotting Saurabh’s murder, PTI reported. Before his return from London in February, she purchased sedatives and knives under the guise of needing them to cut chicken. She also attempted to find a location to dispose of the body.SP City Ayush Vikram Singh revealed that Saurabh had been estranged from his family since marrying Muskan, which she believed would help cover up his disappearance. Ultimately, her plan failed, and both she and Sahil now face trial for a crime that investigators say was as gruesome as it was methodically planned.","Sahil, along with his lover Muskan Rastogi, stands accused of the murder of Muskan's husband, former Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput.

NEW DELHI: Is Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar targeting opposition leader Rabri Devi with a purpose? Twice in the space of 15 days, Nitish Kumar has mocked Rabri Devi reminding her of the circumstances under which the RJD leader was made the chief minister of the state in 1997.On Thursday, when Rabri Devi, along with other opposition members in the legislative council, targeted Nitish Kumar over the law and order situation in the state, the Bihar chief minister's counter was sharp and personal.""Her husband (Lalu Prasad) made her the chief minister when he was placed under suspension,"" Nitish said referring to Lalu Prasad's move to make Rabri Devi the chief minister after he was forced to resign from the post following an arrest warrant in a fodder scam case.Rabri Devi, a homemaker-turned-politician who is now the leader of the opposition in the Council, rose to register her protest, asserting that she could speak of achievements of her eight-year-long tenure as the chief minister.Nitish Kumar then ticked her off with the Magahi phrase ""(you stay out of this. You know nothing about these matters)"".This was the second time that Nitish Kumar had singled out Rabri Devi on the issue and made a mention of how and why Rabri Devi was made the chief minister.Earlier on March 7, during a heated debate over plight of women under the NDA government, Nitish had unleashed a broadside against the RJD in general and Rabri Devi in particular.The Bihar chief minister surprised many with his choice of words to refer to former chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi.""Jab iske husband doob gaye to apni wife ko bana diya (When her husband began to sink, he installed his wife (in the CM's post))"", Nitish had said.So, why is Nitish Kumar harping on what happened 28 years ago?

He wants to establish the narrative that while the RJD under Lalu Prasad had empowered women in his family, he has worked for the common women of the state announcing several schemes for them in the last two decades,"" says Kumar Vijay, a political analyst.""Law and order and development schemes for women have been the strongest forte of Nitish Kumar and when the opposition starts attacking him on these fronts, the reaction is bound to be strong,"" he says.Nitish Kumar faces one of the toughest assembly elections later this year. In the 2020 elections he was reduced to being the junior partner of the BJP in NDA alliance for the first time. This time around he needs to better his party's score to stay relevant.In the last several elections, Nitish has got huge backing of women in Bihar riding on his women-centric schemes and especially after his prohibition move.

The Sisyphus Clause



The Myth of Sisyphus

I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty. This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. Albert Camus

So maybe Pakistan is happier.

Not because it is richer, freer, safer, or better—

But because, like Sisyphus, it has made peace with the mountain.

And it no longer asks why.

Long before he became a meme for slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars for a joke that seemed like a punchline for Big Pharma to sell some follicular solutions, Will Smith acted in some remarkable movies. One of the most moving was, a fine film on paternal-filial relationships. In a rather dark moment, he wonders if Thomas Jefferson gaslit America by stating in the Declaration of Independence that every American would be endowed with certain rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He says in the movie: “And I remember thinking: how did he know to put the pursuit part in there? That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it. No matter what.”It’s a sentiment that theappears to agree with—at least for Indians , who have been rankeddespite the fact that it’s a rising global power—one of the few, to borrow a line from the proverbial egg-faced Shashi Tharoor , whose leader can hug both the premiers of Ukraine and Russia.But that’s hardly surprising, because it completely fits into the WENA (Western Europe and Norhtern American) idea of India. If one were to learn about India solely from Anglosphere coverage, one would assume that India was a genocidal hellhole where the living conditions were worse than sub-Saharan Africa.The fact is that if irony could be measured, the World Happiness Report 2025 would be a more shoddily written Don Quixote. India is ranked 118th—below Saudi Arabia (32), Libya (79), Venezuela (82), Uzbekistan (53), Rwanda (116), China (68), Iran (99), Lebanon (104), Palestine (108), Pakistan (109), Ukraine (111), Iraq (101), Cameroon (104), a list that includes war zones, authoritarian regimes, debt-ridden states, and nations facing civil unrest. Even if one were to accept that there are enough citizens of the world who prefer being a fed sparrow to a hungry songbird, even Pakistanis would be shocked to learn that they are ranked above India and would wonder if the only person surveyed for this poll was Osama Bin Laden So, before we get into the problem with the methodology, let’s do a simple headcount between India and Pakistan. Currently, India’s GDP is $3.7 trillion—the fifth largest in the world and the only one after the US to outstrip its former colonial rulers. Pakistan, meanwhile, is a $375 billion economy—not even 10% of India’s size. India’s digital economy is booming, startups are thriving, and infrastructure is expanding at a record pace. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s economy is lurching from one IMF bailout to another like a tippler looking for his next drink.Pakistan is essentially running on loans. The country has over $125 billion in external debt, with crippling inflation and foreign reserves barely enough to cover a few weeks of imports. It defaulted on several payments before being saved by yet another IMF bailout. India, by contrast, is not only managing its debt prudently but has become a net lender to the IMF.As for the contrasting militaries, there’s a delightful anecdote from 1957 recalled by Anvar Alikhan in apiece titled, where he draws parallels between the militaries of the two countries.He writes: “A true story: In 1957, the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , visiting the office of General Thimayya, the Chief of the Army Staff, saw a steel cabinet behind his desk and asked the general what it contained. The general replied that the top drawer contained the nation’s defence plans. And the second drawer contained the confidential files of the nation’s top generals. And what about the third drawer, enquired Nehru. Ah, said the general with a straight face, the third drawer contains my secret plans for a military coup against you. Nehru laughed, but there was apparently a tinge of nervousness to his laughter.”While the idea of a military coup in India remained a joke locked in a cabinet, in Pakistan, the military was so good at dealing with law and order and other issues that whenever martial law was declared, people would rejoice: “” playing on the termWhile India became a nuclear-armed democracy—warts and all—Pakistan devolved into a de facto military state whose generals always had more power than elected officials. Coups happened with the alacrity of Friday prayers. In fact, Imran Khan was propped up by the military to counter mainstream politicians, but the former World Cup winner soon became more powerful than his puppeteers intended. Yet, a country where the army decides your prime minister, your policies, and sometimes even your breakfast menu is apparently living its best life.Yes, India’s secularism is under scrutiny and faces legitimate criticism. But it still remains a constitutionally enshrined, functioning democracy with an independent judiciary, regular elections, and a diverse press. Pakistan, in contrast, is a state founded on religious identity and has institutionalised discrimination against minorities. Ahmadiyyas can’t even call themselves Muslim, and Hindus are regularly persecuted. Minorities live under a blasphemy law that’s been used more as a weapon than a shield.So, how exactly does a theocracy with enforced religious conformity and institutional bigotry outscore a pluralist democracy—even if imperfect?India is seen as a rising power on the global stage. It’s hosting G20 summits, mediating in global conflicts, and pushing for a multipolar world. Pakistan, meanwhile, is often the subject of IMF reports, FATF warnings, and UN human rights resolutions. India’s passport opens doors; Pakistan’s passport raises eyebrows.In fact, the contrast between India and Pakistan can even be seen in both nations’ favourite pastimes: cricket. In recent years, much to the chagrin of English and Australian columnists, India has become the de facto Trump of world cricket —big enough to call the shots—so much so that when Pakistan finally got the chance to host a Champions Trophy, India refused to set foot. While the Pakistani team went out dismally in the group stage, India romped home to pick up the trophy without as much as breaking a sweat. To add insult to injury, India’s dominance meant that Pakistan (the hosts) had to travel to Dubai to play its match, and India reaching the final robbed Pakistan of the spectacle.India’s changed standing on the global stage can be summarised by the contrasting online reaction to a tweet from an American commentator with a Ukraine flag (a marker of online inanity), which wondered why there was no outrage when Prime Minister Modi (like Zelenskyy) wasn’t dressed in a suit. Most commentators pointed out that Modi was dressed in traditional garb (a kurta pyjama and a jacket) as opposed to Zelenskyy’s cosplay sweatshirt and khakis. However, the real kicker was even white Americans—who often spend time mocking JD Vance’s wife —defended the Indian Prime Minister because he wasn’t in America asking for more funds and weapons.The implication that India—a growing economy, a space-faring democracy, and a hub of innovation—is less “happy” than war-torn or economically collapsed nations raises serious questions about the methodology behind these rankings. The report relied heavily on subjective self-assessments, primarily via Gallup’s “Cantril Ladder,” where respondents rated their lives on a scale from 0 to 10. These were then modelled against six variables: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. However, many of these variables were based more on perceptions than hard data. In societies where expectations are low, or media is tightly controlled, people often report higher satisfaction. In contrast, in dynamic democracies like India, rising aspirations, political noise, and media scrutiny tend to yield harsher self-assessments—even in the midst of tangible progress.All of this brought renewed attention to the flaws of international perception-based indices—something Sanjeev Sanyal and Aakanksha Arora had flagged in a 2022 working paper . They had offered a pointed critique of three influential global indices: Freedom in the World (by Freedom House), Democracy Index (by the Economist Intelligence Unit), and the V-Dem Indices (by the University of Gothenburg)—all of which had routinely rated India poorly.Sanyal-Arora had argued that these indices were largely opinion-driven, relying on small, opaque pools of anonymous “experts” whose identities, qualifications, and nationalities were often undisclosed. Freedom House, for instance, used 25 subjective questions assessed by internal analysts and external advisers, but published no transparency on scoring mechanisms. The EIU claimed to use public opinion, yet India’s last World Values Survey input dated back to 2012—meaning more recent assessments were based almost entirely on expert opinion. V-Dem, meanwhile, used 473 variables, many of them highly subjective, including notions like “self-censorship” or “deliberative quality of governance.”They also noted that many of the questions used were ill-suited for cross-country comparisons, such as “how pervasive is corruption?” or “to what extent is direct popular vote utilised?”—metrics that penalised democracies like India and the US for not holding national referendums, while awarding higher scores to one-party states like Cuba.India and Pakistan are on two different trajectories, and even the honest Pakistani knows that. If Albert Camus was right, then perhaps the secret to happiness lies not in prosperity, democracy, or purpose—but in the acceptance of futility, the repetition of struggle, and the knowledge that there is no divine reward at the summit.In, Camus describes a man condemned to eternally roll a boulder up a mountain, only for it to roll back down each time. It is an absurd fate, but in contemplating it—knowing it is his, accepting it as unchangeable—Sisyphus becomes, paradoxically, free. Camus writes: “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”Perhaps this, then, explains Pakistan’s higher ranking in the World Happiness Report 2025. Perhaps Pakistan is the Sisyphus of South Asia. A nation locked in a cycle of economic collapse, military coups, IMF bailouts, energy shortages, and cricketing heartbreak, and yet—it smiles on the way back down the hill.Where India fights, debates, builds, reforms, and aspires—Pakistan accepts. It no longer expects the summit. Its happiness is not driven by achievement but by survival, not by growth but by repetition. Where India agonises over its democracy, Pakistan no longer pretends to have one. Where India chases global leadership, Pakistan is content negotiating its next loan. There is peace in low expectations, freedom in detachment. If happiness is the absence of disillusionment, then what better strategy than to stop being illusioned in the first place?And so, while Indians grumble through traffic jams in growing cities, rage against corruption, or demand better governance, Pakistanis return to their rock each morning, lift it with muscle memory, and smile—because nothing else was promised. As Camus wrote: “Each atom of that stone... forms a world.”Every bailout is a new beginning. Every coup, a cosmic reset. Every World Cup loss, a philosophical cleansing. They roll the rock. It rolls back. The absurd cycle is complete. Meanwhile, India is caught in its own existential spiral—still believing happiness is to be earned, still chasing Jefferson’s promise of “the pursuit”, still demanding meaning from its journey. But as Camus warns, meaning is a human construct. The world owes us none.","India is ranked 118th among 147 countries in the World Happiness Report 2025.

NEW DELHI: A fire that broke out in the residential bungalow of a Delhi high court judge resulted in recovery of a huge pile of cash, sending shock waves in judicial corridors and forcing the Supreme Court collegium led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna to decide to transfer him to another HC.When the fire broke out, Justice Yashwant Varma was not in town and his family members called the fire brigade and police. After the fire was doused, first responders found a huge amount of cash inside a room, leading to official entries being made about the recovery of what appeared to be unaccounted money.The local cops informed their seniors who briefed the brass about the accidental discovery. Soon, the news reached the higher-ups in the govt, who, in turn, informed the CJI about the hoard. CJI Khanna took a very serious view and immediately called for a collegium meeting.Also read : Who is Justice Yashwant Varma, the Delhi HC Judge transferred after cash recovery The collegium was unanimous that Justice Varma needed to be transferred immediately. He has been transferred to his parent HC, Allahabad HC.

They said Justice Varma should be asked to resign and if he declined, an in-house inquiry should be initiated by the CJI, as the first step towards his removal by Parliament.As per the in-house procedure devised by SC in 1999 to deal with allegations of corruption, wrongdoing or impropriety against constitutional court judges, CJI on receipt of a complaint, seeks response of the judge.He can set up the in-house probe panel comprising an SC judge and chief justices of two HCs in case he is not satisfied with the response or concludes that the matter requires deeper probe.","A fire that broke out in the residential bungalow of a Delhi high court judge resulted in recovery of a huge pile of cash.

NEW DELHI: The central government on Friday said it is ready to rebuild ties with Canada, which has taken a hit over Ottawa harbouring anti-India elements.The ministry of external affairs said the downturn in relations between both nations was caused by the Trudeau-led Canadian government giving license to the extremist and secessionist elements.""The downturn in India-Canada relations was caused by the license that was given to the extremist and secessionist elements in the country. Our hope is that we can rebuild our ties based on mutual trust and sensitivity ,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a press briefing.Over the past several months, relations between New Delhi and Ottawa have experienced significant strain, primarily due to the presence of Khalistanis, who actively work against India's national security.In October 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Indian government agents of involvement in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Canadian citizen and prominent Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia.This allegation led to a diplomatic crisis , with both nations expelling senior diplomats. Canada's federal police claimed to have credible evidence of Indian agents engaging in illegal activities on Canadian soil, including intelligence gathering and interference in democratic processes.The situation further deteriorated when demonstrations near a Hindu temple in Brampton, Ontario, were dispersed by police after weapons were reportedly spotted among participants. This event followed a violent protest involving Khalistani terrorists opposing a visit from Indian consular officials.In response to these developments, India invoked the provision of parity in Canada's diplomatic presence, citing concerns over interference in its affairs by Canadian personnel.External affairs minister S Jaishankar stated that the relationship between the two countries was going through a difficult phase and indicated that India might resume issuing visas to Canadians if there was progress in ensuring the safety of Indian diplomats in Canada.However, Justin Trudeau on January 6 announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party, citing internal conflicts that hindered his ability to effectively lead into the next election.The chances of improvement in ties appeared after Mark Carney was named the new Canadian Prime Minister.

The home minister said, ""If someone is sitting with black glasses on, how is it possible to show them the development?""During his speech, Shah said, ""They ask us — 'What happened after the abrogation of Article 370 ?' Saheb, development can only be seen by those with open hearts and clear vision. Those who sit with black glasses on and their eyes closed cannot see the progress in Jammu and Kashmir.""The home minister, referencing Rahul Gandhi's 2023 statement about his Bharat Jodo Yatra in Kashmir, said, ""He went to Kashmir, played Holi of snow, and then claimed he saw terrorists there.""""

Elon Musk's X sues Centre for using IT Act to 'block' content,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/elon-musks-x-sues-centre-for-using-it-act-to-block-content/articleshow/119250608.cms,"Elon Musk (File photo)

What is Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act?

NEW DELHI: Elon Musk-owned X filed a case against the central government on Thursday for allegedly using the IT Act to block content on the micro-blogging site. The case has been filed in the Karnataka high court.In the plea, the X has challenged what it called unlawful content regulation and arbitrary censorship.It raised concerns over the Centre's interpretation of the Information Technology (IT) Act, particularly its use of Section 79(3)(b), which X argues violates Supreme Court rulings and undermines free expression online, according to the news agency PTI.The lawsuit alleged the government is using the said section to create a parallel content-blocking mechanism, bypassing the structured legal process outlined in Section 69A.Section 69A of the IT Act allows the government to order content removal for national security, public order, or sovereignty concerns, giving companies a clear legal basis to act. In contrast, Section 79(3)(b), companies argue, is vague, forcing platforms to decide what content is illegal, exposing them to lawsuits or backlash.Companies often use Section 69A as a defense, arguing they should only be liable if the government explicitly orders content removal, rather than guessing what is illegal. This shifts responsibility to the government, protecting platforms from legal risks and accusations of bias while ensuring compliance with official directives.X further claimed the government's current approach contradicts the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in the Shreya Singhal case, which established that content can only be blocked through a proper judicial process or the legally defined route under Section 69A.Social media companies complain about Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act because it creates legal uncertainty, forcing them to remove content even when it's unclear if it's illegal. The social media platforms allege that the vague definition of ""knowledge"" of illegal content makes them fear lawsuits, leading to over-censorship and suppression of free speech. The law also places a huge burden on platforms to police billions of posts daily, which is technically challenging.Social media platforms have also legally challenged the government's Sahyog portal, a system developed by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs to manage takedown requests under Section 79(3)(b) and enable direct coordination between social media companies and law enforcement agencies.X has refused to assign an employee to the platform, arguing that it serves as a ""censorship tool"" that pressures companies to take down content without proper legal scrutiny.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Friday claimed the state's initiative against ""unfair delimitation"" planned by BJP-led govt at the Centre had become a ""national movement"".In a social media post, Stalin said the first meeting of joint action committee (JAC) formed to oppose the delimitation exercise, scheduled for Saturday in Chennai, was a ""defining moment in our collective journey"".""This is more than a meeting. It is the beginning of a movement that will shape the future of our country,"" Stalin said, adding, ""It's a historic day for Indian federalism.""The next course of action would be decided based on the outcome of the JAC meeting, the DMK chief maintained.

""It is not about the number of MPs, but that of a state's rights, which will get affected,"" he said.While some CMs have confirmed their participation in the March 22 JAC meeting, others have agreed to send their representatives for the first round.

Later, when the national anthem was played, he stood smiling and waving at bystanders.Kumar came under heavy opposition fire in both Houses of the state legislature for disrespecting the national anthem. His latest act led to much mirth and has given fodder to opposition parties, RJD and Congress, to exploit in the upcoming state polls, arguing he can't be given another term in view of his health condition.BJP, sources said, is confident of winning another term alongside JDU and LJP, but the party's worry is that Kumar's unexpected behaviour in the public glare has often given openings to opponents.The party, however, believes Kumar continues to be a valuable partner, and the memories of RJD's ""jungle raj"" will blunt any possibility of ""anti-incumbency"". Moreover, Kumar is credited with good governance and raising the bar in terms of performance which, BJP insiders feel, will help the alliance win another term.Of late, Kumar's behaviour has not followed a consistent pattern; there have been days when no mishaps took place and he appeared to be in control, like during his 'Pragati Yatra', even though he was in the public glare for several days. But there have been odd days when Kumar behaved in a manner that his opponents derided him, and his supporters found difficult to justify. ""We hope that Nitish Kumar will overcome his on-off ways,"" a BJP functionary said.On questions raised by opposition parties on Kumar's fitness, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said it would not be appropriate for him to comment on any neta's health.

It set aside a 2023 tribunal order directing one senior citizen to hand over the premises to another, observing that the elder sister was not legally required to maintain the younger sister, both being senior citizens.The dispossessed younger sister had petitioned HC against the tribunal's order. Residing in a ground-floor slum tenement, she sought the eviction of her elder sister and another family member from the first-floor premises, alleging encroachment. However, Justice Sandeep Marne held that her application was a case of possession recovery, which could not be filed under the special law meant for senior citizens' maintenance.In its March 10 order, HC allowed Vimal Kate and other petitioners to retain the premises but clarified that the younger sister could pursue recovery through a civil court. It noted that the tribunal, meant for summary inquiries, could not adjudicate complex possession disputes. ""Such adjudication can be undertaken only before a civil court,"" it stated, calling the case a ""gross abuse of jurisdiction"" to secure possession through improper means.While HC entertained the case due to its unique circumstances, it emphasised that this ruling should not be seen as a precedent for bypassing the appeal process under the Act. It also directed the elder sister to pay pending power and water charges and not to harass the younger sister until legal proceedings were initiated."," Bombay HC sets aside a 2023 tribunal order directing one senior citizen to hand over the premises to another.

However, if the report indicates a degree of truth in the allegations, then the CJI could take the judge concerned into confidence and offer him the resignation escape route.If the judge refuses to resign, then the CJI may constitute a three-member inquiry panel headed by a sitting SC judge and comprising chief justices of two high courts other than the HC where he is working.After discovery of a huge pile of cash at Justice Varma's residence, which Allahabad HC Bar Association put at Rs 15 crore in a letter protesting his repatriation, CJI Khanna on Friday informally briefed SC judges about the incident and said the laid-down procedure would be followed to get to the bottom of the matter.The in-house procedure was based on the judgment in 'C Ravichandran vs Justice A M Bhattacharjee' (1995), where SC laid down: ""The CJI, on receipt of the information from the HC CJ, after being satisfied about the correctness and truth touching the conduct of the judge, may tender such advice either directly or may initiate such action as is deemed necessary or warranted under given facts and circumstances.""","The CJI is likely to take a decision by Saturday on setting up an inquiry panel.

Where is Meghan Markle's long-time friend Markus Anderson, who helped build her relationship with Prince Harry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/still-friends-where-is-meghan-markles-long-time-friend-markus-anderson-who-helped-build-her-relationship-with-prince-harry/articleshow/119287580.cms,"Meghan Markle (File pic) and Markus Anderson (Image taken from luxury menswear online retailer Mr Porter's website)

A notable absence from Meghan Markle 's Netflix programme was observed as her long-standing friend and Soho House founder Markus Anderson did not make an appearance. Anderson, previously described as the ""second most important man in her life"", has been a significant figure in her social circle.Anderson and the Duchess of Sussex developed their friendship during her time in Toronto whilst she filmed Suits. Although he wasn't responsible for introducing her to Prince Harry , he facilitated their relationship by arranging private meetings at Soho House and coordinating a visit to Babington House in Somerset.Their close relationship was evident through his attendance at her royal wedding and her previous blog posts on The Tig, where she referred to him as ""my loving, supportive, and endlessly fun friend"". Despite other friends such as Abigail Spencer and Delfina Blaquier appearing in With Love, Meghan, Anderson was conspicuously absent. Their last public sighting together was at a friend's baby shower in December.The Daily Mail reported that Anderson's absence from the show is attributed to his extensive business travel commitments. A source indicated that he prefers to avoid publicity, stating: ""He just really is not comfortable in the spotlight... it's not his thing.""Despite receiving harsh critiques, Meghan's Netflix programme is scheduled for a second series later this year. The show, With Love, Meghan, was considered crucial for the Sussexes' Netflix partnership, established in 2020. Their most impactful production remains their Harry & Meghan documentary, which included contentious claims about the royal family.Netflix chief Ted Sarandos recently defended Meghan in an interview with Variety. The 60-year-old executive highlighted her cultural impact, noting how the Harry and Meghan trailer sparked extensive media analysis. He mentioned the immediate sell-out of her featured clothing and accessories, including a Hermes blanket.Meghan is set to launch a new podcast titled Confessions of a Female Founder. On Instagram, she expressed enthusiasm about the project, describing it as ""candid conversations"" with ""amazing women"" about their business journeys. She shared that recording was both ""eye-opening, inspiring...and fun!"" and mentioned incorporating these insights into her own business ventures.","Markus Anderson did not make an appearance in With Love, Meghan.

""Smart Indian-American children, whose parents work in engineering or tech, are moving to High Finance. This mirrors what smart Americans have done for well over a generation -when I got my PhD from Princeton in 1994, a former engineer from silicon valley, who moved to a Wall Street job, tried to persuade me to join their quantitative analysis and trading team and I instead took a lower paying job as an engineer at Qualcomm. I did not find the idea of making money on money appealing - probably my father's admonition from childhood.

Recently I have noticed that smart well-educated Indians are gravitating to Finance. This is not good.

We need to apply our talents to solve hard engineering and tech problems, hard urban and rural infrastructure problems, hard health care problems and so on.

Making money on money feels easy but a finance-driven economy would destroy society. This is ancient wisdom, and we must pay heed.""

‘Wise advice…’ commented users

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has a word of caution for the children of Indian-Americans working in the technology industry. In a post on Twitter, Sridhar Vembu has expressed concern about what he called 'Smart Indian-American children' increasingly pursuing careers in finance, warning of the risks of an economy overly dependent on financial systems. Vembu said that he has observed a growing shift among Indian-American youth, particularly those from engineering or tech backgrounds, towards high finance—echoing a pattern seen in the United States for decades.Drawing from his own life, he shared how he was once encouraged to join a Wall Street trading team after earning his PhD from Princeton in 1994 but opted for a lower-paying engineering role at Qualcomm instead. ""I did not find the idea of making money on money appealing—probably my father's admonition from childhood,"" he noted.He expressed concern that educated and talented individuals are increasingly choosing finance over sectors like technology, infrastructure, and healthcare, where their skills could have a more tangible and positive impact on society. ""Making money on money feels easy, but a finance-driven economy would destroy society,"" Vembu cautioned, adding that this is ""ancient wisdom"" that should not be ignored.The post has garnered significant attention, with many users engaging in discussions about the implications of finance-centric policies on societal well-being. “Basically, the essence of engineering in engineers must not fade. Wise advice ! But for grads with liabilities like 1st house, car, & marriage, how do they prioritize their love for engineering over higher-paying jobs? Not yet in college but would love to know your view,” commented one user.“Completely agree with the sentiment. Unfortunately solving hard engineering problems doesn’t pay high money. Something we’ll have to look at the incentives and compensation structures and the ecosystem. Ppl shouldn’t find it an aversion as they have to go through hoops to get the resources to work in hard engg problems. Some abundance mindset needed by capital allocators,” said another user.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has expressed concern about what he called 'Smart Indian-American children' increasingly pursuing careers in finance.

BMC offered another land but made U-turn

MUMBAI: Bombay high court recently stayed BMC notices to a church in Vile Parle (W) to acquire its land for a proposed road after observing BMC and the state were stringing out a legitimate land owner, reports Rosy Sequeira.Justices Ajay Gadkari and Kamal Khata restrained BMC through temporary injunction from ""interfering with possession"".They pointed out the state, including BMC, come up with schemes for the benefit of trespassers and squatters, but ""in the present case, though the land and structure is legally acquired and constructed, BMC has adopted a different approach"".They noted the church's papers showed BMC at some point offered suitable alternative land and later rescinded.The Pentecostal Mission Society in Vile Parle (W) had in 2023 filed a petition challenging notices issued to it in April 2019, under the BMC Act for acquiring a part of its land along with nearly 60% of the church for constructing a planned road.On the Society’s May 2023 representation, the then chief minister directed the BMC commissioner to examine the shifting of the alignment of the road and submit a proposal. On a second representation in August 2023, the CM directed the principal secretary, Urban Development Department, to submit a proposal. As BMC did not submit a proposal, HC had rapped BMC for disregarding the CM’s directions. In Feb, HC was told BMC will take action against officers responsible.Justices Ajay Gadkari and Kamal Khata on March 11 restrained BMC by way of temporary injunction from “disturbing, obstructing or interfering with the possession of the petitioner in respect of the church situated on the plot admeasuring 418 sq m…”The Society’s advocate, Shriram Kulkarni, said BMC had offered the adjoining land and his clients had expressed willingness to accept it. However, later BMC said there is no provision in law allowing swapping of land.The judges noted that the Society had legally acquired the land under the church. They noted that the correspondence annexed to the petition “clearly indicates that at some point of time,” BMC offered the Society “suitable alternate land for prayer hall, which was subsequently not adhered to.”“It is not out of the way to take a judicial note of the fact that state, including the BMC, has come up with various schemes for the benefit of rank trespassers and squatters for their rehabilitation. However, in the present case, though the land and structure is legally acquired... BMC has adopted a different approach,” the judges said and granted the Society twin interim reliefs."," Bombay HC has stayed BMC notices to acquire land from a Vile Parle church for a proposed road, noting that the church holds legitimate ownership.
