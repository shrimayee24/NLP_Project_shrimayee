Russia’s Rosatom ships reactor vessel for Kudankulam N-plant unit-6 to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russias-rosatom-ships-reactor-vessel-for-kudankulam-n-plant-unit-6-to-india/articleshow/117345475.cms,"NEW DELHI: The VVER-1000 reactor vessel for the sixth unit of the Tamil Nadu-based Kudankulam nuclear power plant (KNPP), which is being built in India according to a Russian design, is being transported to the construction site. The equipment weighing 320 tonnes was manufactured at Atommash plant, the Russian atomic energy corporation Rosatom's machine-building division, and shipped to the customer.A reactor vessel is a thick steel container that holds nuclear fuel in a nuclear reactor. It's also known as a reactor pressure vessel.Before sending the reactor vessel on a sea voyage, the equipment was delivered by a special automobile transport to the plant pier, where it was loaded onto a river vessel, the destination of which was the sea port of Novorossiysk. Then, in the port, the reactor vessel was placed in the hold of a sea vessel to cover a 11,000-km route to India.A set of four steam generators for the sixth unit of the Kudankulam N-plant will be shipped in 2025.At present, four new power units are being built at the Kudankulam NPP according to the Russian design. The design of the station, construction and supply of equipment are carried out by divisions of the engineering division of Rosatom State Corporation . Contracts for the design and supply of equipment were concluded between JSC Atomstroyexport and ICAEL (Atomic Energy Corporation of India).“We are developing and making our work more perfect both in terms of equipment design, ensuring an unprecedented level of safety, and in terms of the economic efficiency of our products. We are currently developing a reactor installation for nuclear power plants with increased power characteristics, more modern operational properties, and improved technical and economic indicators for use in Russia and abroad,” noted Valery Kryzhanovsky , general designer of OKB Gidropress.KKNPP is scheduled to have six VVER-1000 reactors built in collaboration with Atomstroyexport, the Russian state company and Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), with an installed capacity of 6,000 MW of electricity.The first reactor of the plant attained criticality in July 2013 and was connected to the grid three months later. It started commercial operation from Dec 31, 2014. The second unit achieved criticality on July 10, 2016 and was connected to the grid in Aug.Construction of units 3 and 4 with similar VVER-1000 power units began in 2017. Units 3 and 4 are 73% complete. They have a cost overrun of nearly 73% and a time overrun of 72 months, according to a project summary released in August 2024 by the Union govt. Units 5 and 6 are almost a third complete and have not run into any cost or time overruns, according to the project summary.","The equipment weighing 320 tonnes was manufactured at Atommash plant, the Russian atomic energy corporation Rosatom's machine-building division.

Fast growing composites industry is shaping India’s future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fast-growing-composites-industry-is-shaping-indias-future/articleshow/117345052.cms,"The Indian composites materials market was estimated at USD 1.8 billion in 2024 and is likely to grow at a healthy CAGR of 7.8 per cent over the next six years, reaching USD 2.8 billion in 2030.Composites materials are revolutionising various industries in India, driving innovation, and contributing to the country’s economic growth. These advanced materials, composed of two or more constituents with distinct physical and chemical properties, offer exceptional strength, lightweight characteristics, durability, and resistance to environmental factors.The renewable energy sector benefits significantly from composites, especially in wind and solar energy. Lightweight, durable wind turbine blades and solar panel structures made from composites are key to India’s shift to sustainable energy. In 2024, India’s installed wind energy capacity was approximately 48 GW, the fourth largest globally. India’s installed wind energy capacity is expected to reach 140 GW by 2030, driving substantial growth in the composites industry, as turbines are about 30 per cent composite by weight. Another emerging application is in lightweight high-pressure vessels, enabling efficient hydrogen storage without excess weight.In the aerospace and defence sectors, composites are essential for manufacturing lighter, fuel-efficient aircraft, drones, and military vehicles. These materials enhance performance and reduce operational costs, supporting India’s goal of achieving self-reliance in defence production. Composites are extensively used in the HAL Tejas aircraft, developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL). Additionally, ISRO relies heavily on composites for satellite structures and launch vehicles, enabling more efficient space missions and bolstering India’s global position in space technology.Composites materials are most widely used in the building and construction industry, accounting for 30 per cent of total usage. They are found in a range of products, including roofing, facades, light poles, decorative items, portable toilets, doors, swimming pools, railings, and furniture. As India’s economy grows, all of these applications, and the use of composites is expected to grow substantially.In infrastructure, composites are used in bridges, pipelines, and construction projects, offering corrosion resistance and reduced maintenance costs, essential for smart city initiatives.Composites are integral to the development of lighter and more fuel-efficient vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs) and high-speed trains, helping reduce carbon emissions.In the automotive sector, composites are used for manufacturing the body parts of buses, EVs, and rickshaws. Additionally, they are increasingly being utilised for high-voltage battery casings due to their superior electrical insulation properties.In railways, composites are used in various components, including luggage racks, window blinds, toilet cabins, passenger seat shells, and tables, making train coaches both lightweight and durable. Government initiatives such as the National Rail Plan (NRP) 2030, Make in India, and Atmanirbhar Bharat aim to modernise India’s railway system by promoting the adoption of innovative materials like composites in train manufacturing.Currently, India is entirely reliant on imports for carbon fibre. The FRP Institute, India’s premier composites association, organises the International Conference and Exhibition for Reinforced Plastics (ICERP) biennially. ICERP is the largest show for composites in India and second largest in Asia. The 11th edition of this event, scheduled for next week in Mumbai, will showcase the latest advancements in the Indian composites industry.","The Indian composites materials market was estimated at USD 1.8 billion in 2024. It is likely to grow at a healthy CAGR of 7.8 per cent over the next six years, reaching USD 2.8billion in 2030.

The other half of success,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-other-half-of-success/articleshow/117332916.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

L&T's chairman recently sparked a firestorm of controversy with his startling suggestion that employees should work 90 hours weekly, including Sundays, to remain competitive. His dismissive quip, ""How long can you stare at your wife?"" created waves of outrage on social media .

Several such incidents of the past make us reflect upon the deeper malaise in Indian corporate culture – one of the most recent being the tragic death of Anna Sebastian, a 24-year-old professional, a stark reminder of corporate excess. It's a sobering reality that Indians have the longest average workweek among the world's ten largest economies.

Having witnessed the corporate landscape, I can attest to its often-toxic environment. Like delicate flowers in harsh soil, employees wither under daily instances of humiliation from aggressive supervisors. When aggression flows from the top, it cascades down unchecked and is often celebrated rather than condemned. Talents don't abandon ships; they flee toxic captains. If not valued in one setting, they will surely shine in another like precious gemstones.

But beyond the corporate dynamics lies a more profound question: If a man is at home, can’t he reduce his wife’s burden, even if he is bored of her face. Maya Angelou's poem ‘Woman Work’ resonates with domestic life:

‘I've got the children to tend. The clothes to mend. The floor to mop. The food to shop. Then the chicken to fry. The baby to dry… Shine on me, sunshine… Fall softly, dewdrops… And cool my brow again…’

Beware, a man who does not even see the face of his wife could end up as another Vachaspathi Mishra, the 10th century scholar who spent decades on his scholarly pursuits. So immersed was he in writing a commentary on the Brahma Sutra that he saw only his wife Bhamati’ hands - that served him food and lit his lamp each evening. One night, as the lamp flickered, and she came to add oil, he looked at her aged face and asked her who she was. Struck by the thought of the lost years, he immortalised her sacrifice by naming his masterwork ‘Bhamati’.

If I were Bhamati, I would have preferred work-life balance over a book named after me.

Now, coming to the moot point – can his wife’s face bore a man if he is at home?

One’s eyes, those mystical windows to the soul, hold universes of unspoken understanding. We learn life’s deepest mysteries through eye contact. As the great Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar beautifully captured in his couplet:

""Kannodu Kann Inai NokkuOkkin, VaaiChorkkal

Enna Payanum ila""

“When the eyes meet in love’s silent discourse and are locked in the gaze

Words become superficial vessels”

A man might carve his name on stone with his accomplishments, but how does he compensate for the precious moments lost with his beloved? The poets of ages past didn't write countless verses about fleeting glances without reason; they understood that in these shared gazes lie life's deepest mysteries and most profound connections.

This controversy can help serve as a clarion call for corporate India to reimagine its understanding of success . True leadership recognises that sustainable achievement blossoms from a balance or professional excellence and personal fulfilment. Perhaps it's time to remember that the most meaningful accomplishments often happen in those quiet moments when we pause long enough to truly see the ones we love.

"Startups, venture capital firms seek tax benefits",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/startups-venture-capital-firms-seek-tax-benefits/articleshow/117344086.cms,"MUMBAI: Startups and venture capital (VC) firms are seeking an easier tax regime and measures to boost availability of domestic capital in the upcoming Budget.Parity between foreign and domestic funds in terms of taxation is required to attract foreign investors to Indian alternative investment funds (AIFs), said Siddarth Pai, founding partner at 3one4 Capital and co-chair of regulatory affairs committee at Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association (IVCA).""If foreign investors see foreign funds enjoying better tax treatment in India, they will prefer these foreign vehicles instead of Indian AIFs. This parity will also attract investors and fund managers to GIFT IFSC ,"" said Pai.Insurance companies, banks and pension funds should be encouraged to invest along with govt through fund of funds schemes to fuel growth of AIFs, said Padmaja Ruparel, co-founder at Indian Angel Network (IAN). This will enable expansion of domestic capital for startups, Ruparel said. AIFs are pooled investment vehicles for investing in assets like startups. Current norms do not allow insurance companies and pension funds to invest in startups directly; they can only do so via fund of funds which are allowed to invest in AIFs.India requires a sovereign-backed fund of funds anchored by SIDBI which allows contributions from banks, insurance companies and global sovereign wealth funds, said Anirudh A Damani, managing partner at ArthaVenture Fund. ""With SIDBI as the anchor, this approach will create a much-needed pool of patient capital catering to startups across stages,"" said Damani, adding that the government should also expand the definition of startups to allow more businesses to get backing. The current DPIIT startup classification limits eligibility to companies up to 10 years of age or with a turnover of less than Rs 100 crore.Startups are seeking some relaxation in Esop ( employee stock ownership plan ) tax regime. Treating Esops akin to shares with simplified tax structures would make them a viable wealth-creation tool, helping startups to retain and attract top talent, said Mayank Kumar, co-founder at upGrad.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Friday announced a Rs 2,500 monthly allowance for eligible women under Mahila Samridhi Yojana while unveiling the first of its three-part manifesto ahead of Feb 5 Delhi polls.It also promised Rs 21,000 and six nutritional kits for expecting mothers along with Rs 5,000 for the first child and Rs 6,000 for the second; Rs 500 subsidy on LPG cylinders, Rs 2,500 per month as pension for senior citizens, and implementation of Ayushman Bharat Yojana in the city.BJP president J P Nadda said all existing public welfare schemes will continue if the party is voted to office. AAP govt currently offers several such schemes, including free electricity up to 200 units a month, 20,000 litres of water and free travel passes for women on DTC and cluster buses. In its poll manifesto, AAP has pledged Rs 2,100 a month for women.BJP president J P Nadda said that in the first cabinet meeting after forming the govt, the promises in the manifesto would be executed.He said, ""Under the Pradhan Mantri Matritva Vandana Yojna, we have given around 4.73 crore women Rs 5,000 for the delivery of the first child and Rs 6,000 for the second child.""While talking about the direct cash transfer scheme, Nadda said that the BJP was successful in delivering the scheme in several other states. ""In Madhya Pradesh, 13 million women are being given Rs 1,250 each as part of a women's welfare scheme. Similarly, Maharashtra provides Rs 1,250 monthly to 24 million individuals, Chhattisgarh gives Rs 1,000 per month to 7 million sisters, and Haryana provides Rs 2,500 per month,"" he said.He also took a dig at AAP and said AAP, during its 2021 Punjab campaign, promised Rs 1,000 monthly to women but failed to deliver.

The BJP assures that if it forms the govt in Delhi, it will approve the scheme in the first cabinet meeting and add an additional Rs 500,000 health cover for residents, providing a total coverage of Rs 1 million.The implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme has been a major flashpoint between AAP and BJP, with the latter stating that it has better schemes being run by the state govt. Earlier, AAP announced the Sanjeevani scheme for people aged above 60, including private hospitals. Nadda said that BJP also promises an additional Rs 500,000 health cover for senior citizens over 70.

Poll Do You Believe Government Employees Should Have Higher Salaries Than Private Sector Employees? No, Private Sector Should Be Paid More Yes, They Should Be Compensated More

8th Pay Commission: How much salary hike to expect?

8th Pay Commission: What is the fitment factor?

The fitment factor serves as a multiplication coefficient employed to determine the revised compensation for central government staff and retirees. It represents an essential element of the Pay Commission, utilised when implementing salary and pension increases following new commission guidelines.

The variation in grade pay assessment and irregular spacing between pay bands directly influences the quantum of fitment benefits. This inconsistency led numerous stakeholders to advocate for the implementation of a uniform fitment factor applicable across all employee categories.

The 7th Pay Commission established a standard fitment benefit of 2.57 applicable to all central government employees. This factor resulted in raising the minimum basic pay to ""Rs 18,000"" monthly from the previous ""Rs. 7,000"" (2.57 times the basic remuneration under the 6th Pay Commission).

A practical demonstration helps explain how public sector workers can determine their revised salary using the fitment factor set by the 8th Pay Commission. Consider a scenario where your current basic pay is Rs 40,000 monthly, and let’s assume that the 8th Pay Commission suggests a fitment factor of 2.5. This calculation would raise your basic salary to Rs 1 lakh per month.

Initially, dearness allowance remains excluded, as per typical pay commission guidelines. The dearness allowance component gets incorporated into the salary structure during subsequent years, following pay commission recommendations. Additional allowances might undergo modifications based on the pay commission's directives.

8th Pay Commission latest news : In good news for central government employees, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has given its nod for the constitution of the 8th Pay Commission. With this, central government employees can look forward to a salary hike.PM Modi shared on X: ""We are all proud of the efforts of all Government employees, who work to build a Viksit Bharat. The Cabinet's decision on the 8th Pay Commission will improve quality of life and give a boost to consumption.""The decision comes months after the dearness allowance for central government employees crossed 50% of central government employees' basic salary. From July 1, 2024, central government staff and pensioners have been receiving 53% of their basic pay as dearness allowance/relief, with the next adjustment scheduled for January 2025.The current salary structure, based on the 7th Pay Commission's guidelines implemented from January 1, 2016, will be updated after the 8th Pay Commission recommendations. ET consulted experts regarding potential salary increases, considering historical pay commission recommendations.Krishnendu Chatterjee, TeamLease Vice President, was quoted as saying, ""The Last Pay Commission was established in 2016, which recommended the minimum pay jump from 7,000 per month to 18,000 per month with a fitment factor of 2.57 times of basic pay. The maximum ceiling is 2.5 lakhs per month. Considering the inflation factor, there are indications that the fitment factor may stay between 2.5- 2.8 times, which will give a significant boost to employee salaries between Rs 40,000 and Rs 45,000. There are also suggestions of Performance based pay hike which are still under deliberation.""Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: Cabinet approves constitution of 8th Pay Commission; central government employees eye pay hike According to Rohitaashv Sinha from King Stubb & Kasiva, ""Pay commissions are in most cases established every 10 years to assess and provide changes to the remunerations of central government employees. The last pay commission, i.e. the 7th pay commission took effect in January 2016 and gave a raise on the minimum basic pay from Rs 7000 to Rs 18000 using the fitment factor 2.57. In the 8th Pay Commission, it is believed that the increase the minimum basic pay will be an astonishing 186%. This may make the minimum basic pay to INR 51,480 per month. It seems that the fitment factor for it is 2.86. The changes are likely to be implemented through the Central Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2025 and may lead to enhanced pension and other retiral benefits such as EPF, Gratuity etc. and recommend changes in salary structures for government employees.""SKV Law Offices' Senior Associate Nihal Bhardwaj explains that historical data suggests central government staff might receive a 25-30% pay rise under the 8th Pay Commission. The 6th Pay Commission (Effective from January 1, 2006, covering the period 2006–2016) utilised a 1.86 fitment factor, delivering a 40% increase in wages, whilst the 7th Pay Commission (Effective from January 1, 2016, covering the period 2016–2026) employed a 2.57 fitment factor, yielding approximately 23-25% higher salaries.Staff associations are currently pushing for a fitment factor between 3.0 and 3.5, which could potentially elevate the minimum basic salary from Rs 18,000 to roughly Rs 25,000–Rs 26,000. Such adjustments would result in substantial improvements across all pay grades, he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has given its nod for the constitution of the 8th Pay Commission.

Amit Shah warns against misuse of BNS in booking suspects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-warns-against-misuse-of-bns-in-booking-suspects/articleshow/117342190.cms,"NEW DELHI: Holding consultations with Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav here on Friday on the full rollout of new criminal laws in the state, home minister Amit Shah emphasised on the police getting go-ahead from their senior officers before applying sections related to terrorism and organised crime in cases registered under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Warning that any misuse of legal provisions to book suspects on serious charges like terrorism etc could undermine the sanctity of the new criminal laws, Shah said senior police officials should examine whether the case in question qualifies for application of BNS sections relating to terrorism and organised crime. To ensure transparency for both the victim and accused, Shah asked the police to provide information about individuals detained for interrogation, details of seizures made and cases sent to courts, on an electronic dashboard.While reviewing implementation of the three laws and current status of provisions related to police, prisons, courts, prosecution and forensics with the Madhya Pradesh chief minister in the presence of DGs of NCRB and BPRD, Shah called for 100% rollout of BNS, BNSS and BSA in the state at the earliest. He directed review of the progress on this front on a monthly basis by the chief minister, fortnightly basis by the chief secretary and on a weekly basis by the DGP.Shah stressed on initiation of ' trial in absentia ' in national security-related cases, against fugitives who have been absconding from the country for a long time. Section 355 and 356 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) allow trial and pronouncement of judgment in the absence of the accused in the interest of justice, which was not provided under the erstwhile Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).Shah noted during the review that the essence of the new criminal laws lies in the provision of delivering justice within three years, from the filing of an FIR till verdict of the Supreme Court.The home minister told Yadav that conversion of 'zero FIRs' into regular FIRs should be continuously monitored, and transfer of FIRs between two states ensured through CCTNS (crime and criminal tracking network & systems). Amit Shah added that at least one forensic science mobile van should be deployed in every district and adequate number of cubicles constructed in hospitals and jails to facilitate recording of evidence via video conferencing.Terming legal aid to poor undertrials as the govt's responsibility, Shah emphasised on the need for a robust legal aid system to ensure justice for the underprivileged, along with necessary training for this purpose.On the provisions for electronic evidence in the new laws, Shah suggested that the state's home and health departments provide post-mortem and other medical reports electronically.Union home minister also urged establishment of a system where officials from other states can visit Madhya Pradesh to understand the successful implementation of e-summons there.To upgrade its forensic capabilities, the home minister suggested that the state govt sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Forensic Science University to create adequate, trained forensic manpower.",Home minister Amit Shah held consultations with Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav on the full rollout of new criminal laws. Shah emphasised on the police getting go-ahead from their senior officers before applying sections related to terrorism and organised crime in cases registered under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117342191,imgsize-983133,width-400,resizemode-4/117342191.jpg"

His company Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) was later sold to JSW group for Rs 19,350 crore after banks filed applications under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code to recover loans.The banks, after recovering Rs 19,350 crore, still suffered a loss of about Rs 28,000 crore.

Supreme Court: PMLA accused in jail for over a yr without chargesheet can be given bail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-pmla-accused-in-jail-for-over-a-yr-without-chargesheet-can-be-given-bail/articleshow/117342491.cms,"Affidavit not vetted through proper channel, something ‘fishy’ in way it was filed, says ED

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday said an accused who had spent one year in jail and charges had still not been framed in the money laundering case against that person could be considered for bail as per its verdict in the Senthil Balaji case .SC has been granting bail to accused in money laundering cases after reading down the stringent bail provisions of PMLA by ruling that delay in trial and long incarceration could be grounds for grant of bail. But till now, it had not specified the period beyond which a PMLA accused could not be kept in custody. The time-frame of one year will help bring uniformity for courts to deal with bail pleas.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan clarified the one-year period while hearing the bail plea of Arun Pati Tripathi , an accused in the Chhattisgarh excise case who was arrested by ED on Aug 8 last year. As he has spent only around five months in custody, the court expressed reservation in granting bail.Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora and advocate Mohit D Ram, appearing for the accused, pleaded that he had actually spent 18 months in jail as Enforcement Directorate (ED) had taken him in custody in Aug and before that, he was in jail for a predicate offence. However, the bench said it could not be considered for grant of bail and agreed to examine the issue on Feb 5.The apex court's verdict in the Senthil Balaji case had held that stringent provisions such as Section 45(1)(iii) of PMLA could not become a tool to incarcerate accused without trial for an unreasonably long time and it did not confer power on the state to detain an accused for a prolonged period.The hearing witnessed an unexpected turn at the outset as additional solicitor general S V Raju, appearing for ED, told the bench that an affidavit filed by the agency in court was not vetted through the proper channel. He said there was something ""fishy"" in the way the affidavit was filed and asked the ED director to hold an inquiry.The court expressed surprise that the agency could disown its own affidavit and questioned the role of the advocate-on-record through whom documents are filed in SC. However, the senior law officer clarified that the AoR filed what he was given by the department and the fault lay within the agency. The court thereafter asked ED's AoR to appear before it.Later, Raju said while the person handling filing work, being new to the job, may not have followed the procedure fully, the affidavit contained all valid arguments and grounds. The ASG and solicitor general Tushar Mehta gave a clean chit to the AoR.","SC has been granting bail to accused in money laundering cases.

NEW DELHI: Highlighting the potential of the middle class and youth in fuelling car sales, PM Narendra Modi on Friday asked the auto industry to focus on both ""economy and ecology"" as he sought to push green mobility through electrics, hydrogen fuel cells , and biofuels .Inaugurating the second edition of Bharat Mobility Global Expo , Modi told industry players they should not only make in India for the domestic market but also look to export across the globe. ""Our mobility solutions should be common, connected, convenient, congestion-free, charged, clean and cutting-edge. Our focus on green mobility is part of this vision,"" Modi said, with auto industry CEOs in attendance.His pitch was also linked to India's economic strategy. ""We are building a mobility system that supports both economy and ecology. A system that reduces our import bill of fossil fuels. Therefore, we are focused on development of green technologies such as EVs, hydrogen fuel and biofuels,"" the PM said.Modi said govt has been pushing the sales of EVs with its focus on promoting sustainable solutions. ""We are constantly taking policy decisions to expand electric mobility in the country, (and) supporting the industry."" The PM said campaigns like National Electric Mobility Mission and Green Hydrogen Mission were initiated with these goals in mind.He said various measures have resulted in giving a push to sales of EVs.""For the last few years, India has witnessed rapid growth in electric mobility. In the last decade, electric vehicle sales have increased 640 times. Ten years ago, only around 2,600 electric vehicles were sold in a year, but in 2024, more than 16.8 lakh vehicles were sold. That is, today twice as many electric vehicles are being sold in a single day as were sold in a whole year 10 years ago. It is estimated that by the end of this decade, the number of electric vehicles in India can increase up to 8 times. This shows how much the possibilities are increasing for you.""Speaking about the demand in the automobile sector, he said that a young population will fuel the demand for new vehicles. ""Needs and aspirations are very important for the development of the auto industry. And fortunately, both are vibrant in India today. India is going to remain the youngest country in the world for the next several decades. This youth is your biggest customer.""He said that the middle class is another key enabler for sales. ""In the last 10 years, 25 crore Indians have come out of poverty. This neo middle class is buying its first vehicle. As progress happens, they will also upgrade their vehicles. And the auto sector is sure to benefit from this.""He said the auto industry grew by 12% last year. ""India's largest youth population, the ever-growing scope of the middle class, rapid urbanisation, modern infrastructure being built in India, affordable vehicles from Make in India, all these factors are going to push the growth of the auto sector in India, are going to give it new strength.""He said exports are also increasing. ""The population of many countries of the world is not as much as the number of vehicles being sold in India every year. Nearly 2.5 crore vehicles being sold in a year. It shows how the demand is constantly increasing. This shows why India is being looked up to with so much hope when it comes to the future of mobility.""The PM said govt is focused to deal with the challenge of global warming and climate change, and thus is promoting solar power and alternative fuel.""India has emphasised a lot on a green future during its G-20 presidency. Today, along with EV, work is going on at a very large level regarding solar power in India...

No import allowed of refurbished medical devices: Regulator,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-import-allowed-of-refurbished-medical-devices-regulator/articleshow/117341984.cms,"Poll Do You Believe Refurbished Devices Can Maintain Quality? No, They Lack Reliability Yes, With Proper Regulations

NEW DELHI: Import of second-hand or refurbished medical devices is not allowed, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has said. In a letter sent to the office of the principal commissioner of Customs recently, it has asked Customs dept to not release such devices from the port of entry.The letter, a copy of which is with TOI, said there is no specific provision for regulation of refurbished medical devices under the Medical Devices Rule, 2017.Hence, it said, no licence is issued for import of such devices, and it cannot be imported into the country for sale and distribution.While proponents of this policy said import of refurbished equipment help keep cost of care in check, those against it are of the view that the policy poses serious risks to patient safety and reliability of the tests performed.According to the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry , nearly 60% of the Rs 40,000 crore of imports of medical electronic equipment is estimated to be of pre-owned equipment. ""A stop to import of refurbished medical equipment is a true policy intervention that will guard domestic industry against dumping of equipment with uncertain quality and will help patients in receiving appropriate medical care. This is a welcome and much awaited long due intervention,"" said MD of AMTZ, Visakhapatnam, Dr Jitendra Sharma.Founder-partner of City Imaging & Clinical Labs, Dr Aakaar Kapoor, said refurbished machines have significant concerns regarding radiation emissions, which can pose harm to patients. The newer imaging systems are designed to emit significantly lower radiation, addressing concerns around exposure during scans, Kapoor added.While med-tech companies favoured the move, saying it would promote local manufacturing and the use of updated machines, hospitals and diagnostic facilities said it could increase investment and, therefore, the cost of care. ""Cost of imaging tests is lower in India as compared to developed nations. One of the reasons behind this is the utilisation of refurbished machines. Instead of banning their use, govt should bring in regulations to ensure that devices are up to date,"" said the owner of a Delhi hospital .",The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has asked Customs dept to not release such devices from the port of entry.

Paradise to peril

Coastal crisis deepens

Beachcombing was synonymous with Sujith's childhood in the sun-kissed shores of Shankumugham in Thiruvananthapuram. The beach was a magnet for family gatherings for shindigs on a sprawling stretch of ochre sand. The Indian Coffee House was an added bonus.The lapping of waves against Kerala 's sandy shores once promised timeless beauty, often the backdrop of postcards and a favoured retreat for travellers. Fast forward to 2025, and the state's idyllic beaches are under siege, with Shankumugham shrinking to a mere patch in 30 years since Sujith's playtime days.Today, these shores tell a tale of relentless erosion, rising sea levels, the ravages of sand mining, and communities struggling to hold onto their seafront homes. Over 55% of Kerala's 590km coastline is now ""vulnerable to erosion"".Two major studies in recent years, one by the National Centre for Coastal Research and another by the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), have painted a stark picture of Kerala's coastal future.According to INCOIS, more than 300km of the state's coastline fall into high and medium vulnerability categories, with some areas experiencing erosion at rates as high as six metres a year. This rapid erosion threatens not only the natural landscape but the livelihoods and homes of more than 9.3 million people spread across nine coastal districts.In regions like Kannur, Kochi, Alappuzha, and Kasaragod, the encroaching sea is a daily reminder of vulnerability. Beaches in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Malappuram, and parts of Thrissur have already vanished or are in the process of disappearing.This accelerating loss is exacerbated by the warming Arabian Sea, which has led to an increase in cyclonic events and sea surges, particularly from May to Aug, with a peak in June and July.The human cost of this environmental crisis is immense. Many coastal communities have been displaced, their homes swallowed by the sea, leaving behind a trail of economic and emotional distress.For as long as anyone can remember, fishing communities along Alappuzha's coast have lived by the saying ""Kadalamma chatikkilla"" - the sea mother won't deceive. But as the shoreline erodes, that ancient faith is faltering. Sand mining, the silent thief, has stripped the beaches, forcing many to abandon their ancestral homes. Over 600 houses have crumbled into the sea's maw, and poverty grips the fisherfolk tighter each day.""I know no life but fishing,"" said Kalesh, a fisherman from near Thottappally harbour, watching the sea that once nurtured his community now gnaw at it. His parents live next door in a house built after the 2004 tsunami swept away their old one, but even this home bears the scars of erosion.""The catch has dwindled,"" Kalesh's mother Sura said. ""And there's no beach left to haul our boat ashore."" Their blue boat rests awkwardly in their yard, a silent testament to the changing tides.K C Sreekumar from Alappad recalled a time when the coastal stretch from Azheekkal to Vellanathuruth spanned 89sq km in 1955. By 2004, it had shrunk to a mere 7sq km. The once-thriving Alappad market, where small ships anchored, is now a shadow of its former self, as the sea continues its relentless advance.Many families have been forced to relocate, some never returning to their original homes. Others, constrained by financial limitations or fear of starting anew elsewhere, have chosen to stay, clinging to what remains of their lives along the coast.Businesses dependent on tourism are struggling to stay afloat. Aneesh, who runs Jeevan Beach Resort in Kovalam, said: ""Earlier, the beach had a width of 30m. Now, it is only 10m and hasn't been restored fully for the past two years. It affected the inflow of tourists, especially foreigners. Now, they come and check out the very next day. Earlier, they used to stay here for three months. Kovalam has lost its glory.""The waves have ""swallowed the walkway"" and tourists are vanishing, leaving local business owners like Senthil K, Jose Franklyn and Biju to struggle with plummeting sales. ""My sales have dropped by 70%,"" souvenir shop owner Senthil said. The once ""vibrant spot"" is now deserted, prompting desperate calls for urgent govt action to ""save the beach and our businesses"".Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS) recently highlighted the scale of the crisis. From 2012 to 2021, the state experienced 223 sea surge events, with Alappuzha facing the highest number at 105, followed by Ernakulam (64) and Thrissur (54).Central Kerala, the hub of marine trade and tourism, is particularly vulnerable, experiencing an average of 12 hazard events for every 10km. Areas such as Eriyad, Azhikode, Chellanam, Ambalappuzha, Purakkad, Kuzhupilly, and Vadanapilly are now categorised as high-hazard zones due to a combination of sea surge inundation, sea-level rise, and severe erosion.""South and central Kerala are more susceptible because of their sandy coasts, unlike the rocky shores in the north,"" said Girish Gopinath, head of climate variability and aquatic ecosystems at KUFOS.The primary reasons cited for these changes are inadequate scientific planning of coastal infrastructure and the effects of climate change.More than 50% of Kerala's coastline is lined with artificial structures such as groynes, various types of seawalls and fishing harbours, in addition to ports. Groynes typically consist of wooden or concrete barriers, built perpendicular to a shoreline to prevent erosion, trap sand, and protect beaches from the impact of waves and tides.However, such structures have proved counter-productive, particularly in the south, where sediments are often washed away by littoral currents that flow parallel to a shoreline. According to Gopinath, this structural interference with natural sediment flows has intensified erosion, leaving areas like Cherthala and Ponnani exposed to the sea's relentless encroachment.""There is a phenomenon where seawater overtops into the shore, bringing with it large amounts of sediment. Unfortunately, due to choked and encroached canals, there is no way for the water and mud to flow back, exacerbating the problem,"" he said.Kerala University geology professor E Shaji pointed to the acute shortage of sediment supply from rivers, exacerbated by dredging, sand mining and sediment trapping by dams, as a major contributor to the problem. ""It would take at least five years to revive a beach,"" he said.As Kerala battles against nature and neglect, experts agree that an aggressive coastal management plan is critical.

They, however, seem to have been followed more in the breach. Section 306 IPC appears to be casually and too readily resorted to by the police. While the persons involved in genuine cases where the threshold is met should not be spared, the provision should not be deployed against individuals only to assuage the immediate feelings of the distraught family of the deceased,"" Justice Viswanathan, who penned the verdict for the bench, said.

It is time investigating agencies are sensitised to the law laid down by this court under Section 306 so that persons are not subjected to the abuse of process of a totally untenable prosecution. Trial courts also should exercise great caution and circumspection and should not adopt a play it safe syndrome by mechanically framing charges, even if the investigating agencies in a given case have shown utter disregard for the ingredients of Section 306,"" the bench said.Referring to earlier verdicts of the apex court, the bench said the intention of the accused to aid or to instigate or to abet the deceased to commit suicide was a must for attracting Section 306. It also said a word uttered in a fit of anger and emotion without intending the consequences to actually follow could not be said to be instigation.""In order to bring a case within the purview of Section 306 IPC there must be a case of suicide and in the commission of the said offence, the person who is said to have abetted the commission of suicide must have played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore, the act of abetment by the person charged with the said offence must be proved and established by the prosecution before he could be convicted under Section 306 IPC,"" it said.The court passed the order while discharging a person and noted that exchanges between the accused and the deceased were heated but it wasn't with intent to leave the deceased with no other option but to commit suicide.

NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: "" Sab sawaal ahamiyat rakhte hai, jawaab toh banta hai; aadatan kalam band jawaab dete rahe, aaj rubaroo toh banta hain.Kya pata kal ho ya na hon, aaj jawab banta hai ( All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain.

There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5.

Born on January 12, their second daughter, Golden Raye Mahomes , was met with immense fanfare across social media, as congratulations poured in for one of the most beloved couples in sports.Among the flood of well-wishers was Taylor Swift, who has grown closer to Brittany Mahomes since her relationship with Chiefs star Travis Kelce began in 2023.

The Cheetah Strikes First! Tyreek Hill Touchdown

Tyreek Hill loves to change his course of action. First, it was from the NFL to the $1.7 trillion global clothing market. Now, it's Miami Dolphins to Tampa Bay Buccaneers . It’s like, he’s volatile wherever he’s at.The owner of thestore made everyone go bonkers with his recent tweet on the X platform:It read: “3 hour drive to Tampa about to be a breeze”One X user corrected Hill and wrote, “Sir it’s a 5 hour drive from Miami”Another X user celebrated Hill’s visit and wrote, “You signing with us? That would be 🔥! Tyreek Hill, Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, and J Mack would light up defenses nonstop. Baker Mayfield would have a field day.”A third X user could not believe his or her eyes and wrote, “Wait what…😂 I mean Evans, Godwin, McMillian and Hill. Be like 2020 all over again. Also If you make it in 3 hours that's impressive.”A fourth X user foresighted a bright future and wrote, “You’d have 2000 yards with Baker at QB”Lastly, an X user, who wanted Hill to go after the Patriots, wrote, “3-hour flight to New England. Drake Maye can throw it deep!”The Cheetah has not confirmed his jungle’s name but has left us with a few guesses to make. If not Miami Dolphins, then where could be Tyreek’s new home?Was it the New England Patriots? With a cap space of 132 million dollars? There’s enough room for the wide receiver.Covers said Commanders appear to be in a four-way tie for the odds of the Cheetah’s presence in their franchise. Others in the four-way tie are the Atlanta Falcons, the Las Vegas Raiders, and Los Angeles Chargers. The Washington Commanders have a cap space of 103 million dollars for Hill.Or, if the Kansas City Chiefs want their breathtaking touchdown by Cheetah repeated?WR Tyreek Hill could also be the extra wheel for Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins' magic in the Cincinnati Bengals, but it's up to the Cheetah.Maybe, Tyreek Hill is considering the Tampa Bay Buccaneers - looking at his Thursday’s X post. There’ s Shaquil Barrett there in the Bucs.

Tiktok Ban: US top court upholds law banning TikTok if it's not sold by its Chinese parent company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-top-court-upholds-law-banning-tiktok-if-its-not-sold-by-its-chinese-parent-company/articleshow/117337615.cms,"The US Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the ban on TikTok, set to take effect Sunday unless the app is sold by its China-based parent company .The court ruled that the national security risks linked to TikTok's connections with China outweigh concerns about restricting free speech for the app's 170 million US users.The White House reacted to the decision saying, ""The Administration, like the rest of the country, has awaited the decision just made by the US Supreme Court on the TikTok matter. President Biden's position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the President's desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law. Given the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday.""Donald Trump welcomed the decision and said, ""The Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!""The decision comes amid political tensions involving President-elect Donald Trump and the Biden administration. Trump has pledged to negotiate a solution, while Biden administration has indicated it will not enforce the TikTok ban starting Sunday, Biden's final full day in office.Trump, aware of TikTok's massive popularity and his own 14.7 million followers on the platform, is at odds with prominent Senate Republicans who criticize TikTok's Chinese parent company for failing to secure a buyer in time.Meanwhile, a sale of TikTok does not seem likely in the near future. While experts note that the app will remain on existing users' devices after the law takes effect on January 19, new downloads and updates will be blocked. According to the Justice Department, this will gradually make the app unusable over time.The US government has raised concerns that TikTok collects extensive user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, which could potentially be accessed by the Chinese government through coercion. Officials also warn that TikTok's algorithm could be manipulated by Chinese authorities to subtly influence content on the platform.In response, TikTok argues that the US has not provided any evidence showing that China has attempted to access American user data or manipulate content on its US platform.","US Supreme Court upholds ban on TikTok, set to take effect Sunday.

With Tom Brady becoming a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, imposing more restrictions on the production meetings and with some people talking about the possible end to the 10-year deal, his long-term career in broadcasting remains under scrutiny. His agent, Don Yee, however has stated that he intends to finish the remaining deal in FOX , meaning he will not be leaving the booth anytime soon.Tom Brady, who started broadcasting in 2024, will likely continue his broadcasting since his agent, Don Yee, said that he would fulfill his remaining 10-year contract. Brady announced his retirement last year, joining FOX's new No. 1 team along with Kevin Burkhardt . Even though he struggled at first, he has grown, which is important because he will be broadcasting the Super Bowl. Yee said Brady improved and started off in the new phase of his football career.“Tom has had a tremendous amount of fun working with Fox this year, and he’s really excited about the future with Fox and his growth on their team,” Yee told Ben Fischer about Brady. “And this year was the first year of a long relationship.”Former MLB executive David Samson had doubts and stated that Brady will not return for a second year as an NFL analyst for FOX due to his co-ownership of the Las Vegas Raiders. Brady signed a $375 million deal to become the network's lead color commentator for the next decade. However, he has received mixed feedback from viewers due to league rules preventing him from attending in-person or online production meetings on FOX.Speaking on the Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz he said, “I've previously said I'd put down big money that Brady will not finish his 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox, given all his various business interests away from broadcasting, including ownership.”Brady signed a 10-year, $375 million deal with FOX to become its top color analyst. Greg Olsen, who was a previous teammate of Burkhardt, took over the role after Brady took a year off. Olsen and Joe Davis drew praise.

The Future of Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Lies Uncertain With the Toronto Blue Jays After He Rejects Two Offers During the off Season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/the-future-of-vladimir-guerrero-jr-lies-uncertain-with-the-toronto-blue-jays-after-he-rejects-two-offers-during-the-off-season/articleshow/117334707.cms,"Does Vladimir Guerrero Jr.’s Future Lies Uncertain With The Toronto Blue Jays?

BIG REPORT: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Trade Talks HEATING UP... Could It Happen? (Blue Jays News)

It’s a really difficult spot to kind of envision them come to terms, and he’s not only turned down one contract offer, he’s turned down two over the last couple of months,

I don’t think he’s going to sign for anything less than $400, $450 million, and he’s kind of alluded to wanting in that range.

Are The Blue Jays Running Out Of Time For Vladimir Guerrero Jr.?

One of the most prominent names in the Toronto Blue Jays , Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has been making headlines with respect to his uncertain stint with the MLB team. Reportedly, the 25-year-old power hitter diverted media attention after he turned down two contract extension proposals despite being one of the main figures in the Blue Jays.One of the brightest stars in the MLB currently, the recent rumors around Vladimir Guerrero Jr.indicate the Toronto Blue Jays’ proposal has not met the expectations of the talented hitter.During a recent appearance on the widely watched podcast First Up TNS Blue Jays reporter Scott Mitchell spoke about the speculations surrounding the much-hyped negotiations with respect to Blue Jays and Vladimir Guerrero. He said-Mitchell further added-Reportedly, after the refusal of the contract extension by Vladimir Guerrero, the Toronto Blue Jays have become cautious in their approach. With the ongoing MLB off-season, recent deals including Paul Goldschmidt’s $130 million contract and Freddie Freeman’s $162 million deal have already set the bar. Unlike Goldschmidt and Freeman, Vladimir Guerrero is young and his potential as a baseball athlete needs no description.With spring training just around the corner and two offers already being rejected, Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s time with the Toronto Blue Jays is running out of time before free agency ends up being a looming inevitability. Once the 2025 season starts, the Dominican-American athlete’s price value could rise higher, which might lead to further complicating Blue Jays’ competition with the other MLB teams in the race.Delaying the extension will not only increase the likelihood of losing out on Guerrero but also limit Blue Jay's options to pivot. For a franchise that is striving to maintain a competitive arc in the AL East, the timing of this particular season could shape the long-term trajectory.","Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is one of the most prominent names in the Toronto Blue Jays.

5 reasons Donald Trump chose Sean Curran to lead Secret Service,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/5-reasons-donald-trump-chose-sean-curran-to-lead-secret-service/articleshow/117333120.cms,"Bill Burr Stand-up Monologue - SNL

1. A Trusted Ally in Trump’s Inner Circle

2. Experience on the Frontline

3. Commitment to Trump’s Security

4. A Break from Tradition

5. The Challenge of Reform

Sean Curran , President-elect Donald Trump ’s personal detail chief, has been tapped to lead the United States Secret Service, a decision reflecting Trump’s preference for loyalty over conventional qualifications. Curran, who has been a steadfast presence alongside Trump for four years, gained recognition for his bravery during an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.However, his appointment has drawn criticism due to his lack of senior managerial experience and absence from the Secret Service’s headquarters or the elite Senior Executive Service.Critics argue that overseeing Trump’s personal detail of 85 agents is vastly different from managing the Secret Service’s complex operations and vast budget. Curran’s promotion bypasses traditional pathways taken by past directors, raising questions about his readiness to tackle the agency’s systemic challenges.The Secret Service faces significant scrutiny after two high-profile security breaches in 2024. An independent panel from the Department of Homeland Security highlighted the agency’s need for sweeping reforms and criticised its “do more with less” culture. Outgoing Acting Director Ronald Rowe initiated modernisation efforts, but whether Curran will continue these reforms is uncertain.Five reasons Trump chose Sean Curran:Sean Curran has been by Donald Trump’s side for the past four years, leading his personal Secret Service detail. His loyalty and steadfast presence have earned the president-elect’s trust – a key factor in Trump’s decision-making. For Trump, personal connection often outweighs bureaucratic credentials, and Curran’s dedication to his security makes him the obvious choice.Curran’s leadership was tested during the tumultuous 2024 campaign, particularly during the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. His decisive actions in the face of danger cemented his reputation as a capable and courageous protector. For Trump, having someone who has demonstrated bravery under pressure is non-negotiable.Even after Trump left office, Curran’s role went beyond the usual duties assigned to a former president’s detail. With Trump remaining a high-profile target, Curran pushed for enhanced security measures, including advocating for additional resources and modernisation of protective operations. His commitment to Trump’s safety has been unwavering.Trump is not one to follow convention, and Curran’s appointment breaks with precedent. Unlike previous Secret Service directors who climbed the ranks through headquarters roles, Curran’s promotion reflects Trump’s preference for rewarding those who demonstrate loyalty and on-the-ground capability. Trump’s approach disrupts the traditional emphasis on administrative experience, focusing instead on personal rapport and trust.The Secret Service has faced criticism for operational lapses, particularly during high-stakes events. Curran steps into the role at a time when the agency requires reform and modernisation. While critics argue that Curran lacks the managerial experience for such a massive undertaking, Trump’s decision signals confidence in Curran’s ability to navigate these challenges.","Sean Curran has been by Donald Trump’s side for the past four years, leading his personal Secret Service detail.
