None in opposition can match PM Modi's dynamism: Indian American philanthropist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/none-in-opposition-can-match-pm-modis-dynamism-indian-american-philanthropist/articleshow/110162829.cms,"WASHINGTON: Observing that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the only leader talking about the future of India in his election speeches , a prominent Indian American philanthropist said none in the opposition camp can match his dynamism .In an interview with PTI, Suresh V Shenoy said with India's economy making great strides, the country is all about opportunities.“What I find in Indian elections is that Modi is the only guy who's talking about the future. He's talking about how to implement technology ,” said Shenoy, an IITian and a successful businessman.“I'm not necessarily a Hindutva guy per se. I think that's a narrative that sort of makes political talk. But look at what India has accomplished from an economic standpoint in the last 10 years. It's incredible. They're now the fourth largest economy in the world,” he said in response to a question.Yet there are 800 million underserved people in India who too have aspirations, he said. “So, India will continue to be a cauldron of opportunity for a very large population, whereas the rest of the world is a shrinking population.”“India is all about opportunities and the future and how do you capitalise on that? America is all about, okay, we've had this prosperity, we've had world leadership, how do we maintain that?” he said.Shenoy asked how many political speeches have people heard in the recent past in America, that talk about life in 2020, 2028, or 2032. “Very few. They're talking about what's happening today,” he said.“But if you're a leader, you should be able to paint a picture of what it's going to be like 10 years from now. Whereas in Indian politics, … the others (opposition) are trying, but I think they're sort of stumbling over themselves because they're not able to match Modi's dynamism,” Shenoy said.“I mean, he talks about what life is going to be four years from now or eight years from now. He's talking about leadership, not just Indian leadership, but national leadership. Even his message of one family, one world during the G20 and all that is very appealing to people. Now the rest of the world has to catch up,” he said.","Suresh V Shenoy said with India's economy making great strides, the country is all about opportunities. “India will continue to be a cauldron of opportunity for a very large population, whereas the rest of the world is a shrinking population,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110162815,imgsize-26746,width-400,resizemode-4/110162815.jpg"

On the same screen, there is news that India landed on the moon, and just after two seconds, the news is that a child died in an open gutter in Karachi,"" Kamal said.Highlighting the scarcity of fresh water in Karachi and the staggering number of children deprived of education, Kamal emphasized the urgent need for attention to Karachi's infrastructure and social welfare.

The two seaports operational in Pakistan since its inception, are both in Karachi. We (Karachi) are the gateway to the entire Pakistan, Central Asia to Afghanistan...For 15 years, Karachi was not given even a bit of fresh water. Even the water that came, the tanker mafia hoarded it and sold it to the people of Karachi,"" Kamal said.""We have a total of 48,000 schools, but a new report says that out of that 11,000 are 'ghost schools'. 70 lakh children in Sindh don't go to school and a total of 2,62,00,000 children in the country don't go to school...if we just focus on this, the leaders of the country shouldn't even get proper sleep,"" the Pakistani Parliamentarian added.Kamal also criticized the neglect of Karachi's development despite its pivotal role as Pakistan's economic powerhouse. He condemned the failure to provide basic amenities such as fresh water, which has exacerbated the city's challenges.Meanwhile, Pakistan is grappling with economic hardships, including high inflation and mounting debt. The government has sought a new loan program from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to address these pressing issues. Talks between Pakistan and the IMF are underway, with the IMF urging Islamabad to implement comprehensive reforms in the energy sector and tax system.Last month, Pakistan completed a short-term $3 billion program, that helped stave off sovereign default, however, the government has highlighted the need for a fresh, longer-term program, according to Dawn.","Pakistani lawmaker drew a stark disparity between India's space achievements and the pressing issues faced by Karachi.

Does Art 39(b) allow govt to take over your property?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/does-art-39b-allow-govt-to-take-over-your-property/articleshow/110161236.cms,"Not just an academic question

The trajectory of the case

What are the possibilities?

The real implications

A Gandhian vision of Article 39(b)

Amid polls to constitute the 18th Lok Sabha, the governing party and the opposition have clashed over a critical question — how much inequality is India willing to tolerate? In its manifesto, Congress has promised to conduct a nationwide caste census to determine the socio-economic conditions of various caste and sub-caste groups. Congress functionaries have taken umbrage to the unfair concentration of wealth in the hands of a select few individuals.BJP has hit back, accusing Congress of appeasement politics and termed this exercise an attempt to extract private wealth from individuals and redistribute it among minorities.The issue is philosophical: to whom do a country’s material resources belong? As this debate rages on in election rallies and across TV newsrooms, the Supreme Court is quietly preparing to answer this question. While deciding a seemingly innocuous set of property disputes originally filed in 1992, the SC has felt the need to re-interpret Article 39(b) of the Constitution, a directive principle of state policy which urges the state to make policies to ensure “that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as to best subserve the common good”.Generally, directive principles of state policy are unenforceable by a court of law. A member of the Constituent Assembly even described the entire part as a ‘dustbin of sentiment’. But Article 39(b) is different. It is underwritten by Article 31C — which provides that a law made by Parliament in furtherance of Article 39(b) is not invalid even if it violates fundamental rights such as equality and freedom of trade. It is worth mentioning that the linkage between the two provisions is also an issue before the Supreme Court in this very case.Of course, the expression ‘material resources’ must include public resources. The question is simple: does it include private resources as well?A recent study by the World Inequality Database has stated that wealth inequality in India is now higher than what it was during British rule in India. In light of this, Parliament could potentially enact a ‘wealth tax’ where all citizens with a certain net worth would be taxed 2% of their wealth. Challenging the law because it violates fundamental rights such as equality, life and personal liberty, and freedom of trade would be futile, because Article 39(b), backed up by Article 31C, would kick in.Another example includes a law to acquire all privately held forest land across the country and distribute it among tribal communities who are displaced by climate change, infrastructure projects, internal conflict etc. A mere reference in such an Act to Article 39(b) will save it from being struck down.The implications of this case go beyond the immediate political debate. Its significance lies in how the apex court interprets the constitutional guarantee of equality, and how much power it gives to the state to fulfil this guarantee. A restrictive interpre tation will assign the role of reducing inequality to the private market, hoping that ‘invisible hand’ will reach everyone. A broader interpretation will give greater powers to the state to interfere in private affairs to ensure proper redistribution of wealth.Underlying this provision is an assumption that the state may be better capable of ensuring equality. This may be true in some cases, but very false in others.During the hearings, CJI Chandrachud stated that Article 39(b) could not be interpreted in a purely communist or socialist sense. He seemed to detect a Gandhian flavour to the provision.It is hence likely that the SC will give us a more nuanced interpretation of Article 39(b). Private property may not be wholly excluded, but certain kinds of private property may be declared to be held in trust.The authors are with the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy",The Supreme Court is preparing to answer this question.

Judges can't dodge explainability of their decisions: CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judges-cant-dodge-explainability-of-their-decisions-cji/articleshow/110157792.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud on Wednesday told a gathering of Chief Justices of J-20 countries , the judicial counterpart of G-20 nations, that judges are neither princes nor sovereigns to dodge the critical responsibility of writing judgments which everyone can understand.Speaking on 'Digital transformation and use of technology to enhance judicial efficiency ' at the Rio de Janeiro J-20 summit in Brazil, Justice Chandrachud said, ""As judges, we are neither princes nor sovereigns who are above the explainability requirement ourselves.""This probably stems from his experience of reading past judgments of the SC and HCs, which though lucidly written, would be Greek and Latin to majority of averagely educated people of India, who would find it even more difficult to fathom the logic behind judgments running into hundreds of pages on important issues, the prime example being the landmark Kesavananda Bharati verdict of 1973.CJI said judges are primarily service providers and enablers of rights-affirming societies, that is to ensure a society governed by rule of law. ""The decision itself and the road leading up to it, must be transparent, understandable to everyone with or without a legal education and must be broad enough for everyone to walk alongside,"" he said.He was commenting on a paragraph from Alexander Bickel's 'The Least Dangerous Branch', which read: ""Judges are after all perhaps the only public functionaries who are perched on a raised platform, who punish for contempt, and make important decisions about the lives of others in discrete private chambers, without the fear of electoral losses""; and Ronald Dworkin's 'Law's Empire' which stated - ""the courts are capitals of law's empire and judges are its princes."" Explaining Indian judiciary's rapid strides to optimise use of information technology in justice dispensation, CJI Chandrachud said petitions can now be filed in the SC by the click of a button and that SC's case management system, developed on Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS), is the largest in the world.","CJI said judges are primarily service providers and enablers of rights-affirming societies, that is to ensure a society governed by rule of law.

28-week-old fetus' right to life trumps right to abort: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/28-week-old-fetus-right-to-life-trumps-right-to-abort-sc/articleshow/110157500.cms,"Can’t pass order contrary to

MTP Act

mandate: SC

NEW DELHI: Putting a premium on a 28-week-old fetus 's right to life , Supreme Court Wednesday declined a 20-year-old unmarried woman's plea to let her terminate her pregnancy, even though it had allowed rape survivors or minors to abort much beyond the 24-week outer limit prescribed under Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act. SC said, ""The child in the womb has a fundamental right to live.""When the woman’s counsel argued for permission to terminate the pregnancy saying she is highly traumatised because of social stigma, a bench of Justices B R Gavai, S V N Bhatti and Sandeep Mehta asked, “Her pregnancy is more than seven months old.How do you address the right to life of a foetus which is fully developed? The child in the womb also has a fundamental right to live.”The counsel said, “right of a child to live materialises only after it is born. The MTP Act only protects the mother’s well-being and health. The unmarried woman is highly traumatised and is unable to face society because of unwanted pregnancy.”But the right to life of a healthy 28-week-old foetus trumped the mother’s right to abort as the bench dismissed her appeal against the Delhi HC’s May 3 order. Justice Gavai-led bench said it cannot pass any order contrary to the mandate of MTP Act especially when the ultrasound report stated that the baby in the womb is fully developed and in fine health.Section 3 of the MTP Act provides that when the length of pregnancy is within 20 weeks it may be terminated by a registered medical practitioner if an opinion is reached in good faith that continuance of the same would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant women or cause grave injury to her physical or mental health or there is a risk to the child or that it will suffer from abnormalities.Justice Subramonium Prasad of Delhi HC had rejected her plea for termination of pregnancy: “Since the foetus is normal, and there is no danger to the petitioner to carry on with the pregnancy, feticide would neither be ethical nor legally permissible. The petitioner would have to be induced for delivering the child and such delivery could be detrimental to mental and physical health of the newborn since it would be a pre-term delivery. It could also be detrimental to the mother for her future pregnancies.”",Supreme Court declined a 20-year-old unmarried woman's plea to let her terminate her pregnancy. Court allowed rape survivors or minors to abort much beyond the 24-week outer limit prescribed under Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act.

The study analysed several studies conducted in high-income countries on the fallout of public hospitals being converted to for-profit or not-for-profit facilities and of services by public hospitals being outsourced.The paper published by researchers at the department of social policy and intervention in Oxford University reviewed studies from the US, Germany, the UK, Sweden, South Korea etc.It found that hospitals converting from public to private ownership status tended to make higher profits than public hospitals that do not convert, primarily through the selective intake of patients and reductions in staff numbers. The authors stated that their analysis provided evidence that challenges the justifications for healthcare privatisation and concluded that the scientific support for further privatisation of healthcare services is weak.The review found that the conversion reduced ""the comprehensiveness and generosity of care"". Privatised hospitals decreased their staffing levels, especially of the highest qualified nurses.

It is also argued that competition from private facilities improves performance across the entire health system as all providers are incentivised to deliver better quality services, especially in a single-payer or purchaser system when the pricesare largely fixed. However, the review noted that ""the profit motive might not always result in desired outcomes"". It pointed out that competitive markets could also discourage providers from revealing information on the quality of their services.""The evidence compiled here does not align with the expectations of mixed markets, namely that they would improve quality by increasing competition,"" stated the study, adding that the findings suggested that some areas of the welfare state, such as education and health care, might be structured in ways that make them less amenable to the kinds of incentives that operate in other markets.","The study analysed several studies conducted in high-income countries on the fallout of public hospitals being converted to for-profit or not-for-profit facilities.

Sethi on Wednesday claimed that there had been no fresh incidents of forest fire in the last three days and that as of today forest fires are continuing at three places.Sethi suggested setting up of a six-member expert committee to give comprehensive suggestions for a permanent mechanism to control forest fire in the state, but he was countered by amicus curiae K Parameswaran who informed the bench that there is already a National Forest Fire Plan and Uttarakhand Forest Fire Mitigation Policy of 2022, all of which are only on paper.Sethi then attempted to shift the blame on lack of funding from the Union government, to which the bench said there should be no problem for the Centre to release funds to the state, both being ruled by the same political party.Parameswaran and senior advocate Rajiv Datta said the main problem in tackling the recurring forest fires in the state is the large vacancies in the posts of foresters and forest guards, who are the first to detect fireand take remedial measures. The amicus said there are around 300 vacancies among 1,729 sanctioned post of foresters, and nearly 1,400 vacancies in the 3,650 posts of forest guards.""If the fire line is not cleared of inflammable pine needles prior to onset of summer season, the forest fires are bound to spread to large areas, as happened this year,"" Datta said. On a query from the bench, the state's principal chief conservator of forest V Mohan said an unprecedented dry spell for two months from March to May this year is a major reason for the forest fires. SC said that with climate change, such variation in weather conditions is likely to rise. Mohan said 1,250 vacant posts of foresters and guards have been filled and soon the other vacant posts will be filled up.","Justices B R Gavai, S V N Bhatti and Sandeep Mehta told state's deputy advocate general Jatinder K Sethi.

Fundamental right to be informed of grounds of arrest: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fundamental-right-to-be-informed-of-grounds-of-arrest-supreme-court/articleshow/110157014.cms,"NEW DELHI: Following the SC order finding the arrest and remand of NewsClick founder and editor-in-chief Prabir Purkayastha illegal, Patiala House Court ordered his release on bail bonds worth Rs 1 lakh, and on three conditions - he shall not contact witnesses and approvers in the case, he shall not talk about the merits of the case and he shall not travel abroad without the court's permission.Purkayastha was arrested by Delhi Police on Oct 3 along with NewsClick's HR head Amit Chakraborty for allegedly receiving illegal funding from China, routed through US with the intention of undermining India's sovereignty and territorial integrity.Writing the 41-page SC judgment, Justice Sandeep Mehta said Purkayastha's arrest, followed by the remand order of Oct 4 last year and Delhi HC's Oct 15 order validating the remand, were contrary to law and hence quashed. Non-intimation of grounds of arrest to Purkayastha and his counsel vitiated the arrest and remand order, he said.""There is no doubt in the mind of the court that any person arrested for allegation of commission of offences under provisions of UAPA or for that matter any other offence(s) has a fundamental and statutory right to be informed about the grounds of arrest in writing and a copy of such written grounds of arrest has to be furnished to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception at the earliest,"" the bench, which also comprised Justice B R Gavai, said.It turned down the argument of ASG S V Raju, and said the SC order in Pankaj Bansal case regarding the rights of the accused under PMLA - to be informed of the grounds of arrest in writing - applied also to those charged with offences under UAPA.""The purpose of informing the arrested person (of) the grounds of arrest is salutary and sacrosanct inasmuch as this information would be the only effective means for the arrested person to consult his advocate, oppose the police custody remand and seek bail,"" SC said.Elaborating on the mandatory duty of police to give written information on grounds of arrest, Supreme Court said it must inform the arrested person of ""all basic facts on which he was being arrested"" so as to provide him an opportunity to defend himself against custodial remand and to seek bail.

PUNE: The Maharashtra government has detected 91 instances of the novel Covid-19 Omicron subvariant KP.2 , which has surpassed the previously dominant JN.1 variant and is currently the primary driver of cases in several nations. Pune reported the highest number of KP.2 cases at 51, followed by Thane with 20 cases.Maharashtra first recognized KP.2 cases in January, and by March and April, it had become the predominant strain in the region.Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, the state's genome sequencing coordinator, noted that despite the rise in cases, there has been no corresponding increase in hospitalizations or severe cases. The slight surge in cases witnessed by the state in March, with an average of around 250 detections, is likely due to the spread of the KP.2 variant , which evolved from JN.1, the dominant Covid strain at the end of 2023.Apart from Pune and Thane, seven cases each were reported in Amravati and Aurangabad, while Solapur had two cases and Ahmednagar, Nashik, Latur, and Sangli had one case each of the KP.2 variant. Notably, no cases were reported from Mumbai.The recently identified group of variants, collectively known as ""FLiRT"", primarily consists of the KP.1.1 and KP.2 strains. The nomenclature of these strains is derived from the specific mutations they possess, with one strain containing mutations represented by the letters ""F"" and ""L"", while the other strain features mutations denoted by the letters ""R"" and ""T"". This subvariant was first identified globally in January and is now the dominant strain in the United States .A recent study conducted by Japanese researchers has revealed that the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, which is a descendant of JN.1, possesses three distinct substitutions in the S protein, including S:R346T and S:F456L, as well as an additional substitution in a non-S protein. These genetic changes have resulted in a notable difference in the reproduction number of KP.2 compared to its predecessor, JN.1.The findings indicate that the reproduction number of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively."" This suggests that KP.2 has a higher transmission rate than JN.1 in these countries. Surprisingly, despite its increased reproduction number, the study also found that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly lower than that of JN.1, with a 10.5-fold difference.The KP.2 variant of COVID-19 is spreading more rapidly compared to the KP.1.1 variant, which is another FLiRT variant. According to the most recent information from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), KP.2 accounts for 28% of COVID cases in the United States, while KP.1.1 cases make up only 7.1% of the total cases.Currently, the variants JN.1, JN.1.7, JN.1.16, and JN.1.13.1 are widely circulating throughout the United States.According to experts, individuals who have previously been infected with the JN.1 variant of COVID-19 may still be susceptible to reinfection with the KP.2 variant, especially if a significant amount of time has passed since their last infection.The most recent vaccine, which targets the XBB.1.5 variant, may not provide complete protection against KP.2 due to the notable differences between JN.1 and its descendants. A preliminary study by Japanese researchers, which has not yet undergone peer review or publication, suggests that KP.2 might be more effective at infecting individuals who have received the latest COVID vaccine.Despite these concerns, doctors emphasize that the vaccine still offers some level of protection, particularly against severe disease, as do previous infections. The CDC spokesperson stated that there is currently no evidence to suggest that KP.2 causes more severe illness compared to other strains. However, certain groups, such as those aged 65 and older, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems, remain at a higher risk of experiencing serious complications from COVID-19. The CDC has advised individuals aged 65 and older who have already received one dose of the updated vaccine to get an additional shot at least four months later.The most recent information regarding COVID symptoms and long-term effects suggests that the KP.2 and JN.1 variants, which currently account for approximately 16% of cases, likely cause symptoms similar to those associated with other variants. These symptoms include sore throat, runny nose, coughing, head and body aches, fever, congestion, fatigue and, in severe cases, shortness of breath. However, compared to the early stages of the pandemic, fewer people now experience loss of taste and smell. Patients who are often caught off guard by the fact that COVID can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which are sometimes mistaken for signs of norovirus.For individuals who have previously contracted COVID, subsequent infections tend to be as mild or milder than their initial case. Although the incidence of long COVID is lower now compared to the beginning of the pandemic, Fikadu Tafesse, a virus expert at Oregon Health & Science University, cautions that repeated infections increase the risk of developing long COVID.To stay safe from COVID-19, it is essential to adopt preventive measures such as wearing masks in crowded spaces, maintaining hand hygiene, practicing physical distancing, avoiding large gatherings and poorly ventilated areas, disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, staying home when feeling unwell, staying informed about local guidelines and supporting community vaccination efforts.By adhering to these practices, individuals can significantly reduce the risk of contracting and spreading the virus, contributing to the collective effort in mitigating the impact of the pandemic.","Pune reported the highest number of KP.2 cases at 51, followed by Thane with 20 cases.

""AI has been overriding the number of pitches we got in the last 12 months,"" Rajiv Srivatsa, partner at Antler, told TOI.In India, not many companies are building foundation AI models yet (like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini) but those like Bengaluru-based Sarvam AI and Bhavish Aggarwal's Krutrim AI that have managed to build them, have raked in millions from investors. Last year, Sarvam raised $41 million from investors including Lightspeed and Peak XV Partners in early stage funding, while Krutrim is valued at $1 billion. ""Foundational models require more capital. For apps, it's becoming difficult to differentiate given the pace of innovation in the core models,"" said Srivatsa.Several local startups are instead building AI-centric products and applications for enterprises and consumer centric businesses. For instance, India and US-based startup Attentive, which recently bagged a $7-million funding led by Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India is building an AI-based sales automation platform for outdoor services and construction industry.""AI is not a hype anymore.

A Florida man pleaded not guilty to driving under the influence-manslaughter after authorities said his pickup truck sideswiped their bus.Alicia Barcena , Mexico's foreign relations secretary, said via the social media platform X late Tuesday that all eight people killed were in the U.S.on H-2A farmworker visas. Florida farms use about 50,000 H-2A workers each year, more than any other state, according to the Florida Fruit & Vegetable Association.Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday morning that 44 of the farmworkers on the bus were Mexican citizens, hired by a Mexican-American farmer to work on the watermelon farm under temporary or seasonal visas. He did not release any more information on the victims, out of consideration for their relatives, he said.The Mexican consulate in Orlando was working to provide support at the AdventHealth Ocala hospital, where many of the injured were taken. The Florida Highway Patrol said names of the people who died would be released after relatives were notified.Andres Sequera, a director of mission and ministry for AdventHealth hospitals, said chaplains were visiting the injured workers, and they ""were in good spirits for what they have been through.""""We were able to provide support, presence, prayer when it was asked of us,"" Sequera told reporters.The Florida Highway Patrol arrested the pickup truck's driver, Bryan Maclean Howard, 41, on eight counts of driving-under-the-influence-manslaughter. The agency did not release more details, such as what substance allegedly left Howard impaired.Howard told a judge by teleconference from jail Wednesday morning that he's a self-employed painter and drywall installer with $700 in the bank, no other assets and no dependents. Howard's head was bandaged and he wore a protective gown typically given to inmates on suicide watch. The judge denied bond, appointed a public defender and set his next court appearance for next month.Howard later entered a written plea of not guilty.State records show he had previous arrests, accused of driving with a suspended license, leaving the scene of an accident and marijuana possession. It wasn't clear who might comment on Howard's behalf. Several phone numbers at residences linked to him were non-working.The accident happened at about 6:40 a.m. Tuesday, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Orlando as the workers were going to Cannon Farms in Dunnellon. Troopers say Howard was driving a 2001 Ford Ranger that crossed into the center line on State Road 40, a two-lane road that passes through horse farms. The vehicles sideswiped and the bus veered off the road, plowing through a fence, hitting a tree and rolling over.""Thank you to all who have reached out and offered condolences, help and prayers"" for the people hurt in the crash, Cannon Farms said in a post on its Facebook page that described the accident as happening at the Olvera Trucking Harvesting Corp., which contracted the workers to pick its watermelons.Cannon Farms, a family-owned operation that sends the melons to grocery stores across the U.S. and Canada, also said it would stay closed through Wednesday.No one answered the phone at Olvera Trucking after the crash. The company recently advertised for a temporary driver who would bus workers to watermelon fields and then operate harvesting equipment, at $14.77 an hour.A Labor Department document shows Olvera also recently applied for 43 H-2A workers to harvest watermelons at Cannon Farms this month, again at a base rate of $14.77 an hour, with promises of housing and transportation to and from the fields.The H-2A program allows U.S. employers or agents who meet certain regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals into the country to fill temporary agricultural jobs. Getting to and from the fields can be hazardous: Federal statistics show vehicle crashes were the leading cause of job-related deaths among farmworkers in 2022, the latest year available. They accounted for 81 of 171 fatalities.It was not immediately not known if the bus had seat belts. The Labor Department announced new seat belt requirements for employer vehicles used for farmworkers on temporary visas, among other worker protections that take effect June 28. Florida law already requires seat belts for farmworker transport using smaller vehicles, weighing less than 10,000 pounds. The Florida Fruit & Vegetable Association has been opposed to the new federal seat belt requirement, calling it ""impractical.""A GoFundMe campaign organized by the Farmworker Association of Florida to support accident victims and their families had raised about $20,000 of a $50,000 goal by Tuesday night. ""Farmworkers tend to be forgotten, but it's important not to forget farmworkers, especially during such difficult times,"" the post said.Two advocacy groups called for stricter laws and enforcement to protect farmworkers.""It is too easy to dismiss this as just another accident,"" said Asia Clermont, Florida director for the League of United Latin American Citizens. ""Florida must take every possible step to protect its essential workers, who are human beings and the backbone of the state's economy.""Ty Joplin of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers said transportation laws for farmworkers are often unenforced.""While accidents will happen, protecting workers while transporting them with mandatory and enforceable safety provisions, like seat belts and safety inspections, can reduce injuries and deaths,"" he said.","Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador says 44 of the farmworkers on the bus were Mexican citizens. Bryan Maclean Howard, 41, pleads not guilty to eight counts of driving-under-the-influence-manslaughter. The Florida Highway Patrol said names of the people who died would be released after relatives were notified.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110155208,imgsize-299025,width-400,resizemode-4/110155208.jpg"

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,' China trolls new US tariffs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/what-doesnt-kill-you-makes-you-stronger-china-trolls-new-us-tariffs/articleshow/110161464.cms,"'What doesn't kill you'

BEIJING: China's measured response to the US move to hike tariffs on $18 billion of Chinese goods from syringes to batteries suggests relations between the world's two largest economies face more frost rather than a fresh firefight over trade.China denounced the Biden administration 's action and vowed ""resolute measures"" to protect its interests.But Beijing's response also suggests a new dynamic - and confidence - compared with 2018 when Trump-era tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods touched off an escalating trade war , analysts said.Among the differences between then and now: the Biden White House flagged potential measures to Chinese officials in advance and the tariffs target industries, including EVs and batteries, where the economic impact is limited and Chinese companies' dominance appears unassailable.In response to the tariffs, Chinese state media have shot back, accusing the United States of subverting its own free trade principles and taking action that threatens climate goals and will push up costs for American consumers.In essence, the argument goes, you are hurting yourself.That marks a break from the tone in 2018, when a Chinese negotiator said Washington was putting ""a knife to China's neck"" and state media had suggested extreme counter-measures like a boycott of US food imports or a sell-off of US bonds.""China can take the moral high ground,"" said Wang Huiyao, founder and president of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization, a think tank. ""It doesn't play around with those who break international standards and norms.""In the starkest language of its response, the Chinese commerce ministry said the White House had broken the spirit of an agreement to steady bilateral relations reached by Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden late last year in San Francisco.Biden has said he wants to win this era of competition with China but not to launch a trade war, and US officials have looked to engage Beijing on limited areas of cooperation, including climate change.China has time to punch back with targeted actions of its own before the tariffs go into effect, analysts said. But a lot has changed since the trade throwdown in 2018.In that year, Chinese automakers built just under 800,000 electric vehicles. By 2023, EV output had jumped by a factor of eight times, China had surpassed Japan as the world's biggest auto exporter and Chinese carmakers were cranking up expansion plans from Southeast Asia to Europe.Huawei, which had been crippled by US sanctions in 2019, has bounced back, spearheading demand for China-made chips and challenging Apple in the China smartphone business and Tesla for EVs.""What does not kill you makes you stronger,"" Xinhua said in a commentary on the US tariffs. ""It seems the famous quote applies to China's technology companies.""Beijing knew this round of tariffs was coming. In recent visits to China, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and others had drove home a message that China's industrial capacity to make more EVs, solar panels and batteries than its economy can absorb was a risk to American jobs and business.Chinese officials and state media have rejected that argument, saying the country's EV makers dominate because of innovation and supply chain advantages, not subsidies.The United States imported $427 billion in goods from China last year and exported $148 billion to the world's No 2 economy, a trade gap that has persisted for decades and become an ever more sensitive subject in Washington.Both 2024 presidential candidates are taking a tough line on China ahead of November's election, context Chinese officials understand, analysts said.""Does China really want to go to the mat fighting over these tariffs?"" said Sean Stein, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, who said the announced action was at the ""far low end"" of expectations.""The US rollout was restrained,"" he added.Beijing will also be considering who it would prefer to work with once the election is over.""The thing about this Biden initiative is that it is election driven,"" said Wang. ""It is different to what Trump did, as he had already been president for one year and so was pursuing a trade war, rather than election.""","China's measured response to the US move to hike tariffs on $18 billion of Chinese goods suggests relations face more frost rather than a fresh firefight over trade. China denounced the Biden administration's action and vowed ""resolute measures"" to protect its interests.

USCIS posts guidance on ‘X’ for the benefit of laid off H-1B workers – shows how they can remain in US beyond the 60 day grace period,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-h-1b-visas-guidelines-for-non-immigrant-workers-following-termination-of-employment/articleshow/110148057.cms,"USCIS in its guidance points out:

File an application for change of status :

File an application for adjustment of status:

Be the beneficiary of a nonfrivolous petition to change employer: USCIS explains,

MUMBAI: Just days ago, Tesla employees who were laid-off and were on H-1B visas took to social media frantically searching for a job. After all, H-1B workers get a grace period of only 60 days within which to find another job in the US (under an H-1B transfer process, where the new employer does the sponsorship and relevant paperwork).Today, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) posted on ‘X’ formerly twitter stating: When H-1B or other noncitizen workers are laid off, they may not be aware of their options and may wrongly assume that they have no choice but to leave the country within 60 days.While the guidance is not new, USCIS has made it more convenient for laid-off workers to get information at a glance, as it has collated together the various provisions. This guidance note is available on its site.TOI had earlier covered the other options available – such as transition to a visitor visa or a student visa. In its edition of November 5, 2022, Robert Webber, a US immigration attorney was quoted as saying: “If you do not have an H-1B transfer job offer lined up, after about 45-days, you could start the preparation for filing an I-539 application to change status from H-1B to B-2 to ‘buy time’ to transition out of the US. You will not have authorization to work on this visa, so this option is based on the assumption that you can support yourself during this period on your savings.” The B-2 visa is a visitor visa and the maximum stay is six months, but a few months extension is possibleRead also: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/it-is-a-double-whammy-for-laid-off-h-1b-employees-as-the-clock-is-ticking/articleshow/95325843.cms Later when USCIS broadened the parameters for backlogged skilled workers with approved I-140 petitions to obtain temporary work authorisation (employment authorisation document-EAD) for up to one year, under ‘compelling circumstances’, TOI in its edition of November 5, 2022, analysed how this could also help laid-off H-1B workers.While the compelling-circumstances-EAD has been in existence since 2017, very few could avail of it, as the standards were very strict. Cyrus Mehta, New-York based attorney had then told TOI “On June 14, 2023, USCIS relaxed the standard by allowing persons who have lived in the US with family for a significant amount of time to demonstrate that due to job loss they would be forced to sell their home, pull their children out of school, lose their health insurance and forced to relocate to their home country”.Read also: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/laid-off-workers-in-us-could-benefit-from-broadening-of-compelling-circumstances-norms/articleshow/101068686.cms When a non-immigrant worker’s (ie: H-1B employee’s ) employment ends, either voluntarily or involuntarily, they typically may take one of the following actions, if eligible, to remain in a period of authorized stay in the US:·File an application for a change of non-immigrant status;·File an application for adjustment of status;·File an application for a “compelling circumstances” employment authorization document; or·Be the beneficiary of a nonfrivolous petition to change employer.If they take one of the above actions during their 60 day grace period, their period of authorised stay can exceed 60 days. If the laid-off worker takes no action within the grace period, they and their dependents may then need to depart the US within 60 days, or when their authorized validity period ends, whichever is shorter.If the laid-off worker has a spouse who is holding a valid H-1B visa, he or she can become the dependent of this spouse (in other words obtain an H-4 visa. This is also possible if the spouse is holding an L visa (granted to those on an intra company transfer), the laid off H-1B worker can be the dependent spouse of an L visa holder. Some spouses of H-1B workers (such as those on track for a green card) can obtain work authorization. It is also possible for a spouse of an L visa holder to get work authorization. Or a laid off H-1B worker can transit to a student visa (F-1) or a visitor visa (B-1). USCIS cautions that non-immigrant visitors are specifically precluded from ‘performing skilled or unskilled labour’ in the US. Certain F-1 students, by regulation, may engage in limited employment.USCIS states that some workers may be eligible to file a self-petitioned immigrant visa application concurrently with an adjustment of status application. Examples of immigrant classifications that are eligible for self-petitioning include EB-1 (for those who can prove extraordinary ability) and EB-5 which is the investment linked green card program.

Pakistan's Gwadar port exposes China's Belt and Road failure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-gwadar-port-exposes-chinas-belt-and-road-failure/articleshow/110100113.cms,"'Investors thought Gwadar would become Dubai'

China investing heavily in its Belt and Road network

Gwadar performs worse than other new ports

CPEC hampered by political, economic instability

China learning from its mistakes in Pakistan

Unsustainable investment pushes countries into debt

In November 2016, Gwadar port symbolized stability, peace and prosperity for Pakistan — at least according to then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.""This day is the dawn of a new era,"" he told the opening ceremony crowd, which had gathered to witness a row of Chinese trucks arriving to load cargo onto the first-ever container ship to pass through the port.It was the official launch of the port's operations nearly a decade after its completion. The ceremony also marked the start of the prestigious China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), part of China's global collection of infrastructure projects and trade networks known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Yet today, nearly eight years later, this new era has yet to dawn. A DW analysis shows what went wrong.The idea behind the CPEC was to connect China's western Xinjiang province with the sea via Pakistan. This would shorten trade routes for China and help avoid the contentious Malacca Strait choke point, a narrow waterway between Malaysia and Sumatra that links the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Pakistan, meanwhile, would benefit from increases in trade, infrastructure and industry along the 2,000-kilometer corridor (1,240 miles), all financed by China.In addition to the already established port of Karachi, Gwadar was chosen to connect the corridor to the global shipping network. The small fishing city lies near the Iranian border, some 500 kilometers away from Karachi.Gwadar's recently built deep-sea port, completed in 2007 and handed over to a Chinese operating company in 2013, was to become the heart of the CPEC. It would be integrated into a new special economic zone that would transform Gwardar into a bustling port city.The port has potential, said Azeem Khalid, an assistant professor of international relations at COMSATS University Islamabad who studies Chinese investments in Pakistan. ""It is a natural deep-sea port which can host bigger ships than Karachi. It sits at the crossroads of the global oil trade. And it would consolidate China's regional interests,"" he told DW.At home, China has already proven it can transform sleepy fishing villages into economic powerhouses. Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone, is the best example. In just four decades, the city's population grew from around 60,000 inhabitants to more than 17 million today.""Back then, investors thought Gwadar would become the next Dubai,"" said Khalid.Pakistan is not alone in pursuing this vision. All over the world, governments are hoping to boost their economies through new and expanded ports and other infrastructure projects — and Chinese banks are more than willing to provide financing. Chinese companies often build and operate the ports as well.DW has collated information on at least 38 ports that have been built with Chinese investment since 2000; an additional 43 ports are planned or in construction. Seventy-eight existing ports also have Chinese stakeholders, DW found.These deals are lucrative for China, said Jacob Mardell, a former analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a German think tank, and a journalist covering the BRI.""This model almost kind of acts as a subsidy for Chinese companies,"" he told DW. He explained that Chinese banks loan money to governments that then give that money to Chinese construction companies and pay the loan back to the bank over time. This means the money essentially never leaves China, ""while the bill is ultimately footed by taxpayers in other countries.""One common pattern appears to be building new ports relatively close to already established ones, as is the case with Gwadar and Karachi. The new ports are often meant to supplement or replace the older, less efficient ones over time.This is also the case in Cameroon and Nigeria, for instance. In Cameroon, the newly built port of Kribi is set to replace the congested and far too shallow port of Douala, while in Nigeria, the port of Lagos is supplemented by the just-opened Lekki deep-sea port, less than 100 kilometers away. Both ports were financed and built by Chinese state-owned companies.Similarly, in 2017, the government of Sri Lanka granted China a 99-year lease and majority stake in its relatively new Hambantota port, which was originally intended to supplement the country's main port of Colombo.Lekki port received 26 ships in 2023, its first year of operation, according to ship tracking and maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic. It's a modest number compared to bigger ports — but Gwadar, despite being completed in 2007, has only logged 22 ships in its best year to date. It has also failed to attract any regularly scheduled deep-sea shipping lines.This means Gwadar processes almost no cargo that could generate income for Pakistan — or, for that matter, for the Chinese operating company. And it's no wonder: Gwadar is operating at very limited capacity. The port's three berths, where loading and unloading takes place, can handle 137,000 standard 20-foot shipping containers per year. In contrast, Karachi and its 33 berths can handle the equivalent of 4.2 million 20-foot containers per year.While ports like Kribi or Lekki are comparatively small, they outshine Gwadar, the supposed new centerpiece of trade for South and Central Asia.Khalid told DW that although Gwadar has the potential to eventually surpass Karachi, a lack of investment is holding it back. A $1.6 billion (€1.5 billion) expansion was promised in 2015, but little progress appears to have been made at the port since then. Much of the supporting infrastructure, including roads and railways needed to transport cargo to and from Gwadar, is also missing.Publicly, investors like the China Pakistan Investment Corporation still claim Gwadar port is ""becoming a focal point for trade and investment in the region."" But the empty port site suggests the opposite.Mardell and Khalid said that behind the scenes, both Pakistan and China have become disillusioned with the project.""Jobs promises were not met. Industrial promises were not met. The business opportunities for Pakistanis were not met,"" said Khalid. ""They [China] promised nine special economic zones. Not one is fully functional to date.""The of development in Gwadar broadly mirrors the situation in the rest of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. ""CPEC has had problems since its inception,"" said Mardell.Some of these problems are specific to the border region of Balochistan, where Gwadar is situated. It is among the poorest regions of Pakistan and has strong separatist militias that commonly carry out attacks, including some that have specifically targeted Chinese nationals. In turn, the militias have been violently suppressed by the Pakistani military.At the national level, Pakistan has been experiencing a severe economic crisis in recent years, and the country is still struggling to stabilize politically after the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022.""Since the political and security situation in Pakistan has deteriorated more recently, that's hampered CPEC even more,"" said Mardell.On the Chinese side, Mardell thinks decision-makers might have miscalculated.""When it comes to investment decisions, the Chinese are famously not risk-averse,"" he told DW. He says ""basically unlimited"" state backing for state-owned investment and construction companies, coupled with the political will to rapidly step up competition with Western economies, has led China to fund even very risky projects in less stable countries worldwide.""I just don't think they fully understood the situation in Pakistan going in,"" said Mardell, though he believes this might change for other projects going forward. ""I think they've learned from their mistakes with the BRI and with CPEC, and they're probably more reluctant to commit capital nowadays.""In the last few years, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, China's spending on BRI projects has slowed. But while the country may now be more selective in which projects it funds, it is starting to invest more again, with total BRI investment amounts having reached pre-pandemic levels.Still, countries like Pakistan are now stuck paying back large amounts of debt to Chinese lenders. ""Pakistan has to pay billions of dollars back in loans, because of reckless investments in the name of CPEC,"" said Khalid.Similar cases have previously led to criticism that China is conducting debt-trap diplomacy, allowing partner countries to go into unsustainable amounts of debt to gain political influence.Moreover, part of the revenue from the newly built projects also goes back to China.""China gets the lion's share of everything,"" Khalid said, referring to CPEC investments. With Gwadar port, for instance, 90% of the quite limited revenue goes to the Chinese operating company. The Pakistani government receives 10%, while nothing goes to the Balochi regional government.Mardell said that the CPEC and Gwadar port with it will likely continue despite all its issues.""There's no way that China will lose face and admit that it's a disaster. And pulling out of CPEC and abandoning Pakistan isn't an option now. They're in too deep, and Pakistan is too important an ally,"" he said.Instead, he thinks it's likely China will continue to drag its feet on large investments in Pakistan, but still show token amounts of effort to keep the project going.Yet, he said, there's still a chance for Gwadar. ""If the situation in Pakistan changes for the better, then maybe CPEC will make progress.""","Gwadar port was to become the heart of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The idea was to connect China's western Xinjiang province with the sea via Pakistan. Pakistan, meanwhile, would benefit from increases in trade, infrastructure and industry. But despite being completed in 2007, Gwadar has only logged 22 ships in its best year to date.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110101231,imgsize-834597,width-400,resizemode-4/110101231.jpg"

"Joe Biden and Donald Trump agree on presidential debates on June 27, in September",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-biden-and-donald-trump-agree-on-presidential-debates-on-june-27-in-september/articleshow/110155069.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on Wednesday agreed to hold two campaign debates in June and September - the first hosted by CNN, the second on ABC - setting the stage for the first presidential face-off in just weeks.The quick agreement on the timetable to meet followed the Democrat's announcement that he will not participate in fall presidential debates sponsored by the nonpartisan commission that has organized them for more than three decades.Biden's campaign instead proposed that media outlets directly organize the debates with the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees, with the first to be held in late June and the second in September before early voting begins. Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site, said he was ""Ready and Willing to Debate"" Biden at the proposed times.Hours later, Biden said he accepted an invitation from CNN to a debate on June 27, adding, ""Over to you, Donald. As you said: anywhere, anytime, any place."" Trump told Fox News Digital he accepted the invitation: ""I'll be there,"" he told the outlet. Soon after, they accepted a second debate on ABC.The swiftness with which the June 27 match-up came together reflects how each of the two profoundly unpopular candidates thinks he can get the better of his opponent in the showdown.CNN said that the debate would be held in its Atlanta studios and that ""no audience will be present."" It said moderators and other details would be announced later. Disagreements about moderators and debate rules were some of the very questions that prompted the formation of the Commission on Presidential Debates in 1987.The two campaigns and television networks had held weeks of informal talks on ways to circumvent the commission's grip on presidential debates, owing to years of complaints and perceived slights, according to two people familiar with the matter.Biden's campaign had proposed excluding third-party candidates, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., from the debates outright. Under the debate commission's rules, Kennedy or other third-party candidates could qualify if they secured ballot access sufficient to claim 270 Electoral Votes and polled at 15% or higher in a selection of national polls.CNN held open the door to Kennedy's participation if he or any other candidate met polling and ballot access requirements similar to the commission's.As recently as Wednesday morning, Trump expressed his desire for a large live audience.""I would strongly recommend more than two debates and, for excitement purposes, a very large venue, although Biden is supposedly afraid of crowds - That's only because he doesn't get them,"" Trump said. ""Just tell me when, I'll be there.""Trump has been pushing for more debates and earlier debates, arguing voters should be able to see the two men face off well before early voting begins in September. He has repeatedly said he will debate Biden ""anytime, anywhere, any place,"" even proposing the two men face off outside the Manhattan courthouse where he is currently on criminal trial in a hush money case. He also has been taunting Biden with an empty lectern at some of his rallies.Trump's campaign on Wednesday challenged the Biden campaign to agree to at least two other debates between the two candidates, beside the June and September dates. The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Biden's campaign has long held a grudge against the nonpartisan commission for failing to evenly apply its rules during the 2020 Biden-Trump matchups - most notably when it didn't enforce its COVID-19 testing rules on Trump and his entourage.Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon on Wednesday sent a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates to say that Biden's campaign objected to the fall dates selected by the commission, which come after some Americans begin to vote, repeating a complaint also voiced by the Trump campaign. She also voiced frustrations over the rule violations and the commission's insistence on holding the debates before a live audience.""The debates should be conducted for the benefit of the American voters, watching on television and at home - not as entertainment for an in-person audience with raucous or disruptive partisans and donors,"" she said. ""As was the case with the original televised debates in 1960, a television studio with just the candidates and moderators is a better, more cost-efficient way to proceed: focused solely on the interests of voters.""There was little love lost for the commission as well from Trump, who objected to technical issues at his first debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and was upset after a debate with Biden was canceled in 2020 after the Republican came down with Covid-19. The Republican National Committee had already promised not to work with commission on the 2024 contests.The Trump campaign issued a statement on May 1 that objected to the scheduled debates by the commission, saying that the schedule ""begins after early voting"" and that ""this is unacceptable"" because voters deserve to hear from the candidates before ballots are cast.The commission said in a Wednesday statement that ""the American public deserves substantive debates from the leading candidates for president and vice president,"" adding that its missing is ""to ensure that such debates reliably take place and reach the widest television, radio and streaming audience.""O'Malley Dillon said the debates ""should be one-on-one, allowing voters to compare the only two candidates with any statistical chance of prevailing in the Electoral College - and not squandering debate time on candidates with no prospect of becoming President.""Kennedy, in a statement, said ""Presidents Trump and Biden are colluding to lock America into a head-to-head match-up that 70% say they do not want. They are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win. Keeping viable candidates off the debate stage undermines democracy."" His campaign hasThe Biden campaign also proposed that the Biden-Trump debates this year be hosted by ""any broadcast organization that hosted a Republican Primary debate in 2016 in which Donald Trump participated, and a Democratic primary debate in 2020 in which President Biden participated - so neither campaign can assert that the sponsoring organization is obviously unacceptable: if both candidates have previously debated on their airwaves, then neither could object to such venue.""Those criteria would eliminate Fox News, which did not host a Democratic primary debate in 2020, and potentially NBC News, which did not host a GOP one in 2016 - though its corporate affiliates CNBC and Telmundo were co-hosts of one debate each that year.In teeing up the debates, both Biden and Trump traded barbs on social media - each claiming victory the last time they faced-off in 2020.""Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020, since then, he hasn't shown up for a debate,' Biden said in a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. ""Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal.""Trump, for his part, said Biden was the ""WORST debater I have ever faced - He can't put two sentences together!""The Democrat suggested that the two candidates could pick some dates, taking a dig at Trump's ongoing New York hush money trial by noting that the Republican is ""free on Wednesdays,"" the usual day off in the trial.The president first indicated he would be willing to debate Trump during an interview with the radio host Howard Stern last month, telling him that ""I am, somewhere. I don't know when. But I'm happy to debate him.""Biden indicated again last week that he was preparing to debate, telling reporters as he was leaving a White House event: ""Set it up.""",Biden's campaign had proposed that media outlets directly organize the debates with the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees.

Outrage as migrants accused of assaulting NYPD officers offered plea deals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/outrage-as-migrants-accused-of-assaulting-nypd-officers-offered-plea-deals/articleshow/110154408.cms,"In a controversial turn of events, five of the seven Venezuelan migrants accused of assaulting two NYPD officers in Times Square have been offered plea deals, sparking public outrage. The incident, which occurred on January 27, involved a violent confrontation caught on video, leading to charges of second-degree assault and obstruction of a government administration.The defendants, Ulises Bohorquez , Yohenry Brito , Edgarlis Vegas, Darwin Andres Gomez-Izquiel, Wilson Juarez, Yorman Reveron, and Kelvin Servita Arocha, were presented in front of Judge Laura Wood at the New York Supreme Criminal Court. During the altercation, Lieutenant Ben Kurian and Officer Zunxu Tian suffered injuries including lacerations, bruising, and substantial shoulder pain as they attempted to disperse a disorderly group outside 220 West 42nd Street.Judge Wood expressed particular frustration with Yohenry Brito, who has been described as the 'most culpable' among the accused. Brito faced additional scrutiny for being rearrested on petty larceny charges while on bail. Judge Wood sternly warned him, stating, ""I am furious that Mr. Brito was rearrested and charged with petty larceny while he was out on this case. If you jaywalk, if you jump a turnstile, if you do anything at all and I have to issue a warrant, you will not see the light of day until this case is over. Do I make myself perfectly clear?""The Manhattan District Attorney's office proposed plea deals whereby Bohorquez, Brito, and Gomez-Izquiel would serve a year in prison for pleading guilty to second-degree assault. Meanwhile, Arocha and Juarez were offered six months for obstructing government administration. Vegas and Reveron have yet to receive any deal offers.This legal development has drawn significant attention and criticism, particularly regarding the perceived leniency of the plea deals in relation to the severity of the charges. The defense attorneys have not accepted the offers, and Judge Wood has scheduled a return to court on June 18, where a trial date will be set if no agreement is reached.The case has raised broader questions about the handling of violent crimes involving migrants and the appropriate level of judicial response, particularly in high-profile incidents involving law enforcement officers.","Five of the seven Venezuelan migrants accused of assaulting two NYPD officers in Times Square have been offered plea deals.

"'Zombie' wildfires resurface in Canada, worsening US air quality",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/zombie-wildfires-resurface-in-canada-worsening-us-air-quality/articleshow/110154209.cms,"NEW DELHI: A troubling environmental occurrence has been reported in Canada with the emergence of so-called 'zombie' wildfires. These fires, known for their ability to smolder underground during the colder months, have resurfaced with the arrival of spring, causing significant air quality concerns in both Canada and the United States.CNN meteorologist Elisa Raffa detailed the nature and impact of these fires, saying, ""'Zombie' wildfires currently spreading through Canada are causing air quality issues in parts of the US."" This statement underscores the far-reaching effects of these wildfires, which, despite originating in remote Canadian forests, have the capacity to affect atmospheric conditions over a vast geographical area.The term 'zombie' wildfire refers to fires that do not extinguish completely but instead remain dormant under the insulating cover of snow and ice through the winter. With the onset of warmer weather, these fires reignite, fueled by dry conditions and abundant organic material left from the previous fire season.This phenomenon highlights the challenges posed by wildfire management in the context of global climate change. As temperatures rise and winters become milder, the conditions become more favorable for the persistence and resurgence of these fires. This presents a recurring threat to ecological stability, forest management, and public health due to the spread of smoke and particulate matter across borders, the CNN report said.The implications for air quality are particularly concerning. Smoke from these wildfires can travel thousands of kilometers, impacting air quality across continents and posing health risks to populations far from the original fire sites. This calls for increased international cooperation and innovative strategies in wildfire management and environmental protection to mitigate the impacts of these persistent blazes.As the situation develops, authorities on both sides of the border are monitoring the fires closely, and public health officials are issuing guidelines to help residents minimize exposure to smoke and poor air quality. The recurring nature of 'zombie' wildfires serves as a reminder of the ongoing and evolving challenges posed by environmental and climatic changes.","'zombie' wildfires are known for their ability to smolder underground during the colder months.

The Mount Vernon School assignment prompted students to evaluate Adolf Hitler's leadership qualities through a series of questions, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.Reportedly, students were asked to rate Hitler's characteristics as a leader using a rubric called the ""Mount Vernon Mindset."" One question inquired about Hitler's effectiveness as a ""solution seeker,"" while another questioned his ethical decision-making abilities.The options given along with the questions included “lacks evidence, approaching expectations, meets expectations, exceeds expectations” to describe the dictator.Parents voiced concern over the assignment's potential antisemitic implications and expressed worries that such questions could be interpreted as glorifying Hitler, the dictator of Nazi Germany responsible for orchestrating the Holocaust.Additionally, former students noted that they had not encountered similar questions during their time at the school.In response to the backlash, Mount Vernon School officials removed the assignment from the curriculum. Principal Kristy Lundstrom issued a statement explaining that the assignment aimed to explore World War II and deepen students' understanding of historical events, particularly Hitler's manipulation of fear in connection to the Treaty of Versailles.","Students were asked to rate Hitler's characteristics as a leader using a rubric called the ""Mount Vernon Mindset"" One question inquired about Hitler's effectiveness as a ""solution seeker,"" while another questioned his ethical decision-making abilities.

Trump has been on trial since April 15, facing 34 counts of falsifying business records related to payments made to Daniels before the 2016 election to prevent her from making allegations about their affair.The legal dispute escalated when Trump's attorney, Susan Necheles, questioned Daniels during cross-examination to challenge her credibility. ""This has been your profession for over 20 years, involving writing, acting, and directing adult films. You possess considerable experience in presenting fabricated narratives about sexual encounters as genuine, correct?"", Trump’s attorney had said.Despite facing grueling cross-examination from Trump's defense team, Daniels stood firm in defending her career in the adult entertainment industry.This is not the first time Daniels has expressed fear over the hush money scandal.

Cohen acknowledged his desire for Trump's conviction in the case. During the intense cross-examination, Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, raised questions about Cohen's social media activity, highlighting a post where Cohen said, ""Trump belongs in a cage."" When directly asked if he wished for Trump to be convicted, Cohen responded affirmatively with ""sure"", as reported by CNN.The former Trump aide admitted to exerting pressure on individuals such as attorney Keith Davidson in 2018 to falsify information regarding deals with Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels.

'Robotic transport system': Nasa announces plans to build first railway system on Moon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/robotic-transport-system-nasa-announces-plans-to-build-first-railway-system-on-moon/articleshow/110135829.cms,"Magnetic robots will be utilized in the FLOAT system, designed to levitate over a three-layer film track to minimize abrasion from lunar dust.

These robots will carry carts and move at a speed of around 1.61 kilometers per hour

The system aims to transport approximately 100 tons of material per day to and from NASA's future lunar base

FLOAT's primary objective is to provide transportation services in active astronaut areas on the moon

It will transport lunar soil and other materials to various lunar surface locations

The railway will also facilitate the transportation of larger quantities of materials and equipment between spacecraft landing sites and other areas

NEW DELHI: Nasa is preparing to send astronauts back to the moon and has announced its plan to construct first lunar railway system, known as FLOAT (Flexible Levitation on a Track). Engineers at Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California are currently developing the FLOAT system.According to Nasa's blog post, the project is designed to create a ""robotic transport system"" that will support the future lunar activities of astronauts visiting the moon, the space agency stressed on the importance of this transport system for the daily functioning of a sustainable lunar base in the 2030s.A robotics expert at Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Ethan Schaler said, ""We want to build the first lunar railway system, which will provide reliable, autonomous, and efficient payload transport on the Moon. A durable, long-life robotic transport system will be critical to the daily operations of a sustainable lunar base in the 2030’s, as envisioned in Nasa’s Moon to Mars plan and mission concepts like the Robotic Lunar Surface Operations 2 (RLSO2).Based on Nasa 's initial design, FLOAT will be exclusively for machines.Key features in FLOAT systemNasa 's blog post read, ""FLOAT will operate autonomously in the dusty, inhospitable lunar environment with minimal site preparation, and its network of tracks can be rolled-up / reconfigured over time to match evolving lunar base mission requirements.""It is worth mentioning that FLOAT will be integrated into Nasa 's Artemis program , which aims to return astronauts to the moon and reinstate human presence for the first time since 1972.The space agency has set a target landing date of September 2026 for placing astronauts on the lunar surface.","The system aims to transport approximately 100 tons of material per day to and from NASA's future lunar base.

"Pakistanis own 23,000 properties worth $11 billion in Dubai, reveal property leaks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistanis-own-23000-properties-worth-11-billion-in-dubai-reveal-property-leaks/articleshow/110156743.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Prominent Pakistani politicians, retired generals, bureaucrats, bankers and money launderers have been named in the latest property leaks containing details of individuals who own residential properties in upscale areas of Dubai. The combined value of these properties is around $11 billion.“Dubai Unlocked”, an investigative project by over 70 media outlets around the globe, has revealed ownership of hundreds of properties of prominent global figures, including corrupt politicians,money launderers and drug lords, in Dubai.The data covers records of residential properties from 2020 till 2022.Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaksowning 23,000 properties in Dubaiare President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly, former PM Nawaz Sharif’s son Hussain Nawaz, home (interior) minister Mohsin Naqvi’s wife, and several national and provincial lawmakers.While Zardari’s elder daughter, Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari, is a Dubai resident, his son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and daughter, Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, were listed as owners of four properties. Through her lawyers, Aseefa said that all assets owned by her in Dubai have been duly declared to the relevant authorities in Pakistan, including the electoral watchdog.The Pakistani list also features the late former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, former PM Shaukat Aziz, ex-army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa’s son, and more than a dozen retired army generals as well as a police chief, an ambassador and a scientist, all of whom owned properties either directly or through their spouses and children.The Altaf Khanani network, which was sanctioned by the US for involvement in money laundering, has also surfaced in the leaks. Moving illicit funds for organised crime groups, including drug cartels and violent terrorist organisations, the network raked in an estimated turnover of between $14 billion and $16 billion annually. Altaf Khanani, the international face of the organisation, was ultimately convicted and spent nearly six years in a US prison; he was blacklisted by the US on money-laundering charges along with his son, Obaid Khanani, and nephew, Hozaifa Khanani. In Dubai, a country where, reportedly, investing in real estate with bags of cash raises few questions, the Khananis are listed owners of a massive real estate portfolio. Obaid himself is linked to around 30 properties, while the family as a whole were listed owners of 85 properties in early 2020, including around a dozen villas.Notably, several Pakistani families involved in politics and business were absent from the data, despite it being well known that they have bases and family residences in Dubai. This underscores that although the data is solid, it is neither a historical record of property ownership nor a comprehensive representation of all properties purchased by Pakistanis in Dubai . Many owners, according to data, still remain undetected, especially those who purchased property via a third party, or lesser-known company.","Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaks are President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly.

"Zardari, Sharif, military generals: Dubai leaks expose billions in property owned by Pakistan's elite",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/zardari-sharif-military-generals-dubai-leaks-expose-billions-in-property-owned-by-pakistans-elite/articleshow/110140243.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Dubai Property Leaks have exposed a significant number of prominent Pakistanis who own high-end properties in Dubai. The leaked data, part of the OCCRP’s Dubai Unlocked project, reveals details of individuals from various sectors like politics, military, banking, and bureaucracy. The leak, which has sent shockwaves through Pakistan , involves over 23,000 properties listed as belonging to Pakistani nationals, as detailed in the ""Dubai Unlocked"" investigation conducted by global media outlets.The investigation, conducted by the Centre for Advanced Defence Studies (C4ADS) and shared with global media outlets, sheds light on hundreds of thousands of properties in Dubai, focusing on ownership details.Among the notable Pakistanis listed in the Property Leaks are President Asif Ali Zardari’s children, Hussain Nawaz Sharif , Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s wife, Sharjeel Memon, Senator Faisal Vawda, and several lawmakers from Sindh and Balochistan assemblies. The list also includes late Gen Pervez Musharraf , former prime minister Shaukat Aziz, retired generals, a police chief, an ambassador, and a scientist, all of whom have owned properties directly or through their spouses and children.Furthermore, the leaks highlight discrepancies in property declarations, such as Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s wife owning a villa in Dubai that was not disclosed in his Senate election nomination papers. The investigation also reveals the involvement of individuals like the Altaf Khanani network, sanctioned for money laundering, and Hamid Mukhtar Shah, a physician involved in criminal activities, as property owners in Dubai.The data reveals properties ranging from studio apartments to lavish six-bedroom villas owned by Pakistan's elite, including political, military, and business figures, across premium locations like Dubai Marina, Emirates Hills, and Palm Jumeirah.The leaked data provides insights into the offshore real estate wealth of Pakistanis, with over 23,000 properties listed as belonging to Pakistani nationals up to the spring of 2022. The data, obtained by C4ADS and shared with media outlets worldwide, does not inherently indicate financial crimes but offers a detailed snapshot of Pakistani investments in Dubai properties during a specific period.The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) of Pakistan views this revelation as a crucial step toward tackling tax evasion . ""If we have the data you are talking about, as well as the information on residence status, we will make sure those who are eligible to pay tax in Pakistan on rental income or capital value are doing so,"" Malik Amjed Zubair Tiwana, chairman of the FBR, told Dawn. Despite efforts to regulate and recover undeclared assets, responses from Dubai have been limited, due to lack of geopolitical leverage and political stonewalling.The investigation underscores the challenges faced by Pakistan in bringing undeclared assets into the tax net, with Dubai authorities reluctant to share information on Pakistani citizens owning assets in the emirate. The leaked data, a result of multiple leaks and extensive verification by journalists, reveals a complex web of property ownership involving Pakistan’s political, media, military, and business elite.","The Dubai Property Leaks have exposed a significant number of prominent Pakistanis who own high-end properties in Dubai.
