What caused the meltdown?



NEW DELHI: IndiGo's operational crisis entered its fourth straight day on Friday, triggering widespread chaos at airports across the country, leaving thousands of passengers stranded with no food, no water, vacant counters and lost luggages.IndiGo cancelled over 550 domestic and international flights on Thursday, far above its usual 170–200 daily cancellations, causing widespread disruption across major airports. Most affected routes were linked to Pune, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Goa.According to PTI, airport-wise cancellations included 118 in Mumbai, 100 in Bengaluru, 75 in Hyderabad, 35 in Kolkata, 26 in Chennai and 11 in Goa, with several other airports reporting disruptions as well.Across airports, frustrated passengers complained about long queues, no staff support, uncertainty over alternative flights and hours-long waits at baggage belts.Many shared photos on X showing crowds sleeping on luggage, overflowing check-in areas and piles of unattended bags — unsure whether to go home or hope for a last-minute update.Sharing a post on X, one user wrote, ""Spent the last 4h at Bangalore airport.Some people have been here for more than 13 hours. Every single Indigo flight has been delayed significantly and then cancelled. I still find privilege in having the opportunity to try and get on any flight so I can get to my meetings, yet, no flights available until 24h from now. This is not progress. Thousands stranded.""Inside the terminal, long queues snaked across check-in counters and security lines, with seating areas completely full. A passenger travelling to Bengaluru told TOI that, ""My flight was scheduled to depart at 2.15 pm on Thursday. I rushed to see if I could get a ticket on another airline. But a ticket to Bengaluru had become pricier than a seat at a Taylor Swift concert. Clearly, other carriers were indulging in 'surge pricing. '""Later, when the passengers asked an IndiGo staffer about their delayed flight, he reportedly said: ""The plane is ready, but we don’t have a pilot to fly it,"" offering no clear answers on the delay or cancellation.At several airports, frustration boiled over — angry flyers protested at gates, and the chaos even disrupted boarding for other airlines.Airlines reportedly increased fares amid the crunch. A Delhi–Bengaluru ticket for Friday/Saturday ranged between Rs 11,000 and Rs 43,145, while Mumbai–Kolkata fares touched Rs 19,000.With IndiGo operating 65% of India’s domestic market, disruptions have hit other carriers too. Aircraft stuck at airports like Pune delayed the movement of other airlines.The DGCA held multiple emergency meetings and directed IndiGo to stabilise operations immediately and ensure fares do not rise due to reduced capacity.""To reduce passenger inconvenience while maintaining safety margins, IndiGo has requested operational variations/exemptions from specific FDTL provisions for A320 operations up to 10th February 2026.

The DGCA has asked IndiGo to submit a detailed roadmap on pilot hiring, training schedules, roster restructuring and safety assessments. A 15-day progress report is now mandatory.A DGCA inspection at Delhi’s Terminal 1 found passenger-handling manpower ""inadequate,"" and the airline has been told to urgently increase staff across affected terminals.Pilot associations have criticised IndiGo for poor planning. The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) alleged that despite getting a two-year preparatory window before the full implementation of new flight duty and rest period norms for cockpit crew, ""inexplicably adopted a hiring freeze"".In a statement on X, IndiGo said, ""The last two days have seen widespread disruption across IndiGo’s network and operations. We extend a heartfelt apology to all our customers and industry stakeholders who have been impacted by these events. IndiGo teams are working diligently and making all efforts with the support of MOCA, DGCA, BCAS, AAI and airport operators to reduce the cascading impact of these delays and restore normalcy. ""The airline urged passengers to check flight status before travelling.IndiGo has informed the regulator that more cancellations are likely in the coming days. Flight operations will be trimmed from December 8 to reduce disruptions.IndiGo operates more than 400 aircraft, runs over 2,300 flights daily, connects 90+ domestic and 45+ international destinations, and flew 118 million passengers in FY25. It was recently named ""Best Airline in India and South Asia"" at the 2025 Skytrax Awards.IndiGo attributed the disruption to ""unforeseen operational challenges"" including technical issues, weather interruptions and the rollout of revised crew duty rules (FDTL norms).The DGCA, however, said the disruptions stemmed from misjudging manpower needs under the new rules that limit pilot duty hours and night landings. After reviewing data, the regulator said the airline’s crew requirements ""exceeded their anticipation"".IndiGo reported that for December, it has 2,357 captains and 2,194 first officers, insufficient under the new norms. IndiGo underestimated how many crew members it would need after the second phase of FDTL rules kicked in on November 1. Despite this, the airline increased its domestic flights by 6% — from 14,158 in the summer schedule to 15,014 in the winter schedule starting October 26.This mismatch between flights and available crew has created a major crunch, turning into a double blow for passengers: cancelled flights and skyrocketing fares.""These disruptions have arisen primarily from misjudgement and planning gaps in implementing phase 2 of the flight duty time limitation, with the airline accepting the actual crew requirement for new (rules) exceeded their anticipation,"" the DGCA added.","IndiGo cancelled over 550 domestic and international flights on Thursday, far above its usual 170–200 daily cancellations.

IndiGo Crisis: Inside Pilot Shortage, Rule Change and Winter Delays Behind Over 200 Cancellations

Disruptions May Continue For Next Few Days

Will stabilise ops by Feb 10: IndiGo

NEW DELHI: There were unprecedented disruptions at IndiGo and misery at airports across India, with about 300 IndiGo flights cancelled on Thursday. IndiGo’s problems had consequences for passengers of other airlines too at places like Pune. The airline, the DGCA said, admitted grossly under-estimating pilot requirements for its current schedule under new crew duty rules.These “disruptions have arisen primarily from misjudgement and planning gaps in implementing phase 2 of the flight duty time limitation, with the airline accepting the actual crew requirement for new (rules) exceeded their anticipation,” the DGCA said after meeting the airline management.IndiGo has told DGCA flight cancellations will continue for two-three days and, from Monday (Dec 8), it “will reduce flight operations to minimise disruption”. “IndiGo has assured DGCA that corrective actions are under way and that normalised and stable operations will be fully restored by Feb 10, 2026,” DGCA said. For that to happen, the airline has sought “operational variations/exemptions from specific FDTL provisions… for Airbus A320 operations up to Feb 10, 2026”.A call on granting these exemptions could be taken as early as Friday as restoring a semblance of normalcy is crucial before the annual fog season envelops north India around mid-Dec and starts disrupting flights all over again.While IndiGo underestimated crew requirements post-Nov 1, when the second phase of FDTL rules came into effect, it increased domestic flights by 6% from 14,158 this summer to 15,014 in the winter schedule, in force since Oct 26. What is being witnessed now — a yawning gap between flights and crew required — has proven to be a miserable double whammy for flyers.This admission of miscalculation and submission for exemption came on a day when IndiGo’s woes — due to its sheer size — engulfed passengers of other airlines too. For instance, having its aircraft stuck at Pune airport with no pilots to fly them meant other airlines’ flights could not operate there. At some airports, fed up with long waits and unending uncertainty, angry passengers protested at departure gates and other airlines could not board their flyers. On Wednesday, IndiGo’s on-time performance had dropped to 19.7%.“IndiGo has crossed all limits. They show the flight is on time, checks in people and baggage. They show scheduled flight departure times on boards and, when the time comes, that flight number just vanishes. We’re stuck and helpless,” fumed a passenger who was to fly to Bengaluru from Delhi on Tuesday at 8.45pm. “It’s a bad situation but IndiGo is making it worse with its unethical behaviour,” he added.Inspecting Delhi airport’s Terminal 1, “which witnessed the highest passenger imp-act”, DGCA found “IndiGo’s passenger-handling manpower was inadequate to manage disruption-induced crowding”. While instructing the airline to “urgently increase manpower and strengthen passenger support services at all affected terminals”, the regulator has asked its officials to “conduct real-time inspections at major airports to evaluate IndiGo’s management of flight disruptions. ”An official at a small airport said, “Our stalls quickly ran out of all food due to the number of stranded passengers.” The aviation minister has instructed operators to inform all airport directors that they should provide support to stranded passengers. DGCA has been asked to closely monitor airfares.At its meeting with DGCA, “IndiGo presented data on cancellations and provided initial reasons, including transitional challenges in implementing the revised FDTL, crew-planning issues, and winter-season operational constraints”. The revised FDTL norms were implemented in two phases — July 1 and Nov 1 — following court directions to “strengthen fatigue management and ensure enhanced flight safety”.IndiGo informed DGCA it was “facing significant transitional challenges in roster planning and crew availability under Phase-2 FDTL requirements. These issues, combined with winter operational constraints, have contributed to the sharp spike in cancellations and delays.”“Reviewed the operations of IndiGo along with senior aviation ministry and DGCA officials. I have instructed DGCA and officials concerned at the ministry to keep a close watch on the network and directed IndiGo to normalise operations at the earliest. In addition, AAI and other airport operators have also been directed to provide all support to stranded passengers,” civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said in a post on social media.","IndiGo admits grossly under-estimating pilot requirements for its current schedule under new crew duty rules.

Rs 90 to a dollar: What’s driving the fall and why it matters to you,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rs-90-to-a-dollar-whats-driving-the-fall-and-why-it-matters-to-you-explained/articleshow/125734691.cms,"The rupee's fall past 90 is more than a number-it’s a marker of a new phase in India’s economic story.

Driving the news

Rupee Slides To Record Low Of 90 Per Dollar As Trade Uncertainty, Dollar Demand And Oil Costs Spike

Why it matters

Your next iPhone, fridge, or car? Costlier.

Zoom in: Why did the rupee drop?

Three main reasons:

Trade tensions with the US:

Investor exodus:

Policy shift at the RBI:

The big picture: What makes this different from earlier rupee crises?

Dollar vs Rupee History

What they’re saying

Between the lines: Life is already getting more expensive

Oil & energy:

Electronics & appliances:

Everyday inflation:

Zoom in: Families, students, and borrowers are hurting

For students abroad:

Education loans hurt more:

Borrowers and consumers:

What's next: The pressure is widespread

Is this good for exporters?

The textbook answer: Yes. The reality: It's complicated.

Winners: IT and business service firms paid in rupees but billing in dollars see better margins-though many hedge currency exposure, which limits gains.

Mixed bag: Pharma exporters benefit from the exchange rate but are squeezed by global price pressures and rising import costs of raw materials.

Losers: Textile and light manufacturing should win-but US tariffs blunt their advantage.

Silver lining: Remittance recipients are smiling

What Indian families should do now

Match currency of income and loans: If you earn in rupees, avoid dollar loans.

Hedge wisely: For tuition and foreign payments, consider forward contracts or staggered payments to limit exchange rate shocks.

Plan with a cushion: Assume the rupee could drop further. Many consultants now suggest budgeting with Rs 93–95/$ in mind for 2026 plans.

Leverage remittances smartly: Fixed deposits and short-term debt funds offer high real returns right now-worth exploring.

Diversify investments: Global mutual funds or India-focused funds heavy in export sectors (like IT or pharma) may offer better protection.

The bottom line:

(With inputs from agencies)

Rupee hits a record low to go below 90! On Wednesday, the Indian rupee broke a historic barrier, falling below Rs 90 to the US dollar for the first time. Though the drop from Tuesday’s 89.94 may seem minor, the implications aren’t.This milestone isn’t just psychological-it signals a shift in how India’s economy is perceived, managed, and felt by its citizens.The ripple effects stretch far beyond Dalal Street or forex traders. The rupee’s weakness is now hitting the average Indian household - from their fuel bills to EMIs, tuition fees, and travel costs.Micro meets macro: Imports = inflation: India imports 90% of its oil, and also depends on overseas suppliers for electronics, fertilizers, and edible oil. A weak rupee inflates these bills.Foreign education: Students studying abroad could be shelling out Rs 5–10 lakh more annually compared to 2023, especially those paying USD tuition and living costs.Recent trade negotiations failed, and US tariffs on Indian exports-some rising by 50%-hit business confidence hard.Despite steady inflation and GDP growth, foreign investors pulled out $17 billion from Indian equities in 2025, adding pressure on the rupee.The International Monetary Fund reclassified India's exchange rate regime from ""stabilized"" to ""crawl-like."" This suggests the RBI is now guiding, not guarding, the rupee.The dollar isn’t the main villain: In 2022, a strong dollar weakened currencies across the globe. This time, the rupee is down even as the dollar remains steady.India’s war chest is full: The RBI has $690 billion in reserves-unlike the 2013 taper tantrum or the 2018 oil price shock. This creates strategic patience.Philosophy shift at RBI: Instead of fire-fighting, the central bank now aims for long-term resilience. Its goal is no longer to defend Rs 90 at all costs, but to allow natural depreciation based on fundamentals-like inflation differentials and trade shifts.“For now, the central bank may be letting the rupee weaken a little more to make exports more competitive in light of US tariffs,” said David Forrester of Crédit Agricole.Bloomberg dubbed the rupee “Asia’s worst-performing currency this year.”“If they allow the rupee to close above 90, we could see further speculative bets and the possibility of the rupee heading to 91,”Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst at Kotak Securities, told Bloomberg. The recent slide is “hard to justify on a fundamental basis,” he added.""The weak macro picture in India makes weak currency performance inevitable, there has been a slide in so many data points recently – rising trade deficits, weakening nominal GDP growth, weak FDI and foreigner selling down domestic equities, etc,"" Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors in Singapore, told Reuters.The RBI’s stance? Let it float-for now. With over $690 billion in reserves, India can act if needed, but the central bank prefers gradual adjustment to aggressive defense.The depreciation isn't academic-it’s household.India imports 90% of its crude and over 60% of its edible oils. A weaker rupee makes them costlier.Imported items-laptops, fridges, smartphones-will now come with steeper price tags.Cooking oil, LPG, and petrol will squeeze budgets further, especially for lower- and middle-income households.Tuition at $50,000/year was Rs 40 lakh at ₹80/$, but now it’s Rs 45 lakh. That’s a ₹5 lakh hike-several months’ salary for many middle-class families.A student repaying a dollar loan taken at Rs 80 now owes 12–13% more in rupee terms.A family earning Rs1.5 lakh/month may now have to dip into savings or cut essentials to meet new EMI demands of student loans.Vacations abroad? That $2,000 family trip just went from Rs 1.6 lakh to Rs 1.8 lakh.Small businesses: Those reliant on imported components or foreign travel now face higher costs and tighter margins.“If your goods hit a tariff wall of 25% or 50%, it’s less helpful,” said one trade economist.India received $137–138 billion in remittances in 2024-more than double any other country.A $500 monthly remittance now brings in Rs 45,000 instead of Rs 40,000.For rural and low-income families, this extra Rs 5,000/month is real uplift-sometimes funding education, healthcare, or property investments.The rupee's fall past 90 is more than a number-it’s a marker of a new phase in India’s economic story.In letting the rupee float, policymakers are betting on long-term gains over short-term defense. But for millions of Indian families, that bet is already affecting daily life, monthly budgets, and multi-year plans.","Rupee hits a record low to go below 90!

NEW DELHI: The Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have launched an intensive review and monitoring exercise after IndiGo reported widespread operational disruptions and an unusually high number of flight cancellations across its network since late November 2025.Civil Aviation Minister reviewed the situation with senior MoCA officials and IndiGo’s top management, directing the airline and all relevant aviation bodies to take urgent steps to assist passengers and stabilise operations. The Ministry said it is keeping a “close watch” on the situation, according to DGCA's statement cited by ANI.""In addition, the Civil Aviation Minister has also held a meeting with senior officers of the Airport Authority of India and instructed AAI to inform all airport directors that they should constantly monitor the situation and provide all support to stranded passengers. He also directed DGCA to closely monitor the airfares during the flight disruptions/cancellations,"" according to the released statement.Apart from the ministry, DGCA, in a detailed review meeting chaired by the Director General (Civil Aviation), flagged concerns over IndiGo cancelling 170–200 flights per day, a level significantly higher than normal for the country’s largest airline.IndiGo attributed the disruptions to transitional challenges from the implementation of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) Civil Aviation Requirements, which came into effect in two phases — 01 July 2025 and 01 November 2025 — following court directions.The airline said the new fatigue-management rules, crew-planning issues, and winter operational constraints have sharply impacted scheduling stability.DGCA has directed IndiGo to normalise operations at the earliest and ensure that the current situation does not lead to fare increases.IndiGo has been instructed to submit:As DGCA released its statement assuring firm corrective action and close monitoring, IndiGo, however, informed the regulator that stabilising its network will require a short transition period. The airline told DGCA that additional cancellations will continue over the next two to three days as part of its schedule-reset effort aimed at restoring roster balance and preventing further last-minute disruptions, as reported by PTI.IndiGo has also conveyed that it will proactively scale down flight operations starting December 8 to minimise passenger inconvenience and allow crew-planning teams to rebuild buffers eroded over recent weeks. According to the airline, this controlled reduction in operations is essential to streamline rosters, align crew availability with revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms and ensure that fatigue-management standards are fully complied with.The carrier has assured DGCA that corrective measures are already underway and that full operational stability will be restored by February 10, 2026. IndiGo said its recovery plan includes accelerated crew recruitment, intensified training cycles and a phased reintroduction of flights once adequate staffing and roster resilience are secured.",The Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have launched an intensive review and monitoring exercise.

With new US sanctions throttling Russia’s oil exports and global isolation deepening, Moscow is turning to India with warm words and strategic asks.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called India a “historic partner” and thanked it for its “friendly stand” on Ukraine - a notable shift in tone as Moscow seeks to protect its last big energy customer outside China.

After S-400 Gamechanger, Putin & Modi Set For S-500 Monster Missile Pact | Full Detail

Why it matters



Putin needs India to remain open to Russian oil and arms - and not fully pivot to the West or China.

needs India to remain open to Russian oil and arms - and not fully pivot to the West or China. PM Modi needs assurances on energy stability, defense reliability, and Russia’s geopolitical neutrality - while carefully managing relations with the US.

Between the lines: A fragile oil lifeline



India was buying just 2% of its crude from Russia in early 2022. Now it sources 35–40%, briefly overtaking China as Moscow’s top customer.

But that flow is stalling. New US sanctions on Russian firms like Rosneft and Lukoil are spooking Indian refiners. Imports have dropped and are expected to hit a 3-year low in December.

The big picture: Moscow’s shrinking circle



Zoom in: A trade boom - with problems



Imports from Russia: $63.8bn - mainly crude oil, fertilizers, and coal.

Exports to Russia: < $5bn - a mix of pharma, food, machinery, and electronics.

Sanctioned Russian banks are unable to repatriate dividends from Indian joint ventures like Sakhalin-1 and Vankorneft.

India’s central bank is pushing for rupee–rouble settlements to bypass the dollar-dominated SWIFT system, but progress is slow.

Cheap oil, costly problems



A record trade deficit with Russia ($60bn). Frozen payments due to sanctioned financial channels. Diplomatic backlash from Washington and Brussels.

Defense ties: Still strong, but not what they used to be



From 70% a decade ago, Russia’s share of India’s defense imports is now down to 36% (SIPRI).

India is diversifying: Rafales from France, Apaches and drones from the US, and a push for indigenous platforms under “Make in India.”

Still, Moscow is far from irrelevant:

India signed a $248m deal this year to upgrade its Russian T-72 tank engines.

Talks are on for Su-57 fifth-gen fighters and more S-400 air defense systems.

Joint ventures like BrahMos missiles and AK-203 rifles remain cornerstones of the partnership.

The Trump factor: Tariffs, threats, and trade friction



In August, Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods - citing oil imports from Russia as one justification.

The administration has labelled India’s oil strategy “a security problem” and signaled more pressure could follow.

Yet, negotiators are quietly working on a limited trade deal focused on digital taxes, market access, and regulatory clarity.

What Modi wants from Putin



Trade rebalancing: Russia must walk the talk and buy more Indian goods - especially in pharma, food, and light manufacturing.

Secure payment systems: Delhi wants foolproof local-currency arrangements and clarity on remittances blocked by sanctions.

Energy and nuclear cooperation: Commitments on oil volumes and pricing, plus guarantees on Kudankulam reactors and future small modular units.

Geopolitical neutrality:India wants assurance that deepening Russia–China ties won’t be weaponized against Indian interests in Asia.

What’s next



New defense contracts and S-400 delivery timelines.

Updates to rupee–rouble frameworks or a BRICS-based payments corridor.

Expanded use of RELOS for logistics and energy transit.

A joint statement reaffirming “strategic partnership” in a multipolar world.

Apart from the oil and the arms, it’s diplomatic hedging, showing Beijing and Washington that Delhi has a third option and gives it a bit more bargaining room Prof Kanti Bajpai to CNN

The bottom line



India has always been seen as a purely positive example. It is a non-Western country that is growing rapidly, plays by the rules, and focuses primarily on its own development without having excessive ambitions abroad. An article in Russia Today

Russian President Vladimir Putin landed in New Delhi on Thursday evening for a high-stakes two-day summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi - his first state visit to India since the Ukraine war began in February 2022.“We are proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with India,” Peskov said, framing the summit as a reflection of “deep trust and mutual respect.”This is no ceremonial visit. It's a transaction wrapped in tradition - a negotiation between a sanctions-hit petro-state desperate to stay relevant and a rising power determined to make every partner earn its place.The backdrop: India is walking a diplomatic tightrope - balancing its Cold War-era friendship with Moscow against growing economic and strategic stakes with Washington.Russia’s war chest still depends on oil - and India has become one of its few dependable buyers.“We see this as a temporary disruption,” Peskov said, pledging “sophisticated” workarounds to maintain energy ties.The pressure: US lawmakers have accused India of being a “laundromat” for Russian crude - refining it and exporting finished products globally. Washington is leaning on India to scale back and buy more American energy.Putin’s visit must be seen through the lens of global isolation and economic squeeze.Europe’s exit: The EU has slashed Russian crude and gas imports. G7 sanctions on tankers, insurers, and pipelines have bitten deep.Tech drought: Russia’s oil and defense sectors are struggling to source critical Western components.Asia pivot: With the West out, Moscow is leaning hard on China and India. China brings scale - but India brings strategic balance and global legitimacy.India–Russia bilateral trade has ballooned to $68.7B in FY 2024–25, up from $13B in 2021. But almost all of it flows one way.This imbalance isn’t just a diplomatic irritant - it’s also a financial headache.“The imbalance is real,” Peskov admitted. “We are looking to buy more from India to fix it.”India has benefited from discounted Russian crude - it helped ease inflation, boosted refining margins, and stabilized the rupee.But it has also brought three major side effects:Still, India is unlikely to cut off Russian oil - it will simply recalibrate.Russia remains India’s biggest arms supplier - but that dominance is eroding.Strategic signal: The new RELOS agreement - a logistics-sharing pact - gives India access to Russian military bases, and vice versa. Delhi already has similar deals with the US, Japan, France, and Australia.President Donald Trump has emerged as a wild card.India’s challenge: Continue talking with Washington without appearing to bow - or ditch Moscow.“This is Modi’s strategic autonomy under stress,” said the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi think tank.Putin may be wooing, but Modi isn’t giving anything away for free.India’s demands:“Russia’s relationship with China is not against India,” Peskov said, emphasizing Moscow’s willingness to strengthen ties “as far as India is ready.”The Modi–Putin summit could produce:But every announcement will be weighed in Washington - and possibly followed by more US scrutiny or tariffs.Putin’s Delhi visit isn’t just about oil or arms. It’s about staying visible, keeping options open, and proving Russia is still in the geopolitical game.For India, the summit is a stress test of its global strategy: Can it be everyone’s partner - and no one’s pawn?“You can’t corner India,” said ORF’s Nandan Unnikrishnan. “You have to compete for it.”(With inputs from agencies)","Russia is turning to India with warm words and strategic asks. Putin needs India to remain open to Russian oil and arms - and not fully pivot to the West or China. PM Modi needs assurances on energy stability, defense reliability, and Russia’s geopolitical neutrality - while carefully managing relations with the US.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125765029,imgsize-987755,width-400,resizemode-4/pm-modi-putin-meet-pti-image.jpg"

NEW DELHI: As Russian President Vladimir Putin prepares to visit India for a much-anticipated meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, old images of the two leaders have resurfaced online.The photographs, taken in Moscow in 2001, show Modi — then the Chief Minister of Gujarat — accompanying then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee during an official visit. The visuals, captured during a document-signing ceremony, had first gone viral last year when Modi travelled to Russia, and have reappeared on social media ahead of Putin’s India visit.Modi had later recalled how Putin received him warmly despite his state-level position, engaging in candid discussions on states, hobbies, and global affairs. During the 2001 trip, he signed a protocol agreement between Gujarat and Russia’s Astrakhan region to boost cooperation in petrochemicals, hydrocarbons, trade, science and technology, education, tourism, and culture. He also visited Moscow’s ISKCON temple to offer prayers on Vajpayee’s behalf due to the latter’s health condition, spending considerable time with devotees. The visit marked Modi’s first international engagement as chief minister and his early diplomatic interaction with Putin.Modi returned to Astrakhan in 2006 to extend the pact for another five years with Governor Alexander Zhilkin, strengthening Gujarat–Russia ties in energy and trade. These subnational initiatives later fed into wider bilateral cooperation in defence, energy, and commerce during Modi’s tenure as Prime Minister. Modi has often reminisced about the 2001 meeting, including receiving a framed photograph from the ISKCON visit as a surprise gift during his 2024 interaction in Moscow.","Vladimir Putin is set to visit India for a much-anticipated meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Huge backlog: cancellations even in November, before the current crisis

IndiGo, one of the country's leading airlines, is currently grappling with significant operational disruptions, leading to widespread flight cancellations and delays across major cities such as Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, and Hyderabad.The airline has attributed these disruptions to a combination of factors, including technology glitches, schedule changes, and a shortage of crew due to updated regulatory requirements on crew rostering.The situation has resulted in mounting frustration among passengers, many of whom have been left stranded at airports with little prior notice of changes to their travel plans.In response, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has launched a probe into the airline's operations, seeking explanations and a concrete mitigation plan to address the ongoing issues.Here are the 10 things to know about the massive flight disruptions at several airports:Multiple major Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Hyderabad, were hit by a fresh wave of IndiGo flight cancellations as disruptions continued.On Wednesday, in Hyderabad alone, more than 40 arrivals and departures were cancelled, while in Kolkata, the airline scrapped both legs of at least 10 flights.Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru also saw over 42 IndiGo arrivals and departures cancelled, leaving several passengers stranded and adding to widespread frustration among flyers.Passengers from major cities hit by the disruption have been venting their anger over a wave of delays and cancellations, with many saying they received little or no prior intimation about changes to their flights.Several flyers have described being stuck at airports for hours with families, missing important meetings and onward connections as departure times were repeatedly pushed back or flights abruptly scrapped.IndiGo spokesperson issued a formal statement acknowledging the severe disruption caused to operations at major airports. The airline said its network had experienced significant operational irregularities over the past two days arising from multiple contributing factors.""We acknowledge that IndiGo’s operations have been significantly disrupted across the network for the past two days, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience caused,"" said the statement released on Wednesday.The airline assured passengers that it has put measures in place to restore normal operations at the earliest. However, it also cautioned that disruptions are likely to persist for up to the next 48 hours.""To contain the disruption and restore stability, we have initiated calibrated adjustments to our schedules. These measures will remain in place for the next 48 hours and will allow us to normalize our operations and progressively recover our punctuality across the network,"" they said, ""Our teams are working around the clock to ease customer discomfort and ensure operations stabilize as quickly as possible.""Aviation watchdog DGCA has launched a probe into IndiGo’s ongoing flight disruptions and asked the airline to explain the causes of the current chaos as well as detail its plans to curb cancellations and delays. The regulator has also sought a concrete mitigation plan from the airline after days of disorder at multiple airports.""IndiGo has been asked to report to DGCA, Headquarters, to present the facts leading to the current situation, along with plans to mitigate the ongoing delays & cancellations,"" it said in a statement.As per the data released by ministry of civil aviation, IndiGo provided the summary of its recent operational performance.Crew shortage was also cited by the airlines as the reason behind their grappling with the disruptions. ""Implementation of updated crew rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitations) had a negative compounding impact on our operations in a way that was not feasible to be anticipated,"" said IndiGo spokesperson in a statement.The airline also issued an explanation regarding FDTL, which is majorly affecting the crew operations. They pointed out that stricter rest and duty-hour requirements have significantly reduced crew availability at short notice, forcing the airline to cancel or reschedule flights whenever reserve pilots or cabin crew cannot be rostered within the new limits.Along with crew-related challenges, IndiGo also pointed to a range of other operational factors that together snowballed into the current disruption.""Minor technology glitches, schedule changes linked to the winter season, adverse weather conditions, increased congestion in the aviation system, and the implementation of updated crew rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitations) had a negative compounding impact on our operations in a way that was not feasible to be anticipated,"" IndiGo spokesperson said in a statement.IndiGo reported that it cancelled 1,232 flights during the period, attributing a significant portion of these disruptions to crew and Flight Duty Time Limit (FDTL) compliance issues, as well as airport, airspace and air traffic control constraints that are often outside an airline’s direct control.The carrier’s on-time performance also took a hit, slipping to 67.70 per cent in November compared with 84.1 per cent in October.The performance report by the airlines highlights that in November alone, IndiGo cancelled 1,232 flights, many due to crew/FDTL constraints. The airline, which operates more than 2,200 flights a day, recorded a punctuality rate of just 35 percent on December 2, according to data from the Ministry of Civil Aviation.DGCA has summoned IndiGo to its headquarters to explain the factors behind the ongoing disruption and to outline concrete measures to address the continuing wave of delays and cancellations.","Over 70 IndiGo Flights Cancelled Across India as Crew Shortage Triggers Massive Disruption.

Airfares surge amid shortage of seat

NEW DELHI: IndiGo’s nationwide operational crisis intensified on Thursday, with fresh flight cancellations and long delays reported across Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune. This has resulted in leaving lakhs of passengers stranded and triggering widespread anger amongst them.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has summoned the airline’s senior management to its headquarters to explain the “unprecedented disruptions” and submit an urgent plan to stabilise operations during the peak travel season.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers has written to employees acknowledging the stress being faced by both customers and staff, and assuring teams that steps are being taken to stabilise operations.In the internal communication, Elbers said the airline is working across multiple levels to normalise services and restore punctuality in the coming days, even as disruptions continue to impact passengers nationwide.“We are feeling our customers’ concern and anxieties just as deeply. We are proactively reaching out to affected customers and helping them in every way possible to ease their discomfort… Our immediate goal is to normalize our operations and bring punctuality back on track in the coming days, which is not an easy target… Together, as one team, we will overcome this challenge and emerge even stronger,” he wrote.Passenger anger mounted across major airports as flyers reported waiting for hours without clear updates, with some flights delayed by up to 10 hours and others cancelled at short notice.Social media was flooded with complaints from travellers stuck inside aircraft due to missing cabin crew, families missing connecting flights and business travellers forced to postpone crucial travel.A commuter at Pune airport tweeted, “Situation is worst at Pune airport since @IndiGo6E occupied the hanger. @AkasaAir Flight to Delhi is standing at the hanger since last 2 hours.”A Delhi passenger wrote, “Hi team, we are sitting inside 6E6189 at Delhi airport. It’s been an hour inside the plane. Why start boarding when crew isn’t ready?”From Kolkata, another flyer posted, “Very unfortunate that people in this country face hardships from flight companies. We waited long for the Delhi flight.”At Pune airport on Thursday, prolonged bay occupancy by grounded IndiGo aircraft triggered fresh congestion and sequential delays for multiple carriers.In an official statement, Pune Airport said, “The extended ground presence of multiple IndiGo aircraft awaiting availability of operating crew has resulted in the prolonged occupation of parking bays,” adding that this had a cascading impact on all airlines.Alarmed by the scale of the disruption, the aviation regulator on Thursday summoned IndiGo’s top management to explain the factors behind the chaos and outline a concrete mitigation strategy.“IndiGo has been asked to report to DGCA, Headquarters, to present the facts leading to the current situation, along with plans to mitigate the ongoing delays and cancellations,” the regulator said in a statement.“DGCA is investigating the situation and evaluating measures along with the airline to reduce cancellations and delays in order to minimise inconvenience being caused to passengers,” an official added.In an official statement, IndiGo acknowledged that its network had been “significantly disrupted” and apologised to passengers.“We acknowledge that IndiGo’s operations have been significantly disrupted across the network for the past two days, and we sincerely apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused,” the airline said.“To contain the disruption and restore stability, we have initiated calibrated adjustments to our schedules. These measures will remain in place for the next 48 hours and will allow us to normalise our operations and progressively recover our punctuality across the network,” it added.The Federation of Indian Pilots said the crisis reflects deeper planning failures. Its president, Captain CS Randhawa, said, “Most of these flight disruptions, cancellations and delays have been attributable to, firstly, the crew shortage.”He added, “They have been inducting aircraft. It must be appreciated that when you induct an aircraft, you must have an adequate number of crews per aircraft.”On the revised duty norms, Randhawa said, “After the second phase of the FDTL, new CARs came into effect by the order of the Delhi High Court on 1st of November. They immediately approached the DGCA and sought a variation.” He urged authorities “not to grant such dispensations and variations, and to implement the CAR in totality.”The root of the crisis lies in the implementation of the second phase of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms from November 1, which tightened rest and night-duty rules for pilots. These changes sharply reduced crew availability at short notice. The airline has also cited multiple compounding factors.“Minor technology glitches, schedule changes linked to the winter season, adverse weather conditions, increased congestion in the aviation system, and the implementation of updated crew rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitations) had a negative compounding impact on our operations in a way that was not feasible to be anticipated,” an IndiGo spokesperson said.Since Tuesday, more than 100 flights have been cancelled daily, with over 200 grounded on Wednesday alone. Government data show IndiGo cancelled 1,232 flights in November, nearly 62 per cent due to crew and FDTL constraints. IndiGo’s shares also fell over 3 per cent in late afternoon trade to Rs 5,417.90 on the BSE.The airline’s on-time performance plunged to just 35 per cent on Tuesday, the lowest among all scheduled Indian airlines and stood at 67.7 per cent in November, down sharply from 84.1 per cent in October.With IndiGo accounting for nearly 65 per cent of India’s domestic market, the widespread flight cuts have also sent fares soaring on key routes. An economy class one-way Delhi–Bengaluru ticket for Friday and Saturday was available in the range of Rs 11,000 to Rs 43,145, while Mumbai–Kolkata fares ranged between Rs 8,000 and Rs 19,000.Airport officials said the cascading effect of grounded aircraft and delayed crew rotation continues to strain terminal operations across major hubs, intensifying passenger hardship during the busy travel period.",IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers has written to employees acknowledging the stress being faced by both customers and staff.

Bangladesh Seeks Hasina’s Extradition After Death Verdict As India Weighs Options | Watch

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on “humanitarian grounds,” months after the pair had been pushed into Bangladesh.The top court was hearing the Centre’s challenge to the Calcutta High Court’s September 26 order, which struck down the government’s move to deport Sunali Khatun, Sweety Bibi and their families to Bangladesh after labelling them “illegal immigrants.”A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi directed the West Bengal government to look after the minor and instructed the Birbhum district chief medical officer to ensure full medical support for Khatun, including a free delivery.The bench noted solicitor general Tushar Mehta’s statement that the competent authority had agreed to allow the woman and her child into India purely on humanitarian grounds, without affecting any rights or claims, and that they would be kept under “surveillance.”This followed the Supreme Court’s December 1 direction asking the Centre to consider permitting their entry, also on the condition that they remain under “surveillance.”The Supreme Court had earlier asked Mehta to seek instructions on permitting Khatun, who is in an advanced stage of pregnancy, to enter India through the India–Bangladesh border at Malda in West Bengal.The woman’s father said the family had lived as daily-wage workers in Delhi’s Rohini Sector 26 for more than two decades when police detained them on June 18 on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals.Sunali, her husband, Danish Sekh and their son were later taken into custody and, on June 27, were deported to Bangladesh.Also read: ‘Night at thana’: Was very scared, couldn’t sleep one bit, says Sunali During the hearing, the bench noted that the woman and her eight-year-old child, allowed to re-enter India, would ultimately be brought back to Delhi, from where they were picked up and pushed across the border in June, as cited by PTI.However, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Sanjay Hegde, appearing for Khatun’s father, urged the court to direct that she be taken instead to her home district of Birbhum in West Bengal, where her family resides. They also informed the bench that others, including Khatun’s husband, remained in Bangladesh and sought directions for their return as well, subject to instructions from the Centre.Mehta maintained that he would challenge their claim of Indian citizenship, insisting the family were Bangladeshi nationals and that the government’s decision to admit the woman and her child was purely on humanitarian grounds.Justice Joymalya Bagchi observed that if Khatun could establish that she is the daughter of Bhodu Sheikh, it would be sufficient to prove her Indian citizenship.The court has listed the matter for further hearing on December 10.As per a May 2, 2025, memo issued by the union home ministry, Bangladesh and Myanmar nationals found residing illegally in any state or Union territory will first be subject to an inquiry by the respective state or UT government, after which the deportation process will be initiated.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on ""humanitarian grounds"" The top court was hearing the Centre's challenge to the Calcutta High Court's September 26 order, which struck down the government's move to deport them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125738725,imgsize-1379982,width-400,resizemode-4/ani-file-photo.jpg"

India And Russia Boost Military Ties As Rajnath Singh Highlights Strategic Tech Partnership

Russia’s message at the defence commission meeting





Setting the stage for PM Modi–Putin summit

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday sent out a strong signal about the continuity of its partnership with Russia, with defence minister Rajnath Singh emphasising that bilateral defence cooperation remains steady “despite the geopolitical uncertainty.”His remarks came at the 22nd India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military & Military Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) meeting in New Delhi, held just hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin arrives for the 23rd Annual Summit.Singh described Russia as a “time-tested, special privileged, and strategic partner” and noted that defence ties have grown consistently since the signing of the 2000 Declaration of the India-Russia Strategic Partnership. “I thank you very much for coming all the way to India to discuss and promote bilateral defence cooperation between our countries… It is good that despite the geopolitical uncertainty, our India-Russia defence cooperation is moving at a healthy pace,” he said, as quoted by ANI.He highlighted “outcome-oriented exchanges” between military personnel and experts and also pointed to wider economic engagement.“We welcome the successful holding of the 26th meeting of the India-Russia Working Group on Trade and Economic Cooperation in Moscow last month, and the commencement of negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement with the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union,” Singh said.He added, “We were also eagerly awaiting the visit of His Excellency, Vladimir Putin… which has been fulfilled today.”Russian defence minister Andrei Belousov, co-chairing the meeting with Singh, echoed the sentiment of long-standing partnership.Belousov also noted the extent of military cooperation. “Russia actively cooperates in full scale with India in formation of the new outlook of the Army, Air Force, and the Navy. And using this opportunity, let me congratulate you, the command, and all Indian sailors with the National Navy Day,” he said.On the work of the joint commission, he added, “Distinguished Minister, the intergovernmental commission on military and military-technical cooperation brings the huge dedication in taking part in taking effective and mutually beneficial decisions in the military domain.”Earlier in the day, Singh and Belousov laid a wreath at the National War Memorial, and the Russian minister inspected the Tri-Service Guard of Honour. Belousov was received at Air Force Station Palam by Minister of State for Defence Sanjay Seth, with Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan also present.Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to arrive in India on Thursday evening for his first visit in four years, beginning the trip with a private dinner hosted by PM Modi. The two leaders have spoken by phone five times in 2024 and last met in person on the sidelines of the SCO Summit in Tianjin.Putin’s arrival marks his first trip to India since 2021 and his first since the Ukraine conflict began in 2022.His return to New Delhi comes as the India–Russia partnership continues to adjust to shifting global dynamics, balancing long-standing defence ties with cooperation in technology, energy transition, education, and workforce mobility.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh says Russia is a 'time-tested, special privileged, and strategic partner' Russian defence minister Andrei Belousov echoed the sentiment of long-standing partnership.

Daily road deaths touched 485 in 2024 even as NH fatalities dipped,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/daily-road-deaths-touched-485-in-2024-even-as-nh-fatalities-dipped/articleshow/125777686.cms,"Union minister Nitin Gadkari speaks in Lok Sabha (ANI)

NEW DELHI: On an average, 485 people died in road crashes every day in 2024, with total fatalities reaching 1.77 lakh, according to road transport ministry told Lok Sabha on Thursday. National Highways (NHs), which account for barely 2% of India’s road network, recorded 54,443 fatalities (31%), the lowest share in past four years.The total number of deaths last year was 2.3% higher than in 2023, when 1.73 lakh people were killed in road crashes. TOI had reported on Nov 5 on the trend for the year, which suggested that fatalities in 2024 would exceed those in the previous year.In a written reply to a question from DMK’s A Raja, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari said, “As per information received from states/UTs, total number of road accident fatalities reported in the country on all category of roads during 2024 were 1,77,177, which includes data in respect of Bengal taken from electronic detailed accident report (eDAR) portal.”Govt has rolled out eDAR system for real-time collection of data. Sources said experience shows eDAR data are largely correct, though there is scope for minor corrections, and hence there may be a slight increase in the number of deaths when the annual report of accidents is published.Data on crashes and fatalities on NHs, also submitted to Lok Sabha, show that accidents on these stretches have decreased — from 1.52 lakh in 2022 to 1.29 lakh — and fatalities have dropped from 56,007 in 2021 to just over 54,000.UP has reported significant decline in deaths on NHs, from 8,446 in 2023 to 5,524 last year. Officials said while this is a positive indicator, greater effort is needed to reduce fatalities on NHs and state highways, which have less network length comparatively but account for around 55% of deaths.“We are improving roads, technologies and vehicles, but there is a lack of education among all categories of road users. This must be addressed through awareness, motivation and enforcement,” said Manoj Bhatt, former DGP of Rajasthan.Experts said govt must involve civil society and a larger pool of non-government entities for large-scale awareness campaigns, rather than relying on only a few organisations, given the magnitude of the crisis.Meanwhile, govt is roping in IIT-Kanpur to use AI for mapping and scientifically analysing high-risk spots on NHs, officials said. They added that this will help identify causes of frequent crashes at specific locations, enabling targeted interventions.The road transport ministry also plans to amend Motor Vehicles Act by introducing stricter norms for issuing driving licences and a negative-points system for dangerous driving that could result in suspension or cancellation of licences.","On an average, 485 people died in road crashes every day in 2024, with total fatalities reaching 1.77 lakh.

After S-400 Gamechanger, Putin & Modi Set For S-500 Monster Missile Pact | Full Detail

Tough to give India S-500 systems as of now, says official

NEW DELHI: India and Russia on Thursday agreed to further enhance their expansive defence partnership, including through collaboration in niche military technologies and stronger defence-industrial cooperation, which is likely to see Moscow continuing as New Delhi’s leading arms supplier for the foreseeable future, reports Rajat Pandit.Ahead of the Modi-Putin summit, defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrei Belousov stressed ties were based on “a deep sense of trust, common principles and mutual respect” while inking a protocol on “ongoing and prospective areas” of defence cooperation.The 22nd inter-governmental commission on military and military-technical cooperation, co-chaired by the ministers, underlined India’s intent to retain its strategic autonomy despite mounting pressure from the US and EU to distance itself from Russia.Sources said discussions ranged from India acquiring additional S-400 Triumf air defence systems and their surface-to-air missiles in large numbers to upgrading IAF’s Sukhoi-30MKI fighter fleet and arming them with long-range R-37 and RVV-BD air-to-air missiles.The joint production of advanced variants of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as procurement of short-range Pantsir and man-portable Verba air defence systems also figured in the talks.“It will be difficult for Russia to supply advanced S-500 air defence systems as of now even if India wants them. Its fifth-generation Sukhoi-57 fighters are also on offer, but India is yet to take a decision,” an official said.Taking note during the meeting of the special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia, Rajnath Singh said India is determined to expand the capacity of its indigenous defence industry for both local production and exports under the aegis of ‘ Atmanirbhar Bharat ’ policy.Belousov, in turn, said Russian defence industry was ready to support India towards becoming self-reliant in defence production, highlighting that both the countries were “united by many years of friendship and strategic cooperation”.India also wants Russia to expedite deliveries of critical military hardware that have been hugely delayed due to the Ukraine war. These include the two remaining squadrons of the five S-400 squadrons contracted for $5.43 billion in 2018 as well as the advanced Akula-class nuclear attack submarine, which was supposed to arrive this year on a 10-year lease under the $3 billion deal signed in March 2019. “Russia says the two S-400 squadrons will be delivered next year, while the submarine will come in 2028,” a source said.India plans to acquire another five S-400 squadrons, while defence ministry has also cleared the Rs 10,000 crore procurement of 280 of its missiles with interception ranges of 120km, 200km, 250km and 380km to replenish stocks used during the May 7-10 cross-border hostilities with Pakistan as well as build reserves, as was earlier reported by TOI.IAF also wants R-37 air-to-air missiles, with a range of over 200km, and its advanced version called RVV-BD to arm its upgraded Sukhoi-30MKI fighters. This will counter Pakistan’s use of Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 long-range missiles that initially caught it off-guard during Operation Sindoor.Advanced lighter versions of BrahMos missiles, whose strike range has already been enhanced to 450km from the initial 290km and will eventually go up to 800km, are also on the cards.While the heavyweight Sukhoi fighters armed with BrahMos missiles had carried out long-range precision strikes against Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, the plan now is to go for smaller air-launched BrahMos-NG missiles that can be carried by lightweight jets as well.The total value of the deals inked with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace has crossed Rs 58,000 crore over the years, with the missiles with a 2.8-Mach speed becoming the prime conventional precision strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.","India and Russia agree to further enhance their expansive defence partnership.

Putin’s Grand India Welcome, Modi Rolls Out Red Carpet | Watch Handshake, Hug & Rare Protocol Break

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin’s arrival in New Delhi for the bilateral summit triggered a massive security build-up on Thursday, turning critical zones of the capital into a multilayered defensive perimeter. Sources said the protocols in place during G20 summit-2023 have been replicated to ensure safety of the dignitaries.Central to the security logistics for Putin is his custom-made Aurus Senat limousine. This vehicle, commonly dubbed a “rolling bunker”, which was flown in from Moscow for the visit, will be used for exigency, sources said. On Thursday, the car was spotted trailing the armoured Toyota Fortuner in which PM Narendra Modi and Putin traveled together.The Senat resulted from Russia’s Kortezh project, an initiative to develop indigenous vehicles for top state officials. This car is designed to withstand sniper fire, IED blasts and chemical attacks, featuring run-flat tyres and emergency oxygen supply.A concentric five-layer security grid has been set up, blending the advanced protective protocols of Russia’s internal agencies with those of India’s elite counter-terrorism forces to ensure foolproof protection from the moment the presidential aircraft landed to the time of its departure.A special control room has been set up in each hotel with rooftops being occupied by snipers who have guns equipped with AI-aided technology for calculation and aiming. Anti-drone systems have been installed around the venues as well. For air travel, Putin uses a specially modified Ilyushin IL-96-300PU, sometimes called the “Flying Kremlin,” equipped with four engines, advanced command systems and missile-defence countermeasures, which is accompanied by backup jets flying similar routes to mask the presidential aircraft.The innermost circle of protection is staffed by personnel from Russian Presidential Security Service (SBP), an elite unit operating under Federal Protective Service (FSO). These highly trained officers, selected for their physical and psychological resilience, will be positioned closest to the President, tasked with shielding him, especially during critical moments of his movement to and from his vehicle.Complementing this core team, India’s NSG commandos and Special Protection Group (SPG) units, alongside SWAT teams and Quick Response Teams (QRTs), will form the subsequent layers. All hotels are under the command of a DCP-level officer.Dummy dignitaries have also been placed in some hotels to boost security, and staff of the hotels have been vetted twice by different agencies, sources said.","Russian President Vladimir Putin’s arrival in New Delhi triggered a massive security build-up on Thursday.

Putin & Modi Travel In Same Car From Delhi Airport; Indian PM Shares Inside Look | Watch

NEW DELHI: Calling PM Narendra Modi his “friend”, “a reliable person”, “a person of integrity” and a good thing to have happened to India, Russian President Vladimir Putin said though there has been a slight dip in purchase of Russian oil by India, the overall trade remains steady, adding that “Russian oil industry considers its Indian counterparts to be very reliable”.In an interview to India Today TV, recorded before he left for India, Putin said US continues to buy nuclear fuel from Russia for its own power plants, including uranimum for reactors, and asked why India should not have the same privilege to buy oil.Putin highlighted defence cooperation with India, emphasising that his country also shares technology, and citing, among other instances, the joint production of BrahMos. On whether nuclear cooperation is going to be on the table during the talks with Modi Friday, Putin responded in the affirmative and gave the example of Kudankulam nuclear plant in Tamil Nadu while emphasising Russia’s expertise in developing small nuclear power plants — something that India is keen on.PM Modi welcoming Putin at the airport on Thursday was a rare gesture, following which the two travelled in a Japanese SUV, and not the Range Rover Modi uses, to the PM’s residence.Earlier this year in Tianjin, they had a 45-minute meeting in Putin’s car on their way to the venue of their bilateral meeting on the margins of SCO summit.Modi has in the past greeted on the tarmac only leaders he has personally bonded well with, including ex-US presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump (first term), ex-Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, French President Emmanuel Macron, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, ex-Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and leaders of Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE.“Delighted to welcome my friend, President Putin to India. Looking forward to our interactions later this evening and tomorrow. India-Russia friendship is a time tested one that has greatly benefitted our people,” Modi posted on X.In the meeting on Thursday, ahead of the annual summit, the two discussed ways to further strengthen the special and privileged strategic partnership, along with regional and global issues. In several rounds of meetings that the two will have over two days, Modi is expected to reiterate his message for an early end to the war as India walks a diplomatic tightrope in its relations with Russia on one hand and US and EU on the other.India is working to sign an FTA with EU next month and has also invited EU leaders for Republic Day celebrations. Brussels would be closely watching the summit on Friday as it doesn’t want to see any outcome that could create friction with India.According to govt sources, the Putin visit will go a long way in strengthening economic co-operation. Putin is travelling with a large group of business persons. Ten govt-to-govt agreements in areas like healthcare, trade, economy, mobility and culture are expected to be signed. India also expects to improve the trade deficit with Russia that has shot up because of India’s oil trade with Russia.","Putin & Modi Travel In Same Car From Delhi Airport; Indian PM Shares Inside Look.

NEW DELHI: Noting that both partners in a marriage must work to meet individual as well as family needs and aspirations, which include securing good education for their wards, SC has said a child custody dispute between working parents cannot be decided in favour of one of them on the criterion that they work from home. A bench of Justices Manoj Misra and Ujjal Bhuyan remarked that it could not be said that the interests of the child would be better served by the parent who worked from home, than the other who went to office daily.“It is not in dispute that both parents are working parents and, therefore, it is expected that they cannot always be physically with their children. But this cannot be a ground to place the custody of the child with the one who may be temporarily working from home because it is a matter of common knowledge that to meet individual as well as family aspirations, married couples have to work to build a proper home, and most importantly, to secure better education for their ward. .. We, therefore, do not subscribe to the view that if one parent is working from home and the other is not (i.e., has to visit his office for work) then it has to be inferred that child’s interest would be better served if he is placed in the custody of one who does not go to office for work,” the bench said.SC was hearing a custody dispute over a five-year-old boy in NCR. The couple has two children — a boy and a girl, with the former living with the father and the girl with the mother.SC interacted with the minor who wanted the company of his sister but was not willing to leave his father.“What is important is that from our interactions we noticed he was not willing to part company of his father. We also took notice of the fact that his father has a few elder members at home, including grandfather, who are giving company to the child. In such circumstances, having regard to thefact that the male child is now above five years old and hecontinues to be in the same school where he was studying earlier, and he has no issues with his own father and is not willing to part company of his father, an interference with the order passed by HC is not required, particularly in view of the fact that the appellant (mother) has visitation rights as directed earlier by this court ,” the court said.HC, while granting custody of the child to the father, had mentioned he was working from home. SC’s clarification came with this in mind.","SC was hearing a custody dispute over a five-year-old boy in NCR.

NEW DELHI: Govt policy think tank Niti Aayog has recommended that licences, permits and NOCs should have perpetual validity, except in cases where renewal is required for reasons of national security, serious harm to public safety, human health, environment, or in public interest, among a series of measures to ensure a “trust-based regulatory framework”.A panel headed by Niti Aayog member Rajiv Gauba has also suggested that inspections be carried out by accredited third parties selected through computer-assisted randomised processes based on risk assessment. Officials said that by ensuring predictability, proportionality and fairness, such a system reduces enforcement burden, promotes innovation and sustains confidence, improving governance outcomes. The suggestions have been sent to ministries and departments.The panel has also suggested that even in cases of renewal of licences, permits and NOCs for reasons such as national security and serious harm to public safety or health, the validity period may be for five or 10 years. It has said that licencing and compliance requirements must be proportionate and graded by risk, and there should be no requirement of prior approvals for licences, permits and NOCs in ordinary cases.“Any activity not explicitly prohibited under the law shall be exempted from prior permission,” the think tank said. It has also said registration may be required for maintenance of database or other important purposes, but these must not be subject to approval or rejection. Self-registration based on minimal documentation shall be the norm, it has said.In its bid to eliminate ‘inspector raj’, Niti Aayog has said that inspections by accredited third parties should be the norm and departments must put the selection and periodic performance assessment criteria for third parties in place. “Inspection by govt officers will be only when necessary and through well-defined SOPs,” it said.With focus on decriminalising offences, Niti Aayog has told ministries that minor, procedural and technical offences should be decriminalised and criminal offences should be only for serious offences. It has also suggested the need to have interoperability at ministry level so that information once submitted need not be fed to the system again.","Policy think tank Niti Aayog has recommended that licences, permits and NOCs should have perpetual validity.

Indian student’s honest UK student journey: Expectations vs Reality

Which universities have halted or paused recruitment?





A growing list of institutions has already moved to protect their compliance status:

University of Chester has suspended recruitment from Pakistan until autumn 2026, citing an unexpected rise in visa refusals.

has suspended recruitment from Pakistan until autumn 2026, citing an unexpected rise in visa refusals. University of Wolverhampton is no longer taking undergraduate applicants from Pakistan and Bangladesh.

University of East London , Coventry, Sunderland and others have temporarily stopped recruitment from one or both countries.

Oxford Brookes has paused undergraduate recruitment from Pakistan and Bangladesh for its January 2026 intake.

London Metropolitan University has stopped recruitment from Bangladesh entirely, saying the country accounted for 60 per cent of its visa refusals.

BPP University has temporarily paused recruitment from Pakistan as a risk-mitigation measure.

1. Higher scrutiny from the Home Office





2. Sharp rise in asylum claims





3. Uneven quality of overseas recruitment





How is this affecting students in Pakistan and Bangladesh?





Offers are being withdrawn late in the process

Applications are being paused or left in limbo

Some students have paid deposits they cannot recover

Many who were preparing to travel in January or spring 2026 now have no clear pathway

Why are universities so worried?





Tens of millions in lost tuition revenue

Layoffs and course closures

An irreversible reputational hit

Inability to recruit for key postgraduate programmes

What changes are universities making?





Increasing deposit requirements

Tightening financial documentation checks

Re-evaluating all partnerships with overseas agents

Diversifying recruitment to other markets

Introducing stricter pre-CAS interviews

Reducing exposure to any country with a high refusal risk

What does this mean for migration policy?





The bottom line









The irony is sharp. For years, British universities depended on international students to keep their books balanced and their campuses global. Now many of those same institutions are quietly shutting their doors to two of their biggest applicant pools. The sector insists this is about compliance, not discrimination, but the effect is unmistakable: students from Pakistan and Bangladesh are being blocked, deferred or dropped because universities fear breaching tougher Home Office rules.Here is the full breakdown.Several UK universities have stopped accepting new applications from Pakistan and Bangladesh after tighter Home Office rules made it riskier to sponsor students from countries with high visa refusal rates.The trigger is the overhaul of the Basic Compliance Assessment, the framework universities must meet to retain their student sponsor licence. Under the updated rules, no more than 5 per cent of an institution’s sponsored visa applications can be refused. The previous limit was 10 per cent.Pakistan and Bangladesh now sit well above the new threshold. Their refusal rates — roughly 18 per cent for Pakistan and 22 per cent for Bangladesh in the year to September 2025 — put universities at risk of sanctions, including losing their ability to enrol international students altogether.For many mid-tier and lower-fee institutions, that is an existential threat.Some institutions have reinstated certain programmes for the January intake, but most remain cautious.Why are refusal rates so high?Three major trends have converged:The government has tightened student-visa rules as part of a broader strategy to reduce net migration. Universities now face stricter monitoring of outcomes: refusal rates, enrolment follow-through, and student attendance.There has been a surge in asylum claims lodged by individuals who first entered the UK on a study or work visa. Ministers have warned universities that student routes must not become a “backdoor” to settlement.Some universities rely heavily on education agents to source students. Multiple insiders say poor vetting — particularly in high-volume markets — has led to a mix of strong applicants alongside others with weak documentation or questionable intentions.This combination has pushed refusal rates above the new threshold, putting institutions at risk of non-compliance.For thousands of genuine applicants, the consequences are immediate and painful:Education consultants in the region say the decisions are “heartbreaking” for students who did everything correctly but are caught in the crossfire of institutional risk-management.They also argue that UK universities themselves created the incentives that led to aggressive agent recruitment, weak documentation and fraudulent applications — and are now punishing students for it.The new rules are unforgiving. If a university breaches the 5 per cent refusal cap or other compliance metrics, it can lose its licence to sponsor international students for at least a year.A one-year loss could mean:Officials estimate that at least 22 universities would fail at least one compliance criterion if no corrective action is taken. Five of them could lose their sponsorship rights outright, cutting an estimated 12,000 international students from the system.For lower-fee universities, heavily dependent on international enrolments, even a brief suspension could be fatal.Institutions are now:The result is a cautious and sometimes blunt response: cutting entire markets to protect compliance.The UK government has made it clear that the new rules are intended to restore public confidence in the international student route. Ministers argue that genuine students remain welcome but institutions must take greater responsibility for screening applicants. At the same time, universities warn that the reforms will reshape the sector — reducing diversity, limiting access for students from developing countries, and pushing institutions toward more profitable markets such as China and the Gulf. The Home Office maintains that it “strongly values” international students but insists that only genuine applicants should come to the UK.The freeze on recruitment from Pakistan and Bangladesh is not a political statement by universities. It is a defensive manoeuvre forced by tougher immigration rules, high refusal rates and the fear of losing the right to sponsor students altogether. But regardless of the intention, the impact is immediate: thousands of South Asian students now find their UK education plans derailed, delayed or dropped — not because of their merit, but because the system around them changed overnight.","Several UK universities have stopped accepting new applications from Pakistan and Bangladesh after tighter Home Office rules.

Just touched down in Saudi Arabia and eager to get behind the wheel? Whether you're planning to navigate Riyadh's busy streets or take a leisurely drive through Jeddah, your first step is to figure out if your foreign driving license can be easily converted, or if you'll need to start fresh.Whether you're a new resident or a long-term expat, this guide breaks down the process of converting your license or applying for a new Saudi driving license. We’ve got you covered with everything you need to know, so you won’t be left guessing.Foreigners are allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia under certain conditions. If you hold a valid international or foreign driving license, you can legally drive for up to one year from your date of arrival in the Kingdom, or until your license expires, whichever comes first. After this period, or if you become a resident, you will need to obtain a Saudi driving license.If you're from India, Europe, or any other country, you can drive in Saudi Arabia for up to one year using your home country’s driving license. However, you must carry both your original license and a translated International Driving Permit (IDP). The IDP is required by law for driving on a foreign license in Saudi Arabia, as it serves as an official translation of your original license.Keep in mind that driving without a valid Saudi or officially converted foreign license could result in fines or legal consequences, so be sure to get the necessary documentation in place before you hit the road.If you're planning to stay longer than a year, or you're applying for certain services, you’ll need to convert your license or obtain a new one, depending on where it's issued from.Saudi Arabia offers two different paths for obtaining a Saudi driving license, depending on where your original license was issued.If you're eligible for direct license conversion, meaning you hold a valid license from one of the approved countries, you can convert it directly into a Saudi license without the need to take a driving test. This process is much faster and more straightforward.However, if your home country is not on the approved list, you won’t be able to convert your license directly. Instead, you’ll need to apply as a new driver, which involves enrolling in a Saudi driving school. You’ll need to complete both theoretical and practical driving tests and pay for training sessions, testing, and issuance fees.If you hold a valid driving license from one of the 48 approved countries, including GCC countries, you’re eligible to convert it directly into a Saudi driving license, no driving test required. However, an application, translation, documentation, and medical check are mandatory.If your license is from one of these countries, here’s how you can convert it.Your first task is to get your driving license officially translated into Arabic. Without this step, the conversion process will not proceed.Use the official Absher portal ( absher.sa ) to book an appointment with the General Department of Traffic (Muroor).Use your bank’s online app to access Sadad under Government Payments and select “Driving License Issuance.”Visit an Efada-approved medical center for your health check, bringing:Tests include:On your appointment day, head to the designated Muroor office or traffic school with:Make sure you have your Iqama and all original documents ready, as they are required to complete your license issuance.If everything is in order and your license is from an approved country, you’ll receive your Saudi license the same day, no tests required.If your home country is not listed, you will need to apply as a new driver in Saudi Arabia. That means:This process is longer and involves multiple steps, including lessons and test scheduling, but is required for full legal driving eligibility in Saudi Arabia.Also read: How can foreigners obtain a Saudi driving license if they’re not eligible for direct conversion?",Saudi Arabia allows visitors from 48 countries to directly convert their driving licenses without a driving test.

Donald Trump's Stricter H-1B Visa Rule Hits Indian Talent, Background Check Screening Expanded





Researcher Simon Hankinson who worked as a visa officer in India opened up about his experience of interviewing for H-1B visa program 25 years ago and said he did not fail to see even at the beginning what was wrong with the program. In an opinion piece for Fox News, Hankinson wrote that something was badly wrong with the program which intended to bring 'specialty' workers to the US. But in reality, even 25 years ago, it was average college graduates that he interviewed for the visa program, he said.Hankinson said it's unfair to compare between a Chinese of an Indian student with an American student as a Chinese or Indian student goes to free or inexpensive schools in their countries, gets a BA, MA or even a PhD with little debt. But in America, students are borrowing thousands of dollars to get to the same level. ""They can’t take jobs at the same low salaries their H-1B competitors can,"" Hankinson said.""Amazon got over 10,000 approvals for H-1B visas in 2025, in the same year as they announced cuts of over 30,000 jobs. Was any effort made to retrain or re-assign Americans? Many other large US companies follow the same pattern: hire abroad, fire at home.""Hankinson also said that US companies do not need a lot of specialty workers. ""The truth is, the number of real ""specialty"" workers that even big American companies really need should fit in a bus, not a stadium. And they should be willing to pay a high premium for them,"" he wrote.""If AI firms are really willing to pay up to a hundred million dollars in signing bonuses for top talent, they will be willing to pay high salaries to get a few essential foreign workers. Some in Washington want to increase visas for foreign workers. Some even believe that Americans should have to compete for their jobs with the whole world. I don’t,"" he wrote.In his recent H-1B report for the Heritage Foundation, Hankinson cited the example of Indian politician Kandi Srinivas Reddy, who allegedly used several shell companies to submit multiple H-1B petitions for the same workers.

IndiGo Crisis: Inside Pilot Shortage, Rule Change and Winter Delays Behind Over 200 Cancellations

IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers has written to employees acknowledging the severe disruptions that have hit the airline in recent days, conceding that IndiGo “could not live up to the promise” of providing a good travel experience to passengers.The carrier has seen more than 300 flight cancellations on Thursday alone, with scores of services delayed as operational challenges mounted.In the internal message, Elbers said the past few days had been “difficult for many of our IndiGo customers and colleagues”, noting that the airline serves close to 3.8 lakh customers daily but had failed to meet expectations.“We could not live up to that promise these past days and we have publicly apologised for that,” he said.Elbers attributed the crisis to a mix of “minor technology glitches, schedule changes, adverse weather conditions, heightened congestion in the aviation ecosystem, and the implementation of the newly released FDTL norms”, which “compounded negatively to create a cascading impact on our operations”.He expressed gratitude to pilots, cabin crew, engineers, OCC, customer support, digital teams and airport staff who have been working “tirelessly to manage the situation, minimise the impact, and restore stability as quickly as possible”.As per PTI, IndiGo’s on-time performance had plunged to 19.7 per cent on December 3, underlining the scale of the disruption.Elbers told staff that given the size and complexity of IndiGo’s network, disruptions “grow large immediately” and require interventions at multiple levels. “Our immediate goal is to normalise our operations and bring punctuality back on track in the coming days, which is not an easy target,” he wrote.The DGCA has summoned IndiGo’s senior management to explain the unprecedented nationwide disruptions and present a corrective plan.The airline has already initiated “calibrated adjustments” to its schedules for the next 48 hours to stabilise operations, according to its official statement.Elbers, in his letter, urged employees to come together as one team, recalling how IndiGo recently completed the upgrade of 200 A320 aircraft within 24 hours. “I am confident we all can deal with this challenge too… Together, as one team, we will overcome this challenge and emerge even stronger,” he said.","IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers has written to employees acknowledging the severe disruptions that have hit the airline in recent days.

Rise of Rehman Dakait and the Peoples’ Aman Committee





Feuds, betrayal and the making of Uzair Baloch





Parallel governance, ‘parchi’ systems and water mafias





Several informal systems operated during this period:

The ‘Parchi’ System: Residents, businesses and even small schools were required to obtain a stamped permission slip or parchi from PAC offices to build, renovate, operate stalls or open new ventures. What looked like a routine approval process effectively served as taxation, a tool of surveillance and a means to regulate economic activity.

Water and Tanker Control: Amid persistent water shortages across Karachi, PAC factions captured key pipeline points and operated illegal hydrants. Water was sold through tankers at inflated rates, turning a basic utility into one of the most profitable sources of revenue for the gangs. Control over water distribution also gave PAC leverage over entire neighbourhoods.

Welfare Patronage and ‘Robin Hood’ Politics: A share of illicit earnings was used to sponsor madrassas, support religious events, organise football tournaments, fund community funerals and assist poor families. This welfare strategy deepened PAC’s influence and aligned it with PPP’s political base, reinforcing the perception of gang leaders as protectors rather than mere criminals.

PPP, the Bhuttos and the contested 'protector' narrative





A factual account of the events surrounding Benazir’s return and death underscores this point:

Karsaz bombing (18 October 2007): Benazir was in an open truck surrounded by PPP volunteers, not in a car. Her protection was largely handled by party workers and an informal crowd, not gang networks.

Assassination in Rawalpindi December, 27, 2007: At the time she was targeted, she was travelling in a white Toyota Land Cruiser driven by Javed Rehman, a trained PPP driver, not Rehman Dakait. No credible evidence links the gangster to her security detail.

Post-war Lyari: Quiet streets, unresolved questions









NEW DELHI: Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the “mother of Karachi” – one of the city’s oldest settlements powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football-obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets, long branded as Karachi’s “wild west.”It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar’s recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema. The film revolves around characters that seem to be inspired by gangster Rehman Dakait, police officer Chaudhry Aslam and a shadowy military-intelligence player resembling Ilyas Kashmiri (fictionalised as Major Iqbal). Alongside Pakistani security figures, the narrative hints at a foreign intelligence angle featuring an unnamed “Indian spy chief” — a character with echoes of a former top security official who, in real life, has been involved in covert roles in regional conflicts in Pakistan. These references remain ambiguous on screen, but they mirror real allegations that have circulated for years through local press conferences, dossiers and counterclaims on both sides of the border.Reacting to the controversy around Dhurandhar and the a case file in Delhi high court, Major Mohit Sharma’s brother, Madhur Sharma, said the petition was filed due to ongoing speculation that the film was inspired by the Ashok Chakra awardee’s life without any transparency from the makers. Madhur clarified that the family is not opposed to a film based on Major Sharma, but objected to the possibility of using his story without consent. “We would be proud if a film is made on him. Even in 2021, a film was announced and we supported the producers. He has left a legacy, and it should live on,” he said. The family maintains that they are only seeking clarity and dignity for the officer: “There is no benefit the parents are looking for… If the film is based on him, just say, ‘Sorry ma’am, we didn’t inform you.’ If not, say the hype is untrue.”The Delhi high court heard the plea filed by Major Sharma’s parents seeking a review before the film’s release. While the court did not stay the December 5 release of Dhurandhar, it acknowledged the legitimacy of the family’s concerns regarding similarities to a real-life officer without consent. The court referred the matter to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for examination, noting the need for regulatory scrutiny before the film proceeds.Following the controversy, director Aditya Dhar issued a clarification on X addressed to the family. He wrote: “Hi, sir - our film Dhurandhar is not based on the life of braveheart Major Mohit Sharma AC(P) SM. This is an official clarification. I assure you, if we do make a biopic on Mohit sir in the future, we will do it with full consent and in complete consultation with the family, and in a way that truly honors his sacrifice for the nation and the legacy it has left for all of us. Jai Hind.”This blurred mix of fact, rumour and state narrative reflects Lyari’s history itself. For more than six decades, the neighbourhood has moved on two parallel tracks. One is a working-class community that powered Karachi’s docks, produced champion boxers and footballers, and remained a loyal base of the Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ). The other is a network of gangs and protection rackets that emerged from the hashish trade of the 1960s and later expanded into narcotics trafficking, extortion, land capture and control of water tankers.Successive governments, including PPP administrations, did not simply fight these groups; at various points they bargained with them, funded them or turned a blind eye. Leaders like Rehman Dakait, and later Uzair Baloch, acted not only as crime bosses but as political intermediaries who ran parallel governance under the banner of the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), often brandishing PPP flags at their offices. As Taliban networks poured into Karachi in the 2000s and regional intelligence rivalries spilled into the city, Lyari’s gangs were no longer seen merely as enforcers protecting a vote bank — they were gradually treated as potential pieces in a wider security chessboard.With Dhurandhar reigniting attention, this story revisits how Lyari transformed from a labour colony to PPP stronghold to a battleground shaped by gang wars, state patronage, counter-terror operations and allegations of espionage. What emerges is not simply the tale of feared men, but the story of a neighbourhood where poverty, politics and competing security agendas turned everyday life into a prolonged and violent conflict.a long, violent war.Lyari is among the oldest continuously inhabited parts of Karachi and holds a foundational place in the city’s history. Long before Karachi became Pakistan’s financial hub, Lyari evolved as a working-class settlement dominated by Baloch communities who migrated from coastal and interior regions in search of livelihoods. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as the port emerged as the centre of colonial trade, Baloch labourers became indispensable to loading cargo, building roads and supporting maritime activities. This early dependence on manual workers gradually transformed Lyari into a labour colony closely interlinked with Karachi’s industrial and infrastructural growth.Despite its importance in sustaining the city’s economy, the locality remained neglected in terms of urban development. Narrow lanes, dense housing clusters, unreliable utilities and limited state services came to define its daily reality. Yet, Lyari’s social fabric remained strong: sports, community centres and local cultural traditions created a sense of belonging that distinguished it from other Karachi neighbourhoods.In politics, Lyari’s identity further crystallised with the rise of the Pakistan People's Party. Since the 1970s, the PPP’s populist messaging—centred on economic justice and empowerment of marginalised groups—found deep resonance in Lyari. During decades of shifting political power in Karachi, the locality consistently returned PPP candidates to provincial and national assemblies. This loyalty turned Lyari into the party’s most dependable urban stronghold, a constituency where electoral victories were seldom in doubt.Over time, however, this relationship between Lyari and the PPP took a complex turn. As Karachi’s security landscape deteriorated in the 1980s and 1990s, the party increasingly relied on local strongmen, community leaders and later armed groups to maintain influence and protect its vote bank. Patronage networks developed, blurring the lines between politics, street authority and organised crime. What began as a working-class community with a vibrant political identity would eventually become the focal point of Karachi’s most violent gang conflict—one in which loyalty, power and criminality became deeply entangled.The roots of the Lyari gang war go back to the 1960s, when the area emerged as a key node in the local hashish trade. According to both journalistic and academic accounts, early figures like Dad Muhammad (“Dadal”) and his brother Sheru moved into the hashish business in the mid-1960s, challenging the dominance of an older drug boss known as “Kala Nag”.Kala Nag was eventually killed in what was officially described as a police encounter, and the hashish economy fragmented into rival factions. Violence at this stage largely revolved around knives and small arms, with public killings used to send messages and enforce territorial control.In the 1990s, a more educated generation of criminals appeared. One of the most prominent was Iqbal, known locally as “Babu Dacoit”, who reportedly held a Master’s degree in physics. Operating across a wider network, he ran drugs and other rackets while remaining largely beyond the reach of the police. His later arrest, when he was already paralysed, symbolised a shift from small-scale street crime to more organised, networked operations.A major shift in Lyari’s politics and crime landscape came with the ascent of Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, widely known as Rehman Dakait. Born into a family already linked to smuggling networks, Rehman entered the criminal world at a young age. By the mid-1990s, he had developed a reputation for extreme violence, with local accounts even alleging that he murdered his own mother during a domestic dispute—an unverified but persistent story that reinforced his notoriety.By the early 2000s, Rehman had consolidated control over large parts of Lyari’s illicit economy, including drug trafficking, extortion and gambling rackets. Yet, he also cultivated an image as a benefactor. Oral histories, media reporting and academic studies describe how he funded small clinics, madrassas, football tournaments, neighbourhood parks and schools, using criminal proceeds to build patronage. This dual identity—provider and predator—helped him secure legitimacy among segments of the local population who felt abandoned by the state.Rehman’s rise coincided with Lyari’s continued loyalty to the PPP. As political competition intensified in Karachi, PPP leaders increasingly saw strategic value in a local armed actor who could protect the party’s dominance and mobilise votes. Political alignment, according to multiple accounts, allowed Rehman to operate with greater impunity and helped formalise gang influence under a new name: the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC).Formed around 2008, the PAC presented itself as a community “peace” organisation but functioned as an institutionalised version of Rehman’s operations. It opened offices, appointed local commanders, mediated disputes, collected protection money and distributed welfare. In a context of chronic state neglect, many residents began to rely on the PAC as a parallel administration, making it one of the most powerful non-state authorities Karachi had ever seen.The roots of Lyari’s modern gang war lie in an older conflict shaped by ransom kidnappings, shifting alliances and internal betrayals. In the 1980s and 1990s, parts of Lyari’s criminal economy were dominated by a figure known as Haji Lalu, with another notorious operator, Dadal, working as one of his trusted aides. Disputes over ransom money extorted from wealthy businessmen gradually fractured this relationship. The split laid the foundation for two rival blocs: one centred on Lalu and his son, Arshad Pappu, and the other aligned with Dadal’s family, including his son, Rehman Dakait.The rivalry intensified through the 1990s. Dadal’s murder—widely believed to have been carried out by a competing gang—created a vacuum that Rehman moved to fill, initially with Lalu’s support. But a later dispute over a substantial ransom sum allegedly taken behind Rehman’s back marked the end of that partnership. The fallout turned the former allies into adversaries, cementing a bitter feud between Rehman’s camp and that of Haji Lalu and Arshad Pappu.A separate event subsequently brought an important new actor onto the scene: Uzair Jan Baloch, the son of a transport businessman, Faiz Muhammad, known locally as Mama Faizu. According to both police records and local accounts, Faizu was kidnapped and killed in 2003 by men linked to Arshad Pappu. Uzair initially attempted to seek justice through legal channels but reportedly faced threats and obstruction. Sharing a common enemy in Pappu, he turned instead toward his cousin, Rehman Dakait, joining his organisation.Over the following years, the Rehman–Uzair alliance fought a sustained war against the Pappu–Lalu network. What began as a dispute over illicit profits evolved into a violent cycle of killings, reprisals and territorial battles. By the mid-2000s, the feud had escalated into one of the deadliest urban conflicts in Karachi, with casualties running into the hundreds and paving the way for a new era of militarised gang politics.With the rise of Rehman Dakait and, later, Uzair Baloch, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) grew beyond a criminal network and evolved into a parallel governance structure in Lyari. Between roughly 2008 and 2013, researchers describe Lyari as effectively under PAC’s informal administration, with neighbourhood “commanders’’ exercising authority over small jurisdictions. These commanders managed disputes, issued permissions and collected funds in a manner that closely resembled state functions.These overlapping spheres blurred boundaries between state actors and non-state power. PAC offices routinely displayed both their own banners and PPP flags, while police operations in Lyari were often delayed, curtailed or influenced by political pressure. For a period, the PAC did not simply challenge state authority—it partially replaced it.Within Lyari, Rehman Dakait was widely viewed as being closely aligned with senior leaders of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Journalistic reporting and local accounts repeatedly describe him as someone who maintained proximity to the Bhutto leadership and attended major PPP political events.A popular narrative in Lyari claims that Rehman “saved” former prime minister Benazir Bhutto during the 18 October 2007 Karsaz attack in Karachi, when two explosions targeted her homecoming procession. In these accounts, Rehman is portrayed as part of an informal security circle that helped her escape following the blast. The story has fuelled his “protector” image and contributed to his Robin Hood-style mystique.However, despite the narrative’s frequency in oral history, there is no independent, verifiable evidence confirming that Rehman personally rescued Benazir or served as her driver or official security guard at any point. What is more clearly documented is the broader political relationship: Lyari’s gangs and the PPP operated in a framework of mutual benefit for years, with the party relying on armed control of the constituency and the gangs receiving political space to operate.After the PPP returned to power in 2008, Rehman publicly rebranded himself as Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, presenting the Peoples’ Aman Committee as a community organisation rather than a gang body. His growing political visibility, and reported sympathies with certain Baloch nationalist circles, are believed by some analysts and residents to have contributed to his killing in a controversial police “encounter” in 2009.As media scrutiny of Lyari intensified and gang violence spread to other parts of Karachi, state pressure began to mount. At the centre of this response was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, an officer in the Crime Investigation Department (CID) known for aggressive policing tactics. Aslam cultivated a reputation as an “encounter specialist,” targeting both militant groups and organised crime. His public stance against Lyari gangs put him in direct confrontation with Rehman Dakait, who by the mid-2000s had become one of the most influential figures in Karachi’s underworld.Law enforcement records and press reports from the period describe a tense cat-and-mouse dynamic between the two men. Rehman repeatedly evaded capture; in at least two documented incidents, he escaped custody after allegedly bribing police officers. According to local media accounts and later investigations, Rehman paid select CID and jail officials to secure temporary releases or avoid charges, a practice facilitated by weak internal oversight and political protection. These incidents contributed to Aslam’s personal resolve. Journalists covering Karachi’s crime beat recall that Aslam increasingly framed the pursuit of Rehman as a matter of professional and personal credibility for the police force.On 9 August 2009, police announced that Rehman had been killed in a shootout near Steel Town, on Karachi’s outskirts. Officials claimed that Rehman and three accomplices opened fire on police and were killed in retaliatory fire. However, from the outset, rights groups and local residents questioned the official account. Activists, lawyers and researchers later described the killing as a likely extrajudicial execution, consistent with a broader pattern of “encounters” used in Karachi to bypass a slow judicial system and fragile witness protections.With Rehman removed, the gang landscape did not stabilise. Instead, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), which he had informally led, underwent a leadership transition. Within weeks, Uzair Jan Baloch was positioned as Rehman’s successor, assuming both the criminal networks and the political connections tied to PPP support. Unlike Rehman, whose authority rested heavily on personality and charisma, Uzair’s tenure was marked by greater bureaucratisation—defined commanders, more formalised extortion systems and deeper conflict with the state. This period would set the stage for some of the bloodiest episodes of the Lyari gang war.After Rehman Dakait’s killing in 2009, leadership of the Lyari network did not pass smoothly to a single successor. Uzair Jan Baloch projected himself as the political head of the organisation: educated, relatively well-spoken, and comfortable appearing alongside PPP leaders. His image contrasted sharply with the operational commander Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla”, who had a reputation for ruthlessness built over years as an enforcer in neighbourhood turf battles.Initially, the two worked side by side under the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) banner. But disagreements over extortion routes, neighbourhood control and access to political patrons gradually turned into open rivalry. Within Lyari, some commanders gravitated toward Uzair’s political authority and alleged links to provincial leadership; others aligned with Baba Ladla’s street power. This divide transformed PAC from a single entity into competing armed factions.The conflict reached its most infamous moment in March 2013, with the killing of rival gangster Arshad Pappu. According to court filings and media reporting, Pappu and his brother Yasir Arafat were abducted from Karachi’s Defence neighbourhood and taken to Lyari. Both were tortured, killed and later mutilated. Their remains were reportedly burned and dumped—widely interpreted as Uzair’s retaliation for the killing of his father, Faiz Muhammad. Some later accounts, including police dossiers and local testimonies, alleged that gang members kicked or played football with severed heads, turning the murders into a grim public spectacle that circulated in local narratives.By this stage, the greatest toll fell on ordinary residents. Prolonged firefights between splinter factions left neighbourhoods barricaded for days. Homes and small businesses were commandeered as torture rooms or lookout posts. Young men were coerced into gang recruitment, teachers and shopkeepers were forced to pay “taxes,” and ambulance workers trying to retrieve bodies were threatened by both sides. In response, the state increasingly turned to large-scale fires, sieges and heavy weaponry, culminating in the militarised crackdowns that would soon follow.In April–May 2012, the Sindh government initiated one of Karachi’s largest security actions against gang networks, later known as Operation Lyari. The police deployed thousands of personnel, armoured carriers and specialised units with the stated goal of clearing the area and arresting key commanders linked to the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). For the first time, a formal state crackdown directly targeted the network that had operated for years through political patronage and parallel governance.The operation, however, quickly encountered intense resistance. Armed groups used heavy weaponry, including rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), to attack the advancing police. Several armoured personnel carriers were damaged or destroyed, and police units struggled to push through Lyari’s dense alleyways, where snipers and lookout positions gave gang members a tactical advantage. After several days of fighting, rising casualties, and growing criticism from political circles, the operation stalled. It ended without major arrests and was widely perceived as a failure that exposed both the state’s limitations and PAC’s entrenched power.For residents, the consequences were immediate and severe. Lyari was effectively sealed off for about a week, with restricted movement in and out of the neighbourhood. Power and water supplies were disrupted, markets were shut, and families already living under economic strain faced shortages of food and basic essentials. Humanitarian groups and ambulance services reported being blocked or delayed from providing aid, amid police suspicions that relief efforts could serve as a cover to transport weapons or militants.The failed siege deepened mistrust between civilians, gangs and the state. Many residents had already endured years of coercive “taxes” and violence under PAC rule; the security operation then subjected them to collective punishment, indiscriminate fire and deprivation. Instead of restoring confidence, the crackdown reinforced the perception that both the state and the gangs were willing to sacrifice ordinary people to protect their own interests.Even as Lyari’s gang networks fought prolonged turf wars, Karachi was simultaneously becoming a logistical base for militant organisations, particularly factions of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). As security operations intensified in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt, militants sought anonymity in large urban centres. Pashtun-majority neighbourhoods such as Sohrab Goth, Manghopir and SITE became key sanctuaries and transit corridors where fighters, explosives and finances could be moved with relative ease.The turning point came on 8 June 2014, when ten militants launched an armed assault on Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, using automatic weapons, grenades and a rocket launcher. The attack triggered an overnight battle that left at least 36 people dead, including all ten assailants. The incident severely embarrassed federal authorities and exposed vulnerabilities in Karachi’s security infrastructure. The scale of the attack underscored that the city’s violence was no longer just about gangs—it was also linked to national insurgency networks.In the aftermath, the state expanded its response. The federal and provincial governments granted Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) extensive policing and detention powers to target both militants and criminal networks. These operations aligned with ongoing national counterinsurgency campaigns, including Operation Zarb-e-Azb and later Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, which aimed to dismantle militant networks and disrupt their finances and recruitment pipelines.In Karachi, this translated into a sustained, multi-year crackdown led by the Rangers. Tactical raids, mass arrests, prolonged detentions under special legal provisions and high-profile encounters became common features of urban policing. In Lyari, the result was a shrinking space for gangs to openly control territory. The Peoples’ Aman Committee and splinter factions still operated, but their public influence diminished as armed checkpoints, displays of heavy weaponry and enforced taxation became more difficult to sustain. Although pockets of violence persisted, the crackdown marked the beginning of the end of large, overt gang administrations in the city.One of the most high-profile casualties in the post-2014 security phase was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, the police officer who had led major operations against both Lyari gangs and militant networks. On 9 January 2014, a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into Aslam’s convoy in Karachi, killing him and at least three others. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility, calling the attack revenge for police operations against its fighters and financiers. Aslam’s death was widely perceived as a serious setback to the city’s counter-terror and anti-gang efforts, though operations continued under other police officers and with greater reliance on Pakistan Rangers (Sindh).For Lyari’s armed groups, the most decisive blow came three years later. Acting on intelligence reports, Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) launched a pre-dawn raid on 2 February 2017 in Phool Patti Lane, Lyari, targeting Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla.” According to Rangers’ statements, a gun battle lasting over 30 minutes ensued, during which gang members used automatic weapons and grenades. By the end of the raid, Rangers announced that Baba Ladla and two close associates had been killed.Listed for years among Pakistan’s “most wanted” criminals, Baba Ladla faced cases ranging from murder and extortion to armed attacks on police and suspected collaborations with extremist groups. His death effectively dismantled a key pillar of the Uzair-era structure, removing the most prominent operational commander who had challenged both rivals inside Lyari and the security forces sent to eliminate them.By the mid-2010s, as state pressure intensified and gang structures were fractured by successive operations, Uzair Jan Baloch left Pakistan. In December 2015, Interpol arrested him at Dubai International Airport, reportedly while he was travelling from Muscat. He was subsequently handed over to Pakistani authorities and brought back to Karachi.From 2016 onward, Uzair was charged in dozens of criminal cases, ranging from murder and attempted murder to extortion, kidnapping and terrorism. Many of these cases have since resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence, hostile witnesses or procedural weaknesses—a pattern that has long characterised Karachi’s organised crime trials, where intimidation makes witness testimony difficult.In April 2017, a new dimension emerged when the Pakistan Army took custody of Uzair to try him under military law. He was accused of espionage and leaking sensitive information to a foreign intelligence agency, reportedly linked to Iran. In April 2020, a military court sentenced him to 12 years in prison on espionage charges, marking a significant shift in how the state officially characterized him—not merely as a gang leader, but as a potential national security threat.Pakistani officials and segments of local media have occasionally linked Uzair’s alleged intelligence connections to the controversial case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian national sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in 2017. One strand of narrative suggests that Uzair’s alleged contacts in Iran overlapped with networks also linked to Jadhav. However, India has rejected Pakistan’s claims in the Jadhav case as coerced and unsubstantiated, and publicly verifiable evidence connecting Uzair directly to operational support for Jadhav remains limited.What is clearer is that, from the perspective of the Pakistani state, Uzair Baloch’s profile evolved from that of a gang leader embedded in local politics to an alleged cross-border security risk—reshaping the narrative around Lyari’s gangs and their significance.As violence worsened and Lyari began drawing national and even international scrutiny, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) gradually shifted its stance on the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). Between 2012 and 2013, amid pressure from rival parties, security agencies and media coverage, the PPP formally disowned the PAC, despite years of visible proximity.Senior party leaders later framed PAC figures as rogue actors or products of state neglect, arguing that they were not part of a deliberate political strategy. Critics, however—including journalists, residents and some researchers—contend that the PPP benefitted for years from PAC’s armed control of Lyari, only distancing itself once the political and reputational costs became unsustainable.This distancing reflected a broader shift: as the state redefined Lyari’s gangs from political intermediaries to security liabilities, political actors recalibrated their alliances. What had once been an informal partnership built on patronage and vote control became a liability in the age of counterterrorism and international scrutiny.Security indicators suggest that overt gang violence in Lyari has dropped sharply since the mid-2010s. Rangers-led operations, the removal or incarceration of key gang leaders such as Rehman, Uzair and Baba Ladla, and broader counter-terror campaigns have reduced the frequency of armed clashes and targeted killings in the area.The legacy of the Lyari gang war remains unfinished. For many families, the years of kidnappings, torture, blockades and forced recruitment left deep social and economic scars. Questions continue to surround extrajudicial killings, disappearances and the conduct of both the gangs and state agencies tasked with fighting them. Although large armed networks have been dismantled, traces of informal control and low-level criminality persist in new forms.At the same time, Lyari’s cultural and political identity is evolving again. The football grounds, community schools and cultural centres that once defined the neighbourhood are re-emerging, even as residents remain wary of new power brokers. In popular culture, recent portrayals such as Dhurandhar and other planned projects reflect an enduring public fascination with Lyari—its blurred boundaries between criminal groups, political actors and state security agencies, and the unanswered questions they leave behind.Seen in retrospect, the gang war was not merely the story of violent figures in a marginalised settlement. It grew out of structural inequality, weak state institutions and a political party’s reliance on armed intermediaries to protect its vote bank. As militancy and regional intelligence rivalries later intersected with local crime networks, a neighbourhood built from labour and sport became entangled in national security narratives.Lyari today is quieter, but its past continues to shape how residents understand politics, policing and protection. The names of Rehman Dakait, Uzair Baloch, Baba Ladla and Arshad Pappu remain part of local memory—sometimes condemned as criminals, sometimes recalled as flawed protectors, always as evidence of how quickly a working-class community can become a battleground when crime, politics and security policy converge.","Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the ‘mother of Karachi’ – powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football- obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets. It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar's recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125768364,imgsize-87724,width-400,resizemode-4/lyari-gang-war.jpg"

Fares of other carriers soared at the same time. Another carrier operating from Nagpur was charging Rs 22,000 for a ticket to Mumbai or Delhi for economy class — almost equal to business class rates. In some centres, it was as much as Rs 50,000 per person, with the earliest ticket not available before December 6. At the IndiGo Airlines counter, passengers only received uncertain replies on ticket availability in coming days. Only five flights took off from Nagpur on Thursday till 9pm.The cancelled flights included a plane bound for Pune from Kolkata, which was diverted to Nagpur midday, only to later scrap the journey. There were 162 persons aboard. This was not a typical emergency diversion from a technical snag or a medical emergency with a passenger, said sources. ""The airlines simply said it was an operational reason,"" said a source.It was learnt there was no parking bay available at Pune airport, which was already full with cancelled flights.This led to the flight being diverted, and the journey was truncated, said a source in the airport management.By 9 pm, as many as 11 flights of IndiGo Airlines were cancelled, with many running inordinately delayed. The flights that were cancelled connected the city with Pune, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Goa. Most of these run on a to-and-fro basis, so even arrivals were affected. IndiGo is the largest player at the Nagpur airport, operating 22 flights. There are chances that more flights may be cancelled by midnight, said an employee. The signboard at the departure gate at 8:30pm displayed only the status of a lone flight.""Don't ask for tickets for at least a week,"" said an executive at the booking counter. ""Even we are not sure if there would be any available. Many flights that are running delayed are eventually being cancelled.""An angry Devendra Singh and his friend Mukul Soni said they purchased a ticket, barely a couple of hours ago, only to find out that flights had been cancelled. ""I purchased the ticket to Delhi right from the airline's portal at 7pm for a flight scheduled for 9pm. Why should they sell tickets if the flights were cancelled?"" said Devendra. His friend, Mukul, also purchased a ticket around the same time from an aggregator's portal.The Wakharia family had to catch a flight to Tokyo from Delhi. Earlier, they had planned to fly to Delhi on Friday, but looking at the crisis, they preponed and booked tickets for Thursday, only for the plane to be cancelled. The family later booked a taxi to Delhi.""The crisis also left the ground staff overstretched. We have to report at a given time, but there's no fixed schedule for return since two days. There's too much work, handling cancellations and rescheduling.

NEW DELHI: Over nearly three decades, Swarn Singh and his brother-in-law Dharmender, wanted across multiple states, honed a precise method of siphoning fuel from underground petroleum pipelines.What began as oil pilferage from tankers in the early 1990s evolved into a structured operation built around rented houses, concealed tunnels, improvised valves and night-time diversion of diesel. Their knowledge of a wide terrain and shifting techniques kept them a step ahead of police in at least three states until Delhi Police crime branch arrested them on Wednesday.On June 10, Jaipur police detected that HPCL MDPL pipeline near Dahmi Kalan had been tapped. They zeroed in on a rented house and found tools for digging, a bedroom tunnel and a galvanised pipe with valves for feeding diesel into tankers, a senior officer said. HPCL promptly removed the valves the two had fitted.A person from Assam who used to live in the house claimed the setup was created by ""Swaran Singh Sardar"". Swarn and Dharmender immediately went underground. ""On Dec 3, acting on an input, the crime branch traced them to Vikaspuri and arrested them,"" the cop said.Both allegedly admitted they were involved in tapping pipelines in Jaipur and said they did the same in Kurukshetra, Bathinda, Jaipur, Paschim Vihar and Gurgaon, often using the same DIY method.Swarn's brush with crimes dates to the early 1990s when he worked as a tanker driver and would siphon fuel from the tankers. Dharmender, also a driver, later joined him.The two used to survey long stretches of pipelines and chose isolated points behind residential plots or on the outskirts of towns where pipeline markers were visible, but the movement of people was low. ""To avoid suspicion, they would take a room or a shop on rent and run a small-time businesses like selling mineral water, while preparing to strike,"" DCP (crime) Harsh Indora said.On the premises, they used to shovel a tunnel towards a pipeline. The digging was done in phases over several days to avoid altering neighbours. Once they reached the pipeline, they fixed an improvised metal connection fitted with valves. A plastic hose would then run from the hidden tapping point to storage tanks or directly into a waiting tanker, which used to transport the fuel late at night.The tapping point was camouflaged, and only a handful of trusted associates were involved in the operations. The fuel was sold at a rate lower than the market price to transporters willing to buy ""open diesel"" or was sent to industrial buyers in small, hired vehicles. The two focused on the Jaipur route because of easy access to transporters and heavy movement of goods vehicles in the corridor.Swarn is linked to over a dozen cases in Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab. Charges against him include oil theft, cheating, damaging pipelines and violations under Petroleum & Minerals Pipelines Act. Dharmender has been named in cases of tapping pipelines in Jaipur and Punjab's Bathinda.","Swarn Singh and his brother-in-law Dharmender, wanted across multiple states, honed a precise method of siphoning fuel from underground petroleum pipelines.

IMD Issues Red Alert as Cyclone Ditwah Approaches TN; Sri Lanka Deaths Exceed 80

Unseasonal, patchy showers caught commuters off guard, with many drenched due to sudden bursts of rain despite bright weather earlier in the morning.

North Chennai and Tiruvallur recorded continuous overnight rainfall, while the showers gradually shifted to southern parts of the city during the day.

Manali, Ennore and Wimco Nagar recorded over 20 cm of rainfall in 24 hours, making them the most affected localities.

Meenambakkam, Ennore and Pallikaranai saw lighter spells, registering around 1.3 cm of rainfall.

Chennai’s maximum temperature dipped to 27.5°C, remaining nearly two degrees below normal due to dense cloud cover.

The IMD maintained its heavy rainfall warning for Chennai and nearby districts, cautioning residents about continued instability through the day.

Weather blogger Pradeep John (Tamil Nadu Weatherman) noted that no major rainfall events are expected for at least a week once this system moves out.

A yellow alert was issued for multiple districts, including Chennai, Tiruvallur, Ranipet, Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram and the Nilgiris, due to the lingering impact of Cyclone Ditwah.

Waterlogging intensified across several city pockets, such as Vyasarpadi, Kodungaiyur, MKB Nagar and Mullai Nagar, prompting civic teams to pump out excess water into Buckingham and Captain canals.

Cyclone Ditwah’s aftereffects continued across Tamil Nadu, with three deaths reported in rain-related incidents, widespread crop damage in Nagapattinam, flooding near the Vedaranyeswara Temple, and infrastructure disruption in multiple districts.

CHENNAI: Chennai continues to experience intermittent rainfall as Cyclone Ditwah’s influence lingers over the region.While the city saw scattered showers and localized downpours on Thursday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has indicated that the intensity of rain is set to decrease from Friday, with only isolated spells expected in parts of Chennai and Tiruvallur.Here are the 10 key points:While the intensity of rain is set to ease from Friday, residents are advised to stay cautious in waterlogged areas.Authorities have stepped up monitoring and drainage efforts to ensure minimal disruption until the weather stabilizes.","North Chennai and Tiruvallur recorded continuous overnight rainfall, while the showers gradually shifted to southern parts of the city during the day.

They argue this ""warp-speed approach"" prioritizes AI investments over climate commitments and human workforce well-being, potentially harming democracy, jobs, and the environment.

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

Here's the complete open letter from Amazon 1000-plus employees:

Dear Andy Jassy and S-team,

In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond.

We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis. We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth.

We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm:

Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming.

Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019. The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants.

Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas.

Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement.

Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional.

Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally,

Jeff Bezos

owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance.

All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need.

We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following:

No AI with dirty energy.

No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments.

No AI without employee voices.

We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact.

No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.

Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine.

The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are.

This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of.

Signed,

1,039 Amazon employees (and counting!)





Thousands of Amazon employees have signed an open letter issuing to CEO Andy Jassy . The letter warns the company about its 'rapid' move toward AI. Signed by more than 1,000 Amazon workers (and counting), the open letter calls out Amazon for pushing its AI investments at the expense of climate and human workforce. The letter’s supporters come from a wide array of roles at the company, including many software engineers, and even employees focused on building AI systems. ""We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth,” the letter’s authors wrote. It adds, “We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene.”The open letter is reported to have been signed by Amazon workers anonymously, and comes almost a month after the ecommerce giant announced mass layoff plans as it increases adoption of AI in its operations. Among the signatories are employees in a range of positions, including engineers, product managers and warehouse associates. The letter argues that their employer is throwing out its climate promises in the scramble to win the AI race.Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, pointing to efficiencies from electric delivery vehicles and reduced plastic packaging in its climate commitment.","Over 1,000 Amazon employees have penned an open letter to CEO Andy Jassy, expressing grave concerns about the company's rapid AI development.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

How Elon Musk sees AI and robotics reshaping global industries





Elon Musk: A Different Conversation w/ Nikhil Kamath | Full Episode | People by WTF Ep. 16

Elon Musk’s prediction of AI-driven instant manufacturing





Elon Musk’s view of AI evolving beyond human well-being goals





Elon Musk’s vision of a future where ‘money becomes irrelevant’









Elon Musk has once again shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour. During a conversation on Nikhil Kamath’s People by WTF podcast, the Tesla and SpaceX chief suggested that the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and robotics is pushing society towards a future where humans no longer need to work to survive. Musk’s view is rooted in the belief that machines will eventually handle all essential tasks, allowing people to approach work as a creative or recreational activity rather than an economic necessity.He expressed strong confidence that the world could reach this turning point within the next two decades. For Musk, this future is not a distant fantasy but a likely outcome of the accelerating technological breakthroughs unfolding today.Musk argued that the extraordinary pace of development in AI models, autonomous systems, and humanoid robots is already rapidly reshaping industries worldwide. According to him, the next phase of technological growth will create intelligent machines that can replicate or even surpass human capability in almost every domain, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare, education, and creative services.He believes that this massive transition may occur much sooner than most people expect, possibly within ten to fifteen years. Musk compared future labour to home gardening. Just as people may choose to grow vegetables for enjoyment rather than necessity, he thinks future generations will increasingly engage in work for personal fulfilment, creativity, or social contribution rather than mere survival. The essential work that maintains society will be managed entirely by advanced automated systems that require minimal or no human oversight.A core part of Musk’s argument is that AI systems will eventually be able to create anything a person can imagine. His own AI company, xAI, along with its chatbot Grok, reflects his belief that increasingly capable generative systems will expand into physical production through robotics, automation, and smart manufacturing techniques. As these technologies combine, they could enable a world where scarcity becomes obsolete and resource distribution becomes more equitable. Musk visualises a future in which goods and services can be produced instantly and efficiently.He emphasised that the ability to turn ideas into tangible products without traditional labour inputs would fundamentally reshape economies, social structures, and the global workforce. Once technology reaches this stage, he thinks most constraints on human consumption and lifestyle will disappear, creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation, creativity, and human progress.Musk also explored a lesser-discussed aspect of hyper-advanced AI. He suggested that there may come a time when AI and robotics complete every possible task aimed at improving human well-being. After satisfying all imaginable human desires and demands, these systems could reach a saturation point where they no longer have meaningful human-centred tasks to perform.At that stage, Musk believes AI may begin working on activities that serve its own optimisation because the catalogue of tasks that benefit humanity is finite. This idea raises profound questions about the long-term relationship between humans and intelligent machines once human needs are no longer the defining force behind technological activity. Musk’s predictions extend far beyond the automation of work. At the US Saudi Investment Forum earlier this month, he stated that humanoid robots and AI systems have the potential to eliminate poverty. His argument relies on the assumption that when machines can produce goods for virtually no cost and at limitless volume, wealth becomes universal because essential resources are accessible to everyone.If machines can meet all human needs, the traditional economic struggle for income, resources, and opportunity would disappear. Musk envisions a world where every person benefits equally from the capabilities of intelligent robots that can generate abundance without relying on human labour.In his discussion with Kamath, Musk introduced an even more radical idea. He predicted that money might eventually lose its relevance. In his view, money exists primarily as a tool for allocating labour and determining the value of goods that require human effort to produce. If production becomes entirely automated and unlimited, the need for money as a mechanism for distribution fades.Musk suggested that in such a world, the primary form of value might shift towards power generation. Energy would become the foundational currency because machines require it to operate, create and sustain the systems that support human life. The economy would therefore revolve around energy capacity rather than labour or manufactured goods.","Elon Musk has shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour. The Tesla and SpaceX chief suggested that the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and robotics is pushing society towards a future where humans no longer need to work to survive. Musk’s view is rooted in the belief that machines will eventually handle all essential tasks, allowing people to approach work as a creative or recreational activity. For Musk, this future is not a distant fantasy but a likely outcome of the accelerating technological breakthroughs unfolding today.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125685809,imgsize-27852,width-400,resizemode-4/elon-musk39s-alarming-prediction-on-nikhil-kamath39s-podcast-quotworking-will-be-optional-in-less-thanquot.jpg"

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are exhibiting weakness, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities. Here recommends a sell on rise strategy for investors:Gold futures on MCX traded near ₹1,30,000, showing signs of weakness after failing to sustain above the immediate resistance zone. Price action suggests that momentum is tilting in favor of sellers as the short-term averages flatten and oscillators indicate a lack of bullish conviction. The technical setup supports a sell-on-rise strategy near ₹1,30,400, with a stop-loss at ₹1,31,500 and potential downside targets around ₹1,29,000.Moving Averages (EMA 8 & EMA 21): The 8 EMA has flattened and is trending close to the 21 EMA, signaling loss of momentum and indecision in the short term. A failure to reclaim the ₹1,30,750–₹1,31,000 region will likely keep the bias negative for the session.Gold prices have slipped below the mid-bollinger band, confirming a shift to mild bearishness.

Traders are advised to adopt a sell-on-rise strategy near ₹1,30,400, keeping a strict stop-loss at ₹1,31,500 and targeting ₹1,29,000.

Rupee extends recovery: Currency gains 9 paise in early trade; all eyes on RBI's monetary policy decision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-extends-recovery-currency-gains-9-paise-in-early-trade-all-eyes-on-rbis-monetarypolicydecision/articleshow/125780015.cms,"Representative image

Priyanka Gandhi Slams Modi Govt On Rupee Crash While Piyush Goyal Defends India’s Economic Strength

The rupee extended its recovery on Friday, climbing 9 paise to 89.80 against the US dollar in early trade, ahead of the much awaited the Reserve Bank of India ’s monetary policy announcement.The bounce back comes after a highly volatile week in the currency market, during which rupee repeatedly slipped to new lows.Earlier on Thursday, the currency opened at 90.36 at the interbank foreign exchange market. However, it later reversed the course, ending the day at 89.89 against the greenback, appreciating by 26 paise. The rise was supported by weakness in the US dollar index and reports of intervention by the central bank.Thursday’s turnaround followed another milestone on Wednesday, when the currency breached the 90-per-dollar mark for the first time and closed at 90.15. The fall came due to selling pressure from foreign investors, a rise in crude oil prices and uncertainty linked to the delayed India–US trade deal.Despite the steep decline earlier this week, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran said on Wednesday that the currency’s depreciation is not impacting inflation or exports. According to him, a weaker rupee can aid outward shipments while making imports costlier.He noted that sectors with heavy import requirements, including gems and jewellery, petroleum and electronics, may face pressure if input costs continue rising, which could affect inflation expectations.Now, all eyes are on RBI's announcement expected at 10:00 AM on Friday, which will impact how the currency will be headed in the future.Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited said, “Rupee’s sharp recovery yesterday to 89.97 from the low of 90.42 is signalling some sort of stability in the currency market. The RBI governor’s views on the rupee today will significantly influence the near-term direction of the currency.”Meanwhile, Naveen Mathur, director - commodities & currencies at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers said that the apex bank may be tempted to hold the rate steady this time, ""due to higher concerns of rupee depreciation.""""More importantly, markets are looking for cues on the progress in US-India trade deal which could only provide major relief to the rupee in medium to long term perspective. On the higher side a breach and successful close above 90.70 could lead the pair to test next levels at around 91.40 – 91.50 on weekly basis,"" the expert added.","The rupee extended its recovery on Friday, climbing 9 paise to 89.80 against the US dollar in early trade, ahead of the Reserve Bank of India ’s monetary policy announcement.

The Death Note

BENGALURU: A 45-year-old Bengaluru software professional ended his life on Wednesday, accusing a local family and officials of the erstwhile BBMP, now Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA), of driving him to suicide through harassment.Murali Govindaraju, a resident of Brookbong Layout in Whitefield and father of two young daughters, worked at a private software company in ITPL. He was found dead in his under-construction home in Nallurahalli on Wednesday morning.Police have arrested Shashi Nambiar (64) and his wife Usha (57) on charges of abetting the suicide. Their son, Varun Nambiar, is currently being sought by authorities. The couple was produced before a magistrate and remanded in 14-day judicial custody.A 10-page death note recovered by police outlined Murali’s accusations. It said the Nambiars and “a few GBA officials” had tortured him over alleged violations of approved building plans and repeatedly demanded Rs 20 lakh to stop the harassment.“I am holding responsible Usha Nambiyar, her husband Shashi Nambiar and their son Varun Nambiar responsible for my death. They trapped me in a property issue and harassed me for money.I was unable to come out of the trap. I could not sell the property, nor construct to my desire nor live in the constructed property. I was ruined by them (Nambiars). We have lived a reputed life and no one in my family had ever visited a police station or attended a court. But Usha and Shashi made me to run around police station and court and spoiled the reputation of my family. The Nambiars should be held responsible for everything—my death and the downfall of my family. I had invested my entire life's earnings in this property. My property and other earnings should go to my mother. After her death, the same should be passed on to my children.”A senior police officer said residents have accused the Nambiars of extorting money by filing cases against them with BBMP.“According to locals, many houses are constructed in and around Nallurahalli where, Usha Nambiar, plays the role of an activist. If someone is harassed or tortured by Nambiars, we request them to come forward and file a police complaint,” he said.Investigations indicate that the spat began in 2018, when Murali purchased a 40x60 sq ft plot of land. Usha Nambiar reportedly approached BBMP, accusing him of violating the approved plan. BBMP conducted a spot inspection and issued a notice directing Murali to appear before officials on Wednesday.","Murali Govindaraju, 45, was found dead in his under-construction home in Nallurahalli.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
