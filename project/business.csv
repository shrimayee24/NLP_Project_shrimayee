NEW DELHI: The last Indian warship to be built abroad, a 3,900-tonne multi-role stealth frigate packed with sensors and weapons like the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, will be commissioned as INS Tamal in Russia on July 1.The Navy currently has 59 warships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards at an overall cost of around Rs 1.2 lakh crore to add to its expanding blue-water combat capabilities.It also has the initial approval or ‘acceptance of necessity (AoN)’ for indigenous construction of another 31 warships, including big projects for nine diesel-electric submarines, seven new-generation frigates and eight anti-submarine warfare corvettes.“The force has fully transformed from a `Buyer’s Navy’ to a `Builder’s Navy’ over the years. There is no plan for an Indian warship to be constructed abroad in the future,” a senior officer told TOI.The Navy, which currently has 140 warships and submarines along with over 250 aircraft and helicopters, plans to expand to around 180 warships and 350 aircraft and helicopters by 2030.This is crucial for tackling the rapidly-growing maritime collusiveness between China, which has the world’s largest Navy with 370 warships but is currently constrained by the `tyranny of logistics’ in the Indian Ocean Region, and Pakistan.China is also helping Pakistan to augment its naval capabilities, with the latter on course to induct eight Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines with air-independent propulsion in a major capability jump.The 125-metre long INS Tamal, with extended endurance, a top speed of over 30 knots and a crew of 250 sailors, will be commissioned at a ceremony presided over by western naval command chief Vice Admiral Sanjay J Singh in Kaliningrad.India in Oct 2018 had inked an umbrella agreement with Russia for four upgraded Krivak-III class frigates, with the first two to be imported for around Rs 8,000 crore. The other two, Triput and Tavasya, in turn, are being built at the Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore.The first frigate, INS Tushil, reached her home port of Karwar from Russia in February. These four new warships will add to the six such Russian frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted from 2003-2004 onwards.Designed for blue-water operations across the spectrum of naval warfare in the four dimensions of air, surface, underwater and electromagnetic, these frigates are armed with a wide array of advanced weapon systems. “INS Tamal has significant upgrades over her predecessors, punching well above her weight,” an officer said.Apart from BrahMos missiles, the frigate has Shtil vertical launched surface-to-air missiles, an improved A190-01 100mm gun and a new age electro-optical/infrared Sandal V system. She is also equipped with a 30mm close-in weapon system, heavyweight torpedoes, urgent attack anti-submarine rockets, apart from various surveillance and fire control radars and systems.“Kamov-31 early-warning and Kamov-28 multirole helicopters can also operate from her deck. The combat capability is augmented by a host of network-centric warfare capabilities, including the latest SATCOM, radio, high-speed data link, and advanced electronic warfare suite,” the officer said.","The 125-metre long INS Tamal, with extended endurance, a top speed of over 30 knots and a crew of 250 sailors, will be commissioned at a ceremony presided over by western naval command chief Vice Admiral Sanjay J Singh in Kaliningrad. “INS Tamal has significant upgrades over her predecessors, punching well above her weight,” an officer said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122014589,width-400,resizemode-4/122014589.jpg"

Double trouble: Air India asked to remove 3 crew rostering officials & gets show-cause for violating pilot flying hour norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahmedabad-crash-dgca-orders-air-india-to-remove-3-officials-roles-related-to-crew-scheduling-report/articleshow/121989054.cms,"Air India Crash Probe Focuses On Engine, Flaps And Gear As Boeing 787 Fleet Faces Safety Checks

Poll Should pilots have more stringent regulations regarding flight duty times? Yes, for safety No, current regulations are sufficient

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered the removal of three Air India officials who are incharge of crew rostering following “lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements”. AI has been warned that “any future violation of crew scheduling norms, licensing, or flight time limitations will attract strict enforcement action, including but not limited to penalties, license suspension, or withdrawal of operator permissions as applicable” — basically the regulator has warned going to the extent of shutting down AI if lapses on this crucial front continue.In response to the order, Air India said: ""We acknowledge the regulator’s directive and have implemented the order. In the interim, the company's Chief Operations Officer will provide direct oversight to the Integrated Operations Control Centre (IOCC). Air India is committed to ensuring that there is total adherence to safety protocols and standard practices.""The DGCA has also issued a showcase to the airline for operating two flights — Bangalore-London on May 16 & 17 — by making pilots fly for longer than the 10 hours that was allowed as per flight duty time limitation (FDTL) dispensation given to AI at that point of time.The June 20 order on the three official says: “Repeated and serious violations voluntarily disclosed by Air India concerning flight crew being scheduled and operated despite lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements. These violations were discovered during review (in crew rostering platform transition). The voluntary disclosures, while noted, point to systemic failures in crew scheduling, compliance monitoring, and internal accountability. Of particular concern is the absence of strict disciplinary measures against key officials directly responsible for these operational lapses.”The order says the three identified senior officials “have been involved in serious and repeated lapses including but not limited to: Unauthorised and non-compliant crew pairings; Violation of mandatory licensing and recency norms; Systemic failures in scheduling protocol and oversight.”The regulator has directed AI to “remove (these three) from all roles and responsibilities related to crew scheduling and rostering. Internal disciplinary proceedings must be initiated against these officials without delay, and the outcome of such proceedings shall be reported to this office within 10 days from the date of issue of this letter. The (three) officials shall be reassigned to non-operational roles pending conclusion of corrective reforms in scheduling practices, and shall not hold any position involving direct influence over flight safety and crew compliance until further notice. Any future violation of crew scheduling norms, licensing, or flight time limitations detected in any post-audit or inspection, will attract strict enforcement action, including but not limited to penalties, license suspension, or withdrawal of operator permissions as applicable.”Apart from this order, the DGCA on June 20 also issued a showcase to AI for violating FDTL norms for pilots of two Bangalore-London flights on May 16 and 17. “Accountable manager has failed to ensure adherence,” the notice while seeking a response within seven days.Comments have been sought from AI on both these issues and are awaited.","The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered the removal of three Air India officials who are incharge of crew rostering.

"In UP village, forgotten Indian roots of Ayatollah Khomeini",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-up-village-forgotten-indian-roots-of-ayatollah-khomeini/articleshow/122010671.cms,"KINTOOR (BARABANKI): In Kintoor, a tranquil village of 13,000 nestled along the Ghaghara, 70 kilometres from Lucknow, only five Shia families remain. Among them, the Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, the fiery cleric who ignited Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and became its first Supreme Leader.Born in Kintoor in the early 19th century, Ahmad’s journey from this unassuming village wove a legacy that reshaped West Asia’s history. He left India, escaping colonial rule in 1830, migrating to Najaf, and then finally settling in Khomeyn in 1834. Hence the family name.A portrait of Ruhollah Khomeini still hanging in his drawing room, septuagenarian Syed Nihal Kazmi says, “My great-great-great-grandfather Mufti Mohammad Quli Musavi and Syed Ahmad Musavi were cousins. Ahmad’s story began here in Kintoor, but he became Iran’s forever.” The village, once a vibrant hub of Shia scholarship in the kingdom of Oudh, is concerned with the war in West Asia.BBC journalist and author Baqer Moin, in his book Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah, writes that Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi left Kintoor around 1830, drawn to Najaf, Iraq, for pilgrimage. There, he befriended Yusef Khan Kamarchi, a landowner from Farahan, near Khomeyn, Iran.Persuaded by Yusef, Ahmad settled in Iran in 1839, purchasing a sprawling house and garden in Khomeyn that remained in the family for over a century.Ahmad went to become a Twelver Shia cleric. From his third wife, Sakineh Ahmad, who was his friend Yusef’s sister, Ahmad had three daughters and a son, Syed Mostafa, father of Ruhollah Khomeini. Ahmad died in 1869 and was buried in Karbala.The Musavi family’s roots trace back to Nishapur (or Neyshabur), Iran, over 2,500 kilometres from Kintoor. “In the early 18th century (1700), they migrated to India, settling in Kintoor,” Moin notes. The family, Musavi Syeds, claimed descent from the Prophet through his daughter and the seventh Shia Imam, Musa al-Kazim, a lineage rooted in Nishapur.Syed Adil Kazmi, Nihal’s youngest son and an LLB graduate, says, “Our ancestors’ journey from Nishapur to Kintoor, and Ahmad’s return to Iran, tied two worlds together.”Today, Iran’s defiance under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei echoes Khomeini’s unyielding spirit. “Long before Khamenei or the 1979 revolution led by Khomeini, it was Ahmad, born in our Kintoor, whose choice to settle in Iran changed West Asia’s discourse,” Adil says.From Ahmad’s departure to Khomeini’s revolution, Kintoor’s quiet lanes hold stories of faith, migration, and a family that bridged continents, leaving an indelible mark on history.Kintoor’s legacy also includes Justice Syed Karamat Husain, a Musavi Syed who rose to the position of a judge at the Allahabad high court and founded the Karamat Husain Muslim Girls’ PG College in Lucknow, championing education for women.","The Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini.

NEW DELHI: Wildlife scientists while enumerating snow leopards in India during the last population assessment used a smart trick to make the elusive big cats in the high and rugged Himalayas pose in front of cameras and get their foreheads having distinctive patterns, akin to human fingerprints, photographed.They used a scent, which only had a localised effect, in luring and making a snow leopard bend down and expose its forehead to the appropriately positioned camera trap, according to a recent study that explained the methodology adopted to count the big cats, nicknamed “ghost of the mountains”.It was done by spraying a small amount of perfume just below the cameras that were deployed near their favoured scent marking rocks on high-ridge tops, said the authors of the study published last month in the open-access journal PLOS One. They added that once the curious leopards lower their heads to smell, the enumerators got their prized-unique picturesThough the snow leopard population assessment in India was done during 2019-23 and the counting figure, total 718 in India, was released last year, the scent lure method was revealed in the study by Pankaj Raina from the Ladakh wildlife protection department and co-authors, including senior wildlife scientist at the Indian national science academy, Yadvendradev V Jhala, and others from the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India.""We identified individual snow leopards through their unique forehead pattern,"" said the authors while underlining that every camera trap photograph was geotagged and stamped with the time and date information in the metadata.""The photo-captured species were identified using an AI-based software programme, CaTRAT, customised to identify Himalayan species. The identified species were subsequently validated by biologists,"" they said.The counting figures, released in 2024, show the highest number, 477, of snow leopards in Ladakh out of total population of 718 in India. Among the remaining ones, 124 snow leopards are in Uttarakhand, 51 in Himachal Pradesh, 36 in Arunachal Pradesh, 21 in Sikkim and 9 in Jammu & Kashmir.Covering approximately 1.2 lakh sq km, the counting exercise was conducted using a meticulous two-step framework. The first step involved evaluating snow leopard spatial distribution while the second step involved estimation using camera traps in each identified stratified region. During the exercise, camera traps were deployed at 1,971 locations, including 956 in Ladakh.","Scientists used a scent, which only had a localised effect, in luring and making a snow leopard bend down and expose its forehead to the appropriately positioned camera trap.

The children were rescued by a collective of voluntary organisations in collaboration with authorities.The highest number of rescue operations (23,530) were related to child labour, followed by cases of sexual exploitation (2,766), and begging (1,092). Telangana reported the highest number of child labour rescues (11,063), followed by Bihar (3,974), Rajasthan (3,847), Uttar Pradesh (3,804), and Delhi (2,588). As many as 2,971 children were rescued from sexual exploitation, with West Bengal standing out at the top with 1,005 rescues followed by Bihar (454), Odisha (232), Maharashtra (194) and Rajasthan (191).The report, prepared by voluntary organisation India Child Protection, has drawn from data gathered by Just Rights for Children, a civil society network of over 250 organisations in across 26 states and UTs working in coordination with law enforcement agencies to combat child labour and trafficking as an organised economic crime.Focusing on how prosecution acts as a tipping point to end child labour, the report highlighted that legal action taken in 27,320 operations, showed that in majority of cases that is 35% (9,595) FIRs were registered - seen as a the most critical step in ensuring that those who are exploiting are prosecuted. In another 25% (6,959) cases were filed as General Diary entries, which are initial police records.In addition, around 23% of legal actions involved orders from child welfare committees (CWCs) or were filed under Form 17 of Juvenile Justice Rules, both of which focus on immediate care, protection and rehabilitation of rescued children. In 14% cases, challans were issued by labour departments, mainly in cases of child labour, serving as administrative penalties. The report said a very small proportion (less than 1%) were orders from district magistrates or sub-divisional magistrates, and only about 2% of cases had no clear legal action recorded.Just Rights for Children national convener Ravi Kant said despite gaps, prosecution action, crucial in creating strong deterrent against trafficking and child labour, is getting stronger in India.The report also highlighted that 5,809 employers and traffickers were arrested as part of these rescue operations and 85% of these were in child labour-related cases. Telangana, Bihar and Rajasthan reported the highest arrests, while states like UP and MP had fewer arrests despite high rescue numbers - highlighting enforcement gaps. The report also draws attention to missing children data, citing that is not uncommon for children classified as missing to be subsequently rescued from exploitative labour situations.Nearly 11,409 missing children were identified by the civil society network in 11,068 FIRs over 2024-25. Of them, 8,749 children were reported to be traced by March-end this year. States such as West Bengal (3,509), Maharashtra (1,149), and Bihar (1,306) reported the highest rescues of missing children, pointing to active coordination with child tracking systems.","Nearly 90% of the 44,902 children freed from the clutches of exploitation in over 27,000 operations between April 2024 and March this year were rescued from child labour. The children were rescued by a collective of voluntary organisations in collaboration with authorities. The highest number of rescue operations (23,530) were related to child labour, followed by cases of sexual exploitation (2,766), and begging (1,092)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122014385,imgsize-944772,width-400,resizemode-4/122014385.jpg"

But since we have to keep in mind the interests of all stakeholders, especially users, we are sticking to the Aug 15 timeline,” a top NHAI official said.NHAI has monetised its projects through three models — Toll Operate Transfer (TOT), infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) and securitisation.The official added that work on the annual pass scheme had started months back and all implications have been worked out, based on past toll collection data.

Legal troubles add fuel to the fire

After years of red-carpet glam, family vacations, and public admiration, the once-adored friendship between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift has reportedly come to a painful end—this time, for good. According to multiple insider sources, the fallout is not only personal but now tangled in legal drama, forcing Lively to surrender private texts to the legal team of actor Justin Baldoni . The emotional toll appears to be heavy on Lively, while Swift remains distant—and firmly supported by her current inner circle, including NFL star Travis Kelce The bond between the ""Gossip Girl"" actress and the global music sensation had been iconic. Taylor Swift, godmother to Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ three children—James, Inez, and Betty—was often seen vacationing and celebrating milestones with the couple. But those memories have now faded into silence.“After months of radio silence, Blake has stopped trying to reach out. She’s heartbroken, but she knows it’s time to let go. Taylor’s not coming back,” a source told Radar Online.Another insider close to Swift confirmed the emotional rupture: “The friendship is done.” The source alleged that Lively “exploited the Godmother of her children and manipulated the public into thinking that she was watching out for her best interests.”The emotional heartbreak coincides with a troubling development in the legal arena. Blake Lively has been ordered by a judge to submit her text exchanges with Swift in connection to Justin Baldoni’s ongoing sexual harassment case.The ruling stems from Lively herself identifying Swift as someone with whom she discussed workplace grievances.Reports also suggest Lively may have allegedly used her connection with Swift as leverage. Rumors swirled that Lively had threatened to release past messages unless Swift publicly supported her during the controversy.Taylor Swift, who was dramatically subpoenaed in the case, has attempted to maintain her distance. Yet, her silence has been interpreted as a deliberate break from the actress she once trusted.Through the storm, Taylor Swift isn’t alone. Travis Kelce, her current partner and Kansas City Chiefs star, has remained low-key but steady in his support. While Kelce hasn’t spoken publicly about the situation, insiders close to the singer say he’s been a “calming force” during the fallout.

Mitch Marner stirs trade rumors as top contenders circle

Fans are buzzing after NHL insider Pierre LeBrun, writing for The Athletic, shared that star forward Mitch Marner may opt for a short deal worth $12–13 million per year instead of a long contract. With free agency looming, this decision could shape his next move around a rising salary cap.On June 22, 2025, Pierre LeBrun dropped a bombshell: Mitch Marner, 28, could choose a two‑year deal paying $12–13 million per season. His goal? Re‑enter the free agent market when the NHL salary cap jumps to an expected $113–114 million by 2027–28.LeBrun said he’s heard this from two different NHL teams. A shorter deal gives Marner leverage later, but adds risk—he might get hurt and miss a massive payday. This route would let Marner hit free agency again at age 30, just as the cap boom kicks in .LeBrun also mentioned rookie teams ready to chase Marner. The Vegas Golden Knights, Los Angeles Kings, and Dallas Stars (a $2 billion franchise) are being linked.The Stars match the $12 million-AAV but may struggle with cap space. Still, LeBrun warned: it would be a surprise, but not impossible.

""This happens occasionally when departing from Patna where airlines are forced to unload checked baggage to meet the maximum take-off weight. The airport's shorter runway makes it more likely,"" said an official.As of Saturday evening, Air India had not issued an official statement. Airport authorities, however, indicated that the missing luggage would likely reach Patna by Sunday.Affected passengers remained stuck with little more than their cabin bags and mounting frustration.The episode has once again placed Air India in the spotlight, raising questions about its operational preparedness and passenger communication.","Two Air India Express flights landed at Patna's airport on Saturday morning. Passengers were directed to collect their luggage from conveyor belts 4 and 3. But after prolonged waits, it became clear that no baggage was arriving.

Delhi Uber Crash: Businessman heading to Delhi airport dies as Uber driver 'falls asleep'; company responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/noida-businessman-dies-as-cabbie-falls-asleep-rams-car-into-truck-on-dnd-flyway/articleshow/121997941.cms,"Image Credit: TOI





NOIDA: A city businessman who had booked a cab to go to Delhi airport at dawn died after the driver allegedly fell asleep and crashed into a truck.Rakesh Kumar, CEO of TechnoConcept India Pvt Ltd, had booked an Uber at 4am on June 11 to reach IGI Airport for a flight to Bengaluru. But the car allegedly crashed into a stationary truck on the DND Flyway within minutes of the trip. Kumar died on the spot.The family of the 59-year-old businessman has now accused the ride-hailing company of negligence. They claimed the company neither alerted them about the accident nor flagged a long halt in the trip. They also said the app showed a different destination after the crash.According to his daughter, Shriti Arora, both she and her mother received a crash notification from his iPhone around 4am. ""We initially didn't understand what it meant. My mother tried calling my father several times. There was no response. I checked his location, and it showed he was still on the DND flyover,"" she told TOI.They rushed to the spot and found the car mangled under the rear of a tempo truck near the MCD toll. Passersby informed them that a man was trapped inside. ""We found my father unconscious in the car, with no pulse,"" Arora said.He was later declared dead at AIIMS Trauma Centre. The driver, Sudhir, who survived the crash, claimed a tyre burst led to the collision. But Arora said passersby told her the driver admitted he had fallen asleep. She has also shared photographs of the vehicle with all tyres intact with the police.One of the family's main grievances is Uber's silence. The company, they said, did not reach out after the accident. The app also displayed a destination change — from IGI Airport to AIIMS Trauma Centre — without explanation. The driver allegedly ended the trip around 11am, several hours after the crash.""The company should have noticed the unusually long halt,"" Arora said. ""Instead, they did nothing until we went public on social media on June 15.""Uber only responded after the family shared details of the incident online, eventually providing information about an insurance coverage.An FIR was filed at Delhi's Mayur Vihar Phase 1 police station under BNS sections 106 (causing death by negligence), a bailable offence, besides 281 (rash driving) and 125 (acts that endanger the life or personal safety of others due to rash or negligent behaviour).

"Hyderabad Fake US Visa: Students with fake degrees clear US, UK visa interviews; caught at Hyderabad airport",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/academic-fraud-students-with-fake-degrees-clear-us-uk-visa-interviews-caught-at-hyderabad-airport/articleshow/122002494.cms,"'Cases indicate role of education consultants'





HYDERABAD: In a worrying trend that highlights the growing sophistication of academic fraud, the Bureau of Immigration (BoI) at Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport has uncovered a racket involving students using forged academic credentials to secure student visas for the United States and the United Kingdom.In the past two weeks alone, four individuals were intercepted at the airport-despite having cleared formal visa interviews at foreign embassies-with fake degrees, some sourced from dubious education consultants.These candidates had successfully obtained student visas and enrolled in foreign universities. However, the deception unravelled during additional checks by BoI personnel before departure.The first breakthrough came on June 1 with the detention of Pakeeru Gopal Reddy, a 28-year-old from Parepalligudem in Nalgonda district. Gopal Reddy had earlier entered the US on a student visa with a forged BSc (computers) degree from Madurai Kamraj University and enrolled at Webster University, Missouri, in Sept 2023. After spending 15 months in the US, he returned to India citing personal reasons.However, in May 2024, during his attempt to re-enter the US, he was deported from Dallas airport due to an inactive Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record.Upon landing at RGIA, BoI officials subjected Gopal to intense questioning and document verification, which revealed his degree was fake.He confessed to obtaining it through Katoju Ashok, an agent operating under Sri Dhanalakshmi Overseas Private Limited in BN Reddy Nagar, Vanasthalipuram. Gopal was arrested on June 1, and Ashok a day later.The arrests made us realise that candidates were securing fake degrees through certain education consultants and managing to obtain visas to the US and the UK. We decided to monitor this trend closely,"" a BoI official said.Following this, BoI officials intensified scrutiny and intercepted three more students en route to the UK.Mohammad Shahabazuddin, 26, of Hyderabad, was caught on June 9 with a fake BCom degree from Acharya Nagarjuna University (2021), a forged Intermediate certificate (2017), and bogus BTech certificates from two engineering colleges in Hyderabad.Shahabazuddin admitted to purchasing a fake SSC certificate from one Yakub in the city for Rs 1.5 lakh and fabricating the rest using software. He secured a UK student visa using these forged documents. A case was filed on June 10, and Shahabazuddin was taken into custody.Mohammed Azhar Hussain, 25, from Seetharampuram in Miryalaguda, was stopped on June 10 while boarding a flight to the UK via Dubai.Azhar confessed to using fake certificates from Capital University, Jharkhand, and a forged job letter arranged by Bharat from Emerge Migration Overseas Educational Consultancy in Miryalaguda. BoI filed a police complaint, and Azhar Hussain was remanded in custody.Srikanth Marthala, 26, from Guntur, was intercepted on June 12 with a fake BTech degree from Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation. He admitted to paying Rs 40,000 to Mohan Krishna, a Guntur-based agent, for the certificate.A case was registered, and Srikanth was also remanded in judicial custody.RGIA police, suspecting a broader pattern, are now expanding the probe to identify and arrest more agents and consultants involved in this fraudulent network. Investigations are ongoing.","Bureau of Immigration at Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport has uncovered a racket involving students using forged academic credentials to secure student visas for the United States and the UK.

"Delhi Weather: Monsoon to hit Delhi in 2 days; Rain, storms expected; Yellow alert issued till Tuesday",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/monsoon-likely-to-arrive-in-delhi-within-two-days-with-rain-forecast-and-air-quality-improving/articleshow/122008836.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The monsoon is likely to reach Delhi within the next two days, with India Meteorological Department forecasting light to moderate rain and improved weather conditions. The department has issued a yellow alert for the national capital and surrounding areas till Tuesday, warning of rain accompanied by thunderstorms and gusty winds of up to 50 kmph.According to IMD, heavy rain is expected over large parts of north and northwest India over the next three days as the southwest monsoon advances further into the region, supported by favourable moisture conditions. The monsoon is likely to arrive in Delhi by June 24. IMD has predicted a normal monsoon for the season.""Southwest monsoon has further advanced over most parts of Himachal Pradesh, the entire Ladakh and Kashmir region, most parts of Jammu, and parts of Punjab,"" said RK Jenamani, senior weather scientist at IMD. ""The Northern Limit of Monsoon currently passes through Jaipur, Agra, Rampur, Dehradun, Shimla, Pathankot and Jammu. Conditions remain favourable for its advancement over the remaining parts of the North Arabian Sea, more areas of Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, western Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh during the next two days.Despite the forecast of rain from Sunday onward, no significant weather activity was recorded in the capital till late evening. However, the city's air quality continued to improve.Sunday marked the fifth consecutive day of satisfactory air quality, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) standing at 92 (on a 0–500 scale) at 4 pm. The improvement was aided by sporadic rain and surface winds, which helped disperse pollutants.Delhi govt, in a statement, said Punjabi Bagh recorded the lowest AQI among all major city locations, logging a reading of just 62. Officials attributed the cleaner air to consistent enforcement action and on-ground pollution control measures.""In the past 24 hours, 211 old or end-of-life vehicles — petrol vehicles older than 15 years and diesel vehicles older than 10 years — were impounded,"" the statement said. ""Additionally, 11,157 pollution challans were issued across the city.""Environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said, ""Our strict action on old vehicles and field-level monitoring is producing measurable results. From citywide improvements to local successes like Punjabi Bagh, Delhi is steadily moving towards a cleaner air reality.""On the weather front, Delhi experienced a partly cloudy sky on Sunday, with a slight drop in daytime temperatures. The Safdarjung base station recorded a maximum temperature of 36.2°C, two degrees below the normal for this time of year, compared to 37.3°C a day earlier. The minimum temperature stood at 28.4°C, marginally higher than Saturday's 27.8°C but still within the seasonal average.Despite the slight dip in temperature, high humidity pushed the discomfort levels up. The heat index, or ‘feels-like' temperature, touched 47.5°C. However, IMD expects the maximum temperature to ease further over the coming days, hovering between 33°C and 35°C on Monday, with a possibility of light showers by evening.",India Meteorological Department issues a yellow alert for the national capital and surrounding areas till Tuesday.

The technology sector's brutal workforce reduction continues into 2025, with industry giants Intel, Microsoft, Panasonic, Google , and Amazon leading a wave of layoffs that has already eliminated more than 62,000 jobs in the first half of the year. From semiconductor manufacturers to social media platforms, major tech companies are restructuring operations amid economic uncertainty and shifting business priorities, leaving tens of thousands of workers searching for new opportunities in an increasingly competitive market.The layoffs span across all sectors of technology, affecting everyone from established hardware manufacturers like Intel planning to cut up to 21,700 positions to fintech companies like Block eliminating nearly 1,000 workers, streaming platforms downsizing staff, and even space companies like Blue Origin cutting over 1,000 employees. With artificial intelligence reshaping business models and companies focusing on operational efficiency, the human cost of technological transformation has become starkly apparent as some of the world's most valuable companies simultaneously invest billions in AI while eliminating traditional roles.Intel announced the most devastating single layoff in the tech industry for 2025, planning to eliminate more than 21,000 employees, representing roughly 20% of its total workforce. The semiconductor giant's cuts come ahead of its Q1 earnings call under newly appointed CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over from longtime chief Pat Gelsinger. Additionally, Intel plans to lay off 15% to 20% of workers in its Intel Foundry division starting in July, affecting the unit that designs, manufactures, and packages semiconductors for external clients. With Intel's total workforce at 108,900 people as of December 2024, these combined reductions represent one of the largest single-company layoffs in tech history.Japanese electronics giant Panasonic announced it would cut 10,000 jobs, affecting approximately 4% of its total workforce as part of a comprehensive restructuring plan. CEO Yuki Kusumi said the cuts are designed to better prepare the century-old company for future decades, with 5,000 job losses expected in Japan and another 5,000 overseas. The company is trimming operations in non-growth areas such as televisions and industrial products to concentrate on emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence. Kusumi addressed the severity of the decision during an earnings call, stating he was ""truly sorry"" but emphasized that drastic cost structure cuts were necessary for the company to pursue growth.Microsoft implemented a multi-phase layoff strategy throughout 2025, first cutting over 6,500 jobs in May, affecting approximately 3% of its global workforce of 228,000 employees. The Seattle-headquartered company followed this with additional layoffs affecting software engineers, product managers, technical program managers, marketers, and legal counsels. The May cuts represent one of Microsoft's biggest layoffs since it eliminated 10,000 employees in 2023, and the company is reportedly contemplating further reductions that could happen through additional phases, with discussions about reducing middle managers and non-coding staff to increase the ratio of programmers to product managers.Meta announced it would cut 5% of its staff, targeting what CEO Mark Zuckerberg described as ""low performers"" as the company prepares for ""an intense year."" With more than 72,000 employees as of its latest quarterly report, the social media giant's cuts affect approximately 3,600 workers. The layoffs began in February and hit teams overseeing Facebook, the Horizon virtual reality platform, and logistics operations hardest. Meta also conducted additional layoffs in April, eliminating over 100 employees in its Reality Labs division, which manages virtual reality and wearable technology development for Meta's Quest headsets.HP announced it would eliminate up to 2,000 jobs as part of its ""Future Now"" restructuring plan designed to save the company $300 million before the end of its fiscal year. The cuts represent a significant portion of the computer and printer manufacturer's workforce as the company seeks to streamline operations and reduce costs. The restructuring comes as HP faces ongoing challenges in the traditional PC and printing markets, with the company pivoting toward more profitable business segments and operational efficiency improvements.Google implemented several rounds of layoffs throughout 2025, cutting hundreds of employees across multiple divisions. The search giant eliminated 200 workers in its global business unit, which handles partnerships and sales, while also laying off hundreds of employees in its platforms and devices division covering Android, Pixel phones, and the Chrome browser. Additional cuts affected the People Operations and cloud organizations teams as part of a broader reorganization effort. Google offered a voluntary exit program to U.S.-based People Operations employees while restructuring to ""drive greater collaboration and expand our ability to quickly and effectively serve customers.""Amazon conducted layoffs across multiple divisions, including approximately 100 employees from its devices and services division, which encompasses the Alexa voice assistant, Echo smart speakers, Ring video doorbells, and Zoox robotaxis businesses. The e-commerce giant also laid off dozens of workers in its communications department to help the company ""move faster, increase ownership, strengthen culture, and bring teams closer to customers."" These cuts are part of Amazon's broader cost-reduction strategy, having reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 employees since the start of 2022.Jeff Bezos's space company Blue Origin laid off about 10% of its workforce, affecting more than 1,000 employees in what represents a significant reduction in the commercial space industry. CEO David Limp said the company's priority was ""to scale manufacturing output and launch cadence with speed, decisiveness and efficiency for customers."" The layoffs particularly targeted roles in engineering, research and development, and management positions. Limp acknowledged that rapid growth in recent years had created ""more bureaucracy and less focus than needed,"" necessitating organizational changes to align with execution priorities.Cloud-based customer management software company Salesforce cut more than 1,000 jobs from its nearly 73,000-strong workforce, despite reporting strong financial performance during its third-quarter earnings. The cuts come as the company actively recruits and hires workers to sell new AI products, indicating a strategic shift rather than financial distress. Affected employees are eligible to apply for open internal roles, particularly in sales positions focused on Salesforce's artificial intelligence-powered products.Human resources software company Workday cut 8.5% of its workforce, eliminating around 1,750 employees as part of a strategic focus on artificial intelligence development. CEO Carl Eschenbach said the company would concentrate hiring in AI-related areas while expanding its global presence. The layoffs came with severance packages of at least 12 weeks of pay for affected employees. Eschenbach emphasized that ""the environment we're operating in today demands a new approach, particularly given our size and scale.""Japanese automaker Nissan announced the most severe cuts in the automotive sector, planning to eliminate 20,000 jobs by 2027 while reducing its factory operations from 17 to 10 facilities. The job losses include 9,000 layoffs announced late last year and come as the automaker faces challenges from US tariffs on imported vehicles and collapsing sales in China. Nissan reported a net loss of 671 billion yen ($4.5 billion) for the 2024 financial year and declined to issue an operating profit forecast for 2025 due to tariff uncertainty.Jack Dorsey's fintech company Block laid off nearly 1,000 employees in its second major workforce reduction in just over a year. The company, which operates Square, Afterpay, CashApp, and Tidal, eliminated 931 positions representing around 8% of its workforce. The restructuring involved transitioning nearly 200 managers into non-management roles and closing almost 800 open positions. Dorsey announced the layoffs in an internal email titled ""smaller block,"" emphasizing that the changes were not driven by financial targets or AI replacements but were part of streamlining operations.General Motors' autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise laid off 50% of its workforce as it prepared to shut down operations entirely. The cuts included CEO Marc Whitten and several other top executives, with the remaining portions of the company moving under General Motors' direct control. The dramatic reduction represents one of the most significant failures in the autonomous vehicle sector, eliminating hundreds of jobs as the company ceased its independent operations.Coffee giant Starbucks eliminated 1,100 corporate employees as part of a comprehensive restructuring effort led by CEO Brian Niccol. The layoffs specifically targeted corporate staff and did not affect employees working in Starbucks stores. Niccol stated in a memo that the cuts would help Starbucks ""operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration."" The company implemented the layoffs to improve results after sales declined in the previous year.Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike cut approximately 500 jobs, representing 5% of its global workforce of just over 10,000 employees. CEO George Kurtz said the Austin, Texas-based company's job cuts would position it ""to move faster, operate more efficiently, and continue cybersecurity leadership."" The layoffs came as CrowdStrike works to recover from a major software bug that temporarily disabled millions of Windows PCs worldwide, costing the company between $36 million and $53 million in restructuring expenses.Match Group, owner of Tinder and Hinge, announced it would cut 13% of its approximately 2,500 full-time workers, eliminating around 325 positions. New CEO Spencer Rascoff implemented the cuts while addressing challenges in the dating app market, particularly with younger generations souring on dating platforms. The restructuring aims to remove one out of every five managers and focus on ""product velocity"" to drive growth, with Rascoff acknowledging that apps ""have felt like a numbers game rather than a place to build real connections.""Automattic, the parent company of Tumblr and WordPress, eliminated 16% of its nearly 1,500-person global workforce. CEO Matt Mullenweg said the company had reached an ""important crossroads"" with revenue growth occurring in a highly competitive market where ""technology is evolving at unprecedented levels."" The restructuring aimed to improve ""productivity, profitability, and capacity to invest"" while the company offered severance and job placement resources to affected employees.German luxury automaker Porsche announced plans to cut 3,900 jobs over the coming years as part of efficiency improvements. About 2,000 of the reductions will come from the expiration of fixed-term contractor positions, while the company will make the remaining 1,900 cuts by 2029 through natural attrition and limited hiring. Porsche said the changes would ""make Porsche even more efficient in the medium and long term"" while discussing additional potential changes with labor leaders.","Major tech companies are restructuring operations amid economic uncertainty and shifting business priorities.

Telegram CEO Pavel Durov recently gave intriguing ‘one-sentence’ personality assessments for his tech rivals including Tesla CEO Elon Musk , Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman . Speaking to a French publication Le Point, Durov offered a sharp assessments for the three tech CEOs.On Elon Musk, Durov said: “Elon can be very emotional, while I try to think deeply before acting.” He acknowledged their contrasting leadership styles, noting that Musk’s impulsiveness can be both a strength and a liability.On Mark Zuckerberg, Durov remarked: “Mark adapts well and quickly follows trends, but he seems to lack fundamental values that he would remain faithful to, regardless of changes in the political climate or tech industry trends.”WhatOn Sam Altman, Durov offered a mix of praise and skepticism: “Sam has excellent social skills, which allowed him to forge alliances around ChatGPT—but some wonder if his technical expertise is still sufficient, now that his co-founder Ilya [Sutskever] and many other scientists have left OpenAI.”The remarks come amid rising tensions and shifting alliances in the AI and messaging space. Telegram recently struck a major deal with Musk’s xAI to distribute the Grok chatbot, while Durov has long criticized Meta’s WhatsApp as a “watered-down imitation” of Telegram.","Telegram CEO Pavel Durov recently gave intriguing ‘one-sentence’ personality assessments for his tech rivals.

Against all odds: Students from Karnataka residential schools secure top ranks in SSLC exams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/against-all-odds-students-from-karnataka-residential-schools-secure-top-ranks-in-sslc-exams/articleshow/122015149.cms,"Many have qualified for JEE





MYSURU: In a remarkable testament to resilience and opportunity, the 2025 SSLC results from Karnataka Residential Educational Institutions Society (KREIS) residential schools underscore the transformative power of education for underprivileged students.Children from marginalised backgrounds-offspring of watchmen, midday meal cooks, and daily wage labourers-have not only excelled, but claimed top ranks across the state. The SSLC exam results were released earlier in May.Pruthvisha Govinda Gollarahalli, a student at Morarji Desai Residential School (MDRS) in Makanur, Haveri, clinched the state's first rank, scoring a perfect 625/625. His father, Govinda, a bike showroom watchman, and mother, Mamata, a midday meal cook, beamed with pride. ""We anticipated strong results, but the top rank was beyond our dreams,"" Govinda said.Pruthvisha, who studied 12 hours daily, aspires to become an IAS officer. ""My teachers and school made this possible,"" he said, crediting them for their unwavering support.Savitri Roni, a MDRS student from Halabhavi, Belagavi, scored 624/625. Her father, Lakshmana, an attendant at a private physiotherapy college, and her homemaker mother, Kamalavva, supported her despite financial hardship.""My parents' encouragement, coupled with digital skills training, sports, and 5-6 hours of daily reading, kept me focused,"" Savitri said, thanking her principal and teachers.Bhoomika Suresh Okkaliga, from Kittur Rani Channamma Residential Sainik School in Uttara Kannada, also scored 624/625. Raised by daily wage labourers, she plans to pursue science in higher studies. ""We supported the education of all our children as it is key for empowerment ,"" said her father, Suresha, despite their economic struggles.This year, 34,984 students from 788 KREIS schools appeared for the SSLC exams, achieving 91% pass rate. Notably, 34% earned distinctions, 56% secured first-class results, and 247 students shared the top 10 state ranks. Over 19% scored between 90% and 100%, a feat KREIS attributes to meticulous academic strategies.According to KREIS officials, success stems from rigorous planning, including timely syllabus completion, periodic assessments, and tailored remedial measures for slower learners. Micro-plans at the school level analyse student performance by subject and chapter, while macro-plans involve expert-led online orientations and teacher workshops.A dedicated Master Resource Persons team curates study materials and past papers, ensuring comprehensive preparation. Mobile-free campuses, co-curricular activities, and an Academic Excellence Committee further bolster holistic development, they explained.In the PUC level, 132 students qualified in the JEE Mains exam 2025, while 3 students qualified in the JEE Advanced exam 2025. 517 students qualified in NEET UG, out of which 329 students are expected to get seats in various medical and other colleges.A total of 4,213 students secured ranking in the K-CET exam 2025. As per the cut-off rank for various categories for engineering admissions under govt quota, 2,688 students are expected to get admission in good engineering colleges.","Children from marginalised backgrounds have not only excelled, but claimed top ranks. 34,984 students from 788 KREIS schools appeared for the SSLC exams, achieving 91% pass rate. 34% earned distinctions, 56% secured first-class results, and 247 students shared top 10 state ranks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122015632,imgsize-1720814,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/122015632.jpg"
"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Brent Crude prices spiked as much as 5% on Monday following the US airstrikes on Iran’s key nuclear facilities on Sunday. The move ended days of speculation over whether the US President Donald Trump would join Israel in its confrontation with Iran.While prices surged initially, they soon pared gains. The attacks on Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan had led to expectations of a sustained oil rally. Iran is the third-largest producer in the OPEC+ bloc and accounts for around a third of global oil output.Last week, Brent Crude futures rose 11%, touching $80 per barrel before retreating. Prices rebounded again as Trump kept markets guessing on the US’s involvement, but hopes of a ceasefire and ample supply from OPEC+ capped further gains.Analysts noted that demand remains weak, giving little reason for oil to hold elevated levels.OPEC+ is scheduled to meet on July 5 to discuss another output hike for August, after already increasing supplies by 4.11 million barrels per day in June and July.Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at MST Marquee, said, “Much depends on how Iran responds in the coming hours and days, but this could set us on a path toward $100 oil, if Iran responds as they have previously threatened to,”Iran claims it reserves the right to respond to the US attacks.Local media reports its parliament has approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, though the final call rests with its National Security Council. The US has urged China to discourage Iran from taking that step.T he Strait of Hormuz is a critical oil chokepoint, more than 20 million barrels per day, or 20% of the world’s oil supply, passed through it last year, according to the US Energy Information Administration.Goldman Sachs has warned that a closure of the strait could push oil prices above $100 per barrel. However, JPMorgan views the possibility as low, saying such a move could be seen by the US as an ""act of war.""Rising crude prices could hurt India’s economy, particularly oil marketing companies like HPCL, BPCL, and Indian Oil, along with industries like aviation, paints, and tyres that rely heavily on oil.Goldman Sachs’ Santanu Sengupta told CNBC-TV18 that a rise in crude to $75 per barrel would hurt India’s macroeconomic stability. A $10-per-barrel increase could raise the cost burden by 30–40 basis points.Samiran Chakraborty, chief India economist at Citi, also noted that supply chain disruptions could raise inflation risks, but said India may still be able to manage slightly higher prices due to its limited exposure to Iranian oil.US officials said no further strikes are planned for now, but warned that any retaliation from Iran would invite an even more forceful response.“This is the big one,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital, pointing to a possible $8-a-barrel risk premium. “The market default on this development is higher. How high depends on Iran’s response, or the realistic prospects of a meaningful response, which may not be there.”","Brent Crude prices spiked as much as 5% on Monday following the US airstrikes on Iran’s key nuclear facilities on Sunday.

Crash dummies used in car safety tests are still modelled after men despite higher risks for women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/crash-dummies-used-in-car-safety-tests-are-still-modelled-after-men-despite-higher-risks-for-women/articleshow/122015309.cms,"Crash dummies used in car safety tests are still modelled after men despite higher risks for women (Image: AP)





Maria Weston Kuhn had one lingering question about the car crash that forced her to have emergency surgery during a vacation in Ireland: Why did she and her mother sustain serious injuries while her father and brother, who sat in the front, emerge unscathed?""It was a head-on crash and they were closest to the point of contact,"" said Kuhn, now 25, who missed a semester of college to recover from the 2019 collision that caused her seat belt to slide off her hips and rupture her intestines by pinning them against her spine. ""That was an early clue that something else was going on.""When Kuhn returned home to Maine, she found an article her grandma had clipped from Consumer Reports and left on her bed. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a frontal crash, she learned, yet the dummy used in vehicle tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dates back to the 1970s and is still modeled almost entirely off the body of a man.A survivor becomes an activist Kuhn, who is starting law school at New York University this fall, took action and founded the nonprofit Drive US Forward. Its aim was to raise public awareness and eventually encourage members of Congress to sign onto a bill that would require NHTSA to incorporate a more advanced female dummy into its testing.The agency has the final word on whether cars get pulled from the market, and the kind of dummy used in its safety tests could impact which ones receive coveted five-star ratings.""It seems like we have an easy solution here where we can have crash test dummies that reflect an average woman as well as a man,"" Sen Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican who has introduced the legislation the past two sessions, told The Associated Press.Senators from both parties have signed onto Fischer's ""She Drives Act,"" and the transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for updating the rules.But for various reasons, the push for new safety requirements has been moving at a sluggish pace. That's particularly true in the US, where much of the research is happening and where around 40,000 people are killed each year in car crashes.Evolution of a crash test dummy The crash test dummy currently used in NHTSA five-star testing is called the Hybrid III, which was developed in 1978 and modelled after a 5-foot-9, 171-pound man (the average size in the 1970s but about 29 pounds lighter than today's average). What's known as the female dummy is essentially a much smaller version of the male model with a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger seat or the back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.""What they didn't do is design a crash test dummy that has all the sensors in the areas where a woman would be injured differently than a man,"" said Christopher O'Connor, president and CEO of the Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Humanetics Group, which has spent more than a decade developing and refining one.A female dummy from Humanetics equipped with all of the available sensors costs around $1 million, about twice the cost of the Hybrid used now.But, O'Connor says, the more expensive dummy far more accurately reflects the anatomical differences between the sexes - including in the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs, which one NHTSA study found account for about 80% more injuries by women in a car crash compared to men.Such physical dummies will always be needed for vehicle safety tests, and to verify the accuracy of virtual tests, O'Connor said.Europe incorporated the more advanced male dummy developed by Humanetics' engineers, the THOR 50M (based on a 50th percentile man), into its testing procedures soon after Kuhn's 2019 crash in Ireland. Several other countries, including China and Japan, have adopted it as well.But that model and the female version the company uses for comparison, the THOR 5F (based on a 5th percentile woman), have been met with scepticism from some American automakers who argue the more sophisticated devices may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.A debate over whether more sensors mean more safety Bridget Walchesky, 19, had to be flown to a hospital, where she required eight surgeries over a month, after a 2022 crash near her home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, that killed her friend, who was driving. While acknowledging the seat belt likely saved her life, Walchesky said some of the injuries - including her broken collarbone - were the result of it pinning her too tightly, which she views as something better safety testing focused on women could improve.""Seat belts aren't really built for bodies on females,"" Walchesky said. ""Some of my injuries, the way the force hit me, they were probably worsened.""The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group, said in a statement to the that the better way to ensure safety - which it called its top priority - is through upgrades to the existing Hybrid dummy rather than mandating a new one.""This can happen on a faster timeline and lead to quicker safety improvements than requiring NHTSA to adopt unproven crash test dummy technology,"" the alliance said.Humanetics' THOR dummies received high marks in the vehicle safety agency's early tests. Using cadavers from actual crashes to compare the results, NHTSA found they outperformed the existing Hybrid in predicting almost all injuries - including to the head, neck, shoulders, abdomen and legs.A separate review by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, was far more critical of the dummy's ability to predict chest injuries in a frontal crash. Despite the vast expansion in the number of sensors, the insurance institute's testing found, the male Thor dummy was less accurate than the current Hybrid dummies, which also had limitations.""More isn't necessarily better,"" said Jessica Jermakian, senior vice president for vehicle research at IIHS. ""You also have to be confident that the data is telling you the right things about how a real person would fare in that crash.""The slow pace of changing the rules NHTSA's budget plan commits to developing the female Thor 5F version with the ultimate goal of incorporating it into the testing. But there could be a long wait considering the THOR's male version adopted by other countries is still awaiting final approval in the US.A 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, which conducts research for Congress, cited numerous ""missed milestones"" in NHTSA's development of various crash dummy enhancements - including in the Thor models.Kuhn acknowledges being frustrated by the slow process of trying to change the regulations. She says she understands why there's reluctance from auto companies if they fear being forced to make widespread design changes with more consideration for women's safety.""Fortunately, they have very skilled engineers and they'll figure it out,"" she said.","Crash dummies used in car safety tests are still modelled after men despite higher risks for women. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a frontal crash, yet the dummy used in vehicle tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dates back to the 1970s. The agency has the final word on whether cars get pulled from the market.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122015540,imgsize-989284,width-400,resizemode-4/122015540.jpg"
