Chandigarh gets distinction

NEW DELHI: The performance gap in school education between India's top and bottom-ranking states and Union territories has narrowed from 51% in 2017-18 to 42% in the 2023-24 cycle, according to the education ministry's latest performance grading index (PGI) 2.0, suggesting that many states are catching up with the better performers.Yet, the report underscores a significant concern - none of the 36 states and UTs have reached the top four performance grades of Daksh, Utkarsh, Atti-Uttam, and Uttam. Chandigarh, with a score of 703 out of 1,000, is the only entity to enter the Prachesta-1 band (701-760), with most of the states/UTs still in lower bands.Among states, Punjab led with 631.2 points, followed by Delhi (623.7), Gujarat (614.4), and Odisha (595.6). At the bottom end were Meghalaya (417.9), Arunachal Pradesh (461.4), Mizoram (464.3), Nagaland (468.6), and Bihar (472.0), all placed in Akanshi-2 or Akanshi-3, the lowest performance tiers.PGI 2.0 evaluates school education systems across 73 indicators in six domains - learning outcomes, access, infrastructure and facilities, equity, governance processes, and teacher education & training - assigning each state and UT a score out of 1,000.Grades range from Daksh (top) to Akanshi-3 (bottom), based on performance on these indicators, which are derived from sources such as UDISE+, NAS 2021, PRABANDH, PM Poshan and Vidyanjali.As many as 25 states and UTs are currently in the Akanshi category (scores below 580), indicating acontinuing need for systemic improvements. At the same time, this represents a slight improvement from the 28 states/UTs in Akanshi category in 2022-23. Also, the highest grade attained has moved from Prachesta-2 to Prachesta-1.""The narrowing of the inter-state performance gap is a testament to the collective efforts of states and our commitment to cooperative federalism in education,"" said Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan. ""PGI 2.0 reflects the transformational impact of NE, which has empowered states to pursue evidence-based reforms.""The best performers over a two-year period were Himachal Pradesh (up 41 points to 573.8), Telangana (up 22.6 points to 511.9), Chandigarh (up 15.2 to 703), Odisha (up 11.1 to 595.6) and Goa (up 8.4 to 589.7). Delhi recorded the sharpest single-year rise - 44.4 points - driven largely by improvements in school infrastructure and teacher training. However, its 2021-22 score was not published, making it ineligible for the two-year comparative analysis.In contrast, Chhattisgarh posted the steepest decline, falling 38.6 points from 533.2 to 494.6 due to slippage in governance and equity indicators. West Bengal dropped by 14 points and Tamil Nadu registered a marginal fall of 4.5 points.A domain-wise breakdown highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of major states. Kerala, for example, stood out by becoming the only state to achieve Daksh in the teacher education & training domain, scoring 91.4 out of 100 - reflecting its consistent investment in teacher quality and professional development. Odisha showed strong equity outcomes, with one of the highest scores in bridging gender, caste, and regional disparities. Gujarat, with an overall score of 614.4, excelled in governance (87.8/130) and teacher training (83.3/100), but lagged in learning outcomes.Bihar, a state which faces longstanding educational challenges, showed some improvement in access and teacher training but continued to struggle with infrastructure, scoring only 55 out of 190 - placing it in Akanshi-1 for that domain. Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, moved up to Akanshi-1 grade with 528.1 points, driven by better equity and teacher indicators, though governance remained a weak domain.Maharashtra (582.0) entered Prachesta-3 band with gains in equity and teacher training but needs to improve in infrastructure and governance. Tamil Nadu (559.2), despite a legacy of educational progress, saw a dip in its overall score and domain-wise fall in governance and teacher metrics.The report concluded that while progress is evident, states still have significant ground to cover. ""The highest grade achieved so far is only Prachesta-1, and all states/UTs still have considerable work to do to reach the 1,000-point benchmark,"" the ministry said. And whether they do so or not will reflect in future PGI 2.0 scores, which remain a critical monitoring and reform tool under NE to help align education systems with Sustainable Development Goal 4.","The performance gap in school education between India's top and bottom-ranking states and Union territories has narrowed. Chandigarh, with a score of 703 out of 1,000, is the only entity to enter the Prachesta-1 band. Punjab led with 631.2 points, followed by Delhi (623.7), Gujarat (614.4), and Odisha (595.6).

Delhi Judge Cash Row: SC Probe Panel Report Says Misconduct Proved, Proposes Justice Varma’s Removal

NEW DELHI: The inquiry committee on the Justice Varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the HC judge in his defence - that the cash could have been planted in the storeroom of his residence and that the storeroom was set afire by an act of arson to implicate him.The committee, constituted on March 22 by then CJI Sanjiv Khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges - Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman.It examined 55 witnesses, including Justice Varma, which were video recorded, to confirm every report of TOI on the sensational controversy. The panel's report also referred to TOI's March 21 story breaking the news.Also read: SC panel proposes impeachment of Justice Yashwant Varma - What probe report said Rejecting Justice Varma's defence - that ""someone could have planted the cash in the storeroom in his absence as it was accessible to everyone"" - the panel in its 64-page report said, ""The overall control and the permission to have access to the storeroom was undeniably with Justice Varma.""This should remove all doubts about the launch of proceedings for removal of the HC judge in the monsoon session of Parliament beginning on July 21.The panel cited the fact that the judge was in control of the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow to reject his defence of conspiracy and arson - essentially that someone with mala fide intention planted the cash at his official bungalow and then set off the fire. Referring to statements of security personnel, the panel noted that no one could access the house without the permission of family members and ""therefore, it's well nigh impossible for currency to be planted in the storeroom of a sitting judge, which is being monitored by static 1+4 guard and a PSO stationed at the gate at all time, apart from the fact that the house abounds with a large number of old and trusted domestic servants with over six staff quarters"".The committee also disregarded the theory of ""arson"" - ""a criminal act of deliberately setting fire to property"" - belatedly flagged by Justice Varma. Members of the panel said that by the judge's own initial version, the fire was triggered by a short circuit, besides noting that he did not follow up by registering a police complaint.Significantly, the panel also underlined that the judge had quietly accepted his transfer to Allahabad HC, in the wake of publication of a report in TOI. ""The categorical acceptance on March 20, immediately, without any demur and, respectfully accepting the decision of repatriation to Allahabad would, in normal circumstances, only be done after discussion with family members at least and after an attempt to find out the reason for transfer, having served in Delhi HC for the last three years,"" the report said.""It is his categorical case that he has served diligently for a decade without any complaint. Thus, he would have liked to find out the reason for the transfer,"" it added.In conclusion, the inquiry panel said, ""In the absence of any plausible explanation coming from Justice Varma or his family members or, for that matter, any other witness, this committee is left with no option but to hold that the trust reposed in him was belied by him by allowing highly suspicious material in the shape of piles of currency notes to be stashed in the storeroom. Whether this stashing was done with tacit or explicit consent of Justice Varma or his family members is of little significance in the face of the larger concept of breach of public trust and probity expected of the high constitutional office held by Justice Varma. ""The committee repeatedly termed the post-cash discovery conduct of Justice Varma as ""unnatural"" and ""illogical"" and said, ""Keeping in view the direct and electronic evidence on record, this committee is firmly of the view that there is sufficient substance in the allegations raised in the letter of CJI (Sanjiv Khanna) dated March 22 and the misconduct found proved is serious enough to call for initiation of proceedings for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma. ""The committee also found it odd that the judge, who cut short his vacation in the Satpura forests after having been informed of the fire, did not deem it fit to visit the site until March 15 when the principal private secretary to the Delhi HC chief justice came for an inspection.The committee also stated that Justice Varma's daughter tried to dissuade firemen from entering the bungalow by telling them that the flames had already been controlled.The report said Justice Varma's private secretary, Delhi HC employee Rajinder Singh Karki, frantically tried to reach the judge on phone from the residence. ""He had a detailed conversation with Justice Varma at 1.23am on March 15"" when the judge asked him to stay back at the residence, the report said.It was Karki who instructed firemen not to mention burnt cash in their report, the panel said. It also found from the security guard's statement that Karki and a trusted servant, Mohd Rahil ""were busy supervising the cleaning up job after the fire wagons had left"".During questioning by the committee, Karki entangled himself in contradictory statements, the report said.The committee was also surprised to find that CCTV footage had been wiped out from the hard disc between March 15 and March 25, when the inquiry started.","The inquiry committee on the Justice Varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the HC judge in his defence.

'Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India Will Be Tough' Says Former CBI Director

LONDON: Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court for orchestrating what he refers to as his “kidnapping” from Antigua in 2021 in an alleged honeytrap plot.Choksi has claimed in the preliminary hearing that five people working for R&AW kidnapped him in Antigua and smuggled him on a yacht to Dominica in a plot masterminded by the Indian state in order to extradite him to India to face charges in the Rs 13,500 Punjab National Bank scam.Antigua police named Gurdip Bath, Barbara Jarabik, Gurmit Singh, Gurjit Singh Bhandal and Leslie Farrow-Guy as the five suspects, mostly UK-based, in the kidnapping. They are all being sued by Choksi alongside the Indian govt. They all deny the charges.The court documents were served on the ministry of external affairs by the British high commission in New Delhi.Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Choksi (66), told Justice Freedman on Monday that Choksi was filing a civil suit against the Indian govt for allegedly ordering Choksi to be kidnapped on May 21, 2021 and smuggled by yacht to Dominica.India denies any involvement, argues it is protected by state immunity and that the UK courts do not have jurisdiction for this case.Harish Salve KC, representing India’s govt, said: “There is no evidence of India having anything to do with the alleged events. The claimant’s account is rife with non sequiturs and unsupported assumptions. Those accused seem a rather unlikely band of state-sponsored conspirators.”Choksi is currently in jail in Belgium where he is fighting extradition proceedings brought by India.Choksi first met Barbara Jarabik, a Hungarian luxury goods expert, in Antigua in Aug 2020. In May 2021 she is alleged to have asked him to visit the apartment she had rented in Jolly Harbour.A group of men of Indian origin burst into the apartment and told Choksi he was “being detained to be interrogated by Indian agencies”, Fitzgerald told the court, London’s Times newspaper reported.Choksi alleges that the men told him they worked for R&AW and beat him up, left him unconscious, and tied him to a wheelchair on the yacht to Dominica to extort a false confession from him and implicate the Congress party.“The evidence points inevitably to India being behind this — they had the motivation, they had the resources,” Fitzgerald told the court, the Daily Telegraph reported.Choksi denies the charges against him. Thenext hearing is expected in September.",Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court.

Indian student's deportation sparks outrage

Over 1,000 Indians deported in recent months

NEW DELHI: The US Embassy in India has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a US visa is a privilege, not a right”, and that violating US laws, even after arrival, can lead to visa revocation and ineligibility for future travel.The statement, posted on the embassy’s official X handle on Thursday, emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.“Using illegal drugs or breaking any US laws while on a student/visitor visa can make you ineligible for future US visas. A US visa is a privilege, not a right… and we may revoke your visa if you break the law,” the embassy said.This is the third such advisory from the US Embassy in India in June alone, each one stressing Washington’s firm stance against visa misuse and illegal immigration.On June 10, the embassy stated that while the United States welcomes legitimate travellers, it ""cannot and will not tolerate"" illegal entry or violation of laws. A follow-up on June 16 went a step further, noting that the US has established new visa restrictions on foreign officials and facilitators of mass or illegal immigration.The latest statement comes amid a surge in deportation cases and the circulation of a viral video showing an Indian student in handcuffs at Newark Airport, allegedly being deported. The clip, shared by Indian-American author Kunal Jain, triggered a wave of concern across Indian social media.“I witnessed a young Indian student being deported from Newark Airport last night, handcuffed, crying, treated like a criminal. He came chasing dreams, not causing harm,” Jain posted on X. He said the student appeared to be from Haryana and was heard shouting: “I’m not crazy… they are hell bent to prove that I am crazy.”Jain, who tagged the Indian Embassy and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, alleged that such deportations were becoming alarmingly routine. “Every day 3-4 such cases are happening,” he wrote, describing the student as “disoriented and helpless.”As per India's Ministry of External Affairs, 1,080 Indian nationals have been deported from the US since the Trump administration returned to power earlier this year. The recent crackdown in Los Angeles has also seen mass immigration sweeps, with Trump declaring, “They spit, we hit,” in a controversial order during unrest in the city.","The US Embassy in India has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a US visa is a privilege, not a right” The statement emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.

So now Delhi and San Francisco will have seven weekly flights instead of 10 earlier; Delhi and Toronto will go down from 13 weekly to 7 weekly; Delhi & Chicago will drop from seven to three; Delhi & Washington (Dulles) from five to three and Delhi & Vancouver from seven to five. Between India and North America, AI is the largest operator of direct flights. United and American have only a daily between Delhi & New York.Europe routes will also see frequency cuts. Delhi & London Heathrow (LHR) will go down from 24 to 22 weekly; Delhi & Paris from 14 to 12 and Bangalore & LHR from seven to six (see box). Australia, Tokyo and Seoul will also see temporary cuts.Apart from aircraft shortage due to multiple factors, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s temporary one-month dispensation to AI for making its pilots fly longer due to Pakistan airspace closures that required longer detours ended on June 12.So AI’s pilot requirement for the longer west flights will also increase. “These reductions will be effective from June 21 and last until at least July 15, 2025…. arise from the decision to voluntary undertake enhanced pre-flight safety checks, as well as accommodate additional flight durations arising from airspace closures in the Middle East. The objective is to restore schedule stability and minimising last-minute inconvenience to passengers,” AI said in a statement, adding, “AI apologises to passengers affected by these curtailments, and is proactively offer(ing) re-accommodation on alternative flights, complimentary rescheduling or full refunds as per their preference.”• Delhi-Nairobi1 (AI961/962) – 4x weekly flights• Amritsar-London (Gatwick) (AI169/170) – 3x weekly flights• Goa (Mopa)-London (Gatwick) (AI145/146) – 3x weekly flights• Delhi-Toronto: Reduced from 13x weekly to 7x weekly• Delhi-Vancouver: Reduced from 7x weekly to 5x weekly• Delhi-San Francisco: Reduced from 10x weekly to 7x weekly• Delhi-Chicago: Reduced from 7x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-Washington (Dulles): Reduced from 5x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-London (Heathrow): Reduced from 24x weekly to 22x weekly• Bengaluru-London (Heathrow): Reduced from 7x weekly to 6x weekly• Amritsar-Birmingham and Delhi Birmingham: Reduced from 3x weekly to 2x weekly• Delhi-Paris: Reduced from 14x weekly to 12x weekly• Delhi-Milan: Reduced from 7x weekly to 4x weekly• Delhi-Copenhagen: Reduced from 5x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-Vienna: Reduced from 4x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-Amsterdam: Reduced from 7x weekly to 5x weekly• Delhi-Melbourne and Delhi-Sydney: Reduced from 7x weekly to 5x weekly• Delhi-Tokyo (Haneda): Reduced from 7x weekly to 6x weekly• Delhi-Seoul (Incheon): Reduced from 5x weekly to 4x weekly2(Source: AI)","Air India will suspend flights between Amritsar & London Gatwick, along with those between Goa (Mopa) & LGW and Delhi & Nairobi.

India’s gone from despair to optimism in 11 yrs: Home minister Amit Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-gone-from-despair-to-optimism-in-11-yrs-home-minister-amit-shah/articleshow/121982688.cms,"Union home minister Amit Shah

The Modi govt has completed 11 years in office. What would you count as the five biggest achievements?

But some of the issues raised in 2014 — poverty, inflation and unemployment — have not gone away…

It was a deliberate attempt to sabotage peace in Kashmir, to stop rising tourism and distract Kashmiri youth, who were employed, enjoying prosperity and were distanced from terrorism. The youth in Kashmir realises the evil plan. There were protests in every town in the Valley after the attack on tourists. The Valley had not shown such solidarity with the country before Amit Shah

Congress

says your performance on the economic front is underwhelming.

What about ‘Make in India’ as imports still remain high?

Disaffection with UPA’s performance on the internal security front helped BJP in 2014. How do you view the situation now?

The success against Naxals wouldn’t have happened overnight…

But the Pahalgam attack was a major setback. Congress has blamed the govt for it.

The situation in Manipur is not of terrorism, nor is it an anti-national issue. It is related to ethnic tension. Today, there is no atmosphere of violence, but the rift between the two communities (Meiteis and Kukis) has not been healed. We are seeking to bring about reconciliation; we invited them separately and then asked them together, and now we are discussing this at the political level. We are hopeful of success soon Amit Shah

Was the Pahalgam attack an act of desperation by Pakistan?

There has been a radical shift in approach towards terrorism as the govt has said that any terrorist attack from now on will be considered an act of war.

Do you see the possibility of fresh attempts by Pakistan to disrupt normalcy?

Are more steps required to reassure tourists?

What is the roadmap for granting statehood to J&K? What are the factors that will be borne in mind?

Congress is making an issue of the decision to pause Operation Sindoor.

No one will have any reason to complain when the delimitation exercise is conducted. We will establish a very good balance and no one will be dissatisfied. DMK is raising the issue only because of the 2026 assembly elections. Delimitation is not going to happen by then, and they know this. The 2029 elections will be held with women’s reservation Amit Shah

The opposition has been raising the issue of losses we suffered during Operation Sindoor...

Indus Waters Treaty has been kept in abeyance, not fully annulled. Will it be restored in future?

So you mean status quo ante will not be restored?

What is your assessment of the situation in

Manipur

?

When is an elected govt likely to be restored?

It has been alleged that in its third term, the Modi govt has been making key decisions under pressure, such as the one on caste census.

The opposition has said that the govt notification does not mention caste census.

But the PM had earlier opposed it and you had said this was an attempt to divide Hindus.

By when should we expect the Census numbers?

Is delimitation a possibility before the 2029 elections?

The southern states have concerns around delimitation. How do you propose to balance that with the demand of northern states that their representation in Parliament should be proportionate to their numbers?

BNS has been enacted, how far have you progressed with implementing it?

An infiltrator has to leave India. Our country is not a dharamshala. If you need to visit India, you must obtain a valid visa from our embassy. Whatever the perception or political colour, the country’s security is paramount Amit Shah

There were attempts to integrate various aspects through e-courts and e-prisons.

Infiltration has been a major issue and steps have been taken in recent months. The govt has been accused of communal bias in dealing with it.

Communal violence appears to have decreased…

But Bengal seems to be an outlier?

In Delhi, are you happy with the work done by the govt in the first 100 days?

Drugs have emerged as a major concern. How are you tackling the issue?

What about the new BJP president?

Will you be able to repeat the electoral successes of Maharashtra and Haryana in Bihar, West Bengal and Kerala, especially with anti-incumbency factor against Nitish Kumar?

There is a debate around language in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

Southern states have raised the issue of lower fund transfer and the formula being skewed against them. How do you view it?

Are you hopeful of a favourable verdict from the Supreme Court on the waqf law?

There is an effort to remove Justice Yashwant Varma. Is the govt seeking to use the opportunity for a National Judicial Appointments Commission-type body? Will we see some action during the monsoon session?

Will the same keenness be shown in the case of Justice Shekhar Yadav?

Let’s not get caught in numbers... certain things cannot be quantified. There was widespread pessimism in 2014, and people voted for Modi ji as PM, seeking an end to corruption, weak internal and external security, a severe image deficit abroad, social disharmony, and the poor state of the economy, which had landed us in the unenviable ‘Fragile Five’ club. The youth were particularly apprehensive. Now, in 2025, people are confident that India will become a developed country by 2047. The transformed mindset is a result of hard work over 11 years, marked by farsightedness and microplanning. I consider the renewal of hope and confidence about the country’s future a significant achievement. We are marching ahead with a sense of encouragement derived from the changed national psyche.Let us be real. There are some issues which cannot be eliminated altogether. But can anyone say that the level of poverty and the number of poor are the same, or that their status has not changed? Over 26 crore people have been moved out of the BPL category, and more than 80 crore have benefited from welfare schemes, including housing, water, electricity, toilets and free LPG connections. Free health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh, 5 kg of free ration and free LPG connections are available.These things had not been provided for in 70 years; in these 11 years, we have come a long way.Can India’s rise to becoming the fourth largest economy from the 10th, surpassing six front-running nations in just 11 years, be termed an underwhelming performance? Is doubling of GDP from $2 trillion to $4.2 trillion underperformance? Isn’t the unprecedented rise of capital expenditure from Rs 1.9 lakh crore to Rs 10.5 lakh crore a marker of the nation’s stupendous growth? Since they demitted office, even per capita income has risen from Rs 68,572 to Rs 133,488 and transformed lives for good. And all these are besides the remarkable 143% jump in FDI, which is reflective of international confidence in India’s economic policies. I can go on. Average inflation rate has been brought down from 10.1% to 4.6% and forex reserves have more than doubled to $654 billion. On the infrastructure front, the pace of highway construction has accelerated, Metro rail network has expanded four-fold to 1,000 km. In the banking sector, the turnaround is equally impressive. When we took office, non-performing assets were in double digits. Today, it is just 2.3%. As part of a historic push for financial inclusion, over 55 crore bank accounts have been opened in the last 11 years. Through Direct Benefit Transfer, Rs 44 lakh crore has been disbursed. Today, India accounts for nearly 50% of global digital transactions. Clearly, development under the Modi govt is not just a claim — it is a lived reality of 140 crore citizens.Considerable progress has been made towards Aatmanirbharta. We manufactured defence products worth Rs 1.3 lakh crore and exported Rs 21,000 crore worth of defence products. The target is to increase it to Rs 50,000 crore by 2029. We are now the second-largest exporter of mobile phones — from 26% mobiles being domestically produced, the share is now over 99%. Modi ji’s push to the toy sector has not only ensured that our next generation grows up playing with indigenously manufactured toys but has also reversed the export-import ratio of toys. In 2014, only 20% of toys were manufactured indigenously, 40% of manufacturing units had shut down, and 20% of them were on the verge of shutting down.The biggest challenge was govt’s approach. Earlier, the focus was on containing the problem; our approach has been to eliminate it. Earlier, the concern was to manage a threat somehow while you were in office. It was not helpful. Take, for example, the issue of Naxalism. They had a plan to develop a red corridor from Tirupati (Andhra Pradesh) to Pashupatinath (Nepal), and the threat appeared realistic to many. In 11 years, the challenge has shrunk from 123 districts to just six. I am confident that by March 31, 2026, the entire country will be free of the Naxal menace. Similarly, in the North-east, violence has come down almost 70%, not only by using force. We have negotiated over 20 peace agreements with insurgent groups, and over 10,000 people have surrendered. By the time the report for the year is released, the level of violence is likely to decrease by 90%.By 2020, we began to choke off their supplies, whether it was money, arms or food. We set up over 500 camps, approximately every 8 km, to fill the security vacuum. Forces could now go out in the morning and return by evening after completing an operation. This helped reduce casualties significantly. Besides, we used the camps to distribute grains and medicine to the local population, which eroded the Naxals’ support base. We also enhanced communication systems, utilising the latest technology, including drones that capture the chatter. Most states extended support, regardless of which party was in office. The Congress govt of Chhattisgarh was an exception. It refused to act, and so, the Naxals converged there. Initially, I found it to be a challenge. But it turned into an opportunity. First, a BJP govt was formed there. Second, it became possible to strike the Naxals since they were all located in one place.It needs to be analysed differently. There was a time when 70% of terrorists killed in the Valley would be Indians from Kashmir, while 30% were from Pakistan . Now, that ratio stands at 5:95, which means that if you leave out the Pakistan element, then the homegrown component has almost come to an end. We decided to look at the root of local recruitment. It was fuelled by discontent over rigged polls and corruption that resulted in lack of development. Article 370 was another important factor, as it gave people a sense that they could break away. Nullification of the provision ended that subterranean feeling, with people realising that India is their sole destiny. Free and fair polls at all levels — from local bodies to Parliament — were conducted. Even opponents have not questioned their fairness and so the perception that elections are a sham and managed by Delhi gave way to a sense that the future of a village gets decided only by its residents. Efforts were made to promote Kashmir’s local products. As a result, the enlistment in terrorism decreased. At the same time, there is zero tolerance for terrorists. Funeral procession of a slain terrorist is not allowed, and he is buried where he gets killed. Sympathisers of terrorists have been punished and weeded out from govt jobs, while those involved in stone pelting are debarred from govt jobs. This is why movie theatres have resumed and there are night screenings after 33 years. Tazia procession was taken out after 32 years and Krishna Janmashtami was celebrated at Lal Chowk, where Army had to guard Murli Manohar Joshi ji and Modi ji when they went to unfurl the tricolour there. As for Pakistan-sponsored terrorism that you mentioned in the context of the Pahalgam attack, we have a clear policy: be it Uri, Pulwama or Pahalgam, we have given a strong reply, and today, through your interview, I want to ask Congress, what used to happen during their time? How can Congress question us on the issue of terrorism? It used to do nothing except change a minister. Of all political parties, Congress certainly has no right to criticise us.It was a deliberate attempt to sabotage peace in Kashmir, to stop rising tourism and distract Kashmiri youth, who were employed, enjoying prosperity and were distanced from terrorism. The youth in Kashmir realises the evil plan. There were protests in every town in the Valley after the attack on tourists. The Valley had not shown such solidarity with the country before.Yes, PM Modi has said so repeatedly, there should not be any confusion about it.We cannot control what they are planning but any misdeed of theirs will be responded to with full force. We will not hesitate in acting against whatever Pakistan chooses to do, without any delay.No special effort is required. Tourists have resumed their travel and we will soon be able to reach earlier levels.The PM has stated this in his Independence Day speech, and I have said in both Houses of Parliament that J&K will be granted the status of a state at an appropriate time. There should be no doubt about that.In line with the PM’s public declaration to punish terrorists responsible for the Pahalgam attack, we launched limited strikes on terror launchpads and made it very clear that was a targeted strike. Pakistan treated our strike on terrorists as an attack on its territory, ending the distinction. It attacked our civilian locations. We gave a befitting reply on May 10 by damaging their airbases, while sparing civilian areas. Within no time, Pakistan sought a suspension of strikes.I will only say that when the country is facing hostilities, one should refrain from saying things which hurt the morale of our armed forces, who have done a sterling job. Our agencies gave precise coordinates of specific targets for our forces to strike them with full force. Our scientists also deserve praise for developing weapons systems that proved so effective.No, it will never be restored. International treaties can’t be annulled unilaterally but we had the right to put it in abeyance, which we have done. The treaty preamble mentions that it was for peace and progress of the two countries but once that has been violated, there is nothing left to protect.We will use water that rightfully belongs to India. Paani Rajasthan tak jayega.We will take the water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably.The situation in Manipur is not of terrorism, nor is it an anti-national issue. It is related to ethnic tension. We had an open border with Myanmar and when that country faced instability, infiltration started. Then the court order (on Meiteis also deserving quotas) triggered a spark. We need to keep in mind that in all the previous cases of ethnic violence in Manipur, the situation could be stabilised only after threefour years. Today, there is no atmosphere of violence, but the rift between the two communities (Meiteis and Kukis) has not been healed. We are seeking to bring about reconciliation; we invited them separately and then asked them to come together, and now we are discussing this at the political level. We are hopeful of success soon.Until the differences between the two communities are sorted, it will be difficult. Peace is very important.This decision was not taken under pressure. The Modi govt has made the most significant contributions to inclusive and balanced development, encompassing both social and regional dimensions. Most of the poor are Dalit, backwards and minorities, and a larger part of the budget has been allocated to them. There is no bigger anti-OBC party than Congress; they tried to suppress the Kalelkar Commission report, and they did the same with the Mandal Commission. When the recommendations of the Mandal Commission were implemented by a non-Congress govt, Rajiv Gandhi gave the longest speech as leader of opposition, a record that has not been broken also because you don’t have such leaders of opposition now.Caste count will be part of the Census, period. The PM has said so and there have been three press releases.We did say that it is an attempt to divide society. But we also decided to blunt it by agreeing to the demand. Our goal is to keep everyone united.They should be available towards the end of 2027, may be a few months earlier as we are deploying a lot of technology. Instead of five to six years in the past, it may take five to six months.The 2029 elections will be held with women’s reservation.No one will have any reason to complain when the exercise is conducted. We will establish a very good balance and no one will be dissatisfied. DMK is raising the issue only because of the 2026 assembly elections. Delimitation is not going to happen by then, and they know this.The three laws (IPC, Indian Evidence Act and CrPC) were enacted by the British to preserve their rule. The idea was to protect their forces, their property and their own security. We have kept people’s interests at the forefront. We have provided for technological changes that will remain relevant for a century; the definition of an e-document will remain unchanged, despite changes in technology from floppy disks to pen drives, for instance. It allows for e-hearing and e-arguments, and the entire chargesheet can be filed electronically, making the process paperless. Forensics have been made compulsory for several offences; videography of search and seizures is also compulsory. We have provided timelines to ensure that justice is available promptly, and rights have been provided to victims. Along with all this, there is computerisation of police stations, and multiple types of databases will be available, such as those related to narcotics or terrorism. In two years, our legal system will be the most modern in the world. The improvement in Assam shows that we are on track to reach the global average of convictions.There is an arrangement called ICJS. Legacy data has been added, and 95% of the integration is nearly complete. A common software will be introduced by Sept, connecting all police stations, forensic labs, prosecution wings, courts and prisons.Lies should not deter us from doing the right thing. An infiltrator has to leave India. Our country is not a dharamshala. If you need to visit India, you must obtain a valid visa from our embassy. Whatever the perception or political colour, the country’s security is paramount.That is because we (BJP) are in office in most states.Things will improve there too after the next electionsRekha ji’s govt has made a very strong start, whether it is on health, ration cards, tackling water issues, cleaning and development of Yamuna. Her govt has started work on stopping revenue loss. You can’t do much more in 100 days. We have been able to successfully convey to officers that they have to work hard.For any fight, infrastructure is crucial and that is in place now. There is a fourlevel arrangement — at the national level, between state and central, in districts and it is now going to the level of DySPs and police. Apart from Bengal and Kerala, states have also set up narcotics control wings. We have managed to step up recoveries, laws have been strengthened, we can attach property, keep people in jail for longer duration, now police stations can test samples. Over the next five-six months, we will strike on cartels in a very coordinated way.It will happen soon.We will post convincing wins in Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Bengal. We are confident of victory in Tamil Nadu.It’s been raised in Tamil Nadu due to the polls. The public has clarity on the issue, and Indian languages have a bright future.This is propaganda. Between 2004 and 2014, Rs 18.3 lakh crore was given as grants to states, and between 2014 and 2024, it was Rs 70 lakh crore. This aligns with the population of states.Absolutely. The law is entirely in line with the Constitution. The objective is not to offend or hurt religious sentiments in any way, but to eradicate corruption and make the operation of waqf transparent through the use of technologyThere is no thinking within the govt (on NJAC-type body). For us, corruption is a major issue and when the Chief Justice of India in a letter has acknowledged Varma’s culpability, then there is no reason to doubt. I am hoping that the removal happens unanimously.It is not a corruption case, it is a case about conduct (of a judge), which is not within the purview of an elected govt, it has to be decided by the Supreme Court. Corruption and misconduct are two distinct issues with clearly defined boundaries.",The Modi govt has completed 11 years in office. What would you count as the five biggest achievements?

'Right Engine Overhauled, Left Inspected': Air India CEO Shares Details Of Crashed Boeing Dreamliner

The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) will determine where to decode the black box of Air India's crashed Dreamliner, the government said on Thursday.""A combined unit of the Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) has been recovered from the crash site on June 13, 2025, and another set was found on June 16. This model of aircraft has two black box sets,"" according to a statement from the Civil Aviation Ministry.The ministry confirmed that the AAIB investigation is advancing steadily with assistance from local authorities and agencies.

So what could have caused the problem?



Air India in a statement said an aircraft undergoes multiple engineering checks before it is cleared for flight operations, with top priority given to safety issues, and the June 1 Delhi-Hong Kong flight too went through the process.""A hissing sound started emanating from the decorative door panel mid-flight, and after assessing that there was no risk to safety, crew took action to alleviate the noise. After landing in Hong Kong airport, the aircraft underwent checks by the engineering team.""All safety parameters were found to be in compliance and the aircraft was cleared for service. There was no such noise during the return flight AI315 from Hong Kong to Delhi. We would like to reiterate that the safety of our customers and crew remains top priority,"" the Air India statement added.""As the aircraft climbs, the atmospheric pressure difference within and outside the aircraft increases. The pressure inside the B787 passenger cabin is what you would experience at around 6,000 ft altitude. But the aircraft could be cruising at 40,000 ft. If the door seal is compromised, pressurised air (meant to circulate in the passenger cabin) could leak through it, making these noises,"" said a source, requesting anonymity. Unlike the Boeing 777 or 737 aircraft, Boeing 787 has an advanced plug-type door which is electronically monitored. The door swings outward and then moves forward to open. To close, it is plugged into the fuselage for pressurisation. The B777 door on the other hand is operated manually, while the narrow body B737 has a manual, mechanical plug-type door.TOI looked into door plug problems reported by airlines worldwide. The most recent documented case occurred in Oct 2022, when an American Airlines Boeing 787-800 flight to Paris returned to Philadelphia after fumes were detected around two doors.Flight attendants checked lavatories and other places but couldn't find the source of the fumes and when they began spreading in the passenger cabin, the crew declared an emergency and diverted to land safely.In Feb 2022, a TUI airlines B787-800 flying from Amsterdam to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic returned to Amsterdam after a howling noise came from door 2L. A small hole in the door seal caused the sounds and the pilots decided to divert.In Aug 2019, a Japan Airlines flight from Tokyo to Bangkok landed back in Tokyo two hours after departure. Passengers complained of growling sounds and vibrations coming from the main door towards the front of the Boeing 787-800 Dreamliner, according to reports. On ground inspection a small gap was found in the door seal through which pressurised air was escaping, creating strange noises and vibrations. There were no cabin pressurisation problems, and no oxygen masks were deployed. The aircraft was returned to service about 30 hours after the incident.In none of these three cases did the aircraft suffer from a cabin depressurisation problem. A senior commander said, ""This kind of leak can happen if a door seal is slightly out of place or it has gone old. It does not affect cabin pressurisation at all. Hypothetically if we assume all 8 doors develop this problem, even then pilots get enough advance warning to initiate a descent down to 10,000 ft as is the standard practice in a cabin decompression emergency. ""Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert, said, ""The question is, was it a one-off thing or is it a regular occurrence?

Another section of candidates, who were waitlisted, moved HC for a stay on the scheme, arguing it ""frustrated"" the SC order.Justice Amrita Sinha held that the people whose jobs were terminated by the SC order could not be provided such support after the apex court had decided the issue of illegal appointments conclusively and opined that the appointments were a result of ""fraud"".

(AP Photo/Ajit Solanki)

NEW DELHI: India has been holding yoga events every year on June 21 since 2014, when UN adopted India's resolution to mark the day as International Day of Yoga (IDY).Celebrating IDY was first proposed by PM Narendra Modi at the United Nations General Assembly in 2014. Highlighting yoga's universal appeal, he suggested the Summer Solstice - June 21 - as the appropriate day for the purpose. With 177 UN member states co-sponsoring the resolution, the proposal received overwhelming support, with IDY being first celebrated in 2015.A survey commissioned by Ministry of Ayush has found that this exercise has led to nearly one in every four persons in India incorporating yoga - which includes asana sequences, breath control exercises and meditation - into their lifestyle.While 11% of the respondents - 30,084 people from across the country - said they practise yoga daily, 13% said they do it sometimes.However, 75% of people still don't practise yoga. To encourage such people, the survey report suggests complementing high-visibility flagship events such as IDY with grassroots mobilisation, digital platforms, and institutional partnerships. One of the moves by govt in this direction is a plan to upgrade existing parks in various panchayats (rural) and municipalities (urban) into Yoga parks where people can practise yoga every day.The Ayush ministry report also calls for embedding yoga instruction within school and university wellness programmes to foster early habit formation among young adults (18-24 years).The middle-aged groups can benefit from flexible work arrangements and digital access, which offer opportunities to scale virtual and office-based yoga interventions and convert occasional participants into consistent practitioners, the researchers suggest. They highlighted that nearly 17% of the elderly - the highest of any age group - practise yoga regularly.""The elderly people recognise the benefits of yoga, but they face barriers in including the practice in their daily lives. To address this, senior citizens-focused modules-such as chair-based asanas, balance exercises, and guided breathwork- should be delivered through community health centres and assisted-living facilities, ensuring that older adults can safely and confidently integrate yoga into their daily routines,"" said Raghvendra Rao, director of Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy (CCRYN).He also stressed the need for more yoga trainers and accessibility to yoga classes, offline or through digital mode. Subhash Giri, professor of medicine at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital, stressed that yoga provides numerous physical, mental, emotional, and long-term health benefits.Saima Wazed, regional director of WHO Southeast Asia said: ""The benefits of yoga are well-documented. Studies have shown that 77% of people report feeling physically stronger after practising yoga regularly; 82% of patients with chronic inflammation experienced a nearly 50% reduction in symptoms after just six weeks of daily yoga. A study by Harvard Medical School found 60% of participants with depression experienced a significant reduction in symptoms after practising yoga twice a week for eight weeks"".","India has been holding yoga events every year on June 21 since 2014.

BENGALURU: Defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd has become the first Indian firm to fully acquire technology of a launch vehicle. HAL secured the transfer of technology (ToT) for Isro 's Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) at a cost of Rs 511 crore.Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) announced Friday that this first-of-its-kind complete ToT marked a significant milestone. Unlike the manufacturing contract of PSLV - shared between HAL and L&T - the SSLV has been fully offered to HAL. The company will own the rocket, build it, market it, and launch it independently.The selection process involved two stages. Out of nine applicants, six were shortlisted in the first round. A committee led by former principal scientific adviser to govt of India, Prof Vijaya Raghavan, and co-headed by former Isro director Suresh, then evaluated the techno-commercial bids of three firms. All were technically qualified but HAL emerged as the highest bidder at Rs 511 crore, IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka said.While HAL submitted an independent bid, the other two finalists were consortia - one led by Bengaluru-based Alpha Design and the other by Bharat Dynamics Ltd from Hyderabad.""Payment will be done in phases. ToT will take two years. HAL will make at least two SSLV prototypes with complete help and hand-holding by Isro and after two years, they will be on their own. The initial ToT agreement will be for the first two years and then another contract will be signed between HAL and Isro,"" Goenka said.After the initial two years, HAL will function independently and can even modify the rocket design or choose new partners. A formal contract involving NewSpace India Ltd (Nsil), HAL, Isro and IN-SPACe will be signed soon. Nsil will manage the commercial aspects while IN-SPACe, in collaboration with Isro centres, will oversee the technology transfer.Barenya Senapati, HAL's director of finance, said the win aligned with HAL's broader goal of significantly expanding its space portfolio. He assured the new programme would not affect HAL's other operations.Regarding liability for rocket launches, Goenka noted that, under international norms, the state bore primary responsibility. ""It is up to govt to decide how much of the liability will remain with the state and how much will be transferred to HAL. The company will comply with applicable laws once the contract is finalised,"" he said.","Defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd has become the first Indian firm to fully acquire technology of a launch vehicle.

It has also suggested a two- to five-year jail term and fine for misinformation on social media or in publications. These offences will be considered cognisable but non-bailable.The social-media regulatory authority will ensure content posted on social media should be based on authentic research on subjects related to science, history, religion, philosophy and literature.To fasten accountability, the bill states special courts will be set up with Karnataka HC's concurrence, with a sessions judge presiding over one or more districts. The special courts will issue directions to intermediaries, publishers, broadcasters, or any other persons exercising control over communication medium disseminating misinformation to persons in Karnataka.The proposal gives aggrieved parties 30 days to respond to notices.

NEW DELHI: Election Commission has revised its standard operating procedures (SOPs) for post-result checking of burnt memory or microcontroller of EVM (EVM C&V), allowing the candidates who finished second or third, to also opt for a mock poll on the selected EVM units, in addition to the simple diagnostic check already offered.As per the earlier SOPs issued on June 1, 2024, EVMs could be subjected to C&V as a set, that is, a combination of ballot unit, control unit and VVPAT, as used in an actual election. A diagnostic check would be performed under the supervision of the district in-charge engineer of the manufacturer, Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) or Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL) and the district election officer. There was no provision for a mock poll.The new administrative SOPs, issued on June 17, 2025, have also split the charges to be paid by the candidates applying for EVM checks, into two slabs. While plain EVM C&V charge is now fixed at Rs 23,600, inclusive of 18% GST, C&V check with mock poll will cost the applicant candidates Rs 47,200 (GST included). These charges shall be payable to the EVM manufacturer. However, if the EVM is found to be tampered with or modified, the charges will be refunded to the applicant concerned and borne by central or state govt, depending on the election.Eligible candidates can, within seven days of declaration of result, request a check or verification of burnt memory for any tampering or modification in 5% of EVMs - BU, CU and VVPAT - per assembly constituency or assembly segment of a parliamentary constituency.The new SOPs have also cut the period for the chief electoral officer to send the consolidated list of EVM C&V applications received, to the EVM manufacturers, to 15 days from the date of declaration of result, against 30 days earlier.Meanwhile, in another important decision, EC, concerned at the possible misuse of still and video records maintained by it for each stage of the election process, has fixed the period of retention of such records to 45 days, provided no election petition is filed.Time limits ranging from six months to a year were previously laid down for retention of photos and videography from different stages of elections - pre-nomination, nomination, EVM preparation, polling, counting and declaration of result - even though not mandatory under the law.""The instructions to destroy records after 45 days is prospective,"" an EC official told TOI, hinting that they may kick in only with the upcoming Bihar assembly poll.""The retention period is in sync with the 45-day time-bar for filing election petitions. When an election petition is filed, the relevant records will not be destroyed till after the petition is disposed of finally,"" added the officer.EC, in a letter sent to the all state CEOs on May 30, had justified the modified instructions by citing the ""recent misuse of this content by non-contestants for spreading misinformation and malicious narratives on social media by selective and out-of-context use of such content, which will not lead to any legal outcome"".","Election Commission has revised its standard operating procedures (SOPs) for post-result checking of burnt memory or microcontroller of EVM.

It’s important to note that these

warning notices and an investigation report are not related to the Air India AI 171 Boeing 787 crash that happened on June 12.

What DGCA warned Air India about

The aviation regulator's report quoted in the Reuters report revealed that during May inspections, three Air India Airbus aircraft were found operating with overdue mandatory checks on escape slides, which are vital emergency equipment.

An Airbus A320 aircraft's inspection was conducted on May 15, more than a month behind schedule. During this period, AirNav Radar tracking showed the aircraft served international routes including Dubai, Riyadh and Jeddah.

The findings also highlighted that an Airbus A319, used for domestic flights, had checks delayed by over three months, whilst another aircraft's inspection was conducted two days late.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation had issued a warning to Air India regarding safety protocol violations, as three of the airline’s Airbus aircraft continued operations despite pending inspections of emergency systems. The regulatory body also criticised the airline's delayed response in addressing these concerns, according to a Reuters report.These communications and warnings by DGCA were given to Air India days before the crash of the Dreamliner.The DGCA report said: ""The above cases indicate that aircraft were operated with expired or unverified emergency equipment, which is a violation of standard airworthiness and safety requirements.""Also Read | Air India crash: N Chandrasekaran makes important statement; says AI 171 Boeing 787 Dreamliner had ‘new engine’, ‘clean history’ & ‘no red flags’ The regulator noted that Air India ""failed to submit timely compliance responses"" to identified deficiencies, ""further evidencing weak procedural control and oversight.""The airline, acquired by the Tata Group in 2022 from the government, responded that it was ""accelerating"" the verification of all maintenance records, including escape slide dates, with completion expected within days.The carrier clarified that in one instance, the issue was discovered when an AI Engineering Services engineer accidentally deployed an escape slide during maintenance work.Safety checks on emergency escape slides are crucial, as their malfunction during accidents could result in grave consequences, according to Vibhuti Singh, who previously served as a legal expert at the government's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.The aviation regulator DGCA said that aircraft failing to undergo mandatory inspections would have their airworthiness certificates considered suspended.Documentation reveals that Animesh Garg, who holds the position of deputy director of airworthiness in the Indian government, dispatched the warning notices and reports to Air India's CEO Campbell Wilson and other senior officials, including the continuing airworthiness manager, quality manager and head of planning.Also Read | Air India plane crash: After 12/6, demand for Air India's 787s crashes A legal specialist in aviation matters indicated that such violations typically result in financial and civil penalties for both the company and individual executives.In a previous statement to Reuters, Wilson acknowledged that whilst global parts shortages affected the industry broadly, Air India faced greater challenges due to its older fleet, with numerous aircraft remaining unmodernised since their delivery in 2010-2011.Aviation authorities across the globe, including India's regulatory body, impose penalties on airlines for breaching compliance requirements. In February, the government informed parliament about 23 instances where airlines faced warnings or penalties for safety violations in the previous year.Air India and Air India Express accounted for twelve of these violations, with one case involving ""unauthorised entry into the cockpit"". The carrier faced its heftiest penalty of $127,000 for insufficient oxygen supplies during a San Francisco-bound flight.","The Directorate General of Civil Aviation had issued a warning to Air India regarding safety protocol violations.

Ricky Williams warns Texas hemp THC ban could devastate the state’s cannabis economy, risking billions in revenue and hundreds of small businesses



Ricky Williams blasts Texas for ignoring science and silencing choice, calling the hemp THC ban a reckless move that punishes athletes seeking natural recovery

Why Ricky Williams’ fight against Texas’ cannabis ban could set a national precedent

Ricky Williams has always been more than just a football player. After a career marked by big runs and bold choices, the former Dolphins star is stepping into a different kind of spotlight—this time as a defender of cannabis rights. In June 2025, Williams joined a federal lawsuit aimed at stopping a proposed Texas law that would ban hemp-derived THC products like Delta-8. “Texas is attempting to outlaw these items against the will of hundreds of thousands of voters,” the legal complaint states. Now, Williams is bringing his voice—and his influence—to a battle that could change everything.It all started when Texas lawmakers introduced a bill that would classify many hemp-based THC products as Schedule I substances—putting them in the same category as heroin and LSD. If passed, the law would force shops across the state to pull popular items like gummies, vapes, and oils off the shelves.That didn’t sit right with Williams. So he teamed up with the Cannabis Freedom Alliance and signed onto a lawsuit challenging the proposed ban. Filed in Texas and cited in a report by ProFootballTalk, the suit argues that the state can’t just override federal law. Specifically, it points to the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized hemp-derived cannabinoids nationwide.The suit also warns that Texas is threatening to undo years of work by businesses and farmers who’ve built a thriving industry under the protections of that law. And for Williams, this fight is personal.Speaking at a wellness event in Austin, Williams didn’t hold back. “Cannabis allowed me to extend my athletic career and recover without prescription drugs,” he said.Since retiring from the NFL in 2011, Ricky Williams has leaned into a lifestyle built around healing—teaching yoga, practicing meditation, and advocating for holistic wellness. To him, cannabis isn’t just a talking point. It’s a tool that helped him cope with pain, both physical and emotional.Now he’s using his platform to push back. Through social media, interviews, and public appearances, Williams has urged Texans to stand up for their rights. “This ban doesn’t just affect me—it affects small businesses, farmers, and consumers. Communities,” he said during a recent livestream.Texas lawmakers say they’re concerned about the potency of products like Delta-8 and how they’re marketed to younger audiences. But critics argue that strict regulation—not a flat-out ban—is the real solution. Other states, like Idaho and Wyoming, have already tossed out similar laws in court.This lawsuit could be the next to set a precedent. Legal experts say the outcome might not just shape policy in Texas—it could influence what happens nationwide. If the courts side with Williams and his legal team, hemp-derived THC products would remain protected. But if the state wins? It could be the first domino in a wave of bans.Ricky Williams may be done running on the field, but he’s not done running toward what he believes in. With this lawsuit, he’s putting his name—and his legacy—on the line for something bigger than football. Whether or not the courts agree with him, one thing’s clear: Williams isn’t afraid to challenge the system. Not when he thinks people’s rights are on the line.Also Read: Kansas City Chiefs show out as Patrick Mahomes leads star-studded support for unbeaten current","Ricky Williams has joined a federal lawsuit aimed at stopping a proposed Texas law that would ban hemp-derived THC products.

"After Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis too disagrees with Anthropic CEO's AI job warning",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-nvidias-jensen-huang-google-ai-ceo-demis-hassabis-too-disagrees-with-anthropic-ceos-ai-job-warning/articleshow/121889566.cms,"AI job warning: What Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said about

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says Anthropic CEO is very wrong

Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis said about AI job warning

After Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s recent dismissal of apocalyptic job-loss predictions, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has also dismissed the pessimistic predictions made by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei . Recently, Amodei warned of significant white-collar job displacement, Hassabis and Huang present a more optimistic point of view. Speaking at the SXSW London festival, Hassabis stated that AI will disrupt traditional roles but also emphasised that it will also create valuable and new jobs, particularly for those with STEM skills and technical fluency. Hassabis has asked the students and professionals to embrace AI tools and also build foundational knowledge in math, physics, and computer science, calling them essential for navigating the AI-driven future.Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that artificial intelligence could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, potentially driving US unemployment to 20%. The stark prediction comes as AI technology rapidly advances, with sectors including technology, finance, law, and consulting facing the greatest disruption.""We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,"" Amodei told Axios in an interview published Wednesday. The 42-year-old CEO emphasized that most people remain unaware of the impending transformation, calling it a reality that ""sounds crazy, and people just don't believe it.""Nvidia CEO expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Jensen Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has also expressed less concern about widespread job displacement due to AI. While acknowledging that AI will inevitably transform roles and that humanity is undergoing a shift even greater than the Industrial Revolution, Demis Hassabis remains optimistic about human adaptability. He believes AI will lead to the emergence of ""new very valuable jobs,"" particularly benefiting ""technically savvy people who are at the forefront of using these technologies.""Demis Hassabis's primary concern regarding AI lies not in job loss, but in its potential misuse by malicious actors. He stresses the urgent need for global regulation and an international framework to govern AI, likening it to a ""digital Geneva Convention,"" to prevent powerful AI systems from falling into the wrong hands.",Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that artificial intelligence could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years.

As reported by Reuters, the comprehensive trial, which involved over 1,000 Australian school students and hundreds of adults, concluded earlier this month.The Australian government is pushing ahead with a law, set to come into effect in December, that will require social media giants like Meta (Facebook, Instagram), Snapchat, and TikTok to implement ""reasonable steps"" to block under-16s from their platforms. Companies failing to comply could face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million).Tony Allen, CEO of the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme , the organization overseeing the Australian trial, stated on Friday that ""Age assurance can be done in Australia privately, efficiently and effectively."" He further noted that the trial found ""no significant tech barriers"" to rolling out a software-based scheme.However, Allen also cautioned that ""no one-size-fits-all solution, and no solution that worked perfectly in all deployments"" was identified. Concerns were also raised about some age-assurance software firms potentially ""over-collecting"" data in anticipation of future law enforcement or regulatory needs.As per the report, the initial findings reveal a positive outlook for the government announced ban. This comes despite ongoing skepticism from child protection advocates, tech industry groups, and even teenagers themselves, who have questioned the ban's enforceability due to potential workarounds like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).The trial conducted explored various age verification methods using facial recognition, inferring age based on behaviour and parental controls. During the test some of the facial recognition tools were reported to be almost accurate. However, other reports from the trial highlighted issues with accuracy, such as misidentifying children as older or having higher error rates for certain demographics.The complete report from the Age Assurance Technology Trial is said to be delivered to the Australian government next month. These findings will then inform an industry consultation ahead of the December deadline for the ban's implementation.","Australia is set to ban under-16s from social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat.

""We have taken this decision now since forming a committee, conducting an inquiry and submitting a report would be time-consuming,"" added Reddy.According to the education department officials, the fees of around 50 colleges were proposed to be hiked abnormally, with some increases amounting to 80-100%. Following this, the committee was asked to re-examine the fee hikes. Subsequently, the state decided to form a sub-committee to look into the issue.Meanwhile, managements said the govt should not punish all colleges by putting the fee revision on hold. ""It's true that the proposed fee hike at some colleges was excessive. The govt should have conducted an inquiry into them. Instead of putting the fee revision process on hold, they could have approved a hike of about 20-30% to account for inflation over the last three years,"" said G Nagaiah, general secretary, Federation of Association of Telangana Higher Institutions.The Federation said they would raise this issue with chief minister A Revanth Reddy and other ministers.","The state govt has put the fee hike for engineering, pharmacy and architecture courses on hold for the academin year 2025-26.

MUMBAI: Strong foreign fund buying supported by speculators' short covering late in the session on Friday led to a four-figure points jump in the Sensex. After opening marginally higher, the benchmark picked up gains through the session to close 1,046 points or 1.3 per cent higher above the 82,400-point mark. On the NSE, Nifty too followed a similar trend and closed 244 points or 1 per cent higher at 25,038 points.Foreign investors, after showing mixed trends for the last few sessions, turned strong buyers on Friday with a net inflow of Rs 7,704 crore. Domestic funds, on the other hand, were net sellers at Rs 3,050 crore, BSE data showed.According to Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equities, markets witnessed consolidation after the recent spell of subdued trend, as strong European cues and positive Dow Futures triggered a massive rally in local benchmarks. ""Investors also resorted to short covering ahead of next week's monthly derivatives expiry.""Tapse, despite Friday's gains, is cautious about the market direction since a number of headwinds have a chance of impeding the northward run.

'Involved in development of ballistic missiles': FATF calls out Pakistan for flouting norms; India may use dossier to push for sanctions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/involved-in-development-of-ballistic-missiles-fatf-calls-out-pakistan-for-flouting-norms-india-may-use-dossiers-to-push-for-sanctions/articleshow/121985893.cms,"



A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme, referencing a shipment seized by Indian customs officials in 2020 that was bound for Port Qasim in Karachi. The FATF case study outlines how dual-use goods, including equipment critical for ballistic missile technology, were mis-declared in export documents and linked directly to Pakistan’s National Development Complex, which is known to be involved in the development of long-range ballistic missiles.The FATF report reveals that Indian investigators intercepted a cargo ship falsely declaring autoclaves, equipment used for high-energy materials and missile motor components. “The Bill of Lading of the seized cargo provided evidence of the link between the importer and the National Development Complex,” the report noted.This latest disclosure comes as FATF increases its scrutiny of state-sponsored terrorism, particularly following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which left 26 dead. In a public condemnation, FATF said: “This, and other recent attacks, could not occur without money and the means to move funds between terrorist supporters.”As per PTI sources, India is likely to use this FATF disclosure in its dossier to push for Pakistan’s return to the FATF grey list. The upcoming Asia Pacific Group meeting in August and the FATF plenary in October may see renewed calls for sanctions or monitoring. According to officials cited by PTI, the inclusion of “state-sponsored terrorism” in the FATF’s upcoming analysis marks a significant step in acknowledging Pakistan’s involvement in funding and facilitating terror operations.The incident flagged by FATF, which occurred in February 2020 at Kandla port, saw authorities act on intelligence regarding a suspicious Hong Kong-flagged ship, Da Cui Yun, that had departed from China’s Jiangyin port, TOI had reported. Officials seized a massive pressure chamber described as a pipe-like object, 35-40 feet in length, now confirmed to have potential ballistic missile applications. Experts from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) joined a high-level investigation into the cargo, amid tight-lipped responses from customs due to the national security implications.Also read: ‘Suspicious’ Chinese ship seized at Kandla, under strict scrutiny The FATF report also highlighted the growing global risk from proliferation financing (PF), especially concerning state and non-state actors acquiring dual-use technologies for weapons of mass destruction (WMD). “The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related financing represents a significant threat to global security and the integrity of the international financial system,” the report warns, adding that failure to implement effective controls could allow actors to exploit weaknesses in global export and financial systems.","The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
