'Atom Bomb Hay, Fatega': Rahul Gandhi Warns EC Over Bihar SIR, Oppn Demand Parliament Showdown

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission (EC) on Friday said it prefers to ignore Rahul Gandhi 's baseless allegations of ""vote theft"" and has asked all poll officials to continue working in an impartial and transparent manner, unfazed by his repeated threats and ""deplorable"" statements.In a post on X, the commission said it was unfortunate that Rahul was hurling unfounded allegations at EC and poll officials and repeatedly threatening them through media statements with irresponsible phrases like 'vote chori', ""over a year after conclusion of the Lok Sabha poll"".He said neither Rahul nor Congress availed of options available under the law, such as appeals against wrongful inclusion or exclusion of electors by the ERO in the final roll or challenging an election by filing an election petition within the stipulated time (45 days after declaration of result).EC said that it had sent a mail to Rahul Gandhi on June 12 after he alleged irregularities in Maharashtra polls, in a newspaper article. He was asked to write to the EC directly or meet the panel, but he did not respond. Interestingly, none of the allegations made by Rahul in his article, or any other grievance of his, has been directly communicated to EC. ""It is very strange and deplorable that he is making wild allegations and has now even started threatening EC and its staff,"" EC said.In the post on X, the commission underlined that while Rahul Gandhi has been attacking EC over alleged ""vote theft"" during the Lok Sabha poll in Karnataka, the fact is that the electoral roll was prepared by 31 district election officers, 419 electoral registration officers (EROs) and assistant EROs and 58,834 booth level officers (BLOs), with the due involvement of booth level agents appointed by all political parties.","The Election Commission (EC) on Friday said it prefers to ignore Rahul Gandhi's baseless allegations of ""vote theft"" The commission said it was unfortunate that Rahul was hurling unfounded allegations at EC and poll officials.

Surge in Deportations: 8 Indians Deported Daily from the US Under Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-deportations-from-us-double-after-trump-returns-to-office/articleshow/123052105.cms,"File photo

Humane deportation



90% from 5 states



BENGALURU: That deportations of Indians from the US have surged significantly since Donald Trump returned to office in Jan this year is no secret. Now here’s how much more it is when compared to the Biden term and the last year of Trump’s previous term that preceded it: On average, at least 8 Indians were sent back everyday this year, compared to around 3 daily between Jan 2020 and Dec 2024.According to data from the ministry of external affairs (MEA), in the five-and-a-half years between Jan 2020 and July 2025, 7,244 Indians were deported for various reasons, and nearly a quarter of them — 1,703 — were sent back after Trump took office for the second time.This rise also coincides with more aggressive enforcement mechanisms. On June 26, the US state department reminded people that the visa screening doesn’t stop after a visa is issued. “...We continuously check visa holders to ensure they follow all US laws and immigration rules — and we will revoke their visas and deport them if they don’t.”While this was for legal immigrants, a couple of days before this statement, the US had said: “The US has increased enforcement of immigration laws and removal of illegal aliens. Illegal entry will lead to detention, deportation, and permanent consequences for future visa eligibility…Embarking on a costly and dangerous journey will land you in jail or back in your homeland with a permanent mark on your record.”Of the 1,703 deported this year, 864 deportations occurred through state-arranged charter and military flights, as per MEA. US Customs and Border Protection (military flights) repatriated 333 people across three dates in Feb: 5, 15, and 16. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), through its Enforcement and Removal Operations, deported a total of 231 individuals via chartered flights on March 19, June 8, and June 25. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also carried out deportations via charter flights, sending 300 people back to India on July 5 and 18.W hile 747 individuals were deported via commercial flights from the US — they arrived individually or in small groups, depending on when their flight tickets were arranged — another 72 individuals came through commercial flights from Panama in a similar staggered manner.India doesn’t maintain its own firm estimates of illegal immigration into the US. And so far as consular and deportation exercises are concerned, it relies on information shared by US authorities.The MEA has said that “it remains engaged with US counterparts to ensure deportations are carried out humanely. It has also raised concerns regarding the reported use of shackles, particularly on women and children, and other issues related to cultural and religious sensitivities.”Further, a state-wise analysis of the 1,703 Indian deportations in 2025 so far shows that the trend is heavily skewed towards a few northern states. Punjab topped the list with 620 deportees, closely followed by Haryana with 604 — together accounting for over 70% of all cases.Gujarat was a distant third, with 245 individuals sent back, while Uttar Pradesh and Goa followed with 38 and 26 deportees respectively. These top five states collectively represent more than 90% of all deportations recorded this year.The remaining states and UTs reported far fewer cases. Maharashtra and Delhi had 20 deportees each, Telangana 19, Tamil Nadu 17, and Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand 12 each. Karnataka saw only 5.","In five-and-a-half years between Jan 2020 and July 2025, 7,244 Indians were deported for various reasons.

NEW DELHI: The stampede at New Delhi Railway Station on Feb 15 that claimed 18 lives was triggered due to a ""big headload falling from one of the passengers"", railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told Rajya Sabha on Friday, quoting the findings of a high-level inquiry committee.In a written reply to a question from Samajwadi Party MP Ramji Lal Suman about the status of the committee constituted to investigate the stampede, Vaishnaw submitted that the incident happened on foot overbridge (FOB)-3 stairs connecting platforms 14/15 at the station.

SEBI Unveils ‘Valid’ UPI System to Protect Investors from Fraud in Capital Markets Starting Oct 1

UPI New Rules 2025: Top Things to Know

Cap on balance enquiries to prevent system overload

Limit on bank account access via “list account” API

Restrictions on UPI autopay transactions during peak hours

Industry reaction welcomes move towards efficiency

Deadline set for compliance; penalties for violations

Starting August 1, 2025, UPI will see changes as the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the UPI ecosystem.The changes are aimed at improving system efficiency, preventing outages, and ensuring better user consent mechanisms.Payment Service Providers (PSPs), UPI apps, and banks must implement the changes by July 31, as per NPCI’s compliance notice dated May 21.A major change includes a cap on balance enquiry requests, now limited to 50 per app per customer in a rolling 24-hour period, as per ET.These requests must be user-initiated only, with no automatic prompts by apps or systems. UPI apps must also introduce the ability to reduce or halt such requests during peak load hours to minimise system strain.The guidelines also require issuer banks to include the available account balance in every successful UPI transaction message, streamlining user experience and reducing the need for separate balance checks.NPCI has also put in place access limits on the “list account” API, which lets users view bank accounts linked to their mobile number. This API will now be restricted to 25 requests per customer per app per day, and only after the user selects their bank in the app.Any retries must be made with explicit customer consent, ensuring transparency and avoiding unnecessary API calls.To further address system congestion, NPCI has restricted UPI Autopay executions to non-peak hours only. Peak hours are defined as 10:00 to 13:00 and 17:00 to 21:30.Each autopay mandate will be allowed one initial attempt and a maximum of three retries, clearly capped at four total executions per mandate sequence.Welcoming the new rules, Tarun Nazare, co-founder and managing director of Neokred was quoted as saying by ET that “These measures are prudent and forward-thinking, as they prioritise system efficiency and user security. By capping balance requests and optimising API usage—especially with clear restrictions during peak hours—the guidelines will effectively reduce server overloads and potential service outages. ”He also highlighted the value of “emphasis on customer consent and timely compliance” in enhancing system accountability.The NPCI has clearly warned that failure to comply with these directives by July 31, 2025, may result in UPI API restrictions, penalties, suspension of new customer onboarding, or any other appropriate action.NPCI has advised all member banks and UPI ecosystem participants to communicate these changes across their systems and partners ahead of the compliance deadline.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the UPI ecosystem.

NEW DELHI: India on Friday strongly rejected a British parliamentary committee report that accuses it of engaging in transnational repression (TNR) activities in the UK, dismissing the claims as baseless and sourced from “dubious” and “discredited” individuals with a history of ""anti-India hostility"".Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal in a statement said: “We have seen the references to India in the report and categorically reject these baseless allegations. These claims stem from unverified and dubious sources, predominantly linked to proscribed entities and individuals with a clear, documented history of anti-India hostility.""""The deliberate reliance on discredited sources calls into question the credibility of the report itself,"" the statement added.The UK Parliament’s Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR), in its report titled Transnational Repression in the UK, claimed that several countries, including India, had attempted to intimidate or silence individuals and communities on British soil. The report states that “multiple evidence submissions accused Bahrain, China, Egypt, Eritrea, India, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates of perpetrating TNR in the UK.India was named alongside 11 other countries against whom the committee claimed to have received evidence. However, the source material presented in the report refers specifically to allegations made by Sikhs for Justice, a pro-Khalistan group that has been declared an “unlawful association” under India’s Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The report, authored by a cross-party group of MPs, alleged that foreign states had conducted activities on UK soil that “instilled fear, limited freedom of expression and movement, and undermined people’s sense of safety.” It also claimed that MI5’s state-threat investigations had risen by 48% since 2022.","The UK Parliament’s Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR), in its report titled Transnational Repression in the UK, claimed that several countries, including India, had attempted to intimidate or silence individuals and communities on British soil.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Friday rejected suggestions of any strain in India-Russia relations following sharp attacks from US President Donald Trump, who questioned the economic and strategic ties between the two countries.Responding to questions at the weekly briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “Our bilateral relationships with various countries stand on their own merit and should not be seen from the prism of a third country. India and Russia have a steady and time-tested partnership.”The MEA’s response came a day after Trump criticised both countries on his social media platform, Truth Social.“I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” Trump posted. “We have done very little business with India — their tariffs are too high, among the highest in the world. Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together.”Jaiswal, when asked about Trump’s broader comments, reiterated the importance of the India-US partnership: “India and the United States share a comprehensive global strategic partnership anchored in shared interests, democratic values, and robust people-to-people ties.This partnership has weathered several transitions and challenges. We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to and are confident that the relationship will continue to move forward. ”Also Read: Donald Trump's 25% tariff: India expects minimal impact; indicates agriculture, dairy, GM food no-go areas in trade deal talks Asked about defence cooperation, Jaiswal added: “The sourcing of our defence requirements is determined solely by our national security imperatives and strategic assessments.”He declined to comment on Trump’s suggestion that India might one day purchase oil from Pakistan, saying, “I have no comments to offer in this matter.”On questions related to sanctions imposed by the US on Indian companies trading with Iran, Jaiswal said, “We have taken note of the sanctions, we are looking into it.”He also addressed reports suggesting Indian oil firms had stopped sourcing Russian oil: “You are aware of our broad approach to energy sourcing requirements, that we look at what is available in the market and the prevailing global situation. We are not aware of any specifics.”Russia has remained India’s top oil supplier in recent months, accounting for nearly 35–40 per cent of its imports—up from just 0.2 per cent before the Ukraine war.On Thursday, Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal told Parliament that the government is closely examining the developments and will safeguard national interest.“Government gives utmost priority to the safeguarding of welfare of farmers, labourers, entrepreneurs, industrialists, exporters, MSMEs and stakeholders of the industrial sector,” Goyal said. “We will take all necessary steps to safeguard our national interest.”","The ministry of external affairs rejected suggestions of any strain in India- Russia relations.

NEW DELHI: Another indigenous multi-role stealth frigate, Himgiri, was delivered to the Navy Thursday that will boost country's blue-water combat capabilities. This is the second such stealth warship to be handed over to the force this month.The 6,670-tonne Himgiri has been built by the Kolkata-based Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), while her predecessor Udaygiri was handed over by the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) on July 1. Both the warships are slated to be commissioned together towards end-August.The 149-metre long Himgiri is the third of the seven frigates being constructed under Project-17A, four at MDL in Mumbai and three at GRSE in Kolkata, at an overall cost of Rs 45,000 crore. The first was commissioned as INS Nilgiri in Jan, while the remaining four are to be progressively delivered by end-2026.All these multi-mission frigates are packed with advanced sensors and weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic precision-strike cruise missiles whose range has been extended to 450-km from the original 290-km, and ""designed to address current and future challenges in the maritime domain"", an officer said.For air defence, the frigates are equipped with Israeli-origin Barak-8 surface-to-air missile system, with an interception range of 70km against fighters, helicopters, drones and cruise missiles, among other weapons.""These frigates reflect a quantum leap in naval design, stealth, firepower, automation and survivability, and are an admirable symbol of aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) in warship building,"" the officer said.Overall, the 140-warship Navy has 58 ships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards for over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, while another 31 warships are in the planning stage.

Rijiju blames Opposition for Parliament washout

NEW DELHI: Union minister Kiren Rijiju on Friday ruled out any discussion in Parliament on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar, asserting that the exercise falls entirely within the purview of the Election Commission of India (ECI), a constitutional body.“I want to clarify that the government is ready to hold discussions on any issue as per rules. There cannot be a discussion on SIR because it is a process undertaken by a Constitutional body, and it is not happening for the first time,” Rijiju told ANI.Parliament proceedings have faced repeated disruptions as Opposition MPs demanded a debate on the ongoing SIR exercise in poll-bound Bihar.

Citing former Lok Sabha Speaker Balram Jakhar, he said, “What is not favoured by rules and convention cannot be discussed.” He questioned who in the House would be authorised to respond on behalf of the ECI, adding, “This is not the first time the EC is doing it.”Opposition leaders have been unrelenting.Rahul Gandhi, speaking to reporters after meeting Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, accused the poll panel of acting on behalf of the BJP. “Whoever in the Election Commission is involved in this exercise, right from top to bottom, we will not spare you. You are working against India, and this is no less than treason,” he said.Congress and RJD leaders in Bihar have also criticised the draft rolls released by the ECI. According to PTI, more than 65 lakh enumeration forms were “not included” in the rolls, reducing the state’s total voters from 7.9 crore to 7.24 crore. Patna alone saw nearly 4 lakh such exclusions. The ECI attributed the drop to 22.34 lakh deaths, 36.28 lakh voters permanently shifting away, and 7.01 lakh duplicate registrations.Rijiju also criticised the Opposition for stalling Parliament. “Crores of rupees are spent on running Parliament. The Congress and its allies should apologise to people for their conduct,” he said. He claimed the disruptions prevent MPs from raising other pressing issues and violate parliamentary norms. PTI reported that the INDIA bloc intends to push for a debate again on Monday and at the Business Advisory Committee meeting.The ECI has opened a window for claims and objections till 1 September.

The embassy's advisory underlines growing concerns about their safety.","The embassy of India in Dublin has issued a security advisory urging Indian citizens in Ireland to exercise caution.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has rescued four women, who married four brothers, from the rigours of a more than two-decade old criminal case lodged against them by one of the brothers who was incensed by his father's decision to bequeath the properties to them fearing that the alcoholic son might fritter away the assets.Virtually endorsing the societal belief to entrust landed and residential properties to the women of the house to protect it from being pawned away by alcoholic male members, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan quashed the case accusing the women of forging the old man's will to usurp the property.One Ram Baksh Dubey, fearing his estate getting wasted by the alcoholic obsessions of his third son Ashish Kumar, executed an unregistered will on Dec 23, 1993, bequeathing all his moveable and immoveable properties in the name of his four daughters-in-law.Dubey died on Jan 3, 1994. Three months later Ashish executed a registered sale deed for his share in his father's property in favour of another person. Unaware of this sale, the four women applied for mutation of the land as per the will and revenue authority made necessary changes in the revenue records in Sept 1994.When the purchaser of Ashish's share started constructing on the land, the women approached the civil court, which restrained him. The purchaser's claim based on the sale deed was rejected. He then in league with Ashish filed a criminal complaint case in court accusing the women of creating a forged will.","Ram Baksh Dubey executed an unregistered will on Dec 23, 1993, bequeathing all his moveable and immoveable properties in the name of his four daughters-in-law.

The cabinet has allowed lottery operations, which were shut down in 1999. Burdened with a debt of over Rs 1 lakh crore, it hopes to make a modest Rs 50 crore to Rs 100 crore annually from sale of lottery tickets.The decision to reintroduce lotteries after over a quarter century was taken in a cabinet meeting on July 31. The recommendation came from a cabinet sub-committee set up to give suggestions to boost state revenue.The move seems to be inspired by other states that run lotteries. Neighbouring Punjab earned Rs 235 crore through sale of lottery tickets during the 2024-25 fiscal while the tiny state of Sikkim made Rs 30 crore. Kerala tops the list - the southern state earned a jaw-dropping Rs 13,582 crore last fiscal.

To make the financial situation even worse, the revenue deficit grant, financial assistance from the Centre, has come down from Rs 6,258 crore in 2024 to Rs 3,257 crore in 2025, and GST compensation has been stopped by the Union govt.Govt is expected to introduce the bill on lotteries in the monsoon session of assembly, beginning Aug 18.Himachal banned lotteries, both state-run and from outside, in 1999 during Prem Kumar Dhumal's tenure as chief minister.Lotteries are legal in 13 states - Punjab, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Goa, Bengal, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Assam.","Cash-strapped Himachal Pradesh is trying its luck with lottery to turn its fortunes.

Revenue can’t be earned at cost of environment: SC

New Delhi: Reminding Centre and the states that earning revenue should not be prioritised over the ecology and environment, Supreme Court has expressed deep concern over uncontrolled constructions and inflow of tourists in Himachal Pradesh, saying the day is not far when the Himalayan state may vanish from the map of the country if remedial action is not taken on time.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadev said that in recent years, the state witnessed many natural disasters, and it is humans, not nature, who are responsible for floods, continuous landsliding of mountains and soil, collapsing of houses and buildings, and road subsidence in which hundreds of people perished. These disasters are man-made and it is not right to blame nature for it, the court said.It appealed to Centre and the state government to intervene and stem the rot on an urgent basis.SC said, “Nature has given abundant beauty to the state of HP... Taking advantage of this natural beauty, the government started constructing four-lane roads to promote it as a tourist destination. To build these roads, heavy machinery and explosives materials were used according to various reports to cut the mountains, due to which the natural balance of the place has started to deteriorate.”“We want to impress upon state government and Union of India that earning revenue is not everything. Revenue cannot be earned at the cost of the environment and ecology. If things proceed the way they are as on date, then the day is not far when the entire state of HP may vanish into thin air from the map...,” it said.“The pace of infrastructure development in Himachal has intensified in recent years, driven by the twin goals of connectivity and tourism... In many cases, hill slopes are cut steeply, unscientifically, without adequate stabilisation measures, and natural watercourses are obstructed or diverted. This not only alters the local hydrology but also makes the terrain more vulnerable to landslides and flash floods.“The 2023 and 2025 monsoon season, for example, saw widespread devastation in the Kullu, Mandi, Shimla and Chamba districts, partly attributed to such unscientific construction. Despite having been an environmentally rich state, its own people are today responsible for such blind pursuit of development, to their own detriment,” the court said.",Supreme Court expresses deep concern over uncontrolled constructions and inflow of tourists in Himachal Pradesh.

Due disclosure made to stock exchanges: Reliance ADAG

New Delhi: Enforcement Directorate on Friday put travel curbs on Reliance ADAG chief Anil Ambani by issuing a lookout circular after summoning him for questioning at the agency HQ here on Aug 5 in connection with an alleged money laundering racket involving group entities. The summons were based on findings of probes being conducted by multiple agencies.On Friday, ED searched three premises in Bhubaneswar and one in Kolkata after finding alleged evidence of Rs 68-crore fake bank guarantee provided to Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited on behalf of Reliance NU BESS Ltd/Maharashtra Energy Generation Ltd. The guarantee was generated by a shell entity registered in Bhubaneswar, allegedly linked to ADAG.Reacting to the allegations, ADAG said: ""The company and its subsidiaries acted bonafidely and have been a victim of fraud, forgery and cheating conspiracy.""In its defence, Reliance ADAG said, “The company has made a due disclosure on this to the stock exchanges on Nov 7, 2024. A criminal complaint has already been lodged with the Economic Offence Wing of Delhi Police against the third party on Oct 16, 2024.The due process of law will follow”.“Multiple undisclosed bank accounts have been detected having suspicious transactions of several crores of rupees ,” ED sources said. “Key individuals of the group have been found using Telegram app with ‘disappearing messages’ enabled, indicating attempts to conceal communication.”ED has registered a separate money laundering investigation based on an FIR registered by economic offences wing of Delhi Police in Nov 2024. Searches took place in Bhubaneswar at three premises of Biswal Tradelink and its directors and one premise of an associated operator.The Bhubaneswar entity, now being allegedly linked to Anil Ambani’s group, is a mere paper entity, which was registered at a residential property belonging to an associate, and had suspicious financial transactions with multiple companies.Sources said evidence of generating fake bank guarantees was seized during July 24 searches on ADAG companies. Officials alleged the bank guarantee of Rs 68.2 crore submitted to Solar Energy Corporation of India has been established as fake.“In an attempt to prove that this fake bank guarantee is genuine, the group used a spoofed email domain. Instead of sbi.co.in, the domain s-bi.co.in was deployed to send forged communication to SECI, impersonating SBI,” a source added. ED has sought domain registration details of s-bi.co.in from National Internet Exchange of India.", Enforcement Directorate issues lookout circular after summoning Anil Ambani for questioning.

Fewer deletions in 23 Bihar districts with big minority population

NEW DELHI: The draft roll for Bihar published by the Election Commission on Friday includes 7.24 crore electors who submitted their enumeration forms within the July 25 deadline. Bihar's electorate, as per the draft roll, is over 65.6 lakh less than its 7.9 crore strength on June 24, 2025, ahead of the onset of the special intensive revision.This figure of 65.6 lakh, made public by EC on July 27 after conclusion of the first phase of SIR, includes 22 lakh dead electors, 36 lakh permanently shifted or absent/untraceable, 7 lakh voters enrolled at more than one place and electors who did not submit their enumeration forms.As many as 15 districts have recorded a higher than state average, though not alarming, percentage of exclusions from the draft roll. These include Gopalganj (15.1%), Purnea (12.1%), Kishanganj (11.8%), Madhubani (10.4%) and Bhagalpur (10.2%). Kishanganj and Purnea are districts with allegedly high concentration of illegal migrants from Bangladesh. Kishanganj is also the only Muslim majority district in Bihar, while Purnia has over 38.4% Muslims.Interestingly, Araria and Katihar - where Muslims' share in the population is 43-44% and which also allegedly have Bangladeshi immigrant settlers - have recorded exclusions (7.6% and 8.2%) short of the state average of 8.3%.EC said any elector or party can now file claims and objections with ERO till Sept 1, seeking addition of wrongfully excluded electors or deletions of ineligible ones. From Saturday, EC will release a daily update on claims and objections.The draft roll points to an uneven pattern with 23 of the 38 districts reporting fewer deletions than the state average of 8.3%. These 23 districts include those with a notable minority population.Booth-wise draft lists of all 90,712 polling stations across all 243 assembly constituencies have been shared with all the political parties by 38 district election officers of the state.Videos of district presidents and BLAs of all parties, acknowledging receipt of the draft lists and appealing for claims and objections to be made over the next one month, against any wrongful inclusions and exclusions.EC on Friday hailed the “unprecedented participation” by Bihar’s over 7.2 crore electors who turned in their enumeration forms; and the “unparallelled, transparent and impartial teamwork” by its machinery comprising the chief electoral officer, 38 DEOs, 243 electoral registration officers (EROs), 2,976 assistant EROs, booth-level officers of 90,712 polling booths and lakhs of volunteers; apart from the 1.6 lakh booth-level agents nominated by 12 political parties of the state.The panel on Friday appealed to all eligible electors to check their names in the draft roll and, if missing, to fill and submit Form 6 with the declaration form recording their citizenship status. Young voters who turned 18 on July 1 or will become adults by Oct 1, were also told to apply through Form 6.EC on Friday reiterated that no name can be deleted from the draft roll without giving a notice, hearing the elector and subsequently passing a written order. A two-point appeal can be filed against the ERO’s decision, first with the district magistrate and then with the CEO.","The draft roll for Bihar published by the Election Commission on Friday includes 7.24 crore electors.

India’s ministry of external affairs has condemned a UK parliamentary select committee report that names India as one of 12 countries, alongside Russia, China and Iran, as allegedly involved in “transnational repression” of individuals in Britain as “baseless” and emanating from “dubious sources”.Official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Friday the claims rely “predominantly” on “proscribed entities and individuals with a clear documented history of anti-India hostility. The deliberate reliance on discredited sources calls into question the credibility of the report itself.”The report, titled “Transnational Repression in the UK”, was published on Wednesday by the Joint Human Rights Committee, made up of MPs and peers, which consider matters relating to human rights in the UK. Its members include Indian-origin peer Lord Dholakia.Page 6 states: “Our inquiry received evidence alleging that many states had conducted TNR (transnational repression) activities on UK soil. Multiple evidence submissions accused Bahrain, China, Egypt, Eritrea, India, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and UAE of perpetrating TNR in the UK.""China, Russia and Iran were highlighted as the “three most flagrant TNR perpetrators in the UK”.Written evidence submitted to the committee was also published. Those commenting on India include Sikhs for Justice, Dhal Khalsa UK, Sikh Federation UK, and the Sikh Press Association.The report said that the number of state-threat investigations run by MI5 had jumped by 48% in the last year and made recommendations on how the UK should tackle TNR, such as sanctioning perpetrators, expelling diplomats, and taking TNR into account when making international trade partnerships.Former UK security minister Tom Tugendhat told TOI: “This report makes no statement against India. It merely records that evidence was given by a group that has long been hostile to India. As security minister, this conversation on TNR was not a conversation I ever had to have either with the India high commission, or our friends in the Indian govt, or the Indian agencies that we worked with very closely, for the security of all of our people. ”“The report does not suggest that India is doing it. It just states they received evidence about India. That doesn’t mean the committee believes it,” sources told TOI. “You can refuse to admit the evidence, but the bar for doing that is really high. Sikhs for Justice is not proscribed in the UK.”","India's ministry of external affairs has condemned a UK parliamentary select committee report.

NEW DELHI: Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia has launched a new video series titled “Education Systems of the World and India”, aiming to raise awareness about the importance of quality education in national development.In the first episode, released on Friday, Sisodia compared India’s education system with those of countries such as Japan, Singapore, China, Canada and Finland arguing that these nations achieved global progress by prioritising education reforms.Drawing on international examples, he noted that Singapore, despite gaining independence nearly two decades after India is now among the world's wealthiest nations. He attributed this transformation was possible there due to country's robust education system. Similarly, he pointed to Japan’s early national commitment to education, China’s emphasis on hard work in schools, Canada’s inclusive and diverse approach and Finland’s investment in teacher training and child-centric learning as models worth studying.The series, he said, was inspired by a public conversation he had with Grok AI on education.“Millions of people read our chat, asked questions, and offered suggestions. There was a deep curiosity about how the world educates its children and where India stands in comparison. That interest has motivated me to start this series.”Sisodia argued that for India to achieve meaningful change, education must become a central political priority. “India will only change when its education changes, and education will only change when the thinking of our leaders changes. If their thinking doesn’t change -- change the leaders,” Sisodia said.He also cautioned against blindly copying other countries’ models, stressing the need for India to build an education system suited to its unique social and economic context.“We are India. Our needs and ground realities are different. The country will change only when education changes,"" he added.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia has launched a new video series.

That’s how Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux), India’s newest spacefarer, described his mission in his first interaction after returning from the International Space Station (ISS).Shux, who flew to space in a multinational private mission led by Axiom Space in collaboration with Nasa and SpaceX, marked India’s return to human spaceflight after 41 years. “It wasn’t a solitary leap. It was the beginning of India’s second orbit. And this time, we are ready, not just to fly, but to lead,” he said.For India, this was more than a symbolic milestone. It was also a rehearsal. PM Modi had asked Shukla to document every aspect of his journey, a detailed assignment meant to feed into the Gaganyaan programme, India’s first human spaceflight mission. “I’ve done that very well,” Shukla said, promising that the knowledge gained will prove “invaluable” for Gaganyaan.Over his 20-day mission, Shukla carried out a suite of Indian science experiments, ranging from stem cell studies to microgravity demonstrations. “I saw stem cells behave in unexpectedly positive ways in space. It was science in motion, 400km above the planet,” he said.Not all of it was lab work. One of his most talked-about microgravity demonstrations involved trapping a bubble inside a bubble — an effort that turned into a group mission with fellow astronauts, drawing laughs and attention on Earth.“Doing science in space is fun as well as challenging,” Shukla said.He emphasised how this flight was as much about inspiring India’s youth as it was about technical validation. “The most common question I got from students was, ‘How do I become an astronaut?’ That’s the real success of this mission. We are halfway there. The rest is just enabling.”To foster that curiosity, the crew conducted live STEM sessions from orbit. But the impact wasn’t just educational — it was emotional. “The messages, the love, the support from every corner of India filled me with something unexpected, a new kind of purpose,” he said.Shukla also reflected on the physiological experience of spaceflight. “Leaving Earth’s gravity showed me how deeply our bodies are shaped by it. After 40 years of living in gravity, adjusting to microgravity was strange. Then coming back, the same phone in my hand felt heavy.” He recounted how even simple tasks like standing or walking needed relearning. “Thankfully, the rehabilitation programme works. Within days, I felt normal again—ready for another mission. ”Humour tinged some of his stories. He recalled waking up one morning after returning, closing his laptop, and letting it fall — instinctively expecting it to float. “Thankfully, the floor was carpeted.”Asked about his biggest learning, Shukla spoke not about any one moment, but the entire machinery behind the mission. “People from across time zones and cultures came together to make 20 days in space possible. That scale of collaboration is what stays with me most.”Just before splashdown, he and Hungarian astronaut Tibor Kapu watched pink and orange plasma streak across the window as their capsule “Grace” re-entered Earth’s atmosphere. We were watching the screen show 1g and feeling it get heavy—by 1.8g we were already struggling,” said Kapu. “But it was beautiful.”And then there was Earth itself. Shukla said the view defied all expectations. “There are no borders, no demarcations. It is all our home. The sense of oneness was very strong,” he reiterated.For a country preparing its own independent crewed mission, these are not just reflections, they are building blocks. As Shux said: “This is only the beginning.”",Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux) is India's newest spacefarer.

What's the case about?

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday summoned industrialist Anil Ambani on August 5 in loan fraud case amid probe over bribery, unsecured loans allegations.Ambani, 66, has been asked to depose at the ED headquarters in Delhi as the case has been registered here, sources told news agency PTI.The agency will record his statement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) once he deposes, they said.Meanwhile, the agency is conducting search in Bhubaneshwar and Kolkata in connections with fake bank guarantee racket.""The agency recorded an ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report) based on a case registered by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police dated November 11, 2024 in the matter,"" officials said.This comes days after the central probing agency conducted simultaneous raids in connection of financial irregularities and collective loan ""diversion"" of more than Rs 10,000 crore by multiple group companies of Ambani.ED sources had said the investigation primarily pertains to allegations of illegal loan diversion of around Rs 3,000 crore, given by the Yes Bank to the group companies of Ambani between 2017-2019.Officials said that searches were done at over 35 locations in Mumbai, covering 50 companies and 25 individuals under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).A Delhi-based ED unit is spearheading the investigation.The agency is probing alleged improper diversion of approximately Rs 3,000 crore in loans, granted by Yes Bank to Ambani's group companies between 2017 and 2019. In reaction to the raids, Reliance Power and Reliance Infrastructure issued clarification letters to the exchanges.According to officials, multiple agencies, including the National Housing Bank, SEBI, National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), and Bank of Baroda, have shared relevant information with the ED.Officials told that “ED has found gross violations in Yes Bank loan approvals to RAAGA companies,” including backdated Credit Approval Memorandums, lack of due diligence, and breaches of the bank’s credit policies. The loans were allegedly diverted to multiple group and shell companies.Red flags identified include loans to entities with weak financials, shared addresses and directors, poor documentation, and evergreening of loans. Officials also noted, “SEBI is also learnt to have shared its findings with ED in the case of RHFL.”The searches at premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off, including outside the country, through ""undisclosed foreign bank accounts and foreign assets"" created over the years.A large chunk of the money came to Reliance ADAG from SBI and other public sector banks, besides Yes Bank, then a private entity, and mutual funds.Preliminary investigation has thrown up a mysterious entity: 'C Company'. The entity, whose existence was not known so far, is allegedly found to have been involved in related party transactions in this whole scam, sources said.","Ambani, 66, has been asked to depose at the ED headquarters in Delhi as the case has been registered here.

Technological advancement races forward, transforming how we work and live

Geopolitical instability simultaneously threatens physical safety and economic security





Silicon Valley has always been synonymous with innovation, wealth, and futuristic vision. Yet behind the glossy façade of AI breakthroughs and billion-dollar valuations lies an unexpected trend: tech giants quietly building bunkers. From OpenAI CEO Sam Altman , who revealed having a heavily reinforced underground basement, to billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos investing in fortified hideouts, survival planning is becoming the new status symbol. These bunkers are not for science-fiction AI apocalypses but for real-world threats—global conflict, pandemics, cyberwarfare, and climate disasters.As geopolitical tensions rise and social unrest becomes a growing concern, tech elites are preparing for worst-case scenarios with luxury shelters equipped with renewable energy, air-filtration systems, hydroponic farms, and even theaters. This trend reflects a sobering shift: while these leaders are shaping humanity’s technological future, they’re also investing heavily to ensure their own survival when society’s stability is at risk.During the podcast, Von casually asked about bunkers, leading Altman to admit, “I have, like, underground concrete, heavy reinforcement basements… but I don’t have something I would call a bunker.” Von jokingly responded, “That’s a bunker, dude,” highlighting how little difference there is between the two.Altman went on to explain that he has been considering building an even more robust bunker-like structure—not because of AI concerns, but because “people are dropping bombs in the world again. ”This statement underscores a crucial point: the fear of war and social collapse is not limited to average citizens. Even those leading technological innovation and reshaping industries are preparing for scenarios that feel increasingly possible in today’s volatile geopolitical climate.The 21st century has seen a resurgence of Cold War-like tensions, with military conflicts, regional wars, and nuclear threats back in public discourse. For tech leaders, whose companies depend on global connectivity and stable markets, the risk of war disrupting supply chains, communications, or even cities themselves is real. Events like the war in Ukraine, escalating U.S.–China trade tensions, and concerns over weapons of mass destruction have amplified fears of sudden instability. Bunkers provide a secure refuge during political or military crises, ensuring safety when normal governance and security might fail. For many CEOs, contingency planning is now as important as innovation strategy.Rising sea levels, extreme heat waves, prolonged droughts, and stronger hurricanes threaten not just infrastructure but basic resources like food and water. Silicon Valley elites often view these risks as long-term inevitabilities rather than abstract possibilities. Building self-sufficient shelters—with renewable energy, water purification systems, and food production facilities—allows them to survive environmental disasters without relying on strained public infrastructure or disrupted supply chains.Modern society runs on interconnected systems: power grids, banking, internet, and logistics. A single large-scale cyberattack or infrastructure failure can cripple economies and trigger chaos within hours. For those leading global technology companies, this threat is personal as well as professional. Bunkers equipped with independent power, secure communication, and physical barriers offer a fallback when external systems fail or are compromised.COVID-19 exposed vulnerabilities in even the most advanced nations—panic buying, supply shortages, overwhelmed healthcare systems, and widespread economic shutdowns. For tech leaders, who witnessed these disruptions firsthand, the lesson was clear: future pandemics or biological crises could be more severe. Bunkers serve as safe, isolated environments that reduce exposure to infectious diseases while ensuring access to essential resources during prolonged lockdowns or travel bans.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, revealed in a podcast with Theo Von (This Past Weekend, 2025) that his home includes a reinforced underground basement designed for safety during global conflict rather than AI catastrophes. While he doesn’t call it a “bunker,” it features heavy concrete reinforcement—similar to traditional fallout shelters as reported by Theo Von Podcast, This Past Weekend, 2025. Altman’s admission gave a rare public peek into the hidden world of elite contingency planning.Reports indicate that Mark Zuckerberg has built private shelters within his Hawaiian estate, equipped with advanced security systems. Hawaiian isolation and sustainable living make it a strategic choice for emergency readiness as reported by Forbes.Jeff Bezos owns remote properties rumored to include fortified facilities with off-grid power, advanced security, and self-sufficiency features, ensuring operation even during natural disasters or social unrest as per reports by Vanity Fair, 2024.A wave of tech executives and venture capitalists are investing in luxury bunkers in New Zealand, praised for its geographic isolation and political stability. Companies like Rising S and Vivos Group specialize in elite underground shelters there as per Bloomberg, 2022 reports.– Backup systems like Tesla Powerwalls and wind turbines keep these bunkers running independent of public infrastructure.– Capable of removing biological, chemical, and radioactive contaminants, ensuring breathable air and clean water.– Indoor, soil-free farming for self-sustaining food production, ensuring fresh greens even in lockdown scenarios.– Mini-clinics and encrypted communications keep residents healthy and connected.– High-end gyms, spas, swimming pools, and private cinemas make bunkers comfortable for long-term habitation, not just survival.Altman’s “not-a-bunker” is more than just a quirky personal choice—it’s a symbol of our current age. We live in a world where:Even the innovators of the digital era feel compelled to prepare for analog dangers like war, unrest, and infrastructure collapseWhile AI and future technologies aim to solve complex global challenges, human vulnerabilities remain a pressing reality—leading even visionaries like Altman to build for worst-case scenarios.This shift also sparks a moral dilemma—should the elite prepare to outlive society, or reinvest in its resilience? As bunkers grow in sophistication, the question isn't just what they're hiding from—but what kind of future they’re building toward. These hidden shelters reveal as much about fear as they do about foresight, raising uncomfortable questions about who gets to survive—and who gets left behind.","Silicon Valley has always been synonymous with innovation, wealth, and futuristic vision.

"'Limited direct impact from US tariffs': Fitch revises India GDP forecast to 6.3% for FY26; infrastructure spending, local demand seen supporting key sectors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/limited-direct-impact-from-us-tariffs-fitch-revises-india-gdp-forecast-to-6-3-for-fy26-infrastructure-spending-local-demand-seen-supporting-key-sectors/articleshow/123048853.cms,"Fitch Ratings has revised India’s GDP growth projection for the current financial year down to 6.3%, from its earlier estimate of 6.4%, while stating that the recently announced US tariffs are likely to have only a limited direct effect on Indian corporates.In its latest India Corporates Credit Trends report released Friday, the global rating agency said it expects robust infrastructure spending to sustain demand across core sectors, PTI reported.“We expect India’s GDP growth of 6.3 per cent and robust infrastructure spending to underpin healthy demand for cement and building materials, electricity, petroleum products, steel, and engineering and construction (E&C) companies during FY26,” Fitch noted.The revised forecast comes months after the agency projected 6.4% GDP growth in its Global Economic Outlook report published in April.Despite the macroeconomic adjustment, Fitch anticipates credit metrics for rated Indian corporates to improve in FY26. Wider EBITDA margins are expected to offset the effects of high capital expenditure, it added.On the impact of the 25% US tariffs recently announced by President Donald Trump—along with a penalty targeting Indian trade ties with Russia—Fitch said the direct impact on rated Indian corporates would likely remain limited, owing to low-to-moderate exposure to US exports.However, the report cautioned about potential “second-order risks” arising from global excess supply. Fitch also noted that an eventual India-US trade agreement may alter outcomes, and companies are likely to explore export diversification to mitigate the tariff shock.India and the US are in the midst of negotiations for a bilateral trade deal. According to reports, New Delhi has taken a firm stance against Washington’s demand for duty concessions on agriculture and dairy products—sectors where India has traditionally offered no preferential tariffs in any FTA.Fitch said that sectors focused on the domestic market—such as upstream and downstream oil & gas, cement and building materials, telecom, utilities, and engineering and construction—should see minimal tariff-related disruptions due to strong local demand and regulatory insulation.In contrast, Fitch highlighted that tariff uncertainty may dampen discretionary exports in IT services and automotive components to the US and Europe during FY26. Pharmaceuticals could also be vulnerable to policy changes from the US side.Additionally, the report said that steel and chemicals may face pricing pressure from oversupplied global markets, while the metals and mining sector could experience higher price volatility due to emerging global growth risks.","Fitch Ratings has revised India’s GDP growth projection for the current financial year down to 6.3%, from its earlier estimate of 6.4%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 451 points, or 1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sank 1.6%, AP reported.The sharp market reaction followed a disappointing July employment report from the Labor Department, which showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs during the month — far below economist forecasts. Revisions also slashed 258,000 jobs from May and June figures, further dampening sentiment.Bond yields fell sharply as expectations of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve surged. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.24% from 4.39%, while the two-year yield, which closely tracks Fed policy outlook, plunged to 3.73% from 3.94%.Markets are now pricing in an 80.9% chance of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's September policy meeting, according to CME FedWatch data — up from under 38% a day earlier.“The Fed may see a clearer path to a September cut, especially if upcoming data confirms this trend,” said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. “What had looked like a Teflon labor market showed some scratches this morning, as tariffs continue to work their way through the economy.”President Trump’s move to again delay the effective date of his proposed import tariffs — now set to kick in on August 7 for dozens of countries that haven’t yet reached deals with the US — added to the market volatility. Businesses have warned that the unpredictable rollout of these tariffs is complicating financial forecasts and squeezing margins.Walmart and Procter & Gamble are among major firms that have cited higher costs due to import duties, with concerns that price hikes may ultimately be passed on to US consumers.Tech stocks bore the brunt of Friday’s selloff. Amazon.com shares tumbled 7.7% despite strong quarterly results, as investors focused on slowing growth in its cloud unit. Apple also declined 1.8% despite topping profit and revenue expectations. Both firms face increased exposure to tariff-related headwinds.Energy major Exxon Mobil fell 1.7% after reporting its lowest profit in four years, weighed by lower oil prices amid rising OPEC+ output.Global markets mirrored the US selloff.

Meanwhile, workers more broadly appear hesitant to switch jobs, with many believing the current market reflects peak employment opportunities.That perception is gaining weight as hiring momentum wanes across most sectors, marking a sharp reversal from the post-pandemic surge when employers wooed talent with signing bonuses, flexible schedules, and even pet insurance.The latest US Labor Department employment report, due Friday (US time), is expected to show a gain of 115,000 new jobs in July, according to a FactSet survey of analysts. Though not weak, this would trail both June’s 147,000 additions and last year’s monthly trend. So far in 2024, the economy has added an average of 130,000 jobs per month- down 23 per cent from 2023 and 68 per cent below the 2021–2023 recovery period.Economists say several forces are driving this cooling: the Federal Reserve’s high interest rates to curb inflation, President Donald Trump’s newly reinstated import tariffs, and fears of declining international labour supply under looming deportation plans.“The labour market is poised for a summer slowdown as businesses put hiring plans on hold but refrain from broad-based layoffs,” Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, wrote this week, quoted by AP. “We see job growth slowing well below trend in the coming months.”Despite this, job security remains relatively strong. The national unemployment rate stands at 4.1 per cent, while unemployment benefit applications remain in a normal range.But that headline figure masks disparities. “A low unemployment rate and a muted pace of layoffs mask underlying weakness,” said Adam Schickling, senior economist at Vanguard. “The health of the job market can be a matter of perspective. If you're a nurse, prospects are excellent—the unemployment rate for experienced health care practitioners is under 2 per cent. But for young people or older workers re-entering the market, opportunities may appear scarce. ”The voluntary resignation rate—a key sign of worker confidence—has also dropped below pre-pandemic levels.Employment growth is now largely confined to a few sectors. Of the 644,000 private-sector jobs added in 2024, around 405,000- over 63 per cent- have come from healthcare and social assistance alone.Young entrants and returning workers are struggling most amid fewer openings and longer job hunts. The number of discouraged workers—those who have stopped looking because they believe no jobs are available- rose by 256,000 in June to 637,000, according to the Labor Department.“Historically, a drop in hiring has come with a spike in layoffs, a one-two punch that pushes up unemployment,” said Schickling. “Today’s labour market is defying that pattern.”Part of the explanation lies in the shrinking role of manufacturing, where companies once made sweeping headcount cuts. “There’s simply less headcount to cut,” he added.Ultimately, the job market appears to be softening—not collapsing. “Firms are pulling back on hiring without shedding existing workers in significant numbers,” Schickling noted. “The result is a gradual slowdown, not a sharp downturn.”","Recent graduates are among the worst affected.

'Trump Cannot Dictate': Putin & His Top Ally Unite Against U.S. Over Ukraine Ultimatum | FULL SPEECH





US President Donald Trump on Friday dismissed bureau of labor statistics (BLS) commissioner Erika McEntarfer, just hours after the agency released a weaker-than-expected July jobs report.In a post on Truth Social, he accused Erika McEntarfer, a Biden appointee, of manipulating employment figures for political purposes.“I was just informed that our Country’s “Jobs Numbers” are being produced by a Biden Appointee, Dr Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, who faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala’s chances of Victory,” he wrote in his post.“This is the same Bureau of Labor Statistics that overstated the Jobs Growth in March 2024 by approximately 818,000 and, then again, right before the 2024 Presidential Election, in August and September, by 112,000. These were Records — No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified,” he added.The BLS reported a gain of just 73,000 nonfarm jobs in July—well below market expectations. The agency also revised job gains for May and June downward by a combined 258,000, bringing the three-month average to just 35,000.It was the steepest two-month revision since April 2020, acccording to CNBC News.“McEntarfer said there were only 73,000 Jobs added (a shock!) but, more importantly, that a major mistake was made by them, 258,000 Jobs downward, in the prior two months. Similar things happened in the first part of the year, always to the negative,” Trump wrote.Shortly after the recent post, Trump issued another statement on Truth Social, doubling down on his claim that the numbers were manipulated.""In my opinion, today’s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad — Just like when they had three great days around the 2024 Presidential Election, and then, those numbers were “taken away” on November 15, 2024, right after the Election, when the Jobs Numbers were massively revised DOWNWARD, making a correction of over 818,000 Jobs — A TOTAL SCAM. Jerome “Too Late” Powell is no better! But, the good news is, our Country is doing GREAT!"" Trump said.NBC News confirmed McEntarfer’s dismissal. The BLS, under the department of labor, has not commented. Labor secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a Trump appointee, oversees the agency.Trump and congressional Republicans have long criticized the BLS, particularly over large data revisions. In this year’s budget proposal, Trump called for an 8% staffing cut at the agency, raising concerns about the quality and reliability of its economic data.The weak jobs report triggered a market sell-off, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling more than 500 points and the Nasdaq dropping over 2%. Treasury yields also declined.Trump also renewed his attacks on federal reserve chair Jerome Powell.""The Economy is BOOMING under “TRUMP” despite a Fed that also plays games, this time with Interest Rates, where they lowered them twice, and substantially, just before the Presidential Election, I assume in the hopes of getting “Kamala” elected – How did that work out? He wrote.“Jerome “Too Late” Powell should also be put “out to pasture.”The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged this week, but Friday’s weak jobs data has increased expectations of a possible rate cut in September.","US President Donald Trump dismissed bureau of labor statistics (BLS) commissioner Erika McEntarfer.

Who is Mira Murati?

Thinking Machines Lab: a startup with billion-dollar belief

Why Murati’s team said no to Meta

A name to watch in AI’s future





Mira Murati, the Albanian-American tech visionary behind some of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, is once again in the spotlight—this time for turning down an eye-watering $1 billion offer from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . As the former CTO of OpenAI and now the founder of the AI startup Thinking Machines Lab, Murati has become one of the most influential figures in the global AI race. Her team's unanimous rejection of Meta’s massive offer speaks volumes about their confidence in her leadership and their belief in the startup’s long-term vision.Before launching Thinking Machines Lab, Mira Murati served as the chief technology officer at OpenAI, one of the most influential positions in the modern AI world. During her tenure, she played a pivotal role in leading the development of groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Codex—systems that have since transformed the way people interact with artificial intelligence. She also oversaw OpenAI's deployment of safety protocols that became foundational to industry-wide AI governance frameworks. Her work helped bring generative AI into the mainstream, sparking a global wave of innovation across industries from education and healthcare to design and coding.Murati wasn’t just a technical leader—she was a strategic visionary. At OpenAI, she emphasized the importance of safety, alignment, and responsible development, pushing the organization to think deeply about the societal impact of powerful AI systems.Internally, she earned the reputation of being the “AI brain” behind OpenAI’s most ambitious projects, praised for her calm, focused demeanor and her ability to guide multidisciplinary teams through intense periods of innovation. She was instrumental in assembling the original alignment teams, ensuring ethical considerations were baked into product design from the earliest stages. Murati once remarked, “We don’t just code intelligence—we craft responsibility,” a phrase that has since become a rallying cry for ethical AI development. Her combination of engineering precision and human-centered thinking set the stage for her next bold move: founding her own AI company.In early 2025, she delivered a keynote at the World Economic Forum in Davos, warning that “AI without values is intelligence without conscience,” sparking international dialogue on AI ethics and sovereignty. She’s also been advising the European Commission on emerging AI regulatory frameworks, a rare role for a startup founder. Her ability to bridge the worlds of deep tech and global policy has made her one of the few technologists shaping both the tools and the laws that will define this century. Her growing influence in policy circles signals that she’s not just building AI—but helping shape the rules by which it will operate.Founded in early 2025, Thinking Machines Lab has rapidly emerged as one of the most-watched AI startups. Despite not launching a single product yet, the company recently raised a stunning $2 billion seed round at a valuation nearing $12 billion, led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup’s goal: to create customizable, interpretable, and widely accessible AI systems that could redefine the AI landscape. Industry insiders say the company’s stealth mode only adds to its mystique. With Murati at the helm, expectations are sky-high for what comes next.According to a Wired report, Zuckerberg's Meta offered some of Murati’s team members compensation packages ranging from $200 million to $1 billion to join its newly launched Superintelligence Lab. But every single offer was turned down. Sources say the Thinking Machines Lab team believes their equity in the startup has the potential to be worth far more—and more importantly, they value their independence and Murati’s vision over big-tech paychecks.In a tech industry where massive paydays often drive decisions, the loyalty displayed by Murati’s team stands out. The rejection of Meta’s lucrative offers highlights their belief in the startup’s mission and long-term potential. Their decision also reflects a broader shift in tech culture—one where founders and engineers alike are prioritizing purpose, values, and trust over headline-making payouts. Many observers also note that the chance to help shape AI’s future from the ground up, without the constraints of a corporate giant, is a rare and meaningful opportunity—one Murati has worked hard to create.Mira Murati’s leadership has already been recognized worldwide—she was featured in Time’s 100 Most Influential People in AI (2024) and Fortune’s 100 Most Powerful Women in Business (2023). With Thinking Machines Lab gaining momentum and Meta's billion-dollar offers rebuffed, Murati has solidified her place not just as a builder of AI—but as a shaper of its future. She has become a quiet icon of resistance against the centralization of AI power—choosing to innovate outside the usual corporate echo chambers.",Mira Murati is the founder of AI startup Thinking Machines Lab.

ESPN has officially cut ties with Hall of Fame tight end and media personality Shannon Sharpe. The announcement came just days after Sharpe quietly settled a $50 million lawsuit filed by his ex-girlfriend, alleging rape and sexual assault. Though Sharpe had been absent from ESPN broadcasts since April, this formal separation signals a sharp turn in his professional trajectory.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Shannon Sharpe has an estimated net worth of $30 million. While exact figures from his ESPN salary remain undisclosed, industry analysts speculate that his compensation was likely in the high eight-figure range. Some reports even suggested his earnings could rival Stephen A. Smith’s, whose deals reportedly range from $12 to $20 million annually.Sharpe's leverage came from his cross-platform success, as his podcast ventures consistently trended and expanded his audience far beyond traditional sports media. Even without ESPN, his influence – and income stream – remain substantial.Once hailed as one of the greatest tight ends to ever play in the NFL, Shannon Sharpe built a résumé that earned him a first-ballot induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011.Across 14 seasons, he shattered records at his position – 815 receptions, over 10,000 receiving yards, and 62 touchdowns – although those benchmarks have since been surpassed.Sharpe’s career began at Savannah State and flourished after the Denver Broncos selected him in the 7th round of the 1990 NFL Draft. Despite his low draft status, he quickly rose to prominence, spending nine seasons with Denver before moving to the Baltimore Ravens in 2000. That same year, Sharpe signed a four-year, $13.8 million deal – a significant contract at the time — and helped lead the Ravens to a dominant Super Bowl XXXV win.He returned to the Broncos in 2002 with a seven-year, $16 million contract, retiring just a year later. Although his NFL earnings of $22.3 million may not stand out in today’s financial climate, he was among the better-compensated tight ends of his era.Off the field, Shannon Sharpe remained a dynamic presence in the media. His popular shows, Club Shay Shay and Nightcap with Chad Ochocinco, continued to build his brand independently. These ventures arguably amplified his bargaining power within ESPN, making his exit all the more significant. It will be seen closely who replaced Sharpe at ESPN now.A: Shannon Sharpe's estimated net worth stands at $30 million.A: ESPN ended ties shortly after Sharpe settled a $50 million lawsuit filed by his ex-girlfriend.A: Club Shay Shay and Nightcap with Chad Ochocinco.Also Read: Tom Brady blames football sacrifices for family rift in emotional letter, takes veiled shot at Gisele Bündchen","ESPN has officially cut ties with Hall of Fame tight end and media personality Shannon Sharpe.
