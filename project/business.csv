Holm criticized Germany's uncontrolled migration, highlighting the need for regulated, law-abiding immigrants. AfD aims to enhance Germany's economic attractiveness through lower taxes, investment in infrastructure, and reduced bureaucracy while ensuring cultural integration.

Germany’s most controversial rightwing party, Alternative for

Germany

(AfD)

was invited to accompany Chancellor Scholz’s ongoing visit to India. But

Leif-Erik

Holm

,

Opposition Member of the Bundestag and AfD’s economic advisor, had to pull out due to illness. In an exclusive interview to

Padma

Rao Sundarji

from Germany for

Times of India Online,

Holm talked about why AfD’s popularity is growing so rapidly, Germany’s problem with illegal immigration, its good experience with migrants from India and why his country needs Indians so urgently.

Leif-Erik Holm, your party is described as a “far-right”, “right-wing” and “populist” in the mainstream media around the world, including in India. They say your party opposes the migration of foreigners to Germany, especially of Muslims. Is that a fair description of AfD, or do you want to offer a better one?

Your party was democratically elected to three crucial Länder (state) parliaments in eastern Germany earlier this year. We assume there was no rigging of the vote. Yet, other parties refuse to form coalitions with AfD. In fact, they want the AfD banned. Interestingly, even Germany’s Central Council of Jews spoke against any such ban. Why are you hated so much, both by the German media as well as all mainstream political parties?

In February 2024, there were around 137,000 Indians working in skilled positions in Germany. Chancellor Scholz and a huge delegation are here to attract more Indian IT engineers, nurses and caregivers to migrate to Germany. But many Indians fear racism, specifically at the hands of the AfD, and the neo-Nazi groups who claim to be your supporters and enjoy your support too. Indians have been attacked by such goons. What is your party’s stand on Indian migration to Germany ?

The world’s third largest Muslim population lives in India. Among the talent Germany seeks, are many highly educated Indian Muslims too. But some Indian Muslims are conservative, even wear the

hijab.

There are no problems in India -it is viewed as their choice. But given the AfD’s reluctance to allow conservative Muslims into your country, how will you tackle this conundrum? Surely a democracy like Germany can’t screen applications by religion?

Set aside the liberal media. There are dozens of personal accounts on Youtube by young Indians in Germany. They say they don’t feel culturally accepted, that they often get racial slurs hurled at them, that people -especially in eastern Germany -expect them to speak perfect German -which takes at least a decade to learn, that they get sidelined in favour of white English job-seekers, even for jobs that require English. What do you say to them?

As an economist yourself, why do you think Germany, an industrial giant and an economic superpower, is in such bad shape today?

It was German Economics Minister

Robert Habeck

(Green Party) who invited you to come along to India – specifically to attend the to Asia Pacific Conference of German businesses (APK) in New Delhi. You have lampooned Mr Habeck’s economic policies fiercely. Is that the real reason why you stayed home ? Surely Germany’s economic crisis cannot be attributed to Germany’s current coalition government alone?

You have also criticized the German government’s proposal to lower taxes for foreign migrants. Perhaps this is intended to make migration to Germany even more attractive. So if AfD, too, wants more Indian migrants, why are you slamming this incentive?

What do you think Mr Habeck should focus on while here, given Germany’s interest in both Indian migration, but also in selling in products – especially weapons – to India?

What are your closing words for thousands of Indians who are still streaming to relatively safe and well-known domains like the United States? How will you encourage them to come to Germany instead ? And should migrating Indians do, to ‘integrate’ successfully into German society?

Holm: The labels that are attached to my party are just as inaccurate as the claim that the AfD generally rejects the immigration of foreigners. We are a conservative party with a strong liberal orientation. What we reject is unrestricted illegal immigration, which completely overburdens our country, our society and our social systems. On the other hand, anyone who comes to us legally, integrates, provides for themselves and contributes to Germany's prosperity, is welcome.Holm: The AfD is a thorn in the side of established parties and the mainstream media, because they fear for their positions and their money pots. They are afraid of losing the power they believed to be secure. And rightly so. Because the citizens are voting for us out of conviction, because they want a different policy that finally puts their concerns at the centre of action. A policy that takes care of the interests of its own citizens first. The AfD does that, and that is precisely why more and more people are voting for us.Holm: The AfD does not support neo-Nazi groups and is not supported by such groups. These are simply malicious claims that have no basis whatsoever. Let me make this clear: We are a conservative-liberal party; there is no room for extremists in our organisation. Genuinely skilled workers are very welcome here, whether in the service sector, the IT industry, the nursing sector or elsewhere. Germany has had good experiences with the immigration of skilled labour from India so far. On average, they are well educated (16 per cent specialist level, 37 per cent expert level) and have a low unemployment rate (3.7 per cent). The fear of racism is unfounded and is probably due to the distorted picture painted by some left-leaning media. On the other hand, real skilled workers are put off by the high tax and duty burden in Germany, the bureaucracy, the housing shortage, the deteriorating education system and the growing crime rate as a result of uncontrolled mass migration from the Arab and African regions.Holm: The free practice of religion is a fundamental right in Germany and applies to all people. But of course we also have a guiding culture that defines our country. And that is not Muslim. We expect immigrants from other cultures to accept and adapt to our values and not try to impose their culture on us. Of course, Muslims are free to wear a headscarf. But women must not be forced to do so, and such a religious symbol has no place in the civil service either. Nobody is forced to eat pork in our country, but it is also not acceptable for Muslims to demand a ban on pork for all pupils in cafeterias, for example, or that Christian festivals should no longer be celebrated. If you want to live according to the principles of Sharia law, you have to immigrate to a country where it applies. In Germany, the Basic Law applies.Holm: That the reticence with which some citizens in Germany react to immigrants from other cultures is not automatically meant in a derogatory way. Germany isn’t a classic immigration country like the USA, for example, and so it sometimes takes a little longer for people to warm up to each other. The main problem, however, is that Germans have had bad experiences with uncontrolled mass migration. There are too many illegal immigrants who become criminals and commit the most serious crimes. There are gang rapes, gang crime, drug crime, and the perpetrators are mostly foreigners. This naturally gives rise to prejudices, from which even the righteous immigrants suffer. It was and is a serious mistake on the part of former Chancellor Angela Merkel and now Chancellor Olaf Scholz , to allow this to go on for years. We need to control and regulate immigration. This will also facilitate the integration of those immigrants who abide by the law, who are hard-working and who contribute to society.Holm: The German government's disastrous economic policy has led to Germany being the only leading industrialised nation with no economic growth. We are in recession for the second year in a row. We are the sick man of Europe. Meanwhile, everyone else around us is growing, everyone else is coping better with the same problems such as the consequences of the war in Ukraine, the coronavirus crisis and the global market. This shows that our weakness is home-made. We have far too high a tax and duty burden, a non-functioning energy transition has caused energy prices to explode and made us uncompetitive. Bureaucracy is overburdening companies and citizens, the costs of the social systems are out of control, which is why there is a lack of investment in infrastructure and digitalisation. All of this has led to more and more companies in Germany giving up, or moving abroad, where they find better framework conditions.Holm: We, in AfD, are in favour of the social market economy that has made our country great, while Mr Habeck is a friend of the planned economy. We think that the economy needs freedom. Mr Habeck is in favour of redistribution and would rather put companies on a leash. But no, that doesn’t stop us from getting on a plane together. I would have loved to be there -unfortunately, I fell ill.Holm: The planned tax rebate for foreign skilled workers is a slap in the face for all hard-working citizens in Germany. We cannot degrade the many Germans who get up early every day and work for far too little net income, to second-class taxpayers. That is absurd. We say that relief is needed, but for everyone.Holm: Mr Habeck should make it clear that we are a reliable trading partner whose products stand for the highest quality. And that both Germany and India benefit from close economic relations. Mr Habeck should act accordingly, as a trading partner and not as a teacher. The economy must take centre stage, not green climate ideology.Holm: Germany is a great country that is unfortunately currently badly governed. We as the AfD want to change this and ensure that Germany becomes attractive and strong again. For German citizens, hundreds of thousands of whom are currently emigrating, and also for real skilled workers from abroad. This means lower duties and taxes, especially on energy, more investment in infrastructure and digitalisation and a consistent reduction in bureaucracy. We want to make Germany fit again as a business location. And anyone who wants to lend a hand is welcome.","Leif-Erik Holm from AfD addresses misconceptions about his party's stance on immigration, emphasizing a conservative-liberal approach welcoming skilled workers.

"On Finding Dignity in Defeat, Humility in Victory",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-finding-dignity-in-defeat-humility-in-victory/articleshow/114589679.cms,"Thirukkural

with the Times explores real-world

lessons

from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

After Abdul Kalam, it was probably Ratan Tata ’s passing that stirred the nation to this extent. Two days after his demise, I was journeying through a small city, where I was struck by the sight of giant hoardings displaying Tata's ever-smiling face. The people mourned not just the loss of a business tycoon, but of a man whose humility and benevolence touched lives.Much has been written and spoken about Ratan Tata’s humility, courtesy, and gentle nature. I was a witness myself. During the mid-90s, I often travelled to my bank’s branch in Mumbai. On one such occasion, I noticed Ratan Tata standing in the long queue before a teller. I went to the branch manager to report the visit of the VIP, but was told Tata would deny any special treatment. I was left speechless, having witnessed many customers preferring special treatment at all times.Amidst such people, Tata stood out. He progressed through the queue, exchanged pleasantries with other customers and the teller, and left after his transaction was completed.Tata’s life was filled with moments where he prioritised what truly mattered. In February 2018, Prince Charles wished to honour the tycoon with a lifetime achievement award for philanthropy at Buckingham Palace. Tata accepted the invitation but later informed the prince that he would not be attending. One of his beloved dogs, either Tango or Tito, was gravely ill. His priorities were clear, and he was unapologetic about them.But there is more to his story than humility—he also knew how to rise above challenges, even in the face of humiliation.It was the year 1999, and Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle division was performing poorly, leading the company to consider selling it to Ford Motors. Ratan Tata, along with his senior leadership team, travelled to Detroit to negotiate the deal. However, the meeting took a sour turn when Ford executives reportedly scorned Tata's foray into the car business. The team returned without the deal.And yet, from that moment, Tata Motors rose like a phoenix. A decade later, in a stunning turn of events, Tata acquired Ford’s Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) for $2.3 billion, and Bill Ford, chairman, acknowledged it as a significant deal for JLR.Humiliations, like demons, often burrow into our soul, gnawing at our confidence. The only true way to banish them is through growth—rising above the circumstances and the people who caused the hurt. But in doing so, one must rise with grace, so that even those who wronged us may benefit from our success.I have always imagined Valluvar’s best lines came through a dialogue between him and his disciples. I pictured a scene at his gurukulam. A disciple asked, “Master, how should we conduct ourselves when we stand tall before others? And when we feel small before them?” Valluvar replied, “When life graces you with wealth, power, and fame, remain humble and simple. Avoid pomp and vanity. But when life humbles you with failure, stand tall with dignity .”Perukaththu Vendum Panidhal Siriya Surukaththu Vendum Uyarvu.Cultivate modesty in the days of prosperity, but in the day of decline hold fast to thy dignity.I observed that nature too gives us the same lesson. Trees laden with fruits have their branches bent towards the ground, while the ones without them have branches pointing to the sky. Tata’s life exemplified this.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece 'Thirukkural' written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar.

Canada refuses NIA’s request for death certificate of Nijjar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-refuses-nias-request-for-death-certificate-of-nijjar/articleshow/114599015.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ottawa has refused to entertain the National Investigation Agency’s request for the death certificate of pro-Khalistan operative Hardeep Singh Nijjar , an Indian-origin citizen of Canada who was killed there in June last year. Nijjar was accused in nine cases being investigated by NIA NIA had approached Canada for Nijjar’s death certificate to fulfil the legal requirement of updating the courts here in view of the cases that were pending against him. However, as per NIA sources, the Canadian authorities posed some counter-queries, including why the death certificate of its citizen should be sought by India. “After that, they refused to share his death certificate,” said an officer.Nijjar’s murder had triggered a diplomatic row with the Canadian govt alleging the role of Indian agencies, a charge promptly and stoutly denied by New Delhi. The row had recently escalated with Canada naming senior Indian diplomats as “persons of interest” in the Nijjar murder investigation, and India retaliating by withdrawing those diplomats from the country.NIA is also yet to succeed in securing an Interpol red-corner notice against another pro-Khalistan rabble rouser and designated terrorist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who is a US citizen. NIA is investigating six cases of Khalistani terror against Pannun and has attached three of his properties — across Chandigarh, Amritsar and Pathankot — so far on grounds of being proceeds of terrorism. Interestingly, there was an attempt on Pannun’s life in the US in New York in June 2023, prompting the US to claim the involvement of an Indian official.Last week, an unsealed indictment showed that the US had charged Vikash Yadav, described as a former officer in India’s Research and Analysis Wing spy service, with directing the plot against the Sikh separatist.","NIA had approached Canada for Nijjar’s death certificate to fulfil the legal requirement of updating the courts here in view of the cases that were pending against him.

"Coordinated patrols by Army, PLA set to begin by October-end",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coordinated-patrols-by-army-pla-set-to-begin-by-october-end/articleshow/114598258.cms,"NEW DELHI: With around 50% of troop disengagement completed at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh by Friday evening, the Indian Army plans to start “coordinated patrolling” with the People’s Liberation Army in the two areas by this month-end, even as talks are underway on other issues like the ‘buffer zones’ created earlier in the high-altitude region.“The disengagement in Depsang and Demchok will finish by Oct 28-29 if all goes as per the plan finalised by the Indian and Chinese tactical commanders. The coordinated patrolling from the two sides, with prior intimation to each other to avoid face-offs, will then begin after mutual verification,” an Army source said.The ongoing dismantling of the temporary posts, sheds, tents and other structures and pullback of the rival troops in Depsang and Demchok to pre-April 2020 positions are being closely monitored on the ground as well as through unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other means.As part of the confidence-building measures, the two sides will share their “patrolling routines” with each other and limit the number to 15-20 armed soldiers in each patrol.India’s push for de-escalation along the entire 3,488km line of actual control (LAC) and de-induction of the over 1,00,000 troops forward deployed by each side is still a long way off.A tactical gain, however, is that the new pact on “patrolling arrangements” at the two remaining face-off sites, first announced by foreign secretary Vikram Misri on Oct 21 after diplomatic and military talks that paved the way for the Modi-Xi meeting, does not include no-patrol buffer zones set up in the earlier rounds of disengagement till Sept 2022.Those buffer zones at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3-km to 10-km, are largely on what India considers to be its own territory.“We did not want buffer zones at Depsang and Demchok, with their consequent restrictions on patrolling. The resumption of patrolling in the buffer zones is being separately discussed,” another source said.Under the new pact, the rival troops at Depsang and Demchok will fall back to the positions they held before April 2020, which is when the PLA made multiple well-planned incursions into eastern Ladakh. “The two sides will also patrol the areas they used to patrol till April 2020,” the source said.Consequently, Chinese troops will no longer block Indian soldiers from going to their traditional patrolling points (PPs) 10, 11, 11A, 12, and 13 at the strategically located Depsang Plains, like they were doing around 18km inside Indian territory in the ‘Bottleneck’ area for the last four-and-a-half years.Indian troops should also get access to two crucial PPs in the Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok, while Indian shepherds will also be able to take their animals to traditional grazing grounds there. It, of course, remains to be seen whether all this will work on the ground.There are also concerns about whether a “package deal” has been worked out with China that links the new Depsang-Demchok pact with certain “sensitive” areas like Yangtse, Asaphila and Subansiri river valley in Arunachal Pradesh.Asked about this, an official source said, “The new pact is only about Depsang-Demchok. But talks are going on in all sectors of the LAC.” While the Yangtse plateau in the crucial Tawang sector has for long been a major flashpoint, PLA troops had tried to transgress across the LAC there to unilaterally change status quo, which had led to a major physical clash between the rival troops on Dec 9, 2022, leaving several injured on both sides.",50% of troop disengagement completed at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh.

Varanasi court rejects plea for excavation survey at Gyanvapi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/varanasi-court-rejects-plea-for-excavation-survey-at-gyanvapi/articleshow/114598370.cms,"VARANASI: A fast-track court in Varanasi rejected Friday a Hindu plaintiff’s plea for an “additional” survey by ASI of the Gyanvapi mosque complex, using invasive methods to gain access to purportedly razed remains of an ancient Adi Vishweshwar temple believed to exist beneath the central dome.Civil judge (senior division) Yughul Shambhu cited directives from Supreme Court and Allahabad high court barring any excavation during the previous survey by ASI of “Plot No 9130” within the Gyanvapi complex.“Based on the facts and circumstances, it can be concluded that the report submitted by ASI is yet to be examined. Secondly, the structure where a ‘ Shivling ’ is stated to have been found is protected by an order of Supreme Court,” Shambhu said.The fast-track court reserved its order during the previous hearing on Oct 19 after Anjuman Intizamia Masajid, the mosque’s custodian, filed objections to advocate Vijay Shankar Rastogi’s petition seeking another survey by ASI.Rastogi, who identifies himself as “next friend of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar” in the original Dec 2019 plea for a survey to find out if the mosque was built over a demolished shrine, told reporters that he would appeal Friday’s ruling in the high court.Gyanvapi is embroiled in multiple litigations, including the Shringar Gauri case filed in Aug 2021 by five women plaintiffs seeking unrestricted access to the mosque complex for daily worship of “visible and invisible” Hindu deities there.Two previous surveys of the complex, one by a team constituted by the civil judge’s court and the second by ASI, have yielded purported findings that the Hindu side insists are proof of the existence of a temple.The first court-mandated survey in May 2022 revealed the “Shivling” in the middle of the wuzukhana, or ablution pond. The then civil judge ordered that the pond area be sealed, while allowing namaz to continue. The same month, SC ordered status quo on the dispute and steps to protect the pond area. The apex court also transferred the case to the district judge’s court.On July 23 last year, the district judge asked ASI to conduct a scientific survey of Gyanvapi in response to a plea from the plaintiffs in the Shringar Gauri suit. The survey was to cover the entire premises, barring the sealed wuzukhana zone, to “determine if the mosque had been constructed over the pre-existing structure of a Hindu temple”.ASI submitted its report in a sealed envelope on Dec 18 last year, but it wasn’t opened until Jan 24. The fast-track court, which was separately hearing Rastogi’s plea for a survey of Gyanvapi, directed him to procure a copy of the ASI report before reworking his plea.In compliance with the Dec 30 order, Rastogi submitted a fresh plea in Feb with references to the ASI report. He sought excavation of a trench to gain access to the purported sanctum sanctorum of the ancient temple that is presumed to have been demolished to build the existing mosque.Rastogi contends that the shrine below the central dome houses a towering “Shivling” and an artesian well.AIM and the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board filed their objections against Rastogi’s plea on various grounds.",A fast-track court in Varanasi rejected Friday a Hindu plaintiff’s plea for an ‘additional’ survey by ASI of the Gyanvapi mosque complex.

"PM Modi: War cannot solve problems, says Modi as Scholz sounds alarm on Russia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/war-cannot-solve-problems-says-pm-modi-as-scholz-sounds-alarm-on-russia/articleshow/114599108.cms,"PM Narendra Modi and Chancellor Olaf Scholz

The 7th India-Germany intergovernmental consultations (IGC) co-chaired by PM Narendra Modi and Chancellor Olaf Scholz resulted in 8 major outcomes, including a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty that is expected to bolster joint efforts against terrorism and separatist elements.Scholz appreciated India’s support for just and lasting peace in Ukraine, and the readiness to use its ties with all parties to facilitate a political solution, as Modi maintained war cannot solve any problem and stressed India stood ready to make every possible contribution towards restoration of peace. With delivered and pledged assistance worth 28 billion euro, Germany is second only to the US in providing military aid to Ukraine.Speaking earlier at the Asia-Pacific Conference of German Business, in the presence of Modi, the Chancellor warned if Russia succeeded with its “illegal brutal” war against Ukraine, there would be repercussions far beyond Europe's borders. Such an outcome, he added, would endanger global security and prosperity as a whole.Launched in 2011, IGC allows comprehensive review of ties as well as identification of new areas of cooperation at the cabinet level. Another important agreement signed was for exchange of classified information that, Modi said, reflected deep mutual trust between the 2 countries amid growing defence and security cooperation.Reaffirming commitment to green and sustainable development, both leaders launched an Indo-German Green Hydrogen Roadmap . Among geopolitical issues, the Russia-Ukraine war , West Asia conflict and Indo-Pacific situation were discussed in detail in the meeting.“The ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia are a matter of concern for both countries. India has always maintained that war cannot solve any problem at all and stands ready to make every possible contribution towards the restoration of peace,’’ said Modi, at a joint press event after the wide-ranging talks.In a joint statement, India and Germany also delivered a message to Russia that the threat of use of nuclear weapons is unacceptable.In his opening remarks, Modi also raised the issue of tensions in the Indo-Pacific saying there are serious concerns about the rule of law and freedom of navigation in the region. “In such times, the strategic partnership between India and Germany has emerged as a strong anchor,’’ he said. Scholz will travel to Goa on Saturday where the German naval frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg and combat support ship Frankfurt am Main, as announced by the Indian government earlier, will make a port call as part of Germany’s Indo-Pacific deployment.The leaders underlined the need for reforms in multilateral institutions, particularly the UN Security Council , with Modi saying global forums created in the twentieth century are not capable of addressing challenges of the 21st century. Both India and Germany are members of the G4, along with Brazil and Japan, that seeks expansion of the Security Council and supports each other’s candidature for permanent membership. Scholz also backed an ambitious India-EU FTA, which remains under discussion, underscoring the “enormous potential” to further build and expand trade and investment between the 2 countries.In his remarks at the media event, Scholz said no one can close their eyes to the Russia-Ukraine war and its effects. “This war, which has been raging for so long now and is claiming so many victims, must finally come to an end. The integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine must be preserved,"" Scholz said, adding Russia’s aggression had put under strain the international rules-based order. Scholz also said it was significant that India was an anchor of stability in South Asia in these times.On other areas of cooperation Modi said that a whole-of-government approach to Critical and Emerging Technologies, Skill Development, and Innovation had also been agreed upon. “This will strengthen cooperation in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Semiconductors, and Clean Energy. It will also help in building secure, trusted, and resilient global supply value chains,’’ he said.Welcoming Germany’s Skilled Labour Strategy released for India, Modi said he was confident that India’s young talent pool will get better opportunities to contribute to Germany's development.",The 7th India-Germany intergovernmental consultations (IGC) co-chaired by PM Narendra Modi and Chancellor Olaf Scholz resulted in 8 major outcomes.

Germany ups visas for skilled Indian workers 4.5x to 90k,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/germany-ups-visas-for-skilled-indian-workers-4-5x-to-90k/articleshow/114598523.cms,"NEW DELHI: Germany has decided to increase the number of visas for skilled Indians from 20,000 to 90,000 per year, PM Narendra Modi announced Friday.“I am confident that this will further boost Germany’s economic growth,” he said, speaking at the Asia-Pacific Conference of German Business.Participating in the conference along with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz , Modi said Germany’s holistic approach and commitment to pursuing the strategic partnership are clearly evident. “Especially noteworthy is the trust that Germany has expressed in the skilled workforce of India,” he said.“This is the right time to join India’s growth story... India becoming a global trade and manufacturing hub,” Modi said, adding that today, India stands on strong pillars of democracy, demography, demand and data.Germany is facing an acute shortage of skilled professionals and is looking at the talent pool in India to make up for the shortfall.India also raised the case of Ariha Shah, a three-year-old Indian girl who has been in foster care in Germany, during the meeting between Modi and Scholz. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said at a media briefing that the chancellor has assured the PM that he is “very closely following” the issue.The girl has been in foster care in Germany for more than 36 months following allegations of minor physical abuse. Her parents, Bhavesh and Dhara Shah, are residents of Mira Bhayander in Maharashtra’s Thane district.“The case has been followed very, very closely by us.... Our embassy in Berlin has taken it up. When the external affairs minister was in Germany a few weeks ago, he had raised it very strongly with his counterpart,” Misri said.“Yes, I can confirm that it was raised during Friday’s meeting as well. We have at all levels impressed upon the German side that an Indian child growing up in an environment that is not hers -- cultural, religious, linguistic environment -- is somewhat unnatural and that this situation needs to be addressed,” he added.The foreign secretary said Scholz assured Modi that “he is very closely following this issue and continues to pay close attention to it”, adding, “I am sure that both sides will remain in touch on this issue through various channels.”","Germany has decided to increase the number of visas for skilled Indians from 20,000 to 90,000 per year.

"Agent Vikash: Wanted by FBI, but patriot to his village",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agent-vikash-wanted-by-fbi-but-patriot-to-his-village/articleshow/114599403.cms,"Vikash Yadav’s house in Pranpura is harder to reach than to find. It’s only after clearing a couple of verification rounds from locals that the large iron gate that hides most of the single-storey house with a pink fence — on the last line of settlements beyond which lies typically shrub-speckled Aravali terrain — parts. But there’s no going in unaccompanied.“Sensitive matter,” we are told by a group playing cards that is our first ‘check point’.“No cameras, please, and no recording on the mobile phone,” we are subsequently told by our local escort who agrees to show us the way.Sporadically seen and rarely heard from, Vikash is as inconspicuous as he could be in Pranpura, just one among hundreds of its youths who took up jobs and left and return only to visit family. This changed last week, sensationally.On Oct 17, Vikash shot to the top of an unravelling international diplomatic row after the United States department of justice revealed it had brought murder-for-hire charges against him for the attempted assassination of New York-based separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. Vikash, according to the American indictment, was also aware of the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , another separatist, last year in Canada, which has brought a chill in New Delhi-Ottawa ties after the Justin Trudeau govt alleged Indian govt agencies were involved.Though the US indictment refers to Vikash as an Indian govt official — employed by the cabinet secretariat that oversees R&AW — New Delhi has denied it, saying Vikash had been dismissed from service. In a recent statement, Union ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Vikash Yadav is no longer an employee of govt of India.”Pranpura and Vikash’s family believe neither.The watch has been necessitated by journalists landing up and making inquiries about Vikash since the US indictment revealed his name as a co-conspirator (CC1). Pranpura, part of a cluster of villages in Haryana’s Rewari district near the industrial town of Bawal, is 105 km to Delhi’s south, but not on any of the state or national highways that crisscross the region. In this place of familiar faces and routines, the American revelation creased many brows for two reasons — that Vikash was now wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the indictment’s implication that he was working as an Indian spy.“How do you know what the Americans are saying is true?” shot back Sudesh. In her 60s, Vikash’s mother spoke from behind the gate after our escort, Rajeev, called out to her. Sudesh, and anyone else you talk to in the village, insist Vikash has always been and remains a govt employee.“My son works for the country and our govt will take care of him,” said Sudesh, who knows little else about Vikash’s job except that he is a “CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) commandant”.It’s how the rest of Pranpura — which prides itself as a ‘fauji gaon’ (Army village) with a martyrs’ memorial next to the panchayat office its most prominent landmark — knows Vikash too. Like many of them, Rajeev, a neighbour of Sudesh, brushed off the Pannun plot revelation, calling Vikash “a patriot who serves the country”.Vikash, now 39, was born in a ‘fauji’ household in the mid-80s. His father Ram Singh Yadav was in the BSF and died of a heart attack in 2007 when he was posted in Tripura. The family moved around the North East with Yadav senior’s postings, so Vikash and Ajay did their schooling in different places, including Shillong . But both completed their graduation from Ahir College in Rewari.Ajay is now posted in Gurgaon as a police head constable. His wife and two children live with Sudesh. Vikash’s family — wife and one-year-old daughter — is in Delhi.“Our family has always served the country,” said Sudesh. “I don’t believe Vikash committed any crime.” Vikash, added Sudesh, does not visit home regularly and “calls once in a while”. “I don’t know where he and his family are right now. He hasn’t contacted us,” she said, declining comment on media reports that Vikash had spoken to his family after his name as CC-1 was revealed and rubbished the charges.Sudesh said she also had no idea about his arrest last year by Delhi Police. The arrest on Dec 18 by Delhi Police’s Special Cell, on charges of extortion and kidnapping of a businessman from Rohini, followed the first indictment in the Pannun plot probe by the department of justice last Nov. Vikash spent three months in custody before a Delhi court granted him six days of interim bail on March 22 to see his daughter who was undergoing treatment for acute respiratory infection.The court order described Vikash as an “ex-govt employee with clean antecedents”. On April 22, Vikash was granted regular bail with no objection from the prosecution.A Central Administrative Tribunal principal bench order dated Nov 29, 2023 shows Vikash was appointed senior field officer (SFO) of Aviation Research Centre (ARC) in the executive cadre of Directorate General of Security (cabinet secretariat) on Oct 9, 2023 after the completion of probation. ARC is part of R&AW. Vikash knocked on CAT’s door for permanent appointment after working as a probationer in the agency since Nov 2015.In May, soon after his release from prison, Vikash visited Pranpura, the last time Sudesh claims she saw him. “He came here alone and stayed for a couple of days. He didn’t tell me that he was arrested,” Sudesh said.Vikash, neighbour Rajeev offered, hardly left his home during visits, so interactions with him since he began working were rare. “He was good in academics and a fitness freak,” Rajeev said.A local resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity said no one in India would see Vikash as a criminal, even if the US indictment is true. “Pannun is a wanted accused in India and America does not want to hand him over to us. They also did not hand over (26/11 Mumbai terror attacks accused) David Headley, who is a terrorist. Assuming Vikash is an Indian officer, why should India hand him over for doing his job?” he said. Another villager said since the US indictment named Vikash, police had visited the sarpanch and made some inquiries. “No security has been posted here as they felt it is not required in our village. It is safe here,” said a neighbour of Sudesh.“We will wait and watch. What else can we do?” said a neighbour. “Sarkar dekh legi.”How do you know what the Americans are saying is true, asks Vikash’s mother Sudesh, speaking from behind the gate of their house at Pranpura in Rewari. She insists, along with others from the village, that he is a patriot and a govt employee, calling the US’s murder-for-hire allegations ‘false’.","Vikash Yadav shot to the top of an unravelling international diplomatic row after the United States department of justice revealed it had brought murder- for-hire charges against him.

Gyanvapi case: Varanasi court dismisses plea for additional ASI survey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gyanvapi-case-varanasi-court-dismisses-plea-for-additional-asi-survey/articleshow/114590940.cms,"NEW DELHI: Varanasi court on Friday rejected a request from the Hindu side for an additional Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) examination of the Gyanvapi premises.Following the decision, Advocate Vijay Shankar Rastogi , representing the Hindu side, announced plans to file an appeal in the high court .“The court has rejected our application for an additional survey of the protection of the whole Gyanvapi area by the ASI,” Rastogi said. “We will go to the high court against this decision... within the time limitation, within 30 days.”Rastogi explained that the application for an additional survey was based on a previous directive issued on April 8, 2021. That order, according to Rastogi, had specified a detailed survey by a five-member ASI team that would include an expert from a central university and a representative from a minority community. However, the Hindu side believes the prior ASI survey did not meet these standards.“We had requested the court to comply with its previous directive dated April 8, 2021, as the prior survey and the report submitted did not adhere to that order. On April 8, 2021, the court had clearly directed that the ASI form a five-member team, which would include a representative from a minority community and an expert from a central university in archaeology. However, the previous survey report was solely conducted by ASI, lacking this specified team composition.”Rastogi noted that the high court endorsed this directive and advised that if the previous survey was found non-compliant, the local court should order an additional one. ""The order dated April 8, 2021—endorsed by the high court —directed this court that if the ASI’s earlier report did not align with the April 8 requirements, then an additional survey should be ordered. Based on the information I have gathered so far, this court has not taken that directive into consideration,” he said.Another point of contention, Rastogi pointed out, was that the survey request included the wazukhana (ablution area) and a 100-metre radius around it, but this area has yet to be fully surveyed. According to Rastogi, the court had instructed only for its preservation but did not seal it, leading the ASI to exclude it from the survey.“The wazukhana has not been sealed; the district magistrate was only directed to protect it, which does not mean sealing it. The ASI had previously stated that the high court had ordered it sealed, but no such order exists, and hence, that part of the property has not been surveyed,” he said.Rastogi further explained that the lack of excavation under the main dome, believed to be situated directly over the Jyotirlinga of Lord Vishweshwar. The prior survey, conducted with ground-penetrating radar, detected rubble and stones down to 5.8 meters but did not provide further insights from deeper levels.“Our request was to excavate a 4x4 metre trench at a safe distance to allow ASI to access the area below the central dome and report back to the court. We will now examine the grounds on which the court dismissed our application and proceed to the High Court with our appeal.”The Hindu side intends to seek compliance with the initial 2021 directive in their high court appeal, hoping for a more comprehensive survey to meet the specifications outlined in the court’s previous orders.",Varanasi court on Friday rejected a request from the Hindu side for an additional Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) examination of the Gyanvapi premises.

AHMEDABAD: Despite the perilous journey and a series of deaths of illegal Indian immigrants trying to cross the border, the lure of a life in the US, especially among Gujaratis, remains strong.During US FY 2024 - October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024 - 29 lakh illegal immigrants were caught trying to enter the country through Mexico and Canada. Of these, Indians constituted 90,415, US Customs and Border Protection (US-CBP) data shows.Of this total, roughly 50% were from Gujarat, sources in Indian agencies tracking illegal immigration said. It could also be said that 10 Indians were arrested every hour, the sources said. Also, 43,764 were arrested at the US border with Canada, in the north, making it the highest number of Indians caught at this border till now.The data reveals a slight decline from the previous year's total of 32 lakh people, and in the number of Indians caught on the Mexico route . In FY 2023, the number of illegal Indian immigrants caught was 96,917. In 2024, fewer Indians (25,616) were caught at the US-Mexico border; this number in US FY 2023 was 41,770.""People have stopped using the donkey route via Mexico due to two key reasons. One is that they would be kept in Dubai or Turkey for some time before being taken to Mexico. US agencies, over the past few years, have been keeping sharp vigil on illegal immigrants staying in those countries and have broken links in the human smuggling chain,"" a source in the immigration network said.A source said, ""Gujaratis, too, began choosing Canada over Mexico as they could easily hire a taxi and cross over to the US. Recently, US authorities have tightened vigil on this border. Such immigrants are usually sent to Canada as most of them carry a Canadian visitor visa. However, the immigrants try again after some time on the same route.""Sources also said that people caught at the border may be very few compared to those who actually manage to sneak into the US.","During US FY 2024 - October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024 - 29 lakh illegal immigrants were caught trying to enter the country through Mexico and Canada.

Such compassion towards society-be it a Dalit student or a child of a marginal daily wage labourer who was unable to pay Rs 17,000 for an IIT Dhanbad seat, or a differently abled student-is when a judge can cut through technicalities to help them in their fight for their fundamental rights and realise the true purpose of being a judge, he said.""You can find 25 reasons of technical nature not to give relief to citizens; but to me, one justification to grant the relief is all that is necessary,"" said the 50th CJI to the packed historical central courtroom of Bombay high court , where he was a judge 11 years ago.

"Two anticyclones, mangrove forest save Odisha from Cyclone Dana’s fury",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-anticyclones-mangrove-forest-save-odisha-from-cyclone-danas-fury/articleshow/114599537.cms,"TOI

Bhubaneswar: Two anticyclones strategically located on either side of the severe Cyclone Dana played a crucial role in weakening its intensity and mitigating its impact on Odisha by sandwiching the storm from either side, India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) scientists said on Friday.The presence of anticyclones, which are characterised by the movement of air towards land in high-pressure conditions, acted as a counterforce to the cyclonic system. By sandwiching Cyclone Dana from both sides, these anticyclones effectively throttled its strength, preventing it from causing bigger destruction.The complex interaction of two anticyclones apart, Odisha was shielded from the full fury of Cyclone Dana by the mangrove forest in Bhitarkanika National Park . The severe cyclone made landfall near a tourist camp in Bhitarkanika between 1.30 am and 3.30 am on Friday, with the 209 sq km of mangrove forest in Kendrapada bearing the brunt.“Had there been no anticyclones, rain before the landfall of the cyclone would have been widespread, affecting many central Odisha districts, while stronger winds would have been felt over a larger area,” IMD scientist Uma Shankar Das told. “The anticyclones constricted the cyclone. Only the northern Odisha districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, and Mayurbhanj received heavy rainfall, he added.Weather experts said that due to the influence of an active anticyclone over the Arabian Sea, there was a significant impact of dry airflow from the north-northwest on the left side of the storm.Similarly, an active anticyclone zone was also present on the eastern side of the storm, reducing its area of influence from the right. Cyclone Dana lay centred between these two anticyclones and moved northward, spreading over a smaller area, they said.The anticyclones also ensured there was no change in the cyclone’s path, making it more predictable, which helped in taking preventive measures with more certainty.Bhitarkanika National Park divisional forest officer Sudarshan Yadav was astonished by the minimal damage observed near the landfall point, highlighting the crucial role of mangrove forests in mitigating the impact of cyclones.Odisha chief minister Mohan Majhi, who faced his first major natural disaster since assuming office in June, attributed the state's effective response to the crisis to teamwork and the blessings of Lord Jagannath. ""We managed to achieve our target of zero casualty,"" he said; his govt had evacuated close to six lakh people, with the CM personally monitoring the situation at the control room in the special relief commissioner’s office late into the night.Heavy rainfall and wind speeds of up to 110 kmph to 120 kmph were recorded when the cyclone crossed the coast, IMD Bhubaneswar director Manorama Mohanty said. The wind speed fell to 60 kmph to 80 kmph.“As it grew weaker and turned into a depression, heavy rain is continuing in several northern districts of Odisha. Rainfall activity will reduce by Saturday,” she said.The maximum storm surge height of one to two metres above the astronomical tide inundated low-lying areas of Kendrapara and Bhadrak districts of Odisha at landfall. Several trees were uprooted, and kuccha houses were damaged by heavy rain and strong winds.Chandbali, in Bhadrak district, recorded the highest rainfall — 158.6 mm — in the last 24 hours ending 8.30 am on Friday, while seven other places in Kendrapada, Bhadrak, and Mayurbhanj districts recorded more than 100 mm of rain in this period. IMD issued a red alert for heavy rainfall in Balasore, Bhadrak, and Mayurbhanj districts for the next 24 hours following the landfall of Dana.An 82-year-old woman, identified as Hemalata Nayak, a native of Bankual village in Kendrapada district, died of a suspected heart attack in a cyclone shelter in Rajnagar Block on Thursday night. “The death was not related to the cyclone,” block development officer Nishant Mishra said.","Odisha was shielded from the full fury of Cyclone Dana by the mangrove forest in Bhitarkanika National Park.

Fired Jets Coach Saleh Takes Role With Packers After Controversial End In New York | Pat McAfee Show

LaFleur Discusses Saleh's Role

Saleh Future in Packers



Following Robert Saleh 's hiring as the new head coach of the New York Jets in 2021, succeeding his former position in San Francisco as a defensive coordinator, he took every measure he could to mold an aggressive defense into the franchise. With his offense being quite another story, especially since after the Zach Wilson experiment fizzled. The Jets have injected life into their team by trading for Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers in an eight-player blockbuster deal. Disaster, though, struck just four plays into 2023 when Rodgers ruptured his Achilles.Many were on high hopes with Rodgers' probable return from the 2024 season, which seemed to point towards both Saleh and Rodgers as a potential Super Bowl contender. The reason behind this dire prediction changed once a loss to the Minnesota Vikings in London came by, for shock was what Saleh received upon being fired from his present position.Also Read - How NFL Players Invest Now, Robert Saleh has found a new calling as an analyst to Matt LaFleur and the Green Bay Packers. Recently seen on the practice field, Saleh is studying offensive plays to try to help move the team's offense. He coaches defense mainly, but his thoughts are targeted at helping quarterback Jordan Love know the defenses better.LaFleur believes Saleh has a great impact on the team and said, ""Having a defensive mind talking offense and helping us with things he might see can be beneficial. I believe he has an elite defensive mind, which is why I want him involved on the offensive side."" That tactic helps in getting the Packers a tactical advantage when facing their rivals.Regardless of speculation concerning his potential for a more important role, Saleh said he is not in the running for Jeff Hafley's job as defensive coordinator. ""I think Haf and our defensive staff have a great thing going,"" LaFleur explained. He said he believes in his present coaching staff and reiterated that Saleh's function would be purely as a consultant, bolstering the offense game plan rather than taking on the role of a coordinator.Also Read - Record Breaking Viewership of NFL","Robert Saleh has found a new calling as an analyst to Matt LaFleur and the Green Bay Packers.

Nutritional dash in ICAR Goa’s 11 new horticulture crop types,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/nutritional-dash-in-icar-goas-11-new-horticulture-crop-types/articleshow/114597793.cms,"Panaji:

The Indian Council of Agricultural Research— Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR-CCARI) has announced the successful development of 11 new varieties across six significant horticultural crops over the past year. These varieties have been recommended by the State Variety Release Committee, Goa.“These new varieties have more nutritional advantage compared to the existing varieties,” said ICAR-CCARI director Parveen Kumar.“We have submitted our proposal before the Central Variety Release Committee and we are hopeful that they will be released by them. This will be the biggest achievement of the institute,” Kumar said.Among the varieties, Goa Cardozo Mancurad mango stands out due to its lower fiber content, making it particularly appealing for consumers seeking a smoother texture in their fruit.The Goa Bhutki Supari, a dwarf variety of arecanut, is particularly advantageous for farmers, as it eliminates the need for climbing tall trees to harvest, thus enhancing safety and efficiency in cultivation.The cinnamon variety, Goa Dalchini 1 innovatively utilises both the bark and leaves as spices, broadening the scope for culinary applications and providing an exciting opportunity for spice traders in Goa.The Kokum varieties also introduce intriguing options for local growers. Kokum 1 features a larger fruit size, while Kokum 2 is characterised by a small to medium fruit size, whereas Kokum 3 is notable for its distinctive egg-shaped fruit. In addition, Kokum 2 and 3 diverge from traditional tree growth by coming from bush plants.The Goa Cashew 5 is a selection from the traditional Tudal variety of Canacona, while Cashew 6 represents a hybridisation of various local parent varieties.The nutmeg varieties is also noteworthy with Goa Jayphal 1 sourced from Tamsuli, Marcel, while Jayphal 2 and 3 were developed from ICAR-CCARI’s own farm in Old Goa.“With these innovations, farmers can expect to benefit from improved yields, better market options, and the potential for increased income, thus contributing to the overall economic growth of Goa,” Kumar said.","ICAR-CCARI has announced the successful development of 11 new varieties across six significant horticultural crops over the past year.

Apaar ID is safe and beneficial for students: Edu director,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/apaar-id-is-safe-and-beneficial-for-students-edu-director/articleshow/114595133.cms,"school in maharashtra

Panaji:

The Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (Apaar) ID is not currently mandatory for students, however, he said that recognising the benefits of the card, more than 7,800 students have already registered for it, said education director Shailesh Zingade on Tuesday.Apaar was conceptualised under the National Education Policy . The Apaar ID is a unique 12-digit ID, which will be allotted to students in the state in private, aided, and govt schools. This will be a step in the creation of an academic bank of credits for school students, which will store their academic progress.“The Apaar card is designed to streamline the process of storing and accessing student data . By linking complete student information to a digital locker, the card will enable students to easily obtain admission to educational institutions throughout the country and even abroad,” Zingade said.To issue the Apaar ID, an Aadhar card and the consent from parents are required. However, many worry about fraud as the Aadhar card is being asked for. “There is no possibility of any fraud in this process. Fraud can be committed if you share your fingerprints, etc., but we are only asking for the Aadhar card, using which we will generate the Apaar ID,” the education director said.He added, “When a student misplaces their marksheet, he/she is required to obtain a duplicate copy for admission purposes. This situation poses challenges for the verification process. However, if the marksheets are available on the DigiLocker platform, this issue will not arise.”Zingade appealed to parents not to oppose the Apaar ID as it is going to benefit the students. “Apaar, although not compulsory at present, is a process that I believe every student should undertake. It is going to benefit them. The entire procedure will be closely monitored, and we guarantee that students’ personal data will remain safe,” he said.","Apaar was conceptualised under the National Education Policy.

MADURAI: Continuous rainfall since 3pm for over five hours on Friday caused severe flooding in several parts of Madurai , leaving areas like Sellur, Annaiyur, Officer Town, and neighbourhoods near the bypass road submerged in knee-deep water.The downpour, which measured 10cm from 3pm and 8pm, significantly disrupted daily life and created major inconveniences for residents.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), an intense 4.5 cm of rain was recorded in just 15 minutes, between 3pm and 3.15pm, leading to immediate waterlogging in low-lying areas.Neighbourhoods including Park Town, Mullai Nagar, BB Kulam, Bharathi Nagar, GR Nagar, Surya Nagar, Aathikulam, Narayanapuram, and Viswasanthi Nagar were especially affected, with rainwater entering homes and blocking access to several streets.Residents in these areas voiced concerns about inadequate drainage systems that allowed rainwater to flood residential streets and enter houses. ""We have been facing difficulties since the rain started. Streets are flooded, and it’s becoming hard to even step outside our homes,"" said G Nagarajan, a resident of Bharath Nagar.Madurai MP Su Venkatesan, along with Corporation commissioner S Dinesh Kumar, visited the Sellur area to assess the flooding.""All 15 tanks in Sellur are brimming with water, but corporation and district administration officials are working hard to drain the water from the flooded residential areas,"" said Venkatesan.He confirmed that 15 locations within the corporation area reported severe waterlogging. Commissioner Dinesh Kumar added, ""By tomorrow morning, we expect all water to be drained. We have deployed JCBs to desilt blockages at key locations, particularly along the Panthalkudi channel, which is causing the flooding in Sellur.""In response to the flooding, chief minister M K Stalin released a statement saying that he was informed about the situation in Madurai through a phone call. He directed district collector M S Sangeetha, commercial taxes minister P Moorthy, and IT minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan to work on the ground to carry out relief measures and ensure the situation is brought under control.Temporary shelters have been set up in four corporation schools to accommodate affected residents, and corporation officials have ensured that measures are in place to prevent further damage.In the eastern zone, 12 locations reported inundation, while the northern zone received five complaints of flooding. Commissioner Dinesh Kumar clarified that all tanks and canals in the area remain intact and that water is being diverted to drainage systems. ""Efforts to clear blockages and drain water are ongoing as officials continue to monitor the situation,"" he said.The district administration announced that water from BB Kulam and surrounding areas is being diverted to the Vaigai river through the BB Kulam channel via Chokkikulam and Tamil Sangam area.Food would be distributed to residents staying in temporary shelters until the water is drained from their residential areas, said the release.","Continuous rainfall since 3pm for over five hours on Friday caused severe flooding in several parts of Madurai.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delta Air Line sues CrowdStrike over 'catastrophic' software update that prompted mass flight cancellations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/delta-air-line-sues-crowdstrike-over-catastrophic-software-update-that-prompted-mass-flight-cancellations/articleshow/114605684.cms,"Representative Image

What happened on July 19

Delta Air Line on Friday sued the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike following a global outage in July that resulted in widespread flight cancellations , disrupted travel plans for 1.3 million customers, and cost the airline over $500 million in losses.The air line filed the lawsuit in the Georgia state's Fulton County Superior Court where it described the faulty software update from CrowdStrike as ""catastrophic,"" and said that the firm forced the customers to do the untested and faulty updates. This caused over 8.5 million Microsoft Windows-based computers around the world to ""crash.""The July 19 incident led to worldwide flight cancellations and hit industries around the globe including banks, health care, media companies and hotel chains, according to Reuters.CrowdStrike responded to the allegations late on Friday, stating, ""Delta's claims are based on disproven misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works, and reflect a desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure.""Delta, which has been a customer of CrowdStrike products since 2022, reported that the outage forced the cancellation of 7,000 flights and impacted 1.3 million passengers over a five-day period. The airline is seeking to recover over $500 million in out-of-pocket losses, as well as additional compensation for lost profits, expenditures, including attorneys' fees, ""reputational harm and future revenue loss.""The incident has also prompted an investigation by the US Transportation Department. Delta's lawsuit asserts, ""If CrowdStrike had tested the faulty update on even one computer before deployment, the computer would have crashed."" The airline further stated that because the faulty update could not be removed remotely, ""CrowdStrike crippled Delta's business and created immense delays for Delta customers.""Delta emphasized that as part of its IT planning and infrastructure, it has invested billions of dollars ""in licensing and building some of the best technology solutions in the airline industry."" CrowdStrike has questioned why Delta was more severely affected than other airlines and claimed minimal liability, which Delta has rejected.Last month, Adam Meyers, a senior vice president at CrowdStrike, apologized before Congress for the faulty software update. Meyers explained that the company had released a content configuration update for its Falcon Sensor security software, which led to system crashes worldwide. He stated, ""We are deeply sorry this happened and we are determined to prevent this from happening again.""On July 19, a widespread technology disruption, seemingly connected to issues at global cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and Microsoft, has impacted various industries worldwide, including airports, airlines, financial institutions, and media outlets.Numerous airports and airlines have been affected by the outage. Berlin airport suspended all flights until 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) due to a technical issue.Spanish airport operator Aena reported a computer systems ""incident"" at all Spanish airports, potentially causing flight delays. Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, a major European air transport hub, confirmed it was impacted by the global cyber outage and advised travelers to contact their airlines directly. KLM, the Netherlands' flagship airline, suspended most of its operations, while its parent company, Air France, also experienced disruptions, Reuters reported.Turkish Airlines encountered problems with ticketing, check-in, and booking due to the global technical issue. Major U.S. carriers, including American Airlines, Delta Airlines , and United Airlines, issued ground stops citing communication problems. SAS, Qantas, and Cathay Pacific also reported delays and technical difficulties.The financial sector has also been impacted by the outage. Commonwealth Bank, Australia's largest bank, reported that some customers were unable to transfer money. Several major oil and gas trading desks in London and Singapore struggled to execute trades. Macquarie Capital was unable to provide liquidity for unexpired warrants on HKEX due to technical problems. South Africa's Capitec said card payments, ATM, and app services were fully restored following significant nationwide disruptions linked to CrowdStrike. LSEG Group's Workspace news and data platform suffered an outage, causing disruption across financial markets.Media outlets have also been affected. Sky News, a major British television news channel, went off air. Australia's state broadcaster ABC experienced a ""major network outage,"" while regular programming at Sky News Australia was disrupted.The outage has also impacted emergency services and healthcare. A health booking system used by doctors in England went offline. Several hospitals in the Netherlands had to scale down their operations. Victorian state police in Australia reported that some internal systems were affected, but emergency services were operating normally. Copenhagen's fire department experienced problems receiving automatically transmitted fire alarms and urged people to call 112 in case of a fire.","Delta Air Line on Friday sued cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike following a global outage in July that resulted in widespread flight cancellations.

Democrats burn through cash while outraising Republicans in final weeks of fight for the Senate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/democrats-burn-through-cash-while-outraising-republicans-in-final-weeks-of-fight-for-the-senate/articleshow/114599494.cms,"Democratic candidates outspent their republican rivals in during the first two week of October in closely contested Senate race in US.According to a recent Federal Election Commission filings, Democrats spent more than three times as much as their their GOP opponents during this critical period of the election in states like Ohio, Montana and Michigan.According to a report in Politico , Despite facing a challenging Senate map, Democrats have benefited from this financial edge, enabling them to allocate significant resources to defend multiple states.Colin Allred , who is running against GOP Senator Ted Cruz in Texas, raised an impressive $11.3 million in just 16 days, surpassing Cruz's $9.9 million. Cruz, however, was the highest-raising Republican senator and the only GOP candidate in a high-profile race to outspend his rival.Vulnerable Democratic incumbents Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio raised $9 million and $7.8 million, respectively, while their Republican challengers only brought in $2.3 million and $1.9 million. This fundraising advantage allowed the Democratic incumbents to maintain a higher cash balance for the final days of the campaign, even after substantial spending in recent weeks, Politico reported.In Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Democratic Senate candidates also raised at least three times more than their Republican opponents in the first half of October. Meanwhile, in Nebraska, independent candidate Dan Osborn raised just over $3 million compared to incumbent GOP Sen. Deb Fischer's $560,000, making the race unexpectedly competitive and prompting last-minute defensive spending from national Republicans .To counter Democrats' financial advantage, Republicans have depended heavily on outside groups to support their candidates in competitive states. For example, the Senate Leadership Fund, the largest Republican super PAC, recently started spending in Nevada, reflecting growing optimism about Sam Brown's challenge to Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen.Additionally, Republicans have utilized innovative fundraising strategies, such as a joint fundraising committee affiliated with GOP candidate Tim Sheehy in Montana, which spent over $1 million on advertising in early October, exploiting a campaign finance law loophole to reduce Tester's cash advantage.","Vulnerable Democratic incumbents Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio raised $9 million and $7.8 million, respectively, while their Republican challengers only brought in $2.3million and $1.9million.

Why Donald Trump's appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast could decide the race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-joe-rogan-white-house-kamala-harris/articleshow/114591075.cms,"Not Your Average Broadcast: Rogan’s Unique Appeal

Rogan’s Influence in the Political Landscape

Clearing the Air: Reaching Out to Disaffected Voters

Building the Anti-Woke Coalition

Engaging with the Podcast Generation

What’s Next?

With a planned appearance on ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" former president Donald Trump has seized on an influential platform to further his appeal ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. This move marks a noteworthy turn in Trump’s outreach strategy, as the former president seeks to resonate with Rogan's diverse and often contrarian audience, many of whom don’t traditionally align with mainstream political affiliations. Rogan, known for his eclectic guest lineup and a conversational format that runs for hours, offers Trump an unconventional avenue to discuss his views in an unrestricted setting—a strategic choice that may reflect Trump’s goals of expanding his appeal, countering criticism, and tapping into cultural currents outside traditional conservative circles.Joe Rogan’s podcast, as a medium, is distinctly different from the typical press circuits or debate stages. With approximately 14.5 million Spotify followers, Rogan’s show regularly reaches a massive, diverse listenership that spans age groups and political spectrums. His reputation as a ""regular guy"" offering straightforward commentary has bolstered his popularity, especially among younger men, a demographic Trump has struggled to mobilise.Furthermore, the format itself is unique. A podcast conversation allows for depth and nuance beyond what campaign rallies or mainstream interviews offer, which plays to Trump’s unfiltered, conversational style. On Rogan’s show, guests often find space to express themselves freely—sometimes drifting into contentious territories, yet benefiting from the relatively non-confrontational environment. Trump’s objective here may be to use Rogan's platform to showcase a less formal, more relatable persona, which could be advantageous in reaching undecided voters or those traditionally disengaged from politics.Rogan’s political stance is famously elusive, often defying labels. Though he initially supported Bernie Sanders in 2020, he has also voiced support for figures like Ron DeSantis and briefly endorsed independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who later endorsed Trump after suspending his campaign. This varied alignment reveals a nuanced and complex political viewpoint that resonates with his audience’s desire for authenticity and independent thinking, far removed from partisan echo chambers.With this in mind, Trump likely hopes to use the platform to bridge ideological divides by positioning himself as an anti-establishment candidate—someone willing to challenge the norms, just as Rogan’s show often does. Rogan’s audience includes listeners disillusioned by both ends of the political spectrum, and Trump might aim to leverage this by focusing on topics that resonate with Rogan’s core themes, like critiques of mainstream media, “woke culture,” and governmental overreach.One of Trump’s strategic aims may be to address criticisms that paint him as divisive or out of touch. In the past, Rogan has expressed critical views on Trump, calling him an ""existential threat to democracy itself"" and noting he had declined Trump’s requests to appear on the show. This past reluctance from Rogan and the publicised clash between the two over issues like the 2020 election and Trump’s response to COVID-19 form a complicated backdrop. By appearing on Rogan’s show, Trump might hope to demonstrate his ability to address critics directly, presenting himself as willing to engage even with those who don’t initially support him.Further, Rogan’s audience, drawn to his anti-establishment stance, may see Trump’s willingness to confront criticism as a sign of resilience, appealing to the large segment of voters feeling alienated from conventional political discourse. Here, Trump might also address issues such as vaccine mandates or media bias, aligning himself with Rogan's critiques of perceived ""woke"" overreach while trying to reframe himself as a defender of personal freedoms—a strategy that could resonate among Rogan’s younger, independence-valuing listeners.As the campaign season intensifies, Trump has sharpened his rhetoric around so-called “woke” culture, a theme Rogan’s podcast frequently touches on. Rogan’s show provides a relaxed environment for Trump to discuss his views on cultural and social issues without the scrutiny typical of a news interview. In recent years, cultural topics like identity politics, free speech, and government intervention have emerged as central to Rogan’s discourse, and Trump is likely to lean into these discussions.By delving into these subjects, Trump may hope to energise an anti-woke coalition, extending beyond traditional conservative voters to include independents and moderate liberals weary of political correctness. This strategic alignment with Rogan’s brand could allow Trump to speak to shared grievances over cancel culture and “woke” ideology, potentially broadening his support base among those who might otherwise lean politically neutral or even left-leaning.Podcasts are a potent medium for connecting with younger generations, particularly millennials and Gen Z, who increasingly turn to them for information and entertainment. Trump’s appearances on traditional media platforms have often focused on his core messages but may not reach the demographics that dominate Rogan’s listener base. Through this podcast, Trump can attempt to appeal to young men who may be less interested in traditional political messaging but are tuned into Rogan’s unfiltered format.By joining Rogan’s show, Trump may hope to transcend the polarised image that his critics have painted. For example, he could use this platform to address issues like economic anxiety or criticism of Big Tech’s influence on free speech, topics that resonate across political divides. In doing so, he might hope to create a more relatable image for himself as someone attentive to the challenges facing the younger workforce.Despite their ideological differences, both Trump and Rogan have established themselves as cultural disruptors who openly challenge the status quo. By engaging with Rogan, Trump signals a willingness to reach new audiences on their terms, appealing to those disillusioned by mainstream media and conventional political platforms. This podcast appearance may mark a turning point in Trump’s outreach strategy, blending his populist appeal with Rogan’s influential, independent platform to reinforce his image as an outsider ready to disrupt American politics once again.Ultimately, Trump's appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” may not convert all of Rogan’s listeners into supporters, but it holds potential for reframing his image. Whether discussing policy, personal freedom, or the future of American identity, Trump stands to gain by embracing Rogan’s loyal, diverse audience as he navigates the 2024 campaign. For Trump, stepping into Rogan’s arena is more than just an interview—it’s a bid to redefine the campaign conversation on his terms.","Former president Donald Trump has planned to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast. This move marks a noteworthy turn in Trump’s outreach strategy, says Andrew Keen. Keen: Trump may use the platform to bridge ideological divides.

Pakistan plans artificial rain for the second time after Lahore declared world's most polluted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-plans-artificial-rain-for-the-second-time-after-lahore-declared-worlds-most-polluted/articleshow/114472983.cms,"The Punjab province of Pakistan on Tuesday announced plans for artificial rain to help reduce the impact of smog , following an alarming Air Quality Index (AQI) of 394 in Lahore.This would mark the second time that Lahore, the cultural capital of Pakistan, would carry out cloud seeding for artificial rain, being one of the cities to face the worst pollution regularly.The cloud seeding was done for the first time in December 2023 to combat hazardous levels of smog and it cost an estimated Rs 350 million.Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world on Monday with an alarming AQI of 394.The AQI measures the concentration of different pollutants in the air, with values above 100 classified as unhealthy and those above 150 considered ""very unhealthy.""Addressing a press conference, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said, ""Yesterday Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world. We have taken a number of initiatives to address the matter and now we are planning for artificial rain in the city.""She, however, did not declare any date for it.The Punjab government , led by Maryam Nawaz, has launched the 'Anti-Smog Squad' to monitor areas affected by smog as this hazardous pollution has caused significant health problems for city residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation, and skin infections.These squads will be educating farmers about alternative methods for residue disposal, the hazards of burning crop residues and promoting the use of super seeders.Smog is a specific phenomenon that arises from a mixture of smoke and fog, occurring when certain polluting microparticles combine with cold, moist air and linger near the ground. This results in reduced visibility and can lead to various health problems.Previously, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had also called for ""climate diplomacy"" with India to mitigate smog impact in the province.She said that stubble burning in Punjab, India also impacts across the border because of air direction and hence both sides should make joint efforts to combat smog.""This issue needs to be taken up with India forthwith,"" she said.""Obstacles to environmental improvement must be removed. Smog causes breathing difficulties and damages eyesight,"" the CM added.Meteorology plays an important role in determining the level of air pollution in north Pakistan, just as it is a major factor in the neighbouring region of northwest India. After the rainy season crop is harvested, farmers from both sides tend to burn stubble adding to the existing causes of pollution caused due to industrial emissions and transport.Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, the Environment Ministry said,""The positive effects of the measures taken to combat smog will become visible in 8 to 10 years. Environmental protection has been included as a subject in the curriculum in the province.”She also urged the farmers to avoid burning the crop residues, as it harms not only the crops but also their children's health.","Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world on Monday with an alarming AQI of 394.

The temple has been out of service since 1960, according to Dawn News.Currently, there is no functional Hindu temple in the entire Narowal district, forcing the local Hindu population to either conduct religious ceremonies at home or travel to temples in Sialkot and Lahore.Ratan Lal Arya , the former president of the Pak Dharamsthan Committee , explained that the temple became non-functional after the ETPB took control of it. The Hindu community in Narowal, numbering over 1,453 people, has since lacked a proper place to conduct their rituals.Narowal district once had 45 Hindu temples, all of which have fallen into disrepair over time.The restoration work is currently focused on constructing a boundary wall around the four kanals of land, after which the temple will be handed over to the Pak Dharamsthan Committee.Hindus represent the largest minority group in Pakistan. Official estimates suggest that there are around 7.5 million Hindus in the country, though the community claims the number is closer to 9 million.

MALE: The president of cash-strapped Maldives will take a 50% pay cut as part of an austerity drive that will see public sector salaries reduced to prevent a debt crisis in the tourist hotspot, his office said Thursday. Mohamed Muizzu is introducing a mandatory 10% pay cut to most public sector jobs, leading the belt-tightening with the biggest salary reduction , his office said in a statement.A government source told AFP that Muizzu's annual salary will be reduced to 600,000 rufiyaa ($39,087) from next year - down from 1.2 million rufiyaa but nearly double the average household income of 316,740 rufiyaa per year, according to a 2016 census. Judges and lawmakers in parliament will be exempt from the cuts, though Muizzu's office said he expects them to share the burden by agreeing to a 10% cut voluntarily.Two weeks ago, Muizzu sacked more than 225 political appointees , including ministers, in a bid to reduce expenditure. Among those sacked were seven state ministers, 43 deputy ministers, and 178 political directors. The move is expected to save the country about $370,000 a month.

Dean Forbes , who transformed his life from homelessness to helming a billion-euro tech company, has just been named the UK’s most influential Black individual.Forbes, who is now 45 years old, leads Forterro , a software company worth €2 billion (£1.7 billion). His leadership has earned him a top spot on the Powerlist 2025 , which recognizes influential Black individuals in various fields.His recognition on the list, which celebrates leaders in business, technology, the arts, and more, reflects his journey from challenging beginnings to inspiring success.Established in 2006, the Powerlist celebrates Black excellence across fields such as business, science, and the arts, aiming to inspire young people with role models from diverse sectors.As one of the few Black CEOs globally to lead a billion-euro company, Forbes not only heads Forterro but also contributes as a partner at private equity firm Corten Capital . Additionally, he leads the Forbes Family Group (FFG), a charitable initiative that has raised over £400,000 this year alone for causes like the African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust .As per BBC, Forbes shared fond memories of his childhood in south-east London, where he recalled joyful times at community playgrounds and local youth clubs despite the economic challenges.Raised by a single mother with muscular dystrophy, he acknowledged how these early hardships shaped his resilient outlook.

Another student said he had been struggling to eliminate the infection for ""two to three months"" and speculated that ""sleeping together"" may have been the cause.Professor Hawthorne advised that, despite any stigma associated with scabies, people should not ignore their symptoms, as delaying treatment can worsen the condition and increase the risk of transmission.Medical professionals in the UK have recommend that all individuals infected receive simultaneous treatment with a pharmacy cream or lotion. Bedding and clothing should also be washed at a high temperature to reduce reinfection risk.","3,689 cases of scabies diagnosed in hospitals across England in the year ending in April, marking a rise from 2,128 cases the previous year.
