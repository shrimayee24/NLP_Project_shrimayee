Spirit Shines Through

Crucible Of Chaos

Moment Of Communion

Such A Long Journey

As a photojournalist, crowds fascinate me. And here I was, a speck in the middle of Maha Kumbh Mela, the largest gathering of humanity on Earth. Overwhelming, chaotic, and yet profoundly moving, this was an event unlike any other.For three days, I was immersed in a sea of millions, witnessing from close the fervour and devotion that drew people from every corner of this vast country to the banks of Triveni Sangam .My days would begin well before the first light of dawn, with a gruelling 20km trek to the riverbank. The sheer density of the crowd made walking a challenge. Jostled and pushed at every step, I kept going nevertheless, my eyes on the reward of this unique spiritual and cultural journey.What struck me was the determination and faith that drove the pilgrims’ progress. There were families that had walked for days, wideeyed children clinging to their parents, and elderly people perched on younger shoulders — all driven by the sacred calling of the river.In the midst of this human tide, I couldn’t help but notice the stark realities of a pilgrimage of this scale, especially for the underprivileged.Thousands slept in the open, huddling for warmth on chill-laden nights. Families cooked and ate by the roadside as droves of new arrivals filed past. The aroma of food and incense hung in the air, creating a quaint sensory symphony with the constant hum of chanting and prayers.Amid chaos and the daily struggles of ordinary pilgrims, there were moments of kindness and em pathy — strangers becoming friends and sharing whatever little they had with one another, children passing from hand to hand, and the elderly getting help from whoever they approached.With each passing day, the crowds seemed to grow thicker and almost impossible to manage. After being in several stampede-like situations in my short time there, I feared an accident was waiting to happen. And then a stampede unravelled right before my eyes. I was lucky to have enough time to escape being caught in the crush of panicky feet by climbing onto a mini-van.From the relative safety of my perch, I saw scores of children and women freeze as people around them desperately sought space that didn’t exist. The agony on their faces made me get down and somehow help carry 29 children to safety, as their mothers clung to the sides of the van.The sight of people screaming and crying as they tried to find their loved ones will forever haunt me. As the night wore on, I would learn that the stampede had claimed many lives. Siren-blaring ambulances carrying away the dead and the injured were a constant reminder of the tragedy. I felt helpless, unable to do anything but capture glimpses of the horror and pain through my lens.The next day, I stood on a roof, waiting for the sadhus to take a dip in the holy confluence. Then the news came that they had cancelled their plans due to the stampede the previous night. I was disappointed.As I prepared to leave, there was another announcement that the sadhus would arrive at 1pm. That didn’t happen either. I went back to the tent to pack my bags and leave by around 2.40pm. A third announcement confirmed that sadhus and the mela administration had decided to proceed with the ritual.I again ran 10km to the riverbank, my heart pounding with excitement. As I reached the water’s edge, I saw the most incredible sight — thousands of sadhus, their bodies painted in ash and vermilion, wading into the sacred waters to be in communion with their spirituality.Exhausted as I was by the end, all the tiredness vanished at the thought of having captured what I believed was a photo story for the ages.The journey back home was, however, fraught with challenges that would again test my patience and resolve. The roads were jammed, and we were stuck in traffic for hours. We took detours through villages, where the roads were narrow and winding.When we finally reached the main road, we were diverted again, adding hours to our journey. I missed my flight and had to wait another day to head home.In a way, the assignment ended just as it had started. Within minutes of reaching the media centre in Prayagraj on the day of our arrival, our belongings had been stolen from the car. This happened in the five-minute window that we were away collecting our media passes. I lost my clothes and two bags containing documents and hard disks were gone. For three days, I had to make do with a jacket and a blanket shared by a colleague.As I look back on the trip, the overriding feeling is of fulfilment. The experience was not just a story captured through my lens, but a life lesson in perseverance and the shared essence of our individual journeys. It’s a story I will carry with me.","Photographer SL Shanth Kumar of TOI captures the essence of Maha Kumbh Mela. Overwhelming, chaotic, and yet profoundly moving, this was an event unlike any other.

"AAP’s liquor policy caused Rs 2,000cr loss to government: CAG",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aaps-liquor-policy-caused-rs-2000cr-loss-to-government-cag/articleshow/118569185.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi government suffered a revenue loss of more than Rs 2,000 crore in implementing the contentious Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22, the Comptroller and Auditor General ( CAG ) revealed in a report that was tabled in Delhi assembly on Tuesday. The policy was withdrawn after nine months following registration of a case by CBI in July 2022 to probe alleged irregularities in its formulation and implementation.The federal auditor highlighted that the recommendations of an expert committee — formed by govt to identify lacunae in the previous excise policy and suggest changes for the formation of a new excise policy — were ignored without any justification. The new policy had inherent design issues which increased the risk of monopolisation and cartel formation.The CBI case and a related probe by ED into alleged charges of money laundering snowballed into a major political slugfest between BJP and AAP govt in Delhi. The investigating agencies arrested several people in the case, including the then chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal , his deputy, Manish Sisodia , and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh . All three are currently out on bail.CAG evaluated Delhi govt's regulation and supply of liquor in the capital from 2017-18 to 2020-21 financial years. The report was reportedly sent to the LG and Delhi govt nearly 10 months ago but was not tabled in the assembly. Newly elected CM Rekha Gupta tabled the report, which is said to be one of 14 pending with Delhi govt, on Tuesday.According to CAG, Delhi excise department claimed a loss of revenue to the tune of Rs 941.53 crore, saying timely permissions were not taken for opening liquor vends in non-conforming municipal wards while Rs 890.15 crore was lost on account of licence fee after 19 zonal licensees surrendered their permits much before the policy was withdrawn but re-tendering could not be done. It added that there was a loss of Rs 144 crore due to the “irregular grant of waiver” to licensees because of Covid-related restrictions and closure of shops for a month from Dec 28, 2021, to Jan 27, 2022, while Rs 27 crore was the shortfall of the security deposit collected from zonal licensees.The report states that Master Plan Delhi-2021 prohibited the opening of liquor vends in non-conforming areas but Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 mandated opening at least two retail vends in each ward. “The excise department did not take timely action to work out modalities for the proposed vends in non-conforming areas and the initial tender was floated on June 28, 2021, without taking comments from DDA and MCD,” it said.“Audit noted that due to a number of issues ranging from a weak policy framework to deficient implementation of the policy...there was a cumulative loss of approximately 2,002.68 crore,” said CAG.The report said that a group of ministers (GoM), headed by the then deputy CM and excise minister Manish Sisodia, changed several recommendations of the expert committee formed to formulate the policy and allowed private parties to handle wholesale liquor operations, introduced one-time bidding instead of a lottery system to allocate vends and let licensees have 54 vends against the recommended two per entity. It added that certain decisions with revenue implications — relaxation of the coercive action mandated against defaulter licensees, waiver in license fee, refund of earnest money deposit in case of the airport zone and correction in formulae to calculate maximum retail price of foreign liquor — were taken without having mandatory approval of the cabinet and opinion of the lieutenant governor.The auditor pointed out that the policy led to the risks of monopolies and brand pushing by allowing an “exclusive arrangement” between a few wholesalers and manufacturers and letting the distributors dominate the liquor supply chain. According to the report, just three distributors controlled over 71% of the total liquor supply chain in the capital and virtually decided which brand would succeed or fail.The report mentioned that of 367 registered Indian Made Foreign Liquor brands, 25 accounted for nearly 70% of total liquor sales in Delhi and very few popular ones formed the bulk of sales volume, thus pointing towards formation of a cartel.“The policy mandated an exclusive arrangement between a manufacturer and wholesalers, which led to the entire supply of all brands of a particular manufacturer being controlled by only one wholesaler. This becomes particularly relevant considering the fact that 367 IMFL brands were registered in Delhi,” the report mentioned.This, the CAG mentioned, led to limiting the number of total licensees and increasing the risk of monopolisation and cartel formation. Under the new excise policy, wholesale licences for the supply of IMFL and FL were granted to 14 business entities, whereas the same were granted to 77 manufacturers of IMFL and 24 suppliers of FL in the old policy (2020-21).“Similarly, for the purpose of retail vends, Delhi was divided into 32 zones (containing 849 vends) whose licences were granted to 22 entities through tendering whereas 377 retail vends were run by four govt corporations and 262 retail vends were allotted to private individuals previously,"" the report said.It added that the GoM had mentioned in its report that the entire liquor retail market under the old excise regime was controlled by a few big players through a fraudulent proxy model, but the new policy – instead of removing this anomaly – recommended distribution of retail licences in zones where one entity or person could get up to 54 vends (in two zones, the maximum one could be allotted).According to the report, the licensees were required to set up laboratories before they were granted the licence but the excise department issued the related guidelines only a week before the new policy was rolled out. “The essential pre-condition to set up laboratories to ensure quality of liquor supplied was not enforced by the excise department due to delay in issuing guidelines. The licensees were allowed an extension of two months initially for setting up of the laboratory though there was no provision for this in the policy. A further extension till March 31, 2022, was granted due to the Covid pandemic. Even after this extension, they were set up only in 19 out of 62 warehouses. Batch testing was not even started in these labs,” said the report.CAG said the department was supposed to constitute special teams to pick up samples from bonded warehouses, retail vends, hotels, clubs and restaurants across all brands and publish reports of the same on the website. No reply was provided in spite of multiple reminders and it could not be verified whether such special teams were ever constituted, it stated.“Several fundamental changes were effected in the excise policy for 2021-22 relating to the levy and collection of excise duty, administration of the liquor supply chain and coverage of retail operations. The actual policy contained provisions which were at variance with the underlying objectives for change in policy and the expert committee report,” the CAG report mentioned.“Responsibility and accountability should be fixed for the lapses observed and the enforcement mechanism should be strengthened,” it concluded.","Delhi government suffered a revenue loss of more than Rs 2,000 crore in implementing the contentious Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22. The new policy had inherent design issues which increased the risk of monopolisation and cartel formation.

Sajjan Kumar gets two life terms for 2 murders during 1984 riots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sajjan-gets-two-life-terms-for-2-murders-during-1984-riots/articleshow/118568629.cms,"File photo of Sajjan Kumar (Pic credit: PTI)

Testimonies of victims’ kin nailed Sajjan

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court Tuesday awarded two life terms to Congress ex-MP Sajjan Kumar (80) for murdering a Sikh man and his son during the anti-Sikh riots in Nov 1984. The court said the offences committed were ""undoubtedly brutal and reprehensible"".The two life terms - one for the double murders and another for offences under Section 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc.) of the IPC - will run concurrently.The court had on Feb 12 convicted Kumar in the case for killing Jaswant Singh and son Tarundeep Singh in Saraswati Vihar.Refusing to consider the case in the ""rarest of rare"" category to be fit for awarding death sentence, special judge Kaveri Baweja cited several ""mitigating factors"", including Kumar's age, his health condition and his bedridden wife. ""The satisfactory conduct of the convict as per report of jail authorities... the fact he has roots in society and the possibility of his reformation and rehabilitation are material considerations which, in my opinion, tilt the scales in favour of a sentence for life imprisonment,"" Baweja said.Kumar is already serving a life term in a case related to the anti-Sikh riots awarded by Delhi High Court in 2018. The court had specified in that case that he will remain in jail for the rest of his life.Senior advocate HS Phoolka, who appeared on behalf of the complainant in the case, explained the two life sentences awarded by the court. ""One has been awarded for murder under Section 302 of IPC and the other for offences under 436 IPC. The minimum prescribed sentence for murder and the maximum sentence for offences under 436 IPC have been awarded. Both sentences will run concurrently, but two life sentences will have a serious bearing on any plea by Kumar for bail. Getting bail will be difficult,"" said Phoolka.The court pointed out that the incident in question can said to be a part of the same chain of incidents for which Kumar was sentenced to life imprisonment by Delhi High Court on December 12, 2018. He had been found guilty of causing the death of five innocent persons during a similar incident of rioting following the assassination of Indira Gandhi.""Though the killing of two innocent persons in the present case is no less an offence...the above noted circumstances, in my opinion, do not make this a 'rarest of rare case' warranting imposition of the death penalty for the offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC,"" the court observed.Outlining the brutality suffered by the victims, the court said it has been established that the victims in the present case witnessed not only the brutal killing of their family members at the hands of the rioting mob, which Kumar was a part of, but also the burning and destruction of their house and looting of their belongings.""The helplessness of the victims and the lack of any support whatsoever from the neighbours and also the police have been established from their uncontroverted depositions. In these circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that this is a fit case where the convict must also be awarded life imprisonment for the offence punishable under Section 436 IPC r/w Section 149 IPC in addition to a fine,"" said the court.The court listed various aggravating factors in the case, including the murder of two innocent persons by burning them in the presence of their family members, inflicting injuries and the resultant continuing trauma of the survivor victims (wife, daughter, and niece of deceased victim Jaswant Singh) and destruction of their house and belongings by the mob, of which Kumar was a member during rioting, targeting of male members of a particular community and Kumar's conviction in a similar case by Delhi HC where five persons were murdered by a mob of which Kumar was held to be the leader.However, the court's inclination went in favour of the mitigating circumstances while sentencing Kumar.The court called the testimonies of the witnesses - the complainant wife, daughter and niece of deceased Jaswant Singh ""reliable"" and uncontroverted as they proved that their house at Raj Nagar in Saraswati Vihar, Delhi, was set on fire by the said mob.While sentencing Kumar, the court took note of a report of Tihar Jail authorities, which stated that on account of his prevailing health conditions, Kumar was unable to carry out his daily routine/activities properly. The report said that due to his frail health, he is also not able to do any work in jail.The report also said that he is under treatment and has been prescribed antidepressants and sleep medicines. He otherwise does not show any signs and symptoms of mental illness and does not require any psychiatric intervention at present, said the report of the jail administration.","A Delhi court awarded two life terms to Congress ex-MP Sajjan Kumar (80) for murdering a Sikh man and his son during the anti-Sikh riots in Nov 1984.

Now, as Maha Kumbh draws to a close after Wednesday's Maha Shivratri snan , the sacred hum of prayers will fade. The makeshift settlements along Triveni Sangam will be dismantled. The city will slowly return to its everyday rhythm.The farewell will take place at Kashi Vishwanath temple , with Naga sadhus - ascetics wrapped in ash and mystery - offering prayers on Maha Shivratri. Their journey, one that began in the confluence of Sangam, will culminate in Varanasi, the timeless city where Shiva himself is believed to reside. ""We will bow before Kashi Vishwanath in all its splendour,"" said Mahant Prem Giri, president of Juna Akhara, overseeing the final preparations. With chariots mounted on tractor trolleys and the air thick with chants of ""Har Har Mahadev"", the Shaiv Akharas will part ways.Some will remain in Varanasi to oversee internal matters and prepare for upcoming akhara elections, while the rest will disperse to distant hermitages, awaiting their next great gathering in Trimbakeshwar for the Nasik Kumbh in 2027.

"In rare surgery, docs separate ‘parasitic twin’ from 17-year-old",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-rare-surgery-docs-separate-parasitic-twin-from-17-year-old/articleshow/118568388.cms,"Freed from ‘parasitic twin’, boy makes quick recovery

NEW DELHI: In a rare surgical procedure, doctors at AIIMS successfully conducted a procedure to separate a ‘parasitic twin’ weighing 15 kg from a 17-year-old boy hailing from UP’s Unnao district. The occurrence of conjoined twins is notably uncommon, with frequencies of 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 births. In certain instances, incomplete development results in asymmetrical or ‘parasitic twins’, where one twin (autosite) develops fully while the other (parasite) remains dependent. Such cases are exceedingly rare, with only 40 documented instances in world medical literature.Dr Asuri Krishna, additional professor in the surgery department, noted that when the boy visited AIIMS OPD on Jan 28, they initially mistook his covered abdomen for a carried child. Instead, they discovered two fully developed lower limbs with external genitalia attached to his abdomen.Since birth, the boy lived with these additional limbs from his underdeveloped twin. The parasitic appendage, including underdeveloped male genitalia, grew proportionally with him. The boy experienced sensations, including touch, pain and temperature in the parasitic limb. Despite occasional abdominal discomfort, he maintained normal bodily functions without major health complications.His condition led to considerable social isolation and emotional difficulties throughout childhood. Local medical practitioners advised against removal, warning of potential fatality due to shared cardiac connections. These circumstances forced him to discontinue his education after 8 years of age. His physical limitations included the inability to sleep on his abdomen.The parasitic structure received nutrition through blood supply from the host twin. Medical experts noted that as patients age, such parasitic growths can potentially cause cardiovascular complications and neurological issues, posing life-threatening risks.Following a relative's suggestion, he sought treatment at AIIMS as a last hope. Upon arrival, a multidisciplinary team, including surgeons, radiologists and anaesthesiologists evaluated his condition.AIIMS specialists noted that whilst prenatal screening can detect this condition, the patient's socio-economic background prevented early diagnosis.CT angiography revealed the parasitic limb's blood supply originated from an internal mammary artery branch. The scan also identified a substantial abdominal cystic mass. After comprehensive preparation, surgery was scheduled for February 8, 2025.The complex procedure involved two phases: removing the parasitic limb through careful dissection and vessel ligation, followed by excision of the abdominal cystic mass.Surgeons discovered and removed underdeveloped testes within the attachment site tissue. The second phase required careful separation of the cystic mass from surrounding organs. They noted an unusually high bladder extension, which required precise surgical management. Post-procedure drainage and suturing completed the operation. The operation lasted between 2 and 2.5 hours.Doctors said that the patient was free from additional health complications. Recovery was swift, with successful oral feeding resuming the next day. The medical team removed the drain on the third day, and the patient was cleared to go home on the fourth day.After 17 years of physical and emotional challenges, the successful surgery brought immense relief. Initially experiencing phantom sensations, the patient could finally anticipate a conventional lifestyle.The achievement resulted from collaborative efforts of numerous specialists, including Dr Asuri Krishna, Dr VK Bansal, Dr Sushant Soren, Dr Brijesh Kumar Singh, Dr Abhinav Kumar, Dr Jaymeen Makwana from Surgical Disciplines, Dr Manish Singhal and Dr Sashank from plastic surgery, Dr Ganga Prasad and Dr Rakesh from anaesthesia, and Dr Atin and Dr Ankita from radiology.","17-year-old boy was born with two fully developed lower limbs with external genitalia attached to his abdomen.

Deep-sea quake in Bay of Bengal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deep-sea-quake-in-bay-of-bengal/articleshow/118568278.cms,"KOLKATA: The city woke up to tremors that measured 5.1 on the Richter scale on Tuesday morning. Even though the earthquake did not cause any destruction or injury, it led to momentary panic.The National Centre for Seismology confirmed the earthquake at 6.10 am and traced its epicentre to the Bay of Bengal, off the Puri coast, at a depth of 91 km and 340 km south of Kolkata.Social activist Soumali Chakraborty was shaken out of slumber by the quake. ""It was early in the morning, and I was still asleep when I felt my bed shaking. I was so scared as I had no clue as to what was happening. Later, I realised that it must be an earthquake. Luckily, it lasted only a few seconds,"" said the New Town resident.Neera Bhatiya of Sodepur was in the kitchen preparing the morning tea when she felt the tremor. She was taken aback, wondering what was happening. Soon she realised that an earthquake had just shaken parts of Kolkata and the surrounding areas. ""I was making my morning tea when I felt the tremor. It was quite subtle and lasted only a few seconds,"" said Bhatiya, who runs Eurokids International.Despite the moderate magnitude of the quake, there was no report of damage to property or injury. Seismologists said this was due to the depth of the epicentre, which reduced the intensity of the tremor on the surface. Shallow earthquakes originating five to 10 km below the surface are the ones that cause more damage.""The shaking of my bed woke me up. I was perplexed. I realised the situation when my phone showed an earthquake notification alert,"" said Howrah resident Subhankar Das. ""I wake up early every day, and Tuesday was no different. I was leaning on my bed, listening to music, when I suddenly felt the tremor. Later, I found out that it was an earthquake,"" added Tanisha Chetrii, a student from Dum Dum.Experts said that Kolkata lies in Seismic Zone III, indicating a moderate risk of earthquakes, although the city is not as prone to severe seismic activity as regions like the Northeast.Tuesday's earthquake follows a similar one on Jan 8, when mild tremors were felt across Kolkata and its neighbouring districts following a powerful earthquake in Tibet and parts of Nepal.""While preparing for a recording, I noticed my mic setup and table shaking slightly. At first, I thought it was because I tend to shake my legs, but then I realised that it wasn't the reason. After posting on Facebook, I found out it was actually an earthquake,"" said voice-over artist Malay Ghosh, a resident of Jadavpur.","Kolkata woke up to tremors that measured 5.1 on the Richter scale on Tuesday morning.

Thereafter, on Dec 28, 2021, the parties entered into an agreement. The initial contract was for 42 months from May 31, 2021, the date of the LOA, up to November 30, 2024. On the consultant's request, on Oct 4, 2024, the MMRDA extended the contract until Dec 2026. The Jan 3 notice informed it that its services were discontinued ""with effect from the 46th day of issuance of notice.""The judges referred to the Jan 3 notice, adding: ""...it is evident that the MMRDA has not assigned any reasons for discontinuation of services of the petitioner."" Also, the clause ""cannot be read to mean that the MMRDA has a licence to act unfairly, arbitrarily, or unreasonably in the contractual field without assigning reasons.""Agreeing with Dhond who cited Supreme Court decisions, they said, ""The State or its instrumentality even while acting in the contractual field is under an obligation to act fairly or cannot act arbitrarily or unreasonably."" Saraf had argued that the petitioner cannot seek to eschew its contractual commitments by seeking to invoke public law principles of reasonableness and fairness in a matter within the domain of private law contracts. ""In the instant case, the nature of controversy involves a public law element and therefore this Court in exercise of power of judicial review can examine whether the action of the instrumentality or agency of the State is fair, just, and equitable,"" the judges said.They also said in view of their conclusion, that the MMRDA's action of termination of the contract was arbitrary and unfair, ""it is not necessary for us to examine the nature of the contract."" For the very same reason, they also refused to accept Saraf's contention to relegate the petitioner to arbitration.","Bombay HC Tuesday set aside a Jan 3 notice by which it terminated the services of French engineering firm Systra's Indian subsidiary as a consultant for three Metro lines in Mumbai region. The petition was filed by Systra MVA Consulting (India) Pvt Ltd, which challenged the validity of the notice.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118566270,imgsize-414181,width-400,resizemode-4/118566270.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former Tihar PRO Sunil Kumar Gupta made an explosive claim that air hostesses of Sahara Airlines used to come to Subrata Roy in jail and remain with him for hours. This was one of the many facilities provided to the late founder of Sahara Group when he was in jail. In an interview with ANI, Gupta claimed that Arvind Kejriwal, then-chief minister of Delhi, was aware of all that but did not take any action.Recounting his experience with Subrata Roy when Roy was an inmate, Gupta said he was first kept in a regular jail. But he needed a facility with video conferencing so that he could negotiate with the buyers of his hotels following which he could pay the lenders back.

But I saw that a lot of illegal things were happening...Before this, the Delhi High Court had called me and it said that there are several complaints of bribery and extortion at the jail,"" Gupta said.Gupta said he raised the issues at meetings chaired by DG Prisons but the DG thought Gupta was complaining against him.

NEW DELHI: Government has set a target to construct 10,000 km of national highways (NHs) in 2025-26, as per the budget document, which is the lowest in the past seven years since 2018-19. However, continuing with the sharper focus on building wider and greenfield highways and expressways, the road transport and highways ministry has set a target for all high speed corridors to touch 5,800 km in the next one year.The ministry uploaded the detailed budget document on Monday.The details of highway construction since 2018-19 shows that the lowest was at 10,237 km in 2019-20 and the highest was 13,327 km in 2020-21 despite the impact of Covid-19 pandemic. During the last financial year, the overall NH construction stood at 12,349 km. Officials said that by March this year, the ministry is hopeful of achieving around 10,500 km.By mid-February, all agencies constructed around 8,000 km of NHs. Sources said though the target for FY26 may be revised at a later stage, the pace will remain less since now there are less number of highway projects that are under implementation. Slow pace of award of new projects in 2023-24 and the current financial year will impact the construction in the next two financial years.As per the detailed budget document, the ministry has set the target to raise around Rs 30,000 crore from monetisation of completed highway projects and getting around Rs 35,000 crore private investment.The govt has also earmarked Rs 128 crore for the implementation of cashless treatment to road crash victims across all states and UTs. At present, the scheme has been rolled out in Assam, Chandigarh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Puducherry. The road transport ministry has set a target to remove 1,000 ‘black spots’ on NHs and carry out road safety audits of 40,000 km of highways.","The road transport and highways ministry has set a target for all high speed corridors to touch 5,800 km in the next one year.

Congress's Kerala conundrum: Shashi Tharoor rubs it in with 'selfie message',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congresss-kerala-conundrum-shashi-tharoor-rubs-it-in-with-selfie-message/articleshow/118563023.cms,"Shashi Tharoor posts selfie with Piyush Goyal and Jonathan Reynolds

NEW DELHI: Is Shashi Tharoor on his way out of the Congress or is he just flexing his muscles for a greater role in Kerala Congress keeping in mind the assembly elections in the state next year? Well, any answers to this at present would only be a guess. But what we know for sure is that the Thiruvananthapuram MP will not give in without a fight - either way.Tharoor, who is already in the middle of a political storm triggered by his ""perceived praise"" for rivals, seems undeterred by the criticism within the party. Ever since the controversy erupted, Tharoor has not just defended his remarks but has also reinforced his viewpoint.Also read: Congress's mouthpiece attacks MP Shashi Tharoor for his remarks on PM Modi On Tuesday, the senior Congress leader posted a selfie with Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal and the UK's secretary of state for business and trade Jonathan Reynolds and welcomed the revival of long-stalled India-UK FTA negotiations.""Good to exchange words with Jonathan Reynolds, Britain's Secretary of State for Business and Trade, in the company of his Indian counterpart, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal,"" he said of their meeting at an event on Monday. ""The long-stalled FTA (Free Trade Agreement) negotiations have been revived, which is most welcome,"" Tharoor said on X.While on the face of it there is nothing wrong in Tharoor posting a selfie with a BJP Union minister or for that matter praising the revival of India-UK talks, more so as he chairs the parliamentary standing committee on external affairs. But the fact that this comes from someone who is already under party fire for praising the positives of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US trip and highlighting the progress of start-up sector in Kerala ruled by the LDF government, shows that the Congress leader is in no mood to buckle.Also read: Row over praise for rivals: Should Congress be wary of Shashi Tharoor? The Congress MP, who had earlier defended his remarks and said that when something good emerges, it is petty not to acknowledge it, has used his posts on X to convey a message to his critics within the party.On February 24, Tharoor had tagged a news report titled ""Left, BJP and Congress share stage during Kerala's investors' meet"" and posted ""Good to see this. Economic development should, as far as possible, be above the petty divisions of party politics.""On February 22, Tharoor had a cryptic message for his baiters when he posted a Thomas Gray quote as thought for the day on his timeline - ""Where ignorance is bliss, 'Tis folly to be wise."" The message here was loud and clear.On February 16, Tharoor had posted a long note countering the critics who were targeting him for praising the Left Front government in Kerala. Stating that he was bemused by the raging controversy in Kerala over his article, Tharoor said the article did not mention party politics, but spoke of things Kerala needs to do to get out of the economic doldrums — changes that he has been demanding in the state during all his 16 years in politics.Tharoor is known to fight his battles against all odds. His contest for the post of Congress president against Mallikarjun Kharge is a case in point. The BJP claims the Gandhis have sidelined him within the Congress for taking on ""their nominee"" in the 2022 party elections. Tharoor, on his part, has been vocal about the changes that the party needs to revive from its political slump and cites his four consecutive Lok Sabha wins to prove his point.The Congress, on the other hand, will need to do a tightrope walk as it tries to find a solution to this conundrum. The party, which has already lost several leaders in the last 10 years, would not want to lose another one and give the BJP a handle to attack its leadership. But it can also not give in completely to Tharoor's demands and antagonize the state leadership. With assembly elections due in Kerala next year, the Congress will need to handle the Tharoor challenge deftly.","Shashi Tharoor is in the middle of a political storm triggered by his ""perceived praise"" for rivals.

Three out of five in India succumb to cancer after diagnosis: ICMR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-out-of-five-in-india-succumb-to-cancer-after-diagnosis-icmr/articleshow/118567092.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nearly three out of five people in India succumb following cancer diagnosis, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has claimed. The apex health research agency's claim is based on an analysis of the estimates of incidence and mortality of cancer from GLOBOCAN 2022 - an online database that provides cancer statistics for 185 countries.India is one of the largest contributors to global cancer burden, ranking third in terms of new incidences. China ranks one in cancer incidence followed by the US.According to the ICMR study, published in the journal 'The Lancet Regional - Southeast Asia', the incident to mortality percentage in India stands at approximately 65, which means that three out of five individuals would be expected to die if diagnosed with cancer. The incident to mortality percentages in China and the US stand at 50 and 23 respectively, according to the study.Children (0-14) and reproductive-age (15-49) individuals, ICMR says, have a 0.1%-2.3% chance of developing cancer and a 0.08%-1.3% chance of dying from it. However, the study adds, middle-aged and geriatric individuals have a higher 8.3%-10.3% chance of developing cancer with a 5.5%-7.6% chance of dying from the disease.Women bear a ""disproportionate burden"" with higher crude incidence (104.5 per 1,00,000 population) and crude mortality rate (64.2 per 1,00,000) compared to men (91.5 per 1,00,000 and 62.2 per 1,00,000), according to the study, which also says that trend analysis for past mortality patterns indicate cancer mortality rates in India are on the rise for last two decades.Future projections show that cancer incidence and mortality will continue to rise in the coming years, with mortality rates expected to increase from 64.7 to 109.6 between 2022 and 2050, it says.ICMR warns India is poised to face formidable challenge in cancer control in coming years due to the transition of the current reproductive-age population (15-49 years) to middle-aged (50-69) and geriatric (70+) groups. It has called for proactive measures to enhance early detection, access to quality care, and public health initiatives.Chairperson of Max Institute of Cancer Care, Dr Harit Chaturvedi, said fight against cancer must be multi-pronged. ""We need to create awareness on avoiding unhealthy eating and sedentary lifestyles that are linked to development of several non-communicable diseases, including cancers,"" he said. He added that diagnostic facilities and treatment for cancer need to be made accessible and affordable for early detection and improved outcome.Realising the challenge posed by the rising incidence and mortality caused by the disease, govt in the Union budget 2025-26 said it is planning to have daycare cancer centres in all 759 districts of the country where chemotherapy, essential medication and biopsy services will be made available. Top health ministry officials said these centres will also be utilised for screening high-risk individuals for common cancers.","India is one of the largest contributors to global cancer burden, ranking third in terms of new incidences.

NEW DELHI: The Sino-Indian ties are set for a reboot, following the Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan last year and the subsequent visits to Beijing by NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Vikram Misri that resulted in a series of “common understandings on the boundary question and practical cooperation”, said Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong Tuesday.The remarks followed the recent meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Wang Yi in which the former had lauded cooperation between the 2 countries on multilateral forums, particularly the G20. Doval had visited China in December for talks between the Special Representatives that took place after a gap of 5 years. This was followed by Misri’s visit to China during which India and China agreed to resume Kailash Mansarovar Yatra , trans-border river cooperation and, in principle, direct air services.“Since the meeting between President Xi Jinping and PM Modi in Kazan last year, the 2 sides have earnestly implemented the important consensus reached by the two leaders, engaged in active interactions at various levels, and reached many common understandings on improving bilateral relations,’’ said Xu, interacting with journalists on the margins the 3rd China-India Youth Dialogue. Calling India-China relationship one of the most important in the world, the ambassador said that the 2 countries are promoting positive changes in the international balance of power.For the first time in 5 years, Modi and Xi had met in Russia in October 2024 on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, days after the 2 countries reached an agreement to complete the military disengagement process in eastern Ladakh. India, however, wants to tread cautiously in normalising ties with China and, in his meeting with Wang last week, Jaishankar stressed the importance of restoring mutual trust in bilateral ties and jointly maintaining border peace.Calling for respecting each other’s core interests, Xu said that Xi and Modi had agreed to handle relations from a long-term perspective, prevent “specific disagreements” from affecting the overall relationship, enhance strategic mutual trust and ensure peace and tranquillity in the border areas.China will host the SCO summit later this year and expects Modi to participate. Appreciating India’s contribution to the Eurasian bloc, Xu said China is willing to work with India to host a “friendly, united and fruitful” summit. China holds the rotating presidency of SCO this year.According to the ambassador, the recent high-level engagements had created an important opportunity for the “reboot of China-India relations and provided a broader platform for exchanges and cooperation between the youth of our 2 countries”.","The Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan last year and the subsequent visits to Beijing by NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Vikram Misri resulted in a series of “common understandings on the boundary question and practical cooperation’, said Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong Tuesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118567866,imgsize-1050506,width-400,resizemode-4/118567866.jpg"

He urged people to observe National Science Day by spending “One Day as a Scientist”, which he said will foster curiosity among children and youth about science.On the country’s space sector achievements, Modi said, “Champions Trophy is going on these days and there is an atmosphere of cricket for everyone. We all know the thrill of a century in cricket. But today, I am not going to talk about cricket, rather I will talk about the wonderful century that India has made in space. Last month, the country was a witness to Isro's 100th rocket launch. This is not just a number, but it shows our resolve to achieve ever-new heights in space science. Our space journey started in a very normal manner. There were challenges in every step, but our scientists continued moving forward achieving victory over them.”“With time, the list of our achievements in space flights continues to grow longer. Be it building a launch vehicle, success of Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and Aditya L1 or carrying out the unprecedented mission of sending 104 satellites into space in one go with one rocket. The ambit of Isro's success has been quite large. In the past 10 years, around 460 satellites have been launched, in which many satellites of other countries are also included,"" the PM said.On growing women’s power in the industry, Modi said, “The participation of women power has been continuously rising in the space sector.

For our youth who want to do something thrilling and exciting in their life, the space sector is becoming an excellent option for them.""Speaking about National Science Day 2025, which will be celebrated on Feb 28, the PM said that the interest and passion of youth in science matters a lot. ""You try to spend one day as a scientist. You must visit places like a research lab, planetarium or space centre that day. This will increase your curiosity about science. Like space and science, India is rapidly making its mark in another field. That is AI (Artificial intelligence). I went to Paris to take part in an AI summit.

NEW DELHI: After the breakthrough in developing a hyperloop test track (422m) by IIT Madras with support from Indian Railways , the government is now planning development of a 50km corridor for commercial transport, said minister Ashwini Vaishnaw . It may be the longest hyperloop track in the world.""The first tube will go a long way in developing technologies. The time has come when after the first two grants of $1million each (nearly ₹9cr), the third grant of $1million will be given to IIT Madras for further developing the hyperloop project in a nice way. And once we see the commercial or rather pre-commercial where the product is ready, then within the railway set-up we will start the first commercial project. We will decide a site, which can be used for good commercial transportation of 40km-50km and then we will go for it,"" Vaishnaw said while addressing the closing ceremony of Asia's first Global Hyperloop Competition by IIT Madras.Sources said the test track for commercial operation will help railways assess viability of the technology. The hyperloop track can allow speeds of up to 1,200kmph. The successful development of the first test track, which was completed in Dec last year, will be the base for future development.Hyperloop systems are expected to dramatically reduce travel times between cities, offering an alternative to traditional rail and air travel. The hyperloop concept envisions high-speed, low-pressure pods travelling at speeds of up to 1,200 kmph.The hyperloop system was first conceptualised by Swiss professor Marcel Juffer in the 1970s. In 1992, Swissmetro SA was set up to develop this project, but it went into liquidation in 2009. At present, there are eight promising hyperloop projects in the world, including Virgin Hyperloop which has been actively testing its systems in Nevada. Canadian firm TransPod is also constructing a test track to validate their design.In an official statement, the railway ministry said IIT-Madras and railways will also work together on vertical take-off landing vehicles.","The government is planning development of a 50km corridor for commercial transport.

NEW DELHI/AMRITSAR: A batch of 12 illegal Indian immigrants deported from the US to Panama arrived Sunday in Delhi via Istanbul on a Turkish Airlines flight, making them the first group to be sent back without restraints since three American military aircraft brought 332 deportees to Amritsar within a fortnight this month.The 12 deportees are said to be among 50 undocumented Indian nationals who reportedly arrived in Panama recently. Panama has been assisting the US in its deportation efforts.According to local media reports, the UN-affiliated International Organisation for Migration helped purchase plane tickets for people of various nationalities whose citizenship was confirmed, 17 of them Indians. More deportees from the group are expected next week once MEA verifies their nationality.Deportation from Panama is being carried out under the Regional Assisted Voluntary Return Programme , an IOM protection and support response to facilitate the dignified, safe, regular and orderly return, as well as voluntary and based on an informed decision, of migrants to their countries of origin.Four men from Punjab in the latest batch took a connecting IndiGo flight from Delhi to Amritsar.Airport authorities in the city were informed in advance about the arrival of Patiala resident Jatinder Singh, Maninder Dutt of Jalandhar, and Jugraj Singh and Harpreet Singh from Gurdaspur, but it wasn't immediately clear whether they came unescorted all the way from Panama.Official sources said after the mandatory debriefing that Jatinder, 34, paid a travel agent from Patiala Rs 52 lakh to help him enter the US through a route criss-crossing Guyana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.Maninder, 21, put his faith and Rs 42 lakh in the hands of a Delhi-based illegal immigration agent, who then sent him on a perilous journey through Spain, Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. Jugraj and Harpreet, both 30, paid Rs 38 lakh each to an agent from Batala and reached the US via Nicaragua.Punjab NRI minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal said the state govt had registered cases against 15 travel agents based on complaints from natives of the state who were deported from the US this month. Of these, three agents have been arrested, while police have been raiding offices and homes in search of the absconding 12.Sources said the deportees who arrived on Sunday told authorities they intended to file cases against the travel agents who duped them only if there was a chance of getting their money back.The first US military flight that arrived on Feb 5 brought 104 deportees, with both men and women handcuffed and their feet shackled. The second flight, carrying 119 deportees, arrived on Feb 15. The third flight, with 112 deportees, landed on Feb 16, this time with only the men in shackles.",Four men from Punjab in the latest batch took a connecting IndiGo flight from Delhi to Amritsar.

Shashi Tharoor staking claim in Kerala Congress as 'new pole',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shashi-tharoor-staking-claim-in-kerala-congress-as-new-pole/articleshow/118566379.cms,"NEW DELHI: When the Left bloc stunned Congress by bucking Kerala's ""revolving door"" politics to return to office in the state in 2021, Congress overhauled the state unit with factionally unaffiliated faces, and announced it was designed to end the notoriously entrenched factionalism in the party. Four years later, senior MP Shashi Tharoor staking claim to leadership ahead of assembly elections in 2026 has scrambled the thinly-veiled factional peace, with him as a new pole in the state Congress.Tharoor has adopted an unconventional style. Just like his praise for the growth of start-ups under the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala, on Tuesday, he posted a photo with Union minister Piyush Goyal and the UK trade minister to laud the revival of FTA talks -- triggering a buzz on social media.While Congress criticised Tharoor's praise of the Left govt, the MP's remarks questioning the party's strength in Kerala have thrown out in the open concerns which are privately shared by a large section of Congress. Party leaders are unsure if Congress can oust the LDF this time too. The concerns are based on the threat of fragmentation in the Congress support base, because of BJP's strong pursuit of the Christian community, as well as the fear of loss of some Hindu votes, which has made its dependence on key Muslim ally IUML stronger.The Left too is making a similar push for a slice of Congress votes. Congress seems to be banking on the anti-incumbency against the Left. Tharoor has put out in the open a widespread worry in the party. In the process, he has portrayed himself as the solution because of what he terms as his ability to reach out to non-Congress voters, and thereby, expand the party tent.Having won four successive terms from a difficult Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha seat , Tharoor is a popular leader, but is also a loner in the state unit, viewed by peers as an interloper. He has thrown his hat in the leadership ring of Kerala but Congress sources say it would not be possible for the party to accommodate his claim ahead of other local leaders. Many believe Tharoor may have taken a maximalist position and could be vying for a greater role in Kerala affairs but not necessarily to be declared the outright face. Given the precarious situation that Congress is in, it would be difficult for the party to not accommodate Tharoor in a meaningful way.His fresh remarks have triggered speculation about his future while party leaders have said Tharoor will not leave Congress. But even his disengaging himself from active party affairs ahead of assembly elections would not help the Congress cause. It is to be seen if Congress can find a way to accommodate the restive leader, a tricky task in which the party has failed in many states in the recent years.","Senior MP Shashi Tharoor staking claim to leadership ahead of assembly elections in 2026.

Supreme Court reverses expulsion of RJD MLC for mocking Nitish Kumar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-reverses-expulsion-of-rjd-mlc-for-mocking-nitish-kumar/articleshow/118568194.cms,"No place for aggression and indecency in Parl proceedings, says SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday reversed Bihar Legislative Council's July 26, 2024 decision to expel RJD leader Sunil Kumar Singh from the House for mocking and mimicking chief minister Nitish Kumar, and said the punishment was ""excessive and disproportionate"" to the nature of his misconduct.While a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotishwar Singh came down heavily on Singh for his conduct on the floor of the House and before the ethics committee, it said it would be just and proper punishment to convert the more than 18-month period of expulsion as the period of suspension from the House for the RJD leader.Also, while asking the House to take him back, the bench said he would not be entitled to any remuneration or other monetary benefits for the period of his suspension.SC had earlier stayed the by-election for the seat that had fallen vacant after Singh's expulsion.In a verdict which sought to strike a balance between the principle that punishment should not be disproportionate to the offence and the need for decorum and proper conduct in legislatures, the bench said,""There is no place for aggression and indecency in the proceedings of Parliament or legislature.Members are expected to show complete respect and deference towards each other.""The bench said, ""This expectation is not merely a matter of tradition or formality, it is essential for the effective functioning of democratic processes. It ensures that debates and discussions are productive, focused on the issues at hand, and conducted in a manner that upholds the dignity of the institution.""It emphasised that the right to speak inside the House could not be harnessed as a tool by members to insult, humiliate or defame fellow members, ministers and most importantly, the chair itself.Simultaneously, Justices Kant and Singh said the power of the House to punish a member for misconduct or misdemeanour could not be harsh or disproportionate. ""Courts must act decisively to strike down excessively harsh actions that threaten our democratic fabric while simultaneously exercising restraint to avoid encroaching upon the legislative domain. We reiterate that courts must reflect a certain degree of deference to the legislative will and wisdom, intervening only when the action prescribed is so disproportionate that it shocks the intrinsic sense of justice,"" Justice Kant said.Writing the 50-page judgment analysing the sensitive issue of legislative supremacy with regard to proceedings in the House and limited scope of judicial intervention, Justice Kant said, ""It is imperative that such legislative action remains mindful of the fundamental principle that the purpose of imposing punishment is not to serve as a tool for retribution but rather to uphold and enforce discipline within the House.""The primary objective of the punishment should be to maintain decorum and foster an environment of constructive debate and deliberation, the SC said.",Supreme Court reverses Bihar Legislative Council's decision to expel RJD leader Sunil Kumar Singh from the House.

NEW DELHI: Holding that the evidence of a child witness stands on the same footing as any other witness if the child is competent to testify, Supreme Court has convicted and sentenced a man to life imprisonment for killing his wife by relying upon the statement of the couple's seven-year-old daughter who witnessed the incident.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra set aside the order of Madhya Pradesh high court acquitting the accused by discarding the statement of his daughter who was present in the house when her mother was killed.The top court said the Evidence Act does not prescribe any minimum age for a witness, and evidence of a child witness cannot be rejected outright.""The only precaution which the court should take while assessing the evidence of a child witness is that such witness must be a reliable one due to the susceptibility of children by their falling prey to tutoring ,"" the bench said.However, this in no manner means that the evidence of a child must be rejected outrightly at the slightest of discrepancy, rather what is required is that the same is evaluated with great circumspection,"" the bench said.It added, ""While appreciating the testimony of a child witness, courts are required to assess whether the evidence of such witness is its voluntary expression and not borne out of the influence of others and whether the testimony inspires confidence.""Terming child witnesses as dangerous because they are prone to being influenced, the apex court said trial courts should be alert about this aspect while recording the statement.It said there is no rule requiring corroboration to the testimony of a child witness before any reliance is placed on it and the insistence of corroboration is only a measure of caution and prudence that the courts may exercise if deemed necessary in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case.""Child witnesses are considered as dangerous witnesses as they are pliable and liable to be influenced easily, shaped and moulded and as such the courts must rule out the possibility of tutoring. If the courts, after careful scrutiny, find that there is neither any tutoring nor any attempt to use the child witness for ulterior purposes by the prosecution, then the courts must rely on the confidence-inspiring testimony of such a witness in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused. In the absence of any allegations by the accused in this regard, an inference as to whether the child has been tutored or not, can be drawn from the contents of his deposition,"" it said.","A man was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for killing his wife by relying upon the statement of the couple's seven-year-old daughter who witnessed the incident.

He said Tamil Nadu might lose eight Lok Sabha seats if the delimitation process was solely population-based.Emerging from a cabinet meeting at the state secretariat, the CM launched one more battle against the Centre, this one against delimitation, saying TN has been forced into ""yet another struggle"" to secure its rights. ""Delimitation is a sword dangling over southern states. Tamil Nadu, which is the leading state in all development indicators, will be severely affected. There is a danger of reduction of existing 39 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state,"" Stalin said. State govt will formally invite all 40 political parties registered with the Election Commission of India to the all-party meeting.Stalin later said on X that a democratic process should not penalise states that successfully managed population growth, led in development, and made significant contributions to national progress. ""We need a fair, transparent, and equitable approach that upholds true federalism,"" Stalin said. The Union govt proposed to undertake a delimitation exercise based on population figures in 2026. The decline in population would lead to reduced Lok Sabha representation for the state, while states with larger populations would get more representation.Stalin stressed the importance of the issue beyond just the number of Lok Sabha members, emphasising its connection to states' rights. He called for a united front from all political parties to address this concern, urging their participation in the upcoming meeting. It was not just on the Union govt's trilingual policy, but more parliamentary representation could help the state address issues like NEET and funding from the Centre, Stalin said.When questioned about the Centre's response to TN's concerns on various issues, the CM said, ""There is no reply. They are just silent."" On a query whether the Union govt's actions were instigating a language war, Stalin responded, ""Certainly."" He said the DMK govt was ready to engage in such a war.In a post on X, BJP state president K Annamalai said Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself clearly stated that delimitation would be favourable to all, including southern states, as and when it happens.

James Jones on Aaron Rodgers' future

Are Lakers championship level with Luka Dončić, what is Aaron Rodgers' market value? | THE FACILITY

It's clear that Aaron Rodgers is not the quarterback he used to be. Former Green Bay Packers wide receiver James Jones , who played with Rodgers, made this observation on his visit to FS1's ""The Facility"". Jones was a part of a conversation regarding Rodgers' future, as the New York Jets are looking past the veteran quarterback. Over the course of his career, Rodgers was generally considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of his generation, but in recent seasons, his on-field play has significantly deteriorated.Aaron Rodgers is no longer the quarterback he used to be, as pointed out by his old teammate James Jones in a recent guest spot on FS1's ""The Facility."" The group debated Rodgers' future with the New York Jets beyond the veteran QB. Although Rodgers used to be considered among the best quarterbacks of his generation, his play has tailed off in recent years.After being traded to the Jets in 2023, Aaron Rodgers played only four snaps before a ruptured Achilles tendon ended his season. He returned the following year but struggled to make an impact, throwing for 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions, even with the addition of Davante Adams. Now, with the Jets parting ways with the four-time MVP, who will sign Rodgers in 2025.Jones said, ""Aaron's never been in this situation. Aaron has been MVP, MVP, MVP, MVP—Super Bowl MVP... Eeverything Aaron Rodgers wants, Aaron Rodgers got. Aaron Rodgers has never been in this situation where—I ain't gonna say he's begging—but who want me? No, no, for real. He's never been in this situation.”He added, ""So Aaron Rodgers cannot walk into these teams like he's MVP Aaron Rodgers, you cannot. So when you go meet with the Vikings or you go meet with the Steelers, the mindset you have to have is: What y’all need? That's it. What y’all need?”Several teams in need of a quarterback could be interested in acquiring Aaron Rodgers for the 2025 season, including the Tennessee Titans, Las Vegas Raiders, and Pittsburgh Steelers. With his extensive experience and established legacy, Rodgers will likely have no trouble securing a new team to play for next year.Aside from his deteriorating play on the field, Aaron Rodgers has also been regarded by some as a possible distraction off the field, given his past history of issuing provocative and controversial remarks unrelated to football. Through the years, his pronouncements on such social and political topics have drawn public attention and controversy, making some wonder if he is able to focus and exert his influence in the locker room.Also read : ""I have nothing but respect”: Tyrod Taylor shares candid thoughts on Aaron Rodgers and leading the Jets in 2025 With these dynamics in place, it will be interesting to see how the mesh of his struggles on the field and off-field scandals will affect the 41-year-old as he tries to extend his playing career in the NFL. What he does next may decide the way he is perceived, not only as an athlete, but as a public figure in the sport.","Former Green Bay Packers wide receiver James Jones made the observation on FS1's ""The Facility"" Jones was a part of a conversation regarding Rodgers' future, as the New York Jets are looking past the veteran quarterback.

Vivek Ramaswamy on track to become third US governor of Indian-origin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vivek-ramaswamy-on-track-to-become-third-us-governor-of-indian-origin/articleshow/118547051.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington

: Entrepreneur-turned-Trump acolyte Vivek Ramaswamy will be on track to become the third governor of Indian-origin in US after jumping into the gubernatorial race in Ohio on Monday, promising, among other largesse to voters, abolishment of income tax and property tax in the state.Two other Indian-Americans, Piyush ""Bobby"" Jindal in Louisiana (2008-2016) and Nimrata ""Nikki"" Haley in South Carolina (2011-2017), have preceded him as US governors of Indian-origin, illustrating the rapid strides the community has made in politics, including having half dozen lawmakers in Congress. Before Jindal's breakthrough, George Ariyoshi (1974–1986), a Japanese American, was the first Asian-American governor in Hawaii, a state with a pronounced Asian orientation. Gary Locke (Washington, 1997–2005) became the first and so far only Chinese-American governor in the US.Cincinnati-born Ramaswamy, 39, whose parents emigrated from Palakkad in Kerala, was immediately endorsed by President Trump. ""Vivek Ramaswamy is running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio. I know him well, competed against him, and he is something SPECIAL. He’s Young, Strong, and Smart! Vivek is also a very good person, who truly loves our Country. He will be a GREAT Governor of Ohio, will never let you down, and has my COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT!"" the MAGA supremo posted about a former rival-turned-fanboy who has described Trump as the greatest US President of the century.Polls show Ramaswamy viewed favorably by voters in Ohio, a former bellwether state that is now reliably red, having voted for Trump by more than 8 points in the last three elections. He will be up against Ohio's Republican Attorney General Dave Yost, and Heather Hill, a Black entrepreneur from Appalachia, in the GOP primaries, while Dr. Amy Acton, the former state health director, is running as a Democrat.Ramaswamy also found support from Elon Musk, who posted a starchy ""Good luck, you have my full endorsement!"" message on X.Trump appointed the tech duo to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but Ramaswamy, evidently a #2, peeled off after two weeks on the job, following a revolt by MAGA hyper-nationalists who took exception to his screed on American culture and the mediocrity it engendered while expounding virtues typically associated with successful Asian communities, such as an emphasis on education.""The reason top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over “native” Americans isn’t because of an innate American IQ deficit (a lazy & wrong explanation). A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture....Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long (at least since the 90s and likely longer)...a culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,"" Ramaswamy had written, igniting fury in the MAGA base which saw him as bashing the American way of life.Ironically, Ramaswamy made the argument in support of Musk, who had lamented the lack of engineering talent in the US in defense of H1-B visas, but who has since backed down on the issue having thrown his DOGE partner under the bus. Some political observers though saw Ramaswamy's bailing out of DOGE as a political astute move to line up another run for the White House which they see as easier from a governor's mansion or from the Senate, rather than be hamstrung by DOGE and any potential mishaps there.In his first campaign speeches, Ramaswamy, a multi-millionaire like most people in Trump's inner circle, Ramaswamy spoke of the ""need to bring down the income tax eventually down to ZERO because you (voters) deserve to keep what you earn,"" adding, ""It is your money, not the government's.""He also proposed bringing down property taxes in the state immediately, and eventually down to ZERO, arguing, ""If you own land, it should not feel like it's a lease from the government.""Ramaswamy has degrees from Harvard (biology undergrad) and Yale (law), and before he founded the bio-pharma Roivant Sciences, he worked as an investment partner at a hedge fund, and later co-founded an investment firm, Strive Asset Management. His mother Geeta Ramaswamy is a graduate of Mysore Medical College and worked as a geriatric psychiatrist for Merck and Schering-Plough, while his father Ganapathy Ramaswamy, a graduate of the National Institute of Technology Calicut, worked as an engineer for General Electric."," Entrepreneur-turned-Trump acolyte Vivek Ramaswamy will be on track to become the third governor of Indian-origin in US after jumping into the gubernatorial race in Ohio on Monday.

Taylor Swift left devastated by the booed at the Super Bowl LIX



The Kansas City Chiefs' and Philadelphia Eagles' Super Bowl showdown was memorable not only because the Eagles pummeled the Chiefs 40-22, but also because of a surprise encounter between Taylor Swift. In New Orleans to root on her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, Swift received an unwelcoming welcome.When she made her appearance on the big screen in the middle of the game, rather than applause, a storm of boos rose from the crowd. The response was said to have been unexpected to the Grammy-winning artist, thus a surprise moment amidst the high-profile championship game.As she was supporting her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, in New Orleans, Taylor Swift experienced a surprising reaction from the audience. When she popped up on the video board during the game, there were boos throughout the stadium, rather than applause.

""Taylor has been left devastated by the boos,"" the source told Heatworld.com. ‘It was a really shocking moment – especially after she was riding so high following the Eras Tour. She sees herself as a good person who strives to make the best decisions, so to receive a public bashing was quite traumatising.”It was a terrible moment, and particularly because Swift was only present to be backing Travis Kelce and watching the game. But some fans just went too far, making an experience that otherwise should have been enjoyable into one that obviously lingered with her.Fans have the right to express themselves as they wish, but booing Swift was unwarranted, except for the purpose that Eagles fans might have seen her as being on the other side based on her association with Kelce.

What is Meta accused of



Meta denies allegations

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is facing a lawsuit alleging that it prefers hiring foreign workers over American citizens because they can be paid less. A US federal judge, according to Reuters, has ruled that the lawsuit can move forward, allowing three US citizens to pursue a proposed class action against the company. The lawsuit is filed under the case name Rajaram et al v Meta Platforms Inc in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, with case number 22-02920.The lawsuit was filed by three individuals: IT worker Purushothaman Rajaram, software engineer Ekta Bhatia, and data scientist Qun Wang. All three are naturalized US citizens who claim they applied for multiple jobs at Meta between 2020 and 2024 but were rejected due to what they describe as Meta’s ""systematic preference"" for hiring visa holders instead of American workers.US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco pointed to statistics showing that 15% of Meta’s US workforce holds H-1B visas, which are typically given to foreign professionals, while only 0.5% of the overall workforce in the country has such visas. She also referenced Meta’s 2021 agreement to pay up to $14.25 million, including a fine, to settle US government claims that it routinely ignored American workers for jobs set aside for temporary visa holders.Meta has dismissed the claims as baseless and stated that it will continue to defend itself in court. The company argued that there is no evidence it intended to discriminate or that the plaintiffs would have been hired if they were not US citizens.","A US federal judge has allowed three US citizens to pursue a proposed class action against the company.

Trump’s $5 million 'gold card' visa: What it means for Indians stuck in green card backlogs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-5-million-gold-card-visa-what-it-means-for-indians-stuck-in-green-card-backlogs/articleshow/118570216.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

Here is an explainer FAQs:



Q: What is the 'gold card' visa, and how does it differ from a traditional green card?

Q: How will the gold card impact Indian nationals waiting for green cards?

Offer a faster route for wealthy Indians who can afford it.

Exclude middle-tier investors who previously used EB-5 as an alternative to employment-based green cards.

Shift focus from job creation to wealth, favouring Indian business tycoons over skilled professionals.

Q: Will the gold card replace the EB-5 investor visa program?

Q: Can Indians currently on H-1B or EB-2/EB-3 visas apply for the gold card?

Q: How will this affect Indians who were considering the EB-5 visa?

Q: How many gold cards will be available, and will there be a cap like EB-5?

Q: Could Indian tech CEOs, startup founders, or business leaders benefit from the gold card?

Q: Will the gold card need congressional approval, or can Trump implement it directly?

Q: What are the risks associated with the gold card?

Uncertainty: Details on processing, vetting, and long-term benefits are still vague.

Legal challenges: Congress or courts may challenge its legality.

Affordability: At $5 million, it excludes many Indians who could afford EB-5 but not this steep jump.

Q: What other options do Indians have if the gold card is too expensive?

Is the gold card a game-changer for Indians?

The gold card presents a fast-track residency option—but only for India’s ultra-rich. For the broader Indian diaspora, especially H-1B holders and EB-5 investors, it signals a shift toward wealth-based immigration, leaving most to navigate the backlogged employment-based system. While it may be an attractive shortcut for billionaires and corporate-backed talent, for the majority, it represents a roadblock rather than a solution.

(With inputs from agencies)

President Donald Trump’s proposal to introduce a $5 million ""gold card"" visa as a replacement for the EB-5 investor program has sparked major concerns among Indian nationals waiting for US green cards . With over 1 million Indians stuck in employment-based backlogs—some for over 50 years—the shift toward a wealth-based immigration model could drastically reshape their options.President Donald Trump has proposed a new ""gold card"" visa, which would grant green card privileges and a pathway to US citizenship for a $5 million fee. Unlike the traditional EB-5 investor visa, which requires a $800,000-$1.05 million investment in a business that creates at least 10 US jobs, the gold card has no such job creation requirement. Instead, it is being positioned as a premium residency option for wealthy individuals.Indians are among the largest groups waiting for US green cards, with backlogs exceeding 50 years in some employment-based categories. The gold card could:Yes. Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that the gold card would replace EB-5 in two weeks. Trump criticized EB-5, calling it “full of nonsense, make-believe, and fraud.” While EB-5 required job creation, the gold card is simply a direct purchase of US residency and citizenship eligibility.Yes, if they have $5 million to pay for it. Trump described the gold card as a ""road to citizenship for people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in.” This suggests that companies may also sponsor highly skilled employees, though details remain unclear.For Indians who planned to use EB-5, the fivefold increase in investment cost (from $1 million to $5 million) could make it unaffordable. While EB-5 investors could pool funds or take structured loans, the gold card seems to require upfront cash, limiting accessibility to India’s ultra-rich elite.Trump claimed, ""We’ll be able to sell maybe a million of these cards,"" and even suggested selling 10 million to reduce the US deficit. Unlike EB-5, which had a cap, the gold card appears to have no numerical limit—it is purely a revenue-driven scheme.Yes. The program seems tailored for India’s wealthiest entrepreneurs, tech executives, and industrialists. Those who want to bypass H-1B visa lotteries and EB-2/EB-3 backlogs could find this an attractive alternative. However, its lack of clarity around job creation, business investment, and processing time raises concerns.Trump said that congressional approval is not required, but legal experts disagree. If lawsuits or political opposition arise, implementation could be delayed or blocked—something Indian applicants should consider before committing funds.For those unable to afford the gold card, traditional employment-based green cards (EB-1, EB-2, EB-3) and the H-1B visa remain options, although processing times are long. If the gold card significantly reduces EB-5 interest, Indians already in the EB-5 pipeline may have fewer competitors, potentially improving their chances.","President Donald Trump has proposed a new ""gold card"" visa, which would grant green card privileges and a pathway to US citizenship for a $5 million fee.
