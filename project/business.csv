Army chief

Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi:

Born on July 1, 1964, Sanjeev Kumar Dwivedi is a alumnus of Sainik School, Rewa. He began his military career on December 15, 1984, when he was commissioned into the 18 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles of the Indian Army.

During his long and distinguished service spanning nearly 40 years, he has served in a variety of command, staff, instructional and foreign appointments. The command appointments of Lt Gen Dwivedi include command of regiment (18 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles), Brigade (26 Sector Assam Rifles), Inspector General, Assam Rifles (East) and 9 Corps.

Lt Gen Dwivedi shares his alma mater with the newly appointed Navy chief, Admiral Dinesh Tripathi. Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi, a graduate of the National Defence College and the US Army War College, has also completed training at the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington and the Army War College in Mhow. In addition to his military education, the general holds an MPhil in defence and management studies. He has also earned two Masters' Degrees, one in Strategic Studies and another in Military Science.

With his extensive experience, particularly during his two-year stint as the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GoC-in-C) of the Northern Command, Lt Gen Dwivedi possesses a deep understanding of the challenges posed by both China and Pakistan. Lt Gen Dwivedi, as the head of the Northern Command, was responsible for offering ""strategic guidance and operational oversight"" in the planning and execution of continuous operations along the northern and western borders shared with China and Pakistan. Furthermore, he supervised counter-terrorism efforts in the J&K region.

He has been decorated with the Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Ati Vishisht Seva Medal and three GOC-in-C Commendation Cards.

NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday announced that Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi will be the next chief of the Army Staff succeeding incumbent Gen Manoj Pande . Dwivedi is presently serving as the Vice Chief of the Army Staff. The tenure of the present Chief of the Army Staff, General Manoj C Pande, ends on June 30.The government has followed the seniority principle in appointing Lt Gen Dwivedi, who was commissioned into the 18 Jammu & Kashmir Rifles in December 1984.Earlier on May 26, the government had made a surprising decision by extending Gen Pande's tenure by a month, a mere six days before his scheduled retirement. This unconventional action fueled rumors that a potential supersession within the military ranks was imminent. The move deviated from the typical protocol, where such decisions are usually made well in advance of an officer's retirement date.(With PTI inputs)",Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi will be the next chief of the Army Staff succeeding incumbent Gen Manoj Pande.

The entrance test was conducted across 4,750 centres in 571 cities, including 14 cities abroad. But reports of paper leak surfaced after the test and few arrests were also made. Controversy also cropped up on the way in which grace marks were ""arbitrarily"" given to a few students.Seeking quashing of exams due to paper leak, the petitioners said that four individuals, including two MBBS students, had been arrested for allegedly running a paper solver gang for NEET exam but the NTA was refuting the allegation of paper leak.""NTA has published its own circular/notification giving a clean chit to the alleged offenders in the paper leak case before the ongoing investigations of various agencies concerned is concluded in the backdrop of FIR registered by Shastri Nagar Police Station in Patna and investigation being further carried out by EOU Bihar Police,"" the petition said, pleading the court to intervene.Raising the issue of grant of grace marks, advocate J Sai Deepak told the court that a fresh petition has been filed and the court should also examine the controversy along with allegation of paper leak but the bench said that it was for SC registry to take a call on listing of the case.The petitioners alleged arbitrariness in the grant of grace marks and contended that high marks of 718 & 719 out of 720 secured by several students were ""statistically impossible"".It said that the grant of grace marks due to delay during the exam, was a mala fide exercise to give ""backdoor entry"" to certain students and questioned how 67 students from one particular centre got full 720 marks.",Supreme Court on Tuesday sought explanation from National Testing Agency ( NTA ) on alleged irregularities in conducting the test.

(With inputs from the Diplomat)

NEW DELHI: India is planning to rename over two dozen places in China's Tibet Autonomous Region in a tit-for-tat move against China renaming places in Arunachal Pradesh , according to a report in the Diplomat.The list of places to be renamed has been finalised by the Army's information warfare division and will be released soon, said the report by the Diplomat. The new names are backed by extensive historical research and widely held opinions of the local residents, many of whom fiercely oppose the Chinese names.The unit has also been debunking the Chinese names with support from top research institutes like the British-era Asiatic Society based in Kolkata.The renaming campaign aims to push through an Indian counter-narrative on the border through regional and global media, anchored on both solid historical research and local residents' voices.The move comes after Beijing on several instances changed names of places in Arunachal Pradesh.In March, China renamed 30 places along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the state, including 11 residential areas, 12 mountains, four rivers, one lake, one mountain pass, and a piece of land.It was the fourth time that China unilaterally renamed places in the state. Beijing released the first list of the so-called standardised names of six places in Arunachal Pradesh in 2017, the second list of 15 places in 2021, and a third list with names for 11 places in 2023.New Delhi suspects that China's renaming of places in Arunachal Pradesh is aimed at strengthening Beijing's territorial claim on the largest province in northeastern India, which China calls Zangnan or ""southern Tibet"".India has repeatedly rejected China's move to rename places in Arunachal Pradesh, asserting that the state is an integral part of the country and that assigning ""invented"" names does not alter this reality.The latest round of efforts by China to reassert its claims over the state started with Beijing lodging a diplomatic protest with India over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's March 2024 visit to Arunachal Pradesh, where he dedicated the Sela Tunnel built at an altitude of 13,000 feet.External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on March 23 dismissed China's repeated claims on Arunachal Pradesh as ""ludicrous"" and stressed that the frontier state was a ""natural part of India"".With Prime Minister Narendra Modi retaining Rajnath Singh as defence minister, it is expected that the list of names will be released soon.Experts said that when India reveals the new names, it will be akin to New Delhi reopening the Tibetan question, which is bound to illicit a sharp reaction from China.",India is planning to rename over two dozen places in China's Tibet Autonomous Region in a tit-for-tat move against China renaming places in Arunachal Pradesh.

NEW DELHI: NEW DELHI: Heatwave conditions have returned to parts of North India, bringing a surge in temperatures that surpassed 45°C in many regions on Monday, after a brief respite in recent days.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a warning for northwest and east India, predicting a further rise in temperatures by two to three degrees over the next five days.This year, India has already endured multiple intense and prolonged heatwaves in April and May, pushing human endurance and the country's disaster preparedness to their limits. Several states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Odisha, reported fatalities due to the extreme heat.Experts attribute the severe heat to the El Nino phenomenon—a warming of the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean—and the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Rapid urbanization has exacerbated warming in cities, disproportionately affecting outdoor workers and low-income households.Climate change has significantly increased the frequency of such heatwaves, making them about 45 times more likely, according to the 'World Weather Attribution' group of leading climate scientists.The central water commission reported that water storage in 150 major reservoirs in India has dropped to just 22 per cent of their live storage capacity, exacerbating water shortages and impacting hydropower generation.The intense heat has driven India's power demand to a record 246 gigawatts, as air conditioners and coolers in homes and offices run at full capacity.From March to May, India recorded nearly 25,000 suspected heat stroke cases and 56 heat-related deaths, according to health ministry data. Of these, 46 deaths occurred in May alone, with 19,189 suspected heat stroke cases reported that month.The data, however, does not include figures from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Delhi, suggesting the actual toll may be higher.Severe heatwaves have plagued India for three consecutive years, significantly impacting health, water availability, agriculture, power generation, and other economic sectors.A World Bank report predicts that by 2030, India could account for 34 million of the projected 80 million global job losses due to heat stress-associated productivity decline. Additionally, studies indicate that India faces food losses worth USD 13 billion annually, with only four percent of fresh produce covered by cold chain facilities.","Severe heatwave conditions reported in parts of Gangetic West Bengal, while areas in Uttar Pradesh, south Bihar, Delhi, and Jharkhand also faced intense heat.

NEW DELHI: Newly appointed Union minister of communications , Jyotiraditya Scindia , stressed the pivotal role of the telecom division and India Post on both global and local stages as he assumed office on Tuesday.The 53-year-old son of the late Congress leader Madhavrao Scindia has a significant history in Indian politics, having served as the civil aviation minister in the previous Modi cabinet since 2021.His new role marks a return to a familiar department, as Scindia previously served as the minister of state for communications under the UPA government from 2007 to 2009.""It is a little bit like coming full circle for me because I worked as a junior minister in this department in 2007-2009, and therefore for me, this is also a department with which I've had tremendous emotional ties,"" Scindia said, reflecting on his past experiences.Expressing his gratitude for the opportunity, Scindia highlighted the advancements made under the current administration and pledged to uphold the expectations of the Prime Minister and the people of India.""It is my honour that the Prime Minister has given me the responsibility of the communications ministry. Under his leadership, there has been a revolution in this department. I vow to persevere and put in my best to ensure that we deliver according to the aspirations of the Prime Minister as well as 140 crore people of India,"" Scindia said during his inaugural speech.Scindia chose not to outline immediate priorities, opting instead to first assess the department's current state. However, he faces significant challenges, including overseeing India's 5G spectrum auction set to commence on June 25. This auction is a critical event in the telecom sector, drawing considerable attention.Besides the spectrum auction, where over Rs 96,000 crore worth of airwaves will be on the block, Scindia will also have to prioritise issues like satellite broadband services, security clearance for Elon Musk-led Startlink and formulate rules for the new Telecommunications Act.Another major responsibility for Scindia will be maintaining the structure of India's three-private player telecom market and ensuring the survival of the financially troubled Vodafone Idea, where the government holds the largest stake.Scinida will have to set the ball rolling on a 100-day agenda that would outline clear priority areas, key deliverables, roadmaps and targets for the telecom sector.Scindia, who takes over the baton from Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, inherits a sector with improved financial metrics, lower litigations, and lesser uncertainty following the disposal of several cases in courts.Scindia's ministerial journey started as Minister of State for telecom, Post and IT under then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh-led UPA-1 regime. He was instrumental in driving post office modernisation with the Project Arrow scheme.As a minister in the Modi 3.0 government, Scindia will have the challenge of reviving state-run telecom firm BSNL and settling the debt issues of MTNL.The new minister also has the challenge of resolving the threat posed by fraudulent calls and the persistent issue of pesky calls.Scindia, who was the aviation minister in the previous Modi government, won from Guna in Madhya Pradesh by more than 5.40 lakh votes.","Jyotiraditya Scindia assumed office as Union minister of communications on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Home and cooperation minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said the Modi govt , in its third term, ""shall take its efforts for India's security to the next level and build Bharat as a bulwark against terrorism, insurgency and Naxalism"".

Shah, who took charge both at the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and the ministry of cooperation - the two portfolios he held in the last regime as well - after paying homage to police martyrs at National Police Memorial here, said ""MHA remains committed to the security of the nation and its people, as it always has been"".

Among the key and immediate priorities of the home ministry , as per senior officials, would be smooth rollout of the three criminal laws - Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam - that come into force on July 1; conducting Census which will be the basis for delimitation of seats ahead of implementation of women's quota in legislatures; and arranging security and force logistics for holding assembly and local body polls in J&K.

Building on the gains made in countering terrorism in J&K, shrinking the area under the hold of Left-wing extremists and tackling insurgency in the North-East, Shah is expected to ensure that efforts are intensified in the days and months ahead to eliminate these challenges.

Also assuming charge of the cooperation ministry on Tuesday, Shah tweeted that the ministry will continue to work towards strengthening the country's economy by empowering farmers as per the PM's vision of 'Sahkaar se Samriddhi' (Prosperity via Cooperation). ""Our govt is committed to bring positive change in the lives of crores of people associated with this sector by giving new opportunities to them while empowering the idea of cooperation,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: BJP president J P Nadda took charge of the health ministry on Tuesday. He also held a meeting with senior officials of the ministry who briefed him about ongoing projects. This includes the rolling out of the U-WIN platform to digitise all routine immunisation records .

The U-WIN portal, which is a replication of the Co-WIN platform that was used for Covid-19 vaccination and issuing certificates, is being used currently in multiple states on a trial basis to digitise records of routine immunisations.

Sources said the functioning of Ayushman Bharat Yojana and its potential extension to include senior citizens (70 years and above) was also mentioned in the meeting.

BJP had, in its election manifesto, promised to extend the beneficiary base of Ayushman Bharat, one of the largest health insurance schemes in the world that offers Rs 5 lakh health coverage on an annual basis to the poor and vulnerable families, to include elderly persons who are aged 70 years and above regardless of their economic background.

This is a significant promise since many elderly people, especially those who retired from private jobs or did their own business, find it difficult to get health insurance and even if they manage to get one, the premium is prohibitively expensive. Nadda didn't make any statement about his agenda for the ministry but, in a post on X, he wrote: ""The ministry of health and family welfare plays a crucial role in the nation's progress and the well-being of its people. As the backbone of the country, the health sector not only promotes public health but also stands as a strong force in addressing and overcoming health challenges.""

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Trump completes mandatory presentencing interview in Hush money case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-completes-mandatory-presentencing-interview-ahead-of-sentencing-in-hush-money-case/articleshow/110887178.cms,"(With AP inputs)

NEW DELHI: Donald Trump underwent a mandatory presentencing interview on Monday, which concluded after less than 30 minutes of questioning. Trump was interviewed by a New York City probation officer to prepare a report for Judge Juan M Merchan ahead of Trump's July 11 sentencing in his hush money criminal case .This report will assist the judge in determining Trump's punishment following his May 30 felony conviction for falsifying business records related to a potential sex scandal. The judge has a range of options for punishment, from probation and community service to up to four years in prison.Trump, who did not testify during his trial, attended the probation interview via video conference from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. His lawyer, Todd Blanche, was present during the interview. This arrangement has led to complaints of special treatment, but city officials maintain that it is not unusual.Typically, convicted individuals in New York must meet probation officials in person for their presentence interviews and are not allowed to have their lawyers present. However, after Blanche's objections, Judge Merchan allowed him to attend Trump's interview.Public defenders in the city have criticized the special arrangements made for Trump and have called for equal treatment for all convicted individuals. They argued that all defendants should be allowed counsel during their probation interviews, not just those with significant financial resources.Presentence reports include a defendant’s personal history, criminal record, employment details, and any family obligations. These reports, prepared by probation officers, social workers, or psychologists, also offer defendants a chance to explain why they believe they deserve a lighter sentence.Trump's conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records stems from efforts to conceal a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels alleged she had a sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.Trump, who is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, plans to appeal his conviction but must wait until after sentencing. He maintained his innocence and claimed the case aims to damage his chances of regaining the presidency.",Donald Trump underwent a mandatory presentencing interview on Monday.

The dark side of host clubs: Hundreds of women in Japan coerced into sex,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-dark-side-of-host-clubs-hundreds-of-women-in-japan-coerced-into-sex/articleshow/110881740.cms,"NEW DELHI: Japan ’s host clubs , renowned for their glamorous male hosts who entertain female clients, are facing increasing scrutiny over allegations of debt and exploitation . The industry, which thrives on the allure of companionship and luxury, has come under fire as former hosts and clients reveal troubling practices behind the scenes.

As per a CNN report, several ex-hosts described a work environment where debt is often used as a tool of control. One former host, Tatsuya, recounted how he was lured by the promise of high earnings but quickly found himself trapped in a cycle of debt. “They told me I could make a lot of money, but I ended up owing the club more than I made,” Tatsuya said. The pressure to meet sales quotas led many hosts to spend their own money to buy expensive drinks for clients, further deepening their financial woes.

Clients, too, have fallen victim to these practices. Many women, enticed by the attention and affection of hosts, spend exorbitant amounts of money to maintain these relationships. Some end up in significant debt, forced to take on multiple jobs or even engage in sex work to pay off what they owe. “I felt special and wanted, but it came at a huge cost,” said one former client who wished to remain anonymous.

The darker side of the host club industry extends beyond financial exploitation . Reports have emerged of emotional manipulation, where hosts use affection and psychological tactics to encourage clients to spend more. Former host Ryo explained, “We were trained to make clients feel valued and loved, but it was all a strategy to get them to spend more money.”

These revelations have sparked a public outcry and calls for regulatory action. Critics argue that the host club industry preys on vulnerable individuals and perpetuates cycles of debt and exploitation. Advocacy groups are urging the Japanese government to implement stricter regulations to protect both hosts and clients from these predatory practices.

In response to the growing controversy, some host clubs have pledged to reform their business practices. However, many believe that more comprehensive measures are needed to address the systemic issues within the industry. Until then, the glamorous facade of Japan’s host clubs will continue to mask a much grimmer reality for those ensnared in its web.",Japan’s host clubs are facing increasing scrutiny over allegations of debt and exploitation.

US NSA to visit India on June 18 for iCET review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-nsa-to-visit-india-on-june-18-for-icet-review/articleshow/110919711.cms,"This will also be the first meeting between NSAs since the US indicted an Indian national for planning a hit on a Khalistan separatist

NEW DELHI: US NSA Jake Sullivan is likely to visit India next week for a meeting with his counterpart Ajit Doval in which they will undertake a comprehensive review of cooperation under the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET). The meeting was supposed to take place early this year but had to be postponed twice because of Sullivan's preoccupation with the conflict in Gaza.

Sullivan is likely to meet Indian officials on June 18 in what will be the first high-level engagement between the 2 governments after the return of the NDA government under PM Narendra Modi. Indian officials are waiting for the US to formally announce the visit in a few days.

This will also be the first meeting between the NSAs since the US indicted an Indian national for planning a hit on a Khalistan separatist - a US national - claiming he did so at the behest of an Indian government official. The Washington Post revealed the identity of the official in a report last month.

Biden and Modi had launched iCET in May 2022 to expand strategic technology partnership, with focus on co-production and co-development, and defence industrial cooperation between the 2 countries. The meeting will see talks on plans under the same initiative to address regulatory barriers and develop a new defence industrial roadmap for joint development and production, including of jet engines. Talks are also expected on the progress in implementing the GE-HAL jet engine technology deal which is expected to see unprecedented transfer of technology from the US to India. The deal was announced during Modi’s state visit to the US last year.

However, Sullivan’s meetings here will also be closely followed for what he has to say on Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun foiled murder-for-hire plot which can potentially turn into a major irritant in the relationship. The US is pressing India for action against the Indian official who allegedly masterminded the plot to eliminate Pannun, a US and Canadian national.

The 2 sides are expected to discuss progress in the probe that India is carrying out into the case since November last year, after having received information from the US. The Indian government maintains that it is investigating the leads shared by the US because these have a bearing on India’s own security. The US has also been pushing India to join the Canadian probe into the killing of another Sikh separatist last year near Vancouver.

A White House readout of President Joe Biden's call with Modi last week had said they also discussed Sullivan’s upcoming travel to New Delhi to engage the new government on ""shared US-India priorities, including the trusted, strategic technology partnership"".

US military to introduce new uncrewed aircraft for vertical take-off and landing operations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-military-to-introduce-new-uncrewed-aircraft-for-vertical-take-off-and-landing-operations/articleshow/110917384.cms,"NEW DELHI: The US military is set to introduce new uncrewed aircraft capable of carrying weapons and performing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) operations. These experimental vehicles, known as X-planes , could be ready for test flights as early as 2026, according to the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ).DARPA's Advanced Aircraft Infrastructure-less Launch And Recovery ( ANCILLARY ) program is entering a new testing phase, where proposed designs will undergo risk assessment and efficiency analysis. The project aims to develop X-planes that can operate from aircraft carriers without the need for runways, supporting ground crew, or infrastructure, enabling them to function in a wider range of battlefield environments.""X-plane"" is a classifier used by the US department of defence (DOD) for experimental aircraft. Past X-planes include the Bell X-1 — the first crewed vehicle to break the sound barrier in conventional flight — and the X-15, which broke records in aerospace such as previously unachievable airspeeds and the successful use of novel propulsion techniques.Several defence and aerospace contractors, including AeroVironment, Griffon Aerospace, Karem Aircraft, Method Aeronautics, Northrop Grumman, and Sikorsky (a Lockheed Martin subsidiary), are bidding for the project.Each company has proposed unique designs for achieving VTOL capabilities, such as Sikorsky's battery-powered craft that props itself on its tail and takes off like a helicopter, and Karem Aircraft's heavy-fuel-driven vehicle that uses a tilting rotor for vertical take-off and hovering.DARPA's goal is to increase its use of uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) threefold in the coming years. The small size and low weight of ANCILLARY X-planes would allow the Navy to store more of these vehicles aboard ships compared to helicopters, launching them directly from the deck without the need for specialized equipment.""Our performers are searching for innovative ways to increase payload weight and range/endurance of small, ship-launched UAS by means of novel configurations, propulsion, and controls while also removing the need for special infrastructure,"" said Steve Komadina, DARPA program manager for ANCILLARY, in DARPA's press release.The ANCILLARY program is currently in phase 1b, with testing scheduled to run for 10 months from June 2024 to spring 2025. During this period, DARPA will evaluate the manufacturers' designs based on system safety and hover tests.The project will then progress to phase 2, where participants will propose details for X-plane design, construction, and test plans. Flight tests for the most promising designs are expected to begin in early 2026. Komadina also noted that future improvements to ANCILLARY systems could be achieved through advancements in sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), and autonomous vehicle technology.","US military is set to introduce new uncrewed aircraft capable of carrying weapons and performing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) operations.

Bitcoin investors have reason to be particularly alert for potential volatility.A 30-day correlation between Bitcoin and the US 10-year Treasury yield is at minus 53, one of the most negative readings in data compiled by Bloomberg since 2010. The metric suggests the largest digital asset at present is moving in the opposite direction to the benchmark bond yield to an unusual degree.Bonds may be buffeted by the inflation data and Fed policy outlook, which are both due in the space of a few hours on Wednesday. The correlation study hints at the risk of Bitcoin being tossed around in the Treasury market’s wake.Bitcoin wobbled on Tuesday, sliding as much as 2.8% to a one-week low and hovering at $67,840 as of 2:18 p.m. in Singapore. Smaller tokens such as Ether and meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin also nursed losses.Bitcoin hit a record of $73,798 in mid-March, lifted by inflows into dedicated US exchange-traded funds. But it struggled for new highs in the past three months. For Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia Pty, Bitcoin’s recent failed attempts to crack all-time peaks rings “alarm bells.”‘Lack’ of Progress“The lack of upside progress in recent weeks is concerning given the significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs recently which have thus far failed to turn the dial,” Sycamore said. “The next 36 hours is going to be crucial.”A net $15.6 billion has poured into the ETFs since their January launch. On Monday, $65 million was pulled from the products, snapping a run of 19 straight days of subscriptions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The inflation data are expected to show price pressures running well ahead of the US central bank’s comfort zone. At the turn of the year, investors were wagering on a slew of Fed rate reductions, but now the debate is whether future easing will amount to only a smallish tweak of policy.An outlook of higher for longer borrowing costs could be a challenging backdrop for a speculative asset like Bitcoin, which has already more than quadrupled since the start of 2023 in a comeback from a deep bear market.Fairlead Strategies LLC technical analyst Katie Stockton in a research note flagged “neutral” short-term momentum for the digital token based on chart patterns, while adding that long-term prospects are more positive.The crypto market “is like a junkie that constantly needs bullish news to stay up,” said Anand Gomes, co-founder of Paradigm, a derivatives platform. “So when there is none, the path of least resistance is lower.”","A 30-day correlation between Bitcoin and the US 10-year Treasury yield is at minus 53.

Republican contenders for Mitt Romney's open US Senate seat clash over support for Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/republican-contenders-for-mitt-romneys-open-us-senate-seat-clash-over-support-for-trump/articleshow/110893581.cms,"SALT LAKE CITY: Three of the four Utah republicans vying for the seat of retiring US Sen. Mitt Romney sought to portray themselves as the most loyal to former president Donald Trump during Monday's primary debate , while the likely frontrunner stood out as someone willing to challenge party leadership .The state's marquee race is expected to test Trump's broad influence in Utah, one of the few red states that has been hesitant to embrace him. The former president's day-off endorsement of a little-known mayor helped the local official to win the party nomination over nearly a dozen contenders at the April convention, but may carry less weight with voters statewide.Romney has long been the face of the party's moderate wing, and his retirement from the senate opens a door for more conservative candidates. Observers are closely watching whether voters select a successor whose politics align more with Romney's or with Utah's other US senator, Trump ally Mike Lee.While moderate US Rep. John Curtis is considered the favourite going into the June 25 primary, convention victor Trent Staggs and former Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson, another Trump supporter, could push Utah politics further right in the post-Romney era.Curtis, Wilson and businessman Jason Walton had already qualified for the primary ballot through signature gathering before the convention and joined Staggs on the debate stage Monday night.Staggs, 49, repeatedly touted Trump's endorsement and argued the former president was a victim of ""political persecution."" Last month, Trump became the first former American president to be convicted of felony crimes when a New York jury found him guilty of all 34 charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor.Staggs criticized Curtis for being the only candidate who had not endorsed Trump's reelection bid and gave him an opportunity to do so. The congressman responded that he had already pledged to support the party nominee, which is now Trump, but offered no real endorsement.""Serving with him is a degree of difficultly of a 10,"" Curtis said. ""When president Trump is doing anything that I consider aligned with Utah values, and I can check off a pretty good list, I'm wind at his back. But I'm not going to give him an unconditional yes to anything he wants.""All four men described their style of conservatism similarly, sharing a desire to reduce government spending and limit federal overreach.Wilson, who is endorsed by Gov. Spencer Cox and other top state officials, insisted he's already had the greatest impact on Utah residents as a state legislative leader. As House speaker, he oversaw years of tax cuts and budget negotiations that he said will help him fight federal overspending.The 55-year-old from Kaysville also touted plans to soften federal regulations that he said stand in the way of local officials detaining immigrants who are living in the US illegally. He stressed a need to finish Trump's border wall between the US and Mexico, and dug up a 2017 interview in which Curtis had said the construction project ""carries all of this pent-up racism.""Curtis said the comment was taken out of context and clarified his support for securing the border.He has been compared to Romney for pushing back against hardliners in his party, particularly on climate change, but has distanced himself from the retiring senator while campaigning for his seat. The 64-year-old republican congressman and former mayor of Provo began his political career as a county-level Democratic Party official. He's now the longest-serving member of Utah's US House delegation and has pitched himself as the only candidate who already understands the inner workings of Capitol Hill.Staggs, on the other hand, built his base by calling state GOP delegates and courting the endorsements of Trump and many of his allies nationwide. The mayor of Riverton, a suburb south of Salt Lake City, was the first candidate to enter the senate race, even before Romney announced he was not seeking reelection. However, his convention victory might not translate to success at the ballot box, as Republican Party nominations historically have had little bearing on the decisions of Utah voters.The winner of the republican senate primary will face democrat Caroline Gleich, a mountaineer and environmental activist, in November. Utah has not elected a democrat to the US Senate since 1970.Earlier Monday, US Rep. Celeste Maloy, who is seeking her first full term representing Utah's 2nd District after winning a special election last fall, defended her brief congressional tenure in a debate with challenger Colby Jenkins, who tried to paint her willingness to work across the aisle as kowtowing to democrats.Jenkins, a retired US army officer and telecommunications specialist, beat Maloy at the party convention this year after receiving Lee's endorsement, but not by a wide enough margin to bypass the primary. He used his time on the debate stage Monday to call for Trump's return to the White House, while Maloy justified her votes for several bipartisan spending packages. The winner of the competitive primary will face democratic nominee Nathaniel Woodward, a family law attorney, in November.Republican candidates for governor, attorney general and Curtis' open US House seat will face off in debates on Tuesday and Wednesday.","Three of the four Utah republicans vying for the seat of retiring US Sen.

Baltimore Port shipping channel reopens 11 weeks after bridge collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baltimore-port-shipping-channel-reopens-11-weeks-after-bridge-collapse/articleshow/110887855.cms,"Explosive charges are detonated to bring down collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge resting on container ship Dali (AP file photo)

NEW DELHI: Baltimore's main shipping channel has reopened to its original depth and width following the March 26 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge . The reopening follows an extensive cleanup effort , during which crews removed an estimated 50,000 tons of steel and concrete from the Patapsco River.

The US Army Corps of Engineers certified the riverbed as safe for transit on Monday, confirming that the Fort McHenry Federal Channel has been restored to its original dimensions of 700 feet wide and 50 feet deep. This allows for two-way traffic and removes the additional safety requirements that had been in place due to the temporarily reduced channel width.

The channel had been obstructed by the wreckage of the bridge, which collapsed after a container ship, the Dali , lost power and crashed into one of bridge's supporting columns. The incident resulted in the deaths of six members of a roadwork crew, all of whom were Latino immigrants working an overnight shift to fill potholes on the bridge.

The operation involved more than 1,500 individual responders and 500 specialists from around the world, utilizing a fleet of boats. The effort included 56 federal, state, and local agencies. Surveying and removal of steel at and below the 50-foot mud-line will continue to ensure future dredging operations are not impacted, with wreckage transported to Sparrows Point for further processing.

In April, the FBI opened a criminal investigation into the collapse. The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the Dali had lost electrical power several times before the crash, including experiencing a blackout during in-port maintenance and shortly before the collision. Maryland estimates it will cost $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion to rebuild the bridge, with completion anticipated by fall 2028.

Pakistan installs social media firewall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-installs-social-media-firewall/articleshow/110883200.cms,"Government sources said the firewall would apply to all popular platforms (AP photo)

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has started installing a nationwide firewall system to regulate social media platforms and stop the spread of undesirable content. Government sources said the firewall would apply to all popular platforms like Facebook, YouTube and X.

The firewall, a senior official said, seeks to identify sources of propaganda material, examine data from various internet protocol addresses and limit the content’s visibility. One of the system’s primary functions is keyword filtering, which identifies and hides offensive content .

Additionally, protocols are being developed to oversee Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which many have employed to evade limitations placed on X, formerly Twitter. Initial restrictions on VPNs drew criticism from the corporate sector, which led the govt to temporarily suspend its implementation.

The X blockade has brought its usage in Pakistan to almost half, from 4.5 million to 2.4 million users. It seems the management of X is gradually adhering to govt directives to block accounts that disseminate fake news, allow conversations on sensitive subjects or circulate contentious ideas.

In April, the home ministry had provided the Islamabad high court a detailed report outlining the rationale for X’s prohibition. The report brought attention to X’s non-registration and its disregard for Pakistani legal requirements.

The report claimed that X’s refusal to comply with Pakistani regulations was the reason for its blocking. It argued that the action did not infringe on fundamental rights.

Pakistan and IMF disagree over new income tax rates that will burden salaried class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-and-imf-disagree-over-new-income-tax-rates-that-will-burden-salaried-class/articleshow/110836835.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons and the imposition of a standard 18 per cent sales tax on agriculture and health sector goods, according to a media report on Sunday.On Friday, Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) authorities discussed the outstanding issues related to taxation and the energy sector.Citing sources, the Express Tribune newspaper reported that both sides could not resolve their differences on the income tax threshold, the merger of salaried and non-salaried rates and the maximum income tax rate for individuals.Discussions are revolving around whether to charge a new backbreaking 45 per cent income tax from salaried and non-salaried individuals on a monthly income of just over Pakistani Rs 4,67,000, sources said.At present, the maximum rate of 35 per cent applies to a monthly income of over Pakistani Rs 5,00,000.However, both sides have converged on the issue of increasing the income tax burden on exporters in the next budget who paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 86 billion this year, which is 280 per cent less than the taxes paid by the salaried people.Pakistan also showed a willingness to tax pensions beyond a certain income threshold.In the latest talks, the international money lender insisted on merging the slabs related to salaried, non-salaried and other incomes.On the government's proposal of increasing the annual threshold of taxable income to Pakistani Rs 9,00,000, the IMF is asking for the maximum income tax rate to be increased from 35 per cent to 45 per cent.However, the government is unwilling to increase the maximum rate for salaried individuals to 45 per cent but showed flexibility to keep the taxable income threshold at the current Pakistani Rs 6,00,000.It is also asking to keep the salaried and non-salaried slabs separate but is willing to increase the highest tax rate for non-salaried persons to 45 per cent, said the sources.The non-salaried business individuals pay tax after excluding expenses while the salaried persons pay tax on their gross income without excluding the expenses.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is until now unwilling to increase the burden on the salaried class .According to a proposal, if the taxable income threshold is increased to Pakistani Rs 900,000 per annum, the income tax rate can be up to 7.5 per cent on a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 100,000. The current rate is 2.5 per cent for this category.For the next slab, if the monthly income is up to Pakistani Rs 133,000, the under-discussion tax rate is 20 per cent. The current rate is 12.5 per cent, that too for up to a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 200,000.The IMF wants a higher rate at the lower income level. This slab will directly hit Pakistan's middle-income group.At present, on an income of over Pakistani Rs 500,000, a 35 per cent tax rate is charged. The salaried class has until now paid Pakistani Rs 325 billion in income tax in 11 months, which is expected to rise to around Pakistani Rs 360 billion at the end of the current fiscal year.If the revised income tax rates are accepted, the tax contribution of the salaried class will jump to Pakistani Rs 540 billion in the next fiscal year, said the sources. To absorb this increase in the tax rates, even a 30 per cent pay hike will not be sufficient.Sources said that the IMF had asked Pakistan to share alternative proposals, in case it was unwilling to increase the tax burden on the salaried class. Another round of discussions is expected soon.Sources said that an understanding had been reached between Pakistan and the IMF on changing the tax regime for the richest exporters.As against the existing one per cent final income tax on exporters, it has been proposed that from the next fiscal year, the one per cent rate should be treated as a minimum, according to government sources.Pakistan's taxation system promotes inequality and puts a higher burden on people who have little capacity to bear it. The IMF has asked Pakistan to end all special tax regimes, like the low-income tax on gains made by investing in the stock market and bank deposits.The global lender has recommended treating these gains as part of normal income. The IMF is pushing Pakistan to increase the burden on the salaried class until the country recovers higher taxes from the non-salaried business individuals.During the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the exporters paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 85.5 billion in taxes, which was Pakistani Rs 241 billion, or 280 per cent, less than the amount paid by the salaried class.During July-May FY24, the salaried class paid Pakistani Rs 326 billion in taxes, higher by 40 per cent, or Pakistani Rs 93 billion, compared to the same period last year.The record Pakistani Rs 326 billion in tax payments by the salaried class is also 223 per cent more than the combined tax paid by the rich exporters and influential retailers.Sources said that there was also no consensus on slapping the standard 18 per cent sales tax on fertiliser, pesticides and seeds – the crucial inputs for the agriculture sector.The government was also unwilling to impose an 18 per cent sales tax on medicines, solar panels and medical and surgical equipment. In case, the 18 per cent tax is imposed on medicines, there will be an additional collection of Pakistani Rs 130 billion in the next fiscal year.Similarly, taxing the medical and health-related supplies will generate another Pakistani Rs 100 billion, according to the paper.Pakistan urgently needs a new loan from the IMF to keep the fear of default at bay. The government is eager to ink the agreement before the end of June when the fiscal year ends.","Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons.

However, after 10 days, the child developed bilateral lower limb weakness, which progressively worsened and eventually affected the upper limbs, as reported by Dawn.He was subsequently admitted to the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) in Karachi, where he was diagnosed with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). Despite medical efforts, the child succumbed to the illness on May 22.Samples collected from three contacts of the victim revealed the presence of the wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in one of the siblings and a cousin residing in the same household. Importantly, there was no history of recent travel to other districts prior to the onset of paralysis, indicating local transmission.Investigations are underway to determine whether the case resulted from vaccine refusal, although records indicate that the child had received five doses of vaccine during supplementary immunisation activities.Malik Mukhtar Bharath, the prime minister's coordinator on national health services, emphasised that until Pakistan achieves polio eradication, children remain vulnerable to this debilitating disease.Muhammad Anwarul Haq, coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, highlighted the ongoing efforts to investigate the source of the virus and identify gaps in vaccination coverage . This includes targeting populations that may have missed out on polio immunisation to prevent further outbreaks.","The case, which occurred on April 29 and was confirmed on June 8, highlights a significant delay of six weeks in diagnosis.

Nepal Parliament approves ratification for framework agreement related to International Solar Alliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-parliament-approves-ratification-for-framework-agreement-related-to-international-solar-alliance/articleshow/110819158.cms,"File Photo (Picture Credit: ANI)

KATHMANDU: Nepal's House of Representatives has passed a proposal seeking ratification of a framework agreement related to the membership of the International Solar Alliance that will help the Himalayan nation increase usage of solar power in its effort to combat the impact due to changing climate. The House of Representatives (HoR), or the Lower House on Thursday endorsed the proposal tabled by minister for energy, water resources and irrigation, Shakti Bahadur Basnet through a majority vote.

The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was conceived as a joint effort by India and France to mobilise efforts against climate change through the deployment of solar energy solutions and announced on the sidelines of the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Paris in 2015.

With the amendment of its Framework Agreement in 2020, all member states of the United Nations are eligible to join the ISA. At present, 119 countries, including Nepal, are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement, of which 98 countries have submitted the necessary instruments of ratification to become full members of the ISA.

Responding to queries raised by lawmakers from various political parties, Basnet said that the agreement was tabled in keeping with the national interest of the country as clean energy is essential for minimising the impacts of climate change.

""The installation of solar energy will be important for Nepal's development,"" he pointed out and informed the House that the government has already moved the process for the generation of 1,000 MW through solar power in the next couple of years.

A competitive bidding for Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) has already started for the same and bidding for PPA of 800 MW has already opened, he added.

Rajendra Khatrichhetri, a lawmaker belonging to opposition Nepali Congress, welcomed the government's move as he said, ""This is a good proposal as it will provide cheap and affordable energy to the general public and also helps to minimise the impacts of climate change.""

Currently, Nepal has 13 projects generating 68.38 MW of solar power, according to Nepal's Energy Development Department. In September 2023, Nepal announced that it plans to develop 30,000 MW of electricity by 2035 and would club hydropower and solar power.","Nepal's House of Representatives has passed a proposal seeking ratification of a framework agreement related to the International Solar Alliance.
