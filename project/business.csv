"Baliga credits his success to rigorous training, curriculum at IIT Madras",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/baliga-credits-his-success-to-rigorous-training-curriculum-at-iit-madras/articleshow/113077700.cms,"Bantval Jayant Baliga, winner of the 2024 Millennium Technology Prize , told TOI in an exclusive interview that he puts his success down to the rigorous training and curriculum he received at IIT Madras. The prize is awarded by Technology Academy Finland for innovations that benefit millions of people.Baliga's invention, the insulated gate bipolar transistor ( IGBT ), developed in 1980s, is estimated to have reduced global carbon dioxide emissions by over 82 gigatons (180 trillion pounds) in the past 30 years.""This award is coming at the culmination of my career as I am now retiring after 50 years, so the timing is perfect,"" he said.Born in Chennai, Baliga lived in Delhi until he was 10, then went to Bishop Cotton Boys' School in Bengaluru, before studying electrical engineering at IIT Madras. ""The IITs are extremely rigorous and difficult institutions in terms of the rigour of the classroom and practical training... During the first two years we spent a lot of time in the lab rather than in the classroom, so I learnt things other students may not learn. The biggest thing was the extremely competitive, tough climate,"" he told TOI on Zoom. His father, Bantval Vittal Baliga, was the first chief engineer of All India Radio after Indian Independence.Baliga moved to the US in 1969 to do a master's and PhD in electrical engineering at New York's Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He arrived with just $10 in his pocket. ""In 1969, the Indian govt only gave $10 to people leaving for the US due to limited foreign reserves,"" he explained. It was his first trip out of India and the first time he saw snow. ""At that time they were not admitting Indian students to my department. My professor told me later that is because they thought Indian students could not handle the curriculum. I went in and I got a perfect 4.0 GPA during my time there, and then they said, 'Oh, maybe we were wrong' and started letting Indians in.""""I would have gone back to India, but since I was doing work on cutting edge semi-conductors, there was no opportunity to do that in India... Semi-conductors have always had a problem flourishing in India because you needa lot of infrastructure, like good, clean gas, clean water, reliable electricity, and you cannot have any of this interrupted... But there is nothing to stop them being manufactured in India due to the availability of highly educated and capable engineers if sufficient investments are made,"" he said. The prize will be presented to Baliga in Finland on Oct 30 by the Finnish president.","Baliga's invention, the insulated gate bipolar transistor ( IGBT ), developed in 1980s, is estimated to have reduced global carbon dioxide emissions by over 82 gigatons (180 trillion pounds) in the past 30 years.

Traffic violations frustrate Union mantri: 'Can't keep on increasing fines',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/traffic-violations-frustrate-union-mantri-cant-keep-on-increasing-fines/articleshow/113075574.cms,"NEW DELHI: Expressing frustration at rampant violation of traffic rules despite steep hike in fines , Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday wondered how many times or by how much can govt increase penalties to deter violators. He said there is also a need to induce behavioural change in road users .“We are using technology (ITS) for enforcement of traffic rules.We have increased fines for violations, but it’s not yielding results because people are not taking them seriously. How much fine can we increase? It’s a problem. This can be addressed only by changing human behaviour with the involvement and cooperation of social and educational organisations,” Gadkari said while addressing the World Safety conference.The govt amended the Motor Vehicle Act in 2019 with provisions of high fines and penalties expecting this would prove as a deterrent. But these measures proved inadequate with violation of traffic and transport rules rising and the number of road crash fatalities actually increasing by around 6% from nearly 1.59 lakh in 2019 to 1.68 lakh in 2022.The minister said enforcement alone cannot bring down crashes and fatalities, without focussing on changing road users behaviour by educating people and convincing them to follow road safety rules . On the rising number of two-wheeler riders’ deaths due to riders not wearing helmets, he said he is looking at urging vehicle manufacturers to offer helmets to the buyers at a discount or reasonable rate. In 2022, 50,029 people lost their lives in crashes when they were not wearing helmets.He also flagged the problem of mixed traffic on Indian roads and lack of lane discipline. “We are trying to train the bus and truck drivers, and if they can maintain lane discipline, we can reduce road accidents,” the minister said. He added that large-scale violation of lane driving is coming in the way of increasing the maximum speed limit on access-controlled highways.Gadkari said there is also a need to do more on the trauma care front to save lives.Earlier in the day, Niti Aayog member V K Paul said the govt would soon roll out universal free medical care for 48 hours for all crash victims across the country soon. A pilot run for this is going on in Chandigarh. He added that the govt is working at doubling the fleet under the National Ambulance Service, which is now around 16,000. These will be fitted with modern equipment for 24X7 telehealth services.The global conference attended by top representatives from World Health Organisation, United Nations, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, public health experts called for immediate action for all nations to take a multi-pronged approach to reduce road crashes and fatalities.Etienne Krug, director (social determinants of health) at WHO told TOI, “India having the biggest share of road deaths globally, we need a strong political commitment at national, state and local level. We know what’s to be done and have solutions. Prevention is the best solution. It’s extremely costly to treat victims of road crashes and sometimes the disability is for months, years and for the entire life.”",Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari wondered how many times or by how much can govt increase penalties to deter violators. He said there is also a need to induce behavioural change in road users.

The pact marks yet another step forward in the govt's efforts to bring lasting peace and development to the northeast region .As part of the tripatite memorandum of settlement, over 328 armed cadres of ATTF and NLFT will give up arms and violence, join the mainstream and disband their armed organisations.Centre, Shah said after signing of the memorandum, has approved a Rs 250 crore package for development of Tripura, particularly its tribal-dominated pockets, while preserving their culture, language and identity.""It is an important day as NLFT and ATTF have reaffirmed their commitment towards development of Tripura by ending the 35-year-old conflict in the state,"" Shah said while sharing that the latest memorandum is the 12th for the northeast region and the third for Tripura.Addressing participants during the signing event - attended by Tripura CM Manik Saha and officials of MHA and Tripura govt - Shah underlined how Modi govt has been working since 2014 to realise PM Modi's vision of building a capable and developed northeast through peace and dialogue. Referring to the concept of Ashtalakshami and Purvoday, Shah said the govt has tried to bridge the distance between Delhi and northeast not only with better road, rail and air connectivity but by bringing hearts closer.Shah appreciated the role of Pradyot Debbarma, scion of erstwhile royal family of Tripura, in ending unrest by local tribes.Calling the settlement with NLFT and ATTF ""as yet another milestone in realisation of a fully-developed northeast"", Shah said the 12 peace pacts so far have got 10,000 armed cadres into the mainstream and tackled the cause behind loss of thousands of lives. ""Modi govt remains committed to implementing every peace agreement in letter and spirit,"" Shah said while recounting the earlier peace pacts with NLFT(SD) in 2019, followed by accords with Bru-Reangs and the Bodos in 2020.

Theatre Commands: India's Proposed Integrated Theatre Commands Plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-proposed-integrated-theatre-commands-plan/articleshow/113074831.cms,"NEW DELHI: India’s top military brass is now taking the final look at the blueprint for the proposed theatre commands for China, Pakistan and the Indian Ocean Region, with the aim to ensure a well-integrated war-fighting machinery, at the two-day joint commanders’ conference (JCC) that kicked off in Lucknow on Wednesday.With defence minister Rajnath Singh slated to attend the JCC on Thursday, senior officers told TOI that it will take 12-18 months for the tri-Service theatre commands to take concrete shape on the ground after the final approval by the government.“The blueprint, with the requisite command, control and operational structures for the theatre commands, prepared by chief of defence staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan, is more or less ready. Presentations have been made to the defence minister and others. The government will now have to take the final call,” an officer said.As per the existing plan, which entails the most radical military reorganization in the country since Independence, the China-specific northern theatre command will come up in Lucknow, while the western one for Pakistan will be based in Jaipur. The maritime theatre command, in turn, will be located at Thiruvananthapuram.This will involve the IAF giving up its Southern Air Command at Thiruvananthapuram and the Army its South-Western Command at Jaipur for the theatre commands. The Army’s Central Command at Lucknow will be shifted to some other location. At present, India has as many as 17 single-Service commands (Army 7, IAF 7 and Navy 3), which have little synergy in operations, planning and logistics.A sticking point, however, could be the recommendation that the three theatre commanders-in-chief and a vice CDS should be four-star generals like the CDS and three Service chiefs, who rank above the secretaries to the Union government.At present, the chiefs of the 17 single-service commands and two tri-Service commands (Strategic Forces Command and Andaman Nicobar Command) are senior three-star officers (Lt-Generals, Air Marshals or Vice Admirals).“A four-star officer is needed for the requisite command and control of a theatre since he will have all the three Services under him in that geographical region,” a top officer told TOI.“The maritime theatre command chief, for instance, will have the entire Navy as well as parts of Army and Navy under him. Whether the politico-bureaucratic establishment agrees to four more four-star officers remains to be seen,” he added.Addressing the JCC on Wednesday, Gen Chauhan stressed on enhancing integration across various domains to adapt to the contours of future warfare and conduct of effect-based operations.With the three Services “initiating numerous measures” on the roadmap for integration, the CDS said it was “a step-by-step process, beginning with cross-service cooperation, leading to a ‘joint culture’, and finally achieving integration of forces for conduct of joint operations”.China, incidentally, re-organised its 2-million People’s Liberation Army (PLA) into five theatre commands in early-2016 to boost offensive capabilities and establish better command-and-control structures.The PLA’s Western Theatre Command, for instance, handles the entire 3,488-km Line of Actual Control from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. India, in contrast, has four Army and three IAF commands for the northern borders with China.","India's top military brass is now taking the final look at the blueprint for the proposed theatre commands for China, Pakistan and the Indian Ocean Region.

AHMEDABAD: When Dr Deepak Vyas and Dr Samisth Vyas appeared for the NEET-PG examination earlier this year, they became one of the rare father-son duo who wrote this tough exam together in the same year, on the basis of which admission in PG medical courses is granted in the country.Interestingly, Dr Samisth, who completed his MBBS in 2023 and is currently doing his internship, scored more than his father, who has 28 years of experience! ""Son proved to be better than the father.I had clinical experience, but my son scored better,"" said 51-year-old Dr Vyas.The duo declined to share their scores, saying that the first attempt was more for experience and that Dr Samisth would take the exam again.""When Samisth started preparing for his NEET-PG exams, I decided to give it a shot. When I passed MBBS in 1996, conditions were such that I had to start working and I could not pursue specialisation. Hence, I took it as a challenge to write the NEET-PG exam to test my knowledge, way of learning and format,"" says Dr Deepak Vyas.""I wanted to give company and competition to my son, who passed from GMERS Gandhinagar. We studied together where I guided him in practical aspects, while he would help me with the theoretical aspects from his syllabus.""Dr Vyas said when he last appeared for the MBBS exam 28 years ago, the format was descriptive, and the MCQ format in which NEET-PG is conducted was unthinkable. ""I am from the pen and paper era when MBBS marks were considered for PG admission. Writing the exam on the computer in multiple choice questions (MCQ) format was a new experience,"" added Dr Vyas, a medical counsellor with Apollo Hospitals.The duo said that the examination was a good way to prepare for what comes next – Samisth, who wishes to pursue MD (medicine), will appear next year with better preparation to get admission in his desired field. So, the duo did not fret much about the exam or rank this year as the purpose was not to secure a seat. They had different centres for the exam, they added.The outcome was a win-win. The duo said that it was the spirit of competition that kept them going. ""The result was not the goal – it was the journey, the time spent together and the sense of achievement that we will cherish,"" said Samisth.","Dr Deepak Vyas and his son Samisth appeared for the NEET-PG examination earlier this year.

Three Foreign Nationals Tricked into Kidney Trafficking Scam in India: Harrowing Tales of Betrayal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/lured-with-job-offer-3-bangladesh-men-lose-kidneys-in-india/articleshow/113006025.cms,"NEW DELHI: Two decades ago, the Bollywood film Run depicted a young man venturing to Delhi in pursuit of employment only to be snared by kidney transplant scammers . A recent chargesheet filed by the law enforcement authorities reveals a strikingly analogous plot orchestrated by a syndicate that preyed on desperate individuals seeking a better life and left them with an indelible scar and a haunting future.Three Bangladeshi citizens (identities withheld) have disclosed harrowing accounts of falling victim to a kidney trafficking ring operating in India.Their testimonies, documented under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code , expose a sinister scheme in which these unsuspecting individuals were enticed to India with the promise of employment but were deprived of their kidneys in the guise of medical examinations . Sedated and helpless, they would regain consciousness 48 hours later, discovering their kidneys had been harvested with a paltry sum of 4 lakh takas deposited into their bank accounts as compensation.TI, a 30-year-old Bangladeshi man, didn't know whether to celebrate Eid this year or not after being rescued by police from the clutches of the traffickers that day. He had already lost his kidney. TI, who lived with his mother, sister and wife in Bangladesh, had been advised by an acquaintance to seek employment in India .He said, ""When a fire destroyed my cloth business, I took an 8-lakh taka loan from an NGO. I repaid 3 lakh takas, but the remaining debt caused financial strain for us. A friend suggested that I go to India and arranged my passport and medical visa, claiming job opportunities awaited me. On arrival in India on June 1, I was told there were no jobs. But the men pressured me to donate a kidney for money. I refused, but they withheld my passport and visa, threatening to prevent my departure from India unless I complied.""SS, 35, was similarly assured of employment by an individual named Taskin in Bangladesh. He was transported to India on February 2. At the airport two men, Rasel and Mohammed Rokon, were waiting for me. ""I accompanied them to Hotel Rampal in Jasola. I was promised employment at a hospital and told I had to undergo medical examinations in accordance with Indian regulations,"" said SS. ""I undertook 15-20 tests, including blood tests and an ECG. On April 2, I was taken to a hospital where a nurse administered a liquid substance, causing me to lose consciousness.""He continued, ""On April 3, I was administered an injection and became unconscious. Upon regaining consciousness on April 5, I discovered a scar and stitch marks on my abdomen. I was informed that I had undergone surgery. On April 6, Rasel and his associate Sumon relocated me to the hotel in Jasola. Rasel obtained my bank account details and deposited 4 lakh takas in it but confiscated my passport. My visa had expired in the interim and Rasel told me that I would no longer be employed and instructed me to return to Bangladesh.""S, the third Bangladeshi, suffered a similar experience. He was contacted by a person named Aronno on Facebook, who promised him a job in India with a stipend during training. He was asked to undergo extensive medical tests and 49 tubes of blood were drawn from him over six days. S said, ""I was administered something that made me feel weak and I lost consciousness. I woke up to find my kidney missing. I was told I could live with one kidney without any problem. I was paid 4.5 lakh takas.""The trio has returned to Bangladesh with their tales of horror.

The plea was mentioned before a division bench of Justices B P Colabawalla and Firdosh Pooniwalla for urgent hearing.The bench agreed to hear it on Wednesday. Ranaut, who has directed and co-produced the film besides playing the lead role of former prime minister late Indira Gandhi, on Monday accused the CBFC of stalling certification to delay the release.Scheduled for release on September 6, the biographical drama is caught up in controversy after Sikh organisations including the Shiromani Akali Dal objected, accusing it of misrepresenting the community and getting historical facts wrong.Kangana took to Twitter to express her frustration. She stated that despite rumors claiming the film had received its censor certificate, the certification process had been halted due to threats received by CBFC members. She alleged that there was pressure not to depict certain historical events and figures, such as the assassination of Indira Gandhi and the Punjab riots.The controversy began after the trailer for Emergency was released, which featured Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a controversial figure in the Khalistan movement. This portrayal led to legal action from the Delhi unit of the Shiromani Akali Dal and strong reactions from Sikh organizations like the Akal Takht and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC).","Zee Entertainment Enterprises, co-producer of Kangana Ranaut's upcoming film ""Emergency"" filed a petition in Bombay high court to seeking a direction to the Central Board of Film Certification to issue the film's certificate.

Haryana assembly elections: Congress-AAP explore 'win-win alliance' to consolidate Lok Sabha gains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/haryana-assembly-elections-congress-aap-explore-win-win-alliance-to-consolidate-lok-sabha-gains/articleshow/113068469.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress, which is exploring a ""win-win alliance"" with the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) in Haryana, on Wednesday set deadline for Arvind Kejriwal's party to finalise the seat-sharing deal. The Congress is also in talks with other parties, including Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party, as it explores the possibility of contesting the elections under the banner of opposition's INDIA bloc.""We are in talks for an alliance with AAP and are exploring a ""win-win situation"" for both the parties. The alliance should benefit both of us and we hope to finalise seat-sharing deal in a day or two. If the talks do not succeed in a day or two we will leave it,"" AICC in-charge of Haryana Deepak Babaria said.The Congress leader refused to share the details of ongoing negotiations but confirmed that AAP would be given seats in single-digit. According to reports, AAP has sought 10 assembly seats, but the Congress is not ready to give that many seats.""It will be a very small number, in single digit,"" Babaria said when asked about the number of seats the Congress was ready to give to Kejriwal's party.Congress and AAP, which share a blow hot and cold political relations, initiated discussions for a possible alliance at the behest of Rahul Gandhi, who wanted to ensure that opposition votes were not divided in Haryana. The alliance move comes as a surprise as both the parties have in the past made it clear that their association under INDIA banner was limited only to Lok Sabha elections. In fact, the state units of both the parties have spoken against any alliance at the state level. Punjab chief minister and senior AAP leader Bhagwant Singh Mann has gone to the extent of alleging that Congress is in collusion with BJP in Haryana.So, why are both the parties now trying for an alliance?The Congress is upbeat about its prospects in the state after the party's success in the recent Lok Sabha elections in which the grand old party wrested 5 Lok Sabha seats from the BJP. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had won 10 seats with a vote share of 58%, while the Congress could not open its account with 28% of the votes. The AAP, meanwhile. could manage only .36% of the voteshare.In the assembly elections later in 2019, the BJP lost majority as it won 40 seats in the 90-member assembly with a voteshare of 36.49%. This was 7 less than its 2014 tally. The Congress, meanwhile, increased its tally to 31 seats from 15 in 2014 with 28% voteshare. The AAP, with a .48% of voteshare, lost deposit in all the 46 seats it contested. The BJP did manage to form a government with the help of Dushyant Chautala's JJP, but the saffron party's prospects in the state did not improve. The saffron party made a course correction ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha elections replacing Manohar Lal Khattar with Nayab Singh Saini as the state's chief minister in March this year.However, in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP's tally was reduced to 5 seats and its vote share dipped to 46.11%. The Congress, on the other hand, consolidated its gains as it won 5 seats and increased its voteshare to 43.67%. The AAP also increased its presence in the state registering a voteshare of nearly 4%.The Congress would want to consolidate its gains further and not take any chances. By ensuring that the INDIA bloc contests together, Congress will hope to prevent any possible division of anti-BJP votes. Also the party would hope to benefit from AAP's influence in seats bordering Delhi where Arvind Kejriwal has a fairly strong presence.The AAP, which saw its vote share increase in the last Lok Sabha elections in alliance with the Congress, had earlier announced to contest all the 90 seats in the state. However, with Arvind Kejriwal in jail, the party perhaps realises that it can make only limited gains if it contests alone. A continued alliance with the Congress may help Kejriwal's party open its account in the state assembly.No wonder, the two parties hope that an alliance will be a win-win situation for both of them.But the BJP has been quick to target Congress over its alliance move. BJP leader Anil Vij has claimed that the Congress lacks strength to contest Haryana elections on its own so it is ""cosying up"" to the AAP. Political attacks notwithstanding, the fact remains that Congress and AAP are averse to any alliance in states where the two parties perceive themselves as strong contenders to power - like in Delhi and in Punjab.","Congress is exploring a ""win-win alliance"" with the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) in Haryana.

India tightens check to ensure no Chinese parts in defence drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tightens-check-to-ensure-no-chinese-parts-in-defence-drones/articleshow/113073127.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian defence establishment is now working out a stringent mechanism to ensure that military drones being acquired from domestic private sector companies do not have Chinese components in them, even as the Army has called drone manufacturers to showcase their products in a high-altitude area in Ladakh later this month.An ""appropriate methodology"", with the requisite technical evaluation parameters, is being formulated to prevent Chinese components and electronics from finding their way into the drones.Various methods are being deliberated upon to strengthen this framework, Army Design Bureau additional director general Major General C S Mann said on Wednesday.This urgent requirement has come to the fore after the defence ministry recently put an order for 200 medium-altitude logistics drones for the Army on hold, asking the manufacturer to prove it had not used Chinese components. The drones were primarily meant for deployment along the northern borders with China.The MoD's department of defence production has also asked industry bodies Ficci, CII and Assocham to ""sensitise and caution"" their member companies from procuring Chinese components for drones and other related equipment.Amid the military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh, which is into its fifth year now, the armed forces have gone in for the procurement of a wide array of drones. These range from nano, mini and micro drones to kamikaze, logistics, armed swarms and fighter-size MALE (medium-altitude, long-endurance) and HALE (high-altitude, long-endurance) UAVs.Maj General Mann said the Army will host the 'Him-Drone-A-Thon' for domestic companies to showcase their ""drone solutions for high-altitude areas"" at Wari La, near Leh, on Sept 17-18.""For drone operations, a rarefied atmosphere results in reduced lift and degraded engine performance, which are further accentuated by extreme cold temperatures and high wind speeds. These conditions are unique for the Indian Army and demand systems that can adequately perform in these conditions,"" he said.",The Indian defence establishment is working out a stringent mechanism to ensure that military drones being acquired from domestic private sector companies do not have Chinese components in them.

Central Industrial Security Force ( CISF ) personnel could be relieved from checking ticket details & matching them with photo I cards at terminal entry to allow passenger access — something that can be done by private agency guards — so that the former can focus completely on keeping airports secure.And the exhaustive upto eight-hour shifts that most personnel perform at airports could be reduced to ensure a fully alert watch.Govt sources say the Union home ministry had some time back set up a committee under recently retired IPS officer M A Ganapathy, an expert in aviation security , to study the existing security setup at airports and recommend changes. They add the committee has submitted its recommendations to the Govt which, if accepted and implemented, will lead to less visible but more effective security at airports.At present uniformed personnel in large numbers are deployed at terminals. The panel is learnt to have sought a mix of uniformed and plain clothes security personnel as that would reduce the unease among general public and at the same time enhance security. Airport security , the report is learnt to have stressed, must be inconspicuously foolproof.Govt sources say the committee is not in favour with continuing the long duration (upto eight-hour) shifts of security personnel as that leads to fatigue and less alertness, apart from negatively impacting their health. It has recommended shorter periods of duty to ensure more alert personnel who are the first responders in any crisis and have to hold fort till backup reaches the location. The committee has also recommended sufficient deployment of personnel — armed with night vision devices and thermal sights — along perimeter wall and land side (the terminal entry point side).The report is learnt to have suggested doing away with multiple tasks that security personnel are assigned with — like checking ticket details and matching them with passengers’ I cards to allow them terminal entry. It reportedly points out security personnel should specialise in one task to manage at a time to avoid distractions. Taking away the task of checking tickets and I cards will free up personnel for providing security cover at terminal entry points.Most importantly, the report has recommended setting up of a dedicated airport security group for all airports in the country comprising of personnel from CISF and state police forces. The report has called for ensuring work-life balance and better facilities, including accommodation, for personnel. And it has suggested holding annual validation tests to check the skill set of personnel deployed at airports and taking off duty those who fail from the same.Govt sources say the report is under consideration and will be implemented after consultation with all stakeholders.",CISF personnel could be relieved from checking ticket details & matching them with photo I cards at terminal entry to allow passenger access.

Aparajita Bill

?

President approval

Amid ongoing widespread protest across the nation for the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, the West Bengal Assembly on Tuesday passed the Aparajita Woman and Child Bill (West Bengal Criminal Laws and Amendment) Bill 2024.The bill passed by the Mamata Banerjee government, proposes stringent punishments, including the death penalty, for convicted rapists, especially in cases where the crime results in the victim’s death or leaves them in a vegetative state.The bill seeks to amend key sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, recently introduced criminal law by the central government.Those convicted of severe crimes could face death penalty or life imprisonment without possibility of parole. It also includes provisions for harsher sentences for repeat offenders, who could be sentenced to life imprisonment or even death.The bill provides quicker investigations, with a new three-week deadline for cases to be completed, a significant reduction from the current two-month period. However, an extension of up to 15 days could be granted under specific conditions.Additionally, the bill aims to establish a special task force called the ""Aparajita Task Force"" at the district level, led by a deputy superintendent of police. This task force would focus on handling these serious cases with the necessary resources and expertise to reduce the trauma for victims and their families.Special courts will also be set up to try these cases, and publishing any details about court proceedings without permission could result in imprisonment for up to five years, along with a fine. The bill, which will be introduced by State Law Minister Moloy Ghatak, is expected to be discussed in the state assembly soon.Criminal law in India falls under the concurrent list, meaning both state and central governments can legislate on the subject. However, for the Aparajita bill to be enacted, it must receive the President's approval.","The bill seeks to amend key sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023.

They are products of different times, different tools, different experiences.""""Poor Rahul has gone through two big shocks in life, (death of) his grandmother and his father.So they have had different paths to travel,"" he added.Pitroda, who has been known for his controversial remarks, compared Rahul and Rajiv's intellect saying, ""I had an opportunity to see many prime ministers from very close quarters but the difference between Rahul and Rajiv maybe is that Rahul is much more intellectual, thinker, Rajiv was a little more doer.""Referring to the 'pappu' image propagated in the political arena, Pitroda said, ""First of all the image created in the media was based on a well-orchestrated campaign against an individual where millions and millions of dollars were spent on maligning this young man and when he is highly educated, people said he never went to college.""Without taking any names, Pitroda took a dig at the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's poll promises.""You cannot lie all the time to all the people.

Dual citizenship allows individuals to hold the citizenship of two countries simultaneously, enjoying the rights and privileges of both nations. Many countries like the U.K., Germany, and Canada around the world recognize dual citizenship, enabling citizens to maintain ties with their home country while also integrating into another.Whether through birth, naturalisation, marriage, or investment, dual citizenship provides opportunities for expanded mobility, access to social services, and broader cultural experiences.However, the acceptance of dual citizenship varies widely, with some countries fully embracing it and others imposing strict limitations.Dual citizenship, also known as dual nationality, is the status in which an individual is recognized as a citizen of two countries simultaneously. This means that a person can hold two passports, vote in both countries (where applicable), and enjoy the rights and responsibilities of citizens in both nations. Dual citizenship can be obtained through various means, including birth, marriage, naturalisation, or descent from parents who are citizens of different countries.Dual citizenship is significant for several reasons, particularly in our increasingly globalised world. For individuals with strong ties to more than one country—through family, business, or cultural connections—dual citizenship can offer the freedom to live, work, and travel more easily between these countries. It also provides a sense of security, as individuals can fall back on the protections and privileges offered by either of the two nations. For some, dual citizenship is also a way to maintain a connection to their cultural or ancestral heritage.Dual citizens can live, work, and travel freely in both countries. This is particularly advantageous in regions like the European Union, where citizens of one member state can move freely between member countries.Dual citizens can access social services, including healthcare and education, in both countries. This can provide a safety net in case one country's system fails to meet their needs.In some countries, only citizens are allowed to own property. Dual citizenship can open up real estate opportunities in both countries.Dual citizens can participate in elections and contribute to the democratic processes in both countries, giving them a voice in how both countries are governed.Dual citizenship can be beneficial for entrepreneurs and investors, as it allows easier access to business opportunities, networks, and markets in both countries.Some countries require their citizens to pay taxes on their global income, regardless of where they live. This can lead to dual citizens being taxed by both countries on the same income.Dual citizens may be required to fulfil legal obligations, such as compulsory military service, in both countries.Managing citizenship in two countries can be complicated and involve navigating different legal systems, immigration laws, and bureaucratic processes.In times of diplomatic conflict between the two countries, dual citizens may face challenges or scrutiny, as they may be perceived as having conflicting loyalties.Some government positions, particularly in national security, may require individuals to renounce other citizenships to ensure loyalty to one country.The process of obtaining dual citizenship varies significantly from one country to another, depending on each nation's specific laws and regulations. Below are some common pathways through which individuals can obtain dual citizenship:One of the most straightforward ways to obtain dual citizenship is by birth. If you were born in a particular country, you might automatically qualify for citizenship, even if your parents are from another country. For example, individuals born in the United States may be eligible for dual citizenship if their parents are citizens of another country.Another common method is through naturalisation, where an individual can acquire citizenship after residing as a permanent resident for a specified number of years. For instance, in Canada, permanent residents must live in the country for four out of six years before they can apply for citizenship.Temporary residents, however, must first obtain permanent residency before their time in the country can count towards the citizenship requirement.Some countries offer an accelerated path to citizenship through marriage. By marrying a citizen of that country, individuals may gain permanent resident status, which can shorten the time required to become a citizen.Many countries now offer citizenship or residency through investment programs, particularly aimed at high-net-worth individuals. Citizenship by investment allows individuals to obtain a second citizenship by making a significant financial contribution to the host country’s economy.Similarly, residency by investment programs grant permanent residency after the investment, potentially expediting the process of becoming a citizen.",List of countries that do and do not allow dual citizenship.

Kamala Harris touts her small business tax plan during New Hampshire event

How many businesses could this impact?

No additional surtax on investment income

Current small business

tax deduction

Potential impact on new businesses

Broader economic plans

'A fight for something, not against something'

Key background

Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday distinguished herself from President Biden on tax policy, marking the first major issue where she has publicly diverged from the administration she is part of.At a campaign event in North Hampton, New Hampshire, Harris proposed a lower capital gains tax rate than Biden's plan. Her new proposal reportedly reflects the influence of her campaign's top donors, who encouraged her to moderate some of her previous tax positions.By positioning herself as a more business-friendly candidate, Harris seeks to attract support from Wall Street and Silicon Valley, incorporating business-centric language and policies into her platform, as reported by The New York Times.Harris, a former California senator, previously represented Silicon Valley in Congress.In addition to her revised stance on capital gains tax, Harris introduced a significant new tax break for start-ups. Her proposal would increase the allowable deduction for startup expenses from $5,000 to $50,000. Harris described it as “essentially a tax cut for starting a small business,” allowing new businesses to spread the deduction over multiple years or claim it in full once they are profitable. She also plans to simplify tax filing for businesses, comparing it to the ease of standard deductions for individuals.Under Biden’s current proposal, capital gains for those earning over $1 million would be taxed at 39.6%. Harris's plan suggests a lower 28% tax rate for the same group, marking a shift from her earlier support for Biden’s tax increases.Harris is aiming to attract 25 million new small business applications in her first term if elected president. President Joe Biden ’s administration announced Tuesday there have been 19 million new small business applications since the start of the president’s term.Harris's plan doesn’t include an additional surtax on investment income. Sources close to her campaign said that a 5% surtax could still apply, making the effective rate 33%, compared to Biden's total of 44.6% with the surtax, according to a The New York Times report. Currently, the top capital gains tax rate is 23.8%, including a 3.8% surtax.“My plan will make the tax code more fair while prioritising investment and innovation,” she said. “Billionaires and big corporations must pay their fair share in taxes.”Currently, small businesses can use a $5,000 deduction for startup expenses and amortize remaining costs over 15 years, according to The Wall Street Journal. Eligible startup costs include advertisements, employee training, consultant and executive salaries, and travel expenses related to securing customers and suppliers, as outlined by the IRS.Harris aims to attract 25 million new small business applications during her first term if elected. This goal contrasts with President Biden’s administration's announcement that 19 million new small business applications have been filed since Biden took office.Harris’s economic agenda includes an “opportunity economy” focus on supporting the middle class. Besides the new startup deduction, she plans to expand the child tax credit to $6,000 for newborns up to one year old and $3,600 per child for middle- and lower-income families. Additionally, she proposes tax cuts for the middle class, measures to combat “price gouging” at grocery stores, and up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers.Harris's new proposals come ahead of her scheduled debate with former President Donald Trump. In distancing herself from Biden's campaign rhetoric, Harris frames her approach as a positive agenda rather than merely opposing Trump. “When we talk about fighting, it’s a fight for something, not against something,” she emphasized.Harris's tax proposal also contrasts with Trump’s plan to extend expiring tax cuts for all income levels, including a 20% deduction for businesses. Harris currently holds a lead over Trump in several polls following the Democratic National Convention, including a four-point advantage among registered voters in an Ipsos/ABC News poll taken between Aug. 23-27.Biden’s tax proposals, meanwhile, have faced skepticism on Capitol Hill, affecting their likelihood of becoming law.","Kamala Harris proposed a lower capital gains tax rate than President Biden's plan. Her proposal would increase the allowable deduction for startup expenses from $5,000 to $50,000. Harris is aiming to attract 25 million new small business applications in her first term if elected president.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113077662,imgsize-1022413,width-400,resizemode-4/113077662.jpg"

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"'Very demure, very mindful' takes center stage as TikTok creator Jools Lebron tries to trademark viral phrase",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/very-demure-very-mindful-takes-center-stage-as-tiktok-creator-jools-lebron-tries-to-trademark-viral-phrase/articleshow/113077149.cms,"TikTok sensation Jools Lebron is making waves with a new move to secure her place in internet history. The creator, known for her catchphrase “very demure, very mindful,” has filed to trademark this now-viral expression, aiming to cover various entertainment and advertising services, including beauty product promotions.The buzz around “very demure, very mindful” began earlier this August when Lebron showcased her unique hair and makeup style on TikTok.Her distinctive delivery and the phrase itself quickly became a social media hit, with fans and celebrities alike jumping on the trend, using “mindful” and “cutesy” to describe everything from daily routines to extravagant events.Lebron’s viral success has not only brought her online fame but also provided financial support for her transition as a transgender woman. The trademark filings, submitted under her legal name, are now pending with the US Patent and Trademark Office. The goal? To safeguard her viral creation and potentially monetize the trend.However, the path to securing a trademark is far from straightforward. Several other parties have jumped into the fray, attempting to trademark demure-related phrases in a bid to capitalize on the trend, according to CBS News. This has sparked a race to claim ownership of the viral moment, with some filings pre-dating Lebron’s official submissions.The complexities of trademark law come into play here. Alexandra J Roberts, a law professor at Northeastern University, noted that trademarks must be tied to commercial use—meaning that it’s not enough to simply create aviral phrase . There must be a connection to the sale of specific goods or services. This requirement ensures that trademarks serve as clear indicators of origin for consumers, preventing confusion, reported CBS.Casey Fiesler, an associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, added that while Lebron’s phrase might be closely associated with her, trademarks are designed to avoid consumer confusion. Thus, if someone else were to start a business with a similar name, it could potentially mislead consumers into thinking it’s linked to Lebron’s brand.In the digital age, protecting intellectual property has become increasingly challenging. Content creators face the dual task of gaining recognition for their work and securing their rights amid a sea of online trends. Historically, creators from minoritized groups, particularly young women of color, have struggled to maintain control over their viral moments, often seeing their work appropriated by others with more resources.As for Lebron, her journey is just beginning. While her trademark filings are under review, she still has room to maneuver. She could negotiate with other applicants or challenge rival filings if they pose a threat to her brand. However, the trademark process can be lengthy, sometimes extending beyond the trend’s peak popularity.For now, Lebron has the freedom to continue promoting her “very demure, very mindful” merchandise. But turning these words into a protected brand will be a test of patience and legal savvy. As she navigates this complex landscape, the internet eagerly watches to see how the “very demure, very mindful” saga unfolds.","Jools Lebron has filed to trademark her now-viral phrase “very demure, very mindful.” The trademark filings, submitted under her legal name, are now pending with the US Patent and Trademark Office.
