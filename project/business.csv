'Rough patches' in ties resolved after India's troop pullout: Male,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rough-patches-in-ties-resolved-after-indias-troop-pullout-male/articleshow/113374025.cms,"NEW DELHI: Misunderstandings with India have been resolved through the latter's withdrawal of troops from the Maldives , the Indian Ocean neighbour said as India prepares to host President Mohamed Muizzu for his first official visit this month.Ties between the two nations have seen dramatic improvement since India replaced its military personnel, who manned Indian govt's relief choppers and aircraft, with civilian staff, leading to resumption of high-level visits.Muizzu had insisted on Indian troop withdrawal saying he would not allow any country to interfere with or undermine the Maldives' sovereignty.However, the thaw in ties with India has not come at the expense of the archipelago nation's reorientation towards China, as obvious from the agreement it signed last week to boost trade and investment ties with Beijing and also continued talks to strengthen defence cooperation between the two countries.Speaking about Maldives' ties with India and China, while on a visit to Sri Lanka, foreign minister Moosa Zameer admitted relations with India had faced challenges, following Muizzu's efforts to expel Indian military personnel. ""At the start of our govt, we did have some rough patches (with India), you know,"" Zameer was quoted as saying by a Maldivian newspaper. He added these ""misunderstandings"" had been resolved following the repatriation of Indian troops. Interestingly, the day Muizzu's office announced his visit to India, the Maldivian media also reported that two junior ministers who had made derogatory remarks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year had resigned from the govt.""We have good relations with both China and India, and both countries continue to support Maldives,"" he said, while thanking both countries for their support at a time international credit agencies were warning about the country's financial health.Zameer said that the Maldives has no plans to seek an IMF bailout , dismissing the current economic challenges faced by his country as ""temporary."" He said, ""We have bilateral partners who are very sensitive to our needs and our situation. I seriously don't think it is a time where we will be right now engaging with the IMF. The issue that we have is very temporary because currently, we are having a dip in reserves.""China was reported this week to have pulled the Maldives from the brink of a financial crisis with a bilateral agreement that will apparently act a framework for cooperation in ""promoting the settlement of current account transactions and direct investments in local currencies"".""China will, as always, provide support and assistance to the economic and social development of the Maldives within its capability,"" said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson.","Ties between the two nations have seen dramatic improvement since India replaced its military personnel, who manned Indian govt's relief choppers and aircraft, with civilian staff.

His inability to win public trust has long been evident, yet he continues to draw a ministerial salary. Perhaps those funds could be better utilised in addressing what seems to be a deeper mental affliction. Such a baseless accusation is not merely a lapse in judgement; it is a clear manifestation of a troubling disconnect between his speech and reasoning,"" Bajwa added.Bajwa said that Bittu's accusations were a clear display of irresponsibility, and he urged the Government of India to take action to ensure that those holding positions of authority maintain the ""integrity of the Constitution.""Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit also criticised Bittu, he used to praise Rahul Gandhi when he was in Congress, but now, after joining the BJP, he has swiftly shifted his allegiance to his new party.Bajwa's criticism was in response to Bittu's allegations, where he referred to Rahul Gandhi as ""the country's number one terrorist"" and claimed that Gandhi sympathised with separatists. Bittu also accused Gandhi of disseminating false information about the Sikh community while traveling abroad.""Rahul Gandhi is not an Indian, he has spent most of his time outside. He does not love his country much because he goes abroad and says everything in the wrong way. The people who are most wanted, separatists, and experts in making bombs, guns, and shells, have appreciated what Rahul Gandhi has said. The enemies of the country who try to blow up planes, trains, and roads, are in support of Rahul Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi is the country's number 1 terrorist. The biggest enemy of the country whom the agencies should catch is Rahul Gandhi today,"" he said.Bittu, a former member of the Congress party, accused Rahul of acting against the nation's interests, claiming that those who attempt to attack the country's infrastructure support Rahul.“Why are they teasing Sikhs? What do they want to do? He is speaking the language of terrorists like Pannun who are sitting abroad. I will speak the same when he is sitting in front of me in the parliament,"" he said.During his address to Indian Americans in Herndon, Virginia, Rahul had said, ""First of all, you have to understand what the fight is about. The fight is not about politics. That is superficial, the fight is about whether a Sikh is going to be allowed to wear his turban in India or a kada in India. Or he, as a Sikh, is going to be able to go to Gurdwara. That's what the fight is about. And not just for him, for all religions”.

I do not have any political party connections. Sorry, if I have said anything wrong.”Srinivasan, who is also the president of the Tamil Nadu hotel owners’ association, in a lighthearted comment raised concern about the varying GST rates on food items while addressing Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman during an event in Coimbatore.""Madam, a bun doesn't attract GST, but when cream is applied to make it a cream bun, it attracts 12 per cent GST. Customers now say, 'You bring the bun and cream separately, and I'll make the cream bun,'"" said Srinivasan. He also highlighted the challenges faced by the hotel's computer system in calculating the different tax rates when families order various items, and he urged the minister to simplify the GST structure for food by implementing a uniform rate across all items.Meanwhile, BJP leader K Annamalai apologised on behalf of the BJP's Tamil Nadu unit for making the conversation between the restaurant owner and the Finance Minister public.""On behalf of @BJP4TamilNadu , I sincerely apologise for the actions of our functionaries who shared a private conversation between a respected business owner and our Hon.

"FATF flags sluggish terror funding, laundering trials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fatf-flags-sluggish-terror-funding-laundering-trials/articleshow/113376954.cms,"NEW DELHI: The slow pace of trial in cases of money laundering and terror financing remains a concern with Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) scheduled to release its review report on India on Sept 19. After a recent evaluation, the Paris-based intergovernmental body had placed New Delhi in the 'regular evaluation' list.Though ED probes into money laundering and terror financing (ML&TF) & working of its reporting mechanism such as Financial Intelligence Unit and banks on suspicious transactions are appreciated by global anti-money laundering watchdog, but long pending cases in courts have been raised by the FATF as a matter of concern.Of 11 parameters, FATF has appreciated India's performance on six compliance issues while New Delhi needs to improve on five others. The parameters include scope of criminal offence of ML&TF, confiscation of proceeds of crime, customer due diligence and record-keeping, reporting of suspicious transactions and compliance, measures to be taken with respect to countries that do not or insufficiently comply with FATF recommendations, mutual legal assistance and extradition, transparency of legal system and powers of competent authorities.India was upgraded to a 'regular follow up' category in which only four other G20 countries are placed, including the UK, France, Italy and Russia. Even the US, Japan and China are in the 'enhanced follow up' list, which mandates reporting every three months. India's latest upgrade will need a review only after three years.With regard to implementation of anti-ML&TF regime as required by FATF, a report from ED revealed the agency had in last 10 years conducted 7,300 searches, arrested 755 accused and attached assets worth over Rs 1.2 lakh crore. It confiscated assets worth over Rs 15,700 crore from total attachments during this period and restituted over Rs 16,000 crore to banks and other victims after disposal of assets, all in the last few years.Over 40 extradition requests were filed by the agency against economic offenders who have fled the country, 24 red corner notices issued and four accused extradited and arrested here, including the two prime accused in the AgustaWestland money laundering case.But what is of concern, and also raised by FATF, is delayed trials in money laundering and terror financing cases, leading to very few convictions. In the last decade, ED has registered over 5,000 cases of ML&TF, but it has been able to complete investigations only in about 1,300 cases where it has filed chargesheets. Even after filing of chargesheets, the trials have not progressed much in many cases leading to less than 50 convictions so far.FATF has, however, appreciated India's performance in international cooperation with regard to providing investigation support to foreign countries in cases of terror financing and money laundering.","The slow pace of trial in cases of money laundering and terror financing remains a concern with Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) scheduled to release its review report on India on Sept 19.

'Bastar Olympics': Calling ex-Maoists & IED victims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bastar-olympics-calling-ex-maoists-ied-victims/articleshow/113376927.cms,"Officials hope 'Olympics' inject 'feel-good' factor in Maoist zone

RAIPUR: Victims of Naxalite violence and surrendered Maoists , who can't see eye to eye, may now come face to face, or even team up, in the ' Bastar Olympics ' - a one-of-its kind village games meant to bridge gaps and build hope in the Maoist-affected region.Chhattisgarh govt is organising the games from Nov 1. This unique initiative is meant to encourage youngsters, inculcate sporting spirit, and help mainstream ex-Maoists.Deputy CM Vijay Sharma, who heads the home department, told TOI the event is focused on children and youth, mainly those victimised by insurgency.""This will boost their confidence and spirit for looking forward in life. Those who perform well ...will be felicitated and govt will help them explore their field of interest,"" he said.The games come at a time when intense security ops have pushed Maoists on the backfoot and govt sees a clear path for development. Dozens of schools closed for two decades are reopening in erstwhile Maoist dens. Officials hope the Olympics will inject a feel-good factor in what's been a battleground for over two decades.An official explained to TOI that engaging Bastar youth in studies and sports will keep them away from Maoist attempts to recruit them. In a rare admission recently, CPI(Maoist) had issued a booklet where it acknowledged the difficulties in recruiting cadres due to the sustained security operations. Bastar Olympics will coincide with the general time when Maoists go around villages, seeking to rope in, or drag, youngsters into their fold.The games will begin at the block level to ensure maximum reach, Bastar range sports officer Ravindra Pattnaik told TOI. ""As per initial plan, block-level Olympics will be organised from Nov 1-15, followed by district level contests from Nov 15-20 and divisional level finals at Jagdalpur from Nov 8-30. The winners will be presented with cash prizes and mementos,"" he said.Surrendered cadres and victims of Maoist violence will play only at the divisional level, Pattnaik said. There will be four sub-categories - victims of IED blasts or Maoist violence, surrendered Maoists, junior and senior groups.The list of participants has not been prepared yet, because the detailed guidelines are yet to be finalised, said officials. Disciplines include hockey, football, kabaddi, volleyball, weightlifting (only men) and tug of war (only women). It's not usual for Maoist victims and surrendered cadres to come face to face, or together in general public.Police are careful to keep former Maoists away from the local population as far as possible, keeping them in special camps for the cooling period. 'Bastar Olympics' will be an unprecedented platform for the meeting of two sides whose relationship outside the arena is dominated by fear, pain and loss.When TOI tried to find out how victims feel about the games, those who could be contacted were extremely wary. One of them said, ""I don't have a leg. It was blown up by an IED. How will I play any game?"" Another said: ""I would be quite embarrassed. I have an amputated limb.""In Maoist-affected areas of Bastar division, villagers live in utter dread of Maoists - so much so that families dare not inform police when one of their loved ones is murdered by Maoists. Activists aren't too enthused by the games. ""It's being organised with the hidden agenda of gathering public support for the militarisation going on in Bastar which is focused on corporate loot of minerals, land and forest,"" activist Sanjay Parate said.","Chhattisgarh govt is organising the games from Nov 1.

""We believe in the process of democracy and there is a commitment to the people of J&K that statehood will be restored.

20 bodyguards for 'voyager': Inside Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s $6-figure security detail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/20-bodyguards-for-voyager-inside-tesla-ceo-elon-musks-6-figure-security-detail/articleshow/113353777.cms,"Tesla's headquarters in Austin, Texas, has ramped up security measures following a series of disturbing threats targeting CEO Elon Musk and other high-ranking executives. According to Business Insider, the company has made over five emergency 911 calls linked to ""terroristic threats"" between April 2022 and January 2024, prompting Tesla to spend millions to ensure the safety of its personnel and facilities.One of the most serious incidents occurred in March 2023 when then-Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn received a death threat via email. The email demanded $300,000 in bitcoin to spare his life, although authorities later deemed the threat a scam. Kirkhorn stepped down from his position in August 2023, months after the threat. In January 2024, another 911 call was made after a Tesla employee used X, formerly Twitter, to threaten Musk and U.S. President Joe Biden. The employee was arrested, and the threat was classified as ""terroristic.""Musk, who is code-named ""Voyager"" by his security team, rarely goes anywhere without his extensive security detail . The New York Times reported that Musk is typically flanked by as many as 20 security personnel, some armed, and accompanied by a medical professional. His net worth, estimated at over $250 billion by Bloomberg, has placed him at greater risk, necessitating constant protection. His security costs reportedly run into six figures monthly, once reaching over $163,000 in a single month in 2016.As Musk’s wealth and status have grown, so too have the risks. At Tesla's shareholder meeting in June 2024, Musk revealed that ""two homicidal maniacs"" had tried to kill him in recent months, forcing him to become more cautious. ""I probably need to, like, not get assassinated or something,"" Musk said.Musk has also taken personal measures to protect himself, including buying a house with 24/7 security after his address became public. Tesla's SEC filings show that Musk’s security company billed the company $2.4 million in 2023 and another $500,000 by February 2024.Tesla’s increased security also extends beyond Musk. The company has bolstered surveillance and personnel at its factories following recent layoffs, and factory workers in both Nevada and Texas now undergo multiple security checks each day to enter the facilities.","Tesla has made over five emergency 911 calls linked to ""terroristic threats"" between April 2022 and January 2024.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"Preschools turn nursing homes, retirement age raised: China's demographic crisis explodes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/20000-preschools-shut-retirement-age-raised-chinas-demographic-crisis-comes-to-a-head/articleshow/113322208.cms,"Demographic crisis



Retirement age raised

'An inevitable choice'

NEW DELHI: In a major indication that alarm bells are going off in Beijing due to an impending demographic crisis that could potentially have severe impact on its economy , healthcare and social welfare systems, China's top legislative body on Friday announced plans to raise the country's retirement age .The development also comes as reports have highlighted that over 22,000 kindergartens have been closed across China in the past two years due to plummeting birth rates, with some turning into nursing homes to tend to the elderly.A slowing economy, shrinking government benefits and a decades-long one-child policy have created a creeping demographic crisis in China. China's pension pot is also running dry and the country is running out of time to build enough of a fund to care for the growing number of elderly.Over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce . This is the country's largest age group, nearly equivalent to the size of the US population.Significantly, the national population fell in 2023 for the second year in a row.Reform is urgent with life expectancy in China having risen to 78 years as of 2021 from about 44 years in 1960 and projected to exceed 80 years by 2050.The number of people aged 60 and older is projected to rise dramatically, with estimates suggesting that this demographic will account for about 30% of the population by 2035, up from 14.2% in 2021.At the same time, the working population needed to support the elderly is shrinking.The decision to raise the retirement age, marks the first such adjustment since the 1970s and accelerates an overhaul of decades-old laws to tackle the economic pressure of a shrinking workforce.China's retirement ages are currently among the lowest globally.The retirement age will be raised for men to 63 years old from 60, while for women in white collar work it would be raised to 58 years from 55. For women in blue collar work it will be adjusted to 55 from 50.The changes will come into effect from January 1, 2025 and will be implemented over the next 15 years with incremental adjustments occurring every few months.""Starting 2030, the minimum year of basic pension contributions required to receive monthly benefits will also be gradually raised from 15 years to 20 years at the pace of an increase of six months annually,"" said news agency Xinhua. By 2039, they would have to clock 20 years of contributions to access their pensions.The new rules will also allow Chinese people ""to postpone retirement to an even later date if they reach an agreement with employers"".Retiring before the statutory age will not be allowed, state news agency Xinhua reported, although people can extend their retirement by no more than three years.The demographic crisis poses severe risks to China's economy, particularly regarding the pension system. A report from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences projected that the state pension fund could be depleted by 2035 if no reforms are enacted. The increasing number of retirees, coupled with a declining birth rate, places immense pressure on the pension system, which relies on a robust workforce to support an expanding elderly population.By extending the retirement age, the government aims to alleviate some of this pressure. Delaying retirement can help stabilise the labour force participation rate and reduce the financial burden on the pension system. Moreover, it allows for a larger tax base to support social welfare programs, which is crucial as the population ages.But delaying pension payouts and requiring older workers to stay at their jobs longer may not be welcomed by all.""In the next 10 years, there will be another bill that will delay retirement until we are 80,"" one user wrote on a Chinese social media site Weibo.Further, many younger workers fear that an expanded labour pool will intensify competition for jobs, particularly as youth unemployment rates have soared to alarming levels. In July 2024, the jobless rate for those aged 16 to 24 reached 17.1%, raising concerns about the economic prospects for younger generations""What a miserable year! Middle-aged workers are faced with pay cuts and raised retirement ages. Those who are unemployed find it increasingly difficult to get jobs,"" another chimed in.However, Mo Rong, director of the Chinese Academy of Labour and Social Security, told the People's Daily that raising the retirement age was ""an inevitable choice for our country to adapt to the new normal of population development"".","China's top legislative body on Friday announced plans to raise the country's retirement age.

US sanctions Chinese firms supporting Pakistan's ballistic missile program,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/us-sanctions-chinese-firms-supporting-pakistans-ballistic-missile-program/articleshow/113308230.cms,"NEW DELHI: The sanctions target five entities and one individual under missile sanction laws for proliferating ballistic missiles and controlled missile equipment and technology.""The Department of State is taking action against five entities and one individual that have been involved in the proliferation of ballistic missiles and controlled missile equipment and technology.Specifically, the Department of State is designating the Beijing Research Institute of Automation for Machine Building Industry (RIAMB) pursuant to Executive Order 13382, which targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery,"" state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.This is not the first time the US has taken action against entities involved in supplying Pakistan's ballistic missile program.

There has also been a 20-30% tariff increase on electricity and other energy products, hitting the common man hard.Pakistan's external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.The February general election produced Shehbaz Sharif-led shaky coalition government, which now has the challenging task of tackling deep-rooted structural problems to pull the $350-billion economy out of its misery.Since joining the multilateral lender in 1950, Pakistan has secured 24 IMF bailouts, the latest being subject to approval by the lender's executive board and the confirmation of necessary financing assurances from the country's development and bilateral partners.","Islamabad has been working on implementing conditions from the IMF to complete a $7 billion, 37-month loan programme agreed in July.
