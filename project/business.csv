Government readies new strategy for higher education institutes to boost students' mental health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-readies-new-strategy-for-higher-education-institutes-to-boost-students-mental-health/articleshow/115130110.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre is rolling out a comprehensive mental health and well-being programme for higher education institutions (HEIs) across India.In a collaborative effort, over 200 institutions, including premier IITs, IIMs, NITs, and central and state universities, 350 students and faculty, are engaged in discussions to strengthen mental health support mechanisms.Govt has outlined a four-pronged strategy that includes capacity building and model institution visits. A National Wellbeing Conclave underway at IIT Hyderabad will set a structured framework for psychosocial support among students in HEIs.The programme's holistic approach targets both immediate needs and preventive measures for long-term mental health improvement. It aims to help students in need while fostering an environment that encourages healthy behaviours and prevents the onset of mental health disorders.For the first time, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman included mental health in the Economic Survey 2023-24, presented in Parliament on July 22, 2024. Acknowledging mental health as a key driver of national development, the Survey cited findings from National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) 2015-16, indicating that 10.6% of Indian adults suffer from mental disorders, with a significant treatment gap of 70-92%. Mental health challenges are particularly prevalent in urban metros, where 13.5% of the population is affected, compared to 6.9% in rural and 4.3% in urban non-metro areas. Additionally, an NCERT survey reported worsening mental health among adolescents, a trend exacerbated by Covid-19 pandemic.In line with these findings, the Conclave on Sunday is bringing together educators, students, mental health experts, and policymakers. The event, themed ""Integrated Approach for Promoting Mental Health, Resilience and Wellbeing,"" aims to address the urgent need for mental health support in HEIs, deliberating on general mental health awareness to managing severe mental health conditions, helping institutions implement a structured, multi-tiered support system.Guided by National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, ministry of education has initiated a framework for HEIs focusing on physical and mental health. Ahead of the conclave, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan told TOI, ""This framework encourages institutions to create environments conducive to students' social, emotional, and academic growth. Several HEIs, including IIT Madras with its KUSHAL programme, have introduced wellness initiatives that include surveys, grievance redressal, counselling, and peer support networks. Other institutions, such as IIIT Allahabad, have incorporated AI-driven mental health monitoring, while others engage families to support students' well-being.""","Govt has outlined a four-pronged strategy that includes capacity building and model institution visits.

CJI: Pressure on judges from private interest groups as well,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-pressure-on-judges-from-pvt-interest-groups-as-well/articleshow/115128910.cms,"NEW DELHI: The pressure on judges comes not just from the political executive, but also from private interest groups , CJI D Y Chandrachud said, during an extensive and frank interaction as Guest Editor of The Times Of India on Saturday.Elaborating, the CJI, who demits office on Monday, said private interest groups use news TV and social media to create an atmosphere where a judge often feels pressured to go in a particular direction. The price of independence here, he pointed out, is to be subjected to heavy trolling. ""You will be trolled, you will be attacked,"" he said. On the larger issue of judicial independence , Justice Chandrachud said it's wrong to measure independence only by looking at judgments where the Supreme Court went against govt views. ""It's a reflection of the state of our polity today,"" he observed, arguing polarised views mean that each ""end of the spectrum"" judges SC's independence by whether the court concurs with it. ""I think I have tried to draw a balance,"" the CJI said. He added he's never tried to fit a judgment to a preconceived view, rather he's gone where his judicial reasoning took him.But the CJI and all high court chief justices need to work with govts on the administrative side, Justice Chandrachud said, recounting his efforts to improve judicial infrastructure , funds for which come from govts. Consultation with govts is also key to resolving court-executive differences , he said, illustrating his point with the SC collegium-Centre differences on selecting judges, an issue that has hit headlines many times.""I have always been candid with the govt,"" CJI said, referring to times when the govt has pushed back on a collegium decision. ""But all differences can't be resolved,"" he added frankly. On perhaps the best-known example of those differences - the govt not yet okaying collegium's decision to appoint lawyer Saurabh Kirpal as an HC judge - the CJI said his view is that neither a prospective judge's sexuality nor the fact that his partner is a foreign citizen can be held against him when assessing his fitness for the job.A CJI known for the clarity with which he writes his judgments, he was emphatic in saying judgments written in archaic or bad English did disservice to those seeking justice. And demonstrating he himself was not attached to stale custom, he said he's for both doing away with the stuffy attire lawyers have to wear in a hot country and simple architecture, not forbiddingly grand, when it comes to building courthouses.","CJI D Y Chandrachud says pressure on judges comes not just from political executive, but also from private interest groups.

"Barring disabled a sign of bias, violates their rights, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-inclusion-of-disabled-in-med-practice-key-to-humane-outlook/articleshow/115128343.cms,"CJI: Inclusion of disabled in med practice key to humane outlook

NEW DELHI: Observing that no one wants to forfeit claim to pursue education or his/her preferred profession due to disability, Supreme Court has appealed for a change in the approach of govt authorities by focusing more on the ability and not the disability of such persons, and bring them into the social mainstream and allow the differently abled to pursue studies and jobs in their chosen field.Allowing the plea of a medical aspirant who was denied admission to MBBS course due to a faulty assessment of his ""disability"", the top court said that if reasonable accommodation is denied to a differently abled person, it would amount to discrimination and a violation of fundamental rights, which would not only demean the individual's aspirations but also harm the country as a whole.""The courts cannot be stupefied into inaction by the lack of adequate framework or expertise when questions of fundamental rights emerge. The flurry of cases concerning medical aspirants with disability which has come before this court shows that the overarching issue is a sense of over-medicalisation of disabled bodies by the assessment boards,"" said a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra.""The approach often taken, due to inertia or unwittingly, is to assume that a person with disability may not be eligible for pursuing the course and then to put the candidates under tests to prove the assumption,"" it added.The approach focuses more on the disability of a person than their ability. This turns the principle of reasonable accommodation on its head. The question instead that the board ought to ask itself is this - what measures can be taken to ensure that the candidate with disability can start his/her MBBS course on an equal footing with their prospective classmates?"" the court said.This is one among the series of verdicts delivered in recent times to protect the interests of differently abled people who faced various bottlenecks in getting entry into educational institutions.On Oct 16, in a landmark verdict meant to demolish entry barriers for people with disability in educational institutions, Supreme Court had held that quantified disability by itself will not disentitle a candidate from being considered for admission in educational institutions, and they would be eligible for admission if the disability assessment board opines that the disability won't come in the way of pursuing a course of study. Earlier, SC had quashed a rule that barred colour-blind students from gaining admission to MBBS courses.CJI Chandrachud, who authored the verdict for the bench, said that the inclusion of persons with disabilities in medical practice is vital to ensure that the approach of the medical community, hospitals and other healthcare institutions is humane, sensitive, and informed by lived experiences. He said a society where discrimination and exclusion are addressed and eliminated will create a just and equitable system for all persons regardless of their identities.""Persons with disability are not objects of pity or charity but an integral part of our society and nation. The advancement of rights for persons with disabilities is a national project along with eradication of all forms of discrimination. A component of this project is the inclusion of persons with disabilities in all pursuits of life,"" the CJI said.","Supreme Court has appealed for a change in the approach of govt authorities by focusing more on the ability and not the disability of such persons.

Pakistan on social media overdrive to revive terrorism in Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-on-social-media-overdrive-to-revive-terrorism-in-kashmir/articleshow/115124996.cms,"New Delhi: An exponential rise in social media activity over the past month by Pakistan and PoK-based terrorist handles, aimed at glamourising terrorism and secessionism in J&K, as well as threatening anti-India posts, is being viewed by Indian security agencies as ""a fresh bid by Pakistan-backed terror outfits to revive local terror recruitment in J&K"", according to intelligence sources.An analysis by the agencies here of anti-India activities across ""identified"" Pakistan and PoK-based terror-linked accounts on platforms like Facebook, X, Telegram, Dark Web etc, revealed over 2,000 'posts of concern' in the past one month alone (Oct-Nov), as against 89 during the corresponding period of 2023. This translates to a more than 22-fold rise.Of the nearly 2,016 objectionable posts, more that 130 each were terrorism-specific and anti-India rants, 33 backed separatism and secessionism, and 310 were in the nature of threats to infrastructure and public places like schools etc, TOI has learnt.A senior officer in the central security establishment told TOI that the social media route to influence and exploit impressional minds of J&K youths and radicalise them for anti-national activities - something that had seen young Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani turn into a terror icon before he was killed in 2016 - follows a sharp decline in the number of local Kashmiris joining terrorist outfits. Just four locals in J&K - two from Shopian and one each from Srinagar and Tral - were recruited for terrorist activities till Nov this year, down from 22 in 2023 and 113 in 2022. In fact, there are only 30 local terrorists operating in J&K as of now, as against 75-80 foreign terrorists.""Attempts at raising local recruitment may not point to plans for a troubled winter but to preparations for heightened terror activity in the summer of 2025,"" said an officer.The decline in local recruitment in the past few years was attributed by a senior J&K govt functionary to the central and the UT administration's zero-tolerance approach to terror over the past few years, which focused not only on tackling terrorists but also on dismantling the terror eco-system by choking funding and cracking down on overground supporters by denying them govt jobs and clearances for passports, driving licence, etc.Interestingly, the rise in terrorist outfits' social media outreach to J&K youths coincides with the installation of an elected govt in the UT.Agencies are probing whether the changed power equations in J&K, even though control of police remains with the LG, have emboldened the Pakistan-based terrorist masterminds to whip up trouble there. A recent intelligence input warned of the plan of Pakistan's ISI to target over a dozen Jamaat-e-Islami leaders in Kashmir through their terror associates ""in the near future"". This could be to create public unrest or possibly linked to JeI's decision to enter the political space by contesting the recent J&K assembly elections, a source told TOI.Drone activity, meanwhile, continues to be a concern in J&K, with 40 sightings reported until Oct this year as compared to 31 in the corresponding period of 2023.","Over 2,000 'posts of concern' in the past one month alone (Oct-Nov), as against 89 during the corresponding period of 2023.

It will not allow infiltration to continue,"" Nadda asserted to the crowd.He went on to criticize the current JMM-led government, saying, “Corrupt people and thieves are part of the JMM-led government in the state.” Nadda urged voters to replace what he termed the “single-engine government” with a “double-engine government” for Jharkhand’s comprehensive development under the BJP’s leadership.Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi's influence on India’s global standing, Nadda highlighted a recent statement from US President-elect Donald Trump, who described Modi as a “close friend,” reflecting India’s elevated image internationally.Nadda also cited economic strides under Modi’s leadership, noting that India now ranks second in steel manufacturing and fifth in the mobile phone market globally. ""The budget for highways was increased by 50 percent under PM Modi,"" he added.Emphasizing Modi’s efforts to uplift tribal communities, Nadda pointed out that the tribal welfare budget was tripled, funding for Eklavya model schools increased twenty-one times, and about 1.5 crore toilets were built for tribals as part of the 11 crore toilets constructed nationwide.In another rally in Bishrampur, Nadda claimed that Jharkhand’s citizens are frustrated with the JMM-led government’s “corruption and appeasement politics” and are ready to embrace ""good governance and development"" under Modi's leadership. Nadda later met with members of the medical fraternity in Ranchi, underscoring the party's commitment to improved healthcare in the state.","BJP President Jagat Prasad Nadda pledged that if the BJP is elected to power, it would prevent children of Bangladeshi infiltrator fathers and local Adivasi mothers from accessing tribal rights.

UP women’s panel proposes ban on male tailors and barbers for ladies: A move against ‘bad touch’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/up-womens-body-proposes-men-shouldnt-tailor-womens-clothes-or-cut-their-hair/articleshow/115077086.cms,"UP women's body proposes men shouldn't tailor women's clothes or cut their hair

NEW DELHI: In an eyebrow-raising proposal aimed at safeguarding women, the Uttar Pradesh state women’s commission has suggested a ban on male tailors measuring women and male barbers styling women’s hair. The recommendation, which advocates for a female-only rule in tailoring and salons, is aimed at curbing instances of ""bad touch"" and discouraging ""ill intentions"" from male professionals, according to the commission.The proposal was made during a meeting on October 28, where women’s commission chairperson Babita Chauhan led the discussion, gaining support from the attending members. Himani Agarwal, a commission member, disclosed the details of the suggestion on Friday, as reported by PTI.""At the meeting, we proposed that only female tailors should take women’s measurements and that CCTV cameras should be installed in these areas to ensure women’s safety,"" Agarwal said. ""In salons, only female barbers should attend to female clients."" She explained that such restrictions could help prevent inappropriate behavior, adding, ""Some men in these professions do not have good intentions, which can lead to molestation.""Agarwal clarified that the intent isn’t to paint all men as predatory but to address specific instances where women have felt uncomfortable. ""Not all men have bad intentions,"" she said, acknowledging the potential sensitivities surrounding the proposal.Currently, the commission is in the early stages of pushing this idea and plans to appeal to the state government to consider formal legislation. While the proposal has sparked discussions on the necessity and practicality of such restrictions, the commission believes this measure could create a safer environment for women in Uttar Pradesh.","UP women's body proposes men shouldn't tailor women's clothes or cut their hair.

However, when the second petition was called out for hearing, Upadhyay did not have to persuade the bench.The CJI issued notice to Centre, and finding SG Tushar Mehta around, told him to persuade the govt to include the Indian healthcare system - ayurveda , yoga, naturopathy - in the national health protection mission - PM-JAY. The SG promised to take up the matter with the govt.Upadhyay complained that though Centre, to achieve universal health coverage for economically weaker sections and below poverty line population, launched Ayushman Bharat scheme in conformity with recommendation of National Health Policy, 2017, it excluded ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy from its ambit.Ayushman Bharat scheme includes health and wellness centres and envisages to convert primary health centres into 1,50,000 health & wellness centres. PM-JAY, launched in Sept 2018, gives health coverage of Rs 5 lakh to 12 crore poor and vulnerable families.These plans predominantly cover and are limited to allopathic hospitals and dispensaries even though India has a rich heritage and knowledge base of ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy, siddha, unani and homeopathy systems of medicine which are effective in addressing certain health issues, the petitioner said.",CJI D Y Chandrachud entertained the last PIL in his 25-year-long career.

UPA govt, led by Manmohan Singh, had formed a dedicated 'group of ministers' to discuss the issue but its prolonged discussions did not lead to any concrete output, despite touching a crescendo at one point. It is likely the second time that a top govt or parliamentary body will discuss the subject.The parliamentary committee on welfare of SCs/STs has listed it as part of its annual agenda of deliberations. Sources said the subject was mooted by Azad Samaj Party MP Chandrashekhar Azad in the first meeting of the panel to finalise list of business, and found support from others.The proposal to extend quotas to private sector, which has had some push from champions of social justice but never became a forceful demand, has a polarising edge. While its proponents argue that rapid privatisation is leading to shrinking of seats in govt sector that fall in ambit of reservations, other decry that it will hurt the economy and compromise merit in appointments in the industry and corporate sector. Some also argue that enforcing quotas in private bodies would be unconstitutional.Chairman of the committee, Faggan Singh Kulaste said, ""The issues are decided by the members.

""Earlier, the last date for submission of details was Nov 8 but many colleges have not filled or partially filled the required information. Thus, we have given a final deadline of Nov 23 to medical colleges to provide the required information,"" B Srinivas, secretary, NMC told TOI.Last year, NMC carried out an informal exercise to double-check that MBBS admissions made by colleges were in accordance with the regulations. It was found that there were instances, at least 30-40 of them, where the admission was inconsistent with the rules. For example, sources said, students who obtained less than 50% marks in 10+2 (physics, chemistry, biology) were granted admission.The NMC secretary said they have, for the first time, developed an online monitoring system to ensure faithful adherence to norms of admission and to further promote transparency and accountability in medical education. There are approximately 1.20 lakh undergraduate medical seats across govt and private medical colleges in the country.Srinivas said while granting admission in MBBS courses, medical colleges are required to ensure it is not beyond their sanctioned intake capacity. Also, colleges must make sure that the students meet eligibility requirements regarding age and qualifying marks.All students who are admitted in MBBS course are supposed to have qualified NEET-UG with the required percentile; 50th percentile and above for general category, 45th percentile and above for physically handicapped and 40th percentile and above for reserved (SC/ST/OBC) candidates.In addition to this, all admissions should be made through common counselling.

She went into depression and filed the FIR a year later.Assistant commissioner of police (Kalyanpur) Abhishek Kumar Pandey said the case was registered on Friday after she approached the Kalyanpur police station.

The student was 17 years old when this happened.In her complaint, the survivor told police that in January 2023, Siddiqui invited her to his friend's flat in Kalyanpur's Makdi-Khera area for a New Year's party, saying other students would be there as well.She alleged that when she reached the flat, she found only Siddiqui there who drugged her by lacing her soft drink with sedatives and raped her while also recording the episode on video.According to the complaint, Siddiqui allegedly held her hostage in his flat for over six months, during which he repeatedly raped her and also threatened to share the video online if she spoke to anyone about it.The student alleged that Porwal raped her a few months after this.She said in the FIR that she could not muster the courage to seek police help as she was afraid that it might land her family in danger.Six months later, the girl's mother arrived in Kanpur and took her along.Initially, the girl was hesitant to approach the police, but she made up her mind to take the step when she came across a video showing Siddiqui sexually harassing a coaching student.""An FIR has been registered against both accused teachers under the Pocso Act and other BNS sections, including 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc., with intent to commit an offence), 376(2)(n) (commits rape repeatedly on the same woman), 344 (wrongful confinement for 10 or more days) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation),"" said ACP (Kalyanpur) Abhishek Kumar Pandey.","A minor student from Fatehpur who moved here to prepare for her medical entrance exam NEET was allegedly held hostage for over six months and raped by two of its teachers.

MUMBAI: In the charged poll season, candidates are going all out on social media to ensure messages make a lasting impression. Timelines are buzzing as incumbents and new contenders work overtime to amplify their reach, using hashtags to stand out.From assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar, who is using #PaanchSaalBemisaal to highlight his work in Colaba since the last polls, to Mulund MLA Mihir Kotecha's #Mihir4Mulund and Bhiwandi MLA Rais Shaikh's #RiseWithRais, each slogan is trying to capture campaigns' essence. Amin Patel, Mumbadevi MLA, is tapping into local sentiments in the minority-dominant constituency with #AwaamKiAwaaz and #AwaamOfMumbaadevi. His opponent, Sena's Shaina NC, is making use of #ShainaNC4MumbaDevi. Then there's incumbent Bandra West MLA Ashish Shelar, who is running #ApnaAshishHaiNa, and MP Lodha, Malabar Hill MLA, with #HameshaAapkeSaath.Some candidates' posts on X give updates on their group meetings, housing society visits and yatras to various corners of their constituencies.According to citizen groups on social media, these hashtags may be an effective way to connect with the electorate but they have a word of caution. ""With artificial intelligence already honing in on keywords across social media, they lack impact and serve little real purpose,"" said advocate Trivankumar Karnani, founder of Citizen Welfare Forum-Mumbai North Central District Forum, which raises citizens' issues on X.Mandeep Singh Makkar, founder of Chandivali Citizens Welfare Association , who handles @ChandivaliCCWA, said such hashtags are only a type of propaganda and may not convert into votes.""Today, the voter is smart enough and not ready to be manipulated by such hashtags. People would rather have their issues resolved than see such hashtags.""However, in an era where digital presence is crucial, some candidates believe that a powerful online identity can make some kind of impact. RTI activist Anil Galgali said while politicians understand hashtags may not make a huge difference, in today's scenario-where elections can be decided by just a few hundred votes-every vote matters. ""If social media can help them reach even a small segment of voters, no candidate wants to miss that opportunity."" Galgali referred to Sena's Ravindra Waikar beating Sena (UBT)'s Amol Kirtikar for the Mumbai North-West seat in the LS polls by just 48 votes-the narrowest margin across the country during the election.Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said hashtags resonate with educated, cosmopolitan and elite voters. ""A hashtag might work to some extent for Narwekar in Colaba whose voters are educated. We've moved far from the days when autos with loudspeakers aired catchy taglines.""Jondhale credited BJP for pioneering the use of social media in elections. ""Take incumbent Bandra West MLA Ashish Shelar's hashtag #ApnaAshishHaiNa-it's informal, making voters feel he's one of them. This kind of language builds stronger rapport with voters,"" he said.","Candidates are going all out on social media to ensure messages make a lasting impression.

""Very good question. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is accepting investments from Adani, there is nothing wrong if we also accept funds from Adani for the development of Telangana,"" Reddy said.In the recent past, the Adani group has donated Rs 100 crore to the Telangana govt for the establishment of the Young India Skills University. Group founder Gautam Adani had met Reddy to hand over the cheque.Reddy, accompanied by Karnataka deputy CM D K Shivakumar, Himachal Pradesh CM Sukhvinder Sukhu and AICC spokesperson Pawan Khera, were in Mumbai as part of Congress campaign for the assembly polls. Countering BJP's criticism on the welfare guarantees unveiled by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi and talking about their implementation in their own states was their objective. BJP's contention that Congress guarantees are unrealistic for Maharashtra to implement in view of the debt burden was countered by the trio who spoke about the schemes in operation in their respective regions.Reddy and Sukhu said BJP should not have a problem if Congress-governed states implement schemes for the welfare of the poor as the NDA govt has written off loans worth Rs 16 lakh crore of a few leading industrial houses. They said BJP has misled people by claiming that Congress had not fulfilled guarantees in Karnataka, Telangana and Himachal.

"One lakh fishing vessels to get transponders for safety support, tech to help constant monitoring in high seas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-lakh-fishing-vessels-to-get-transponders-for-safety-support-tech-to-help-constant-monitoring-in-high-seas/articleshow/115122860.cms,"Representative Image

How is it significant for India?



How will it help the country from a security point of view?



How will it help fishermen who inadvertently cross over to maritime boundaries and get caught?



How will transponders work?



Has the installation process started beyond Odisha?



Will one lakh transponders cover the country’s entire fleet of marine fishing vessels?



Who will operate and maintain it?



NEW DELHI: We have heard about many incidents of Indian fishermen unintentionally crossing over to the maritime boundaries of other countries, mainly Pakistan and Sri Lanka, to look for their catch in the high seas, only to get caught by security agencies. It invariably takes a lot of diplomatic effort to get them released.Besides, there have been instances when fishermen faced the threat of natural calamities, such as during Cyclonic Storm Ockhi along the Tamil Nadu coast, resulting in the disappearance of around 100 fishermen in 2017. Practically, every ‘depression’ or ‘deep depression’ either in the Bay of Bengal or in the Arabian Sea puts thousands of fishermen in danger.The govt has now found an answer to deal with such issues by installing 100,000 indigenously developed transponders, using ISRO's Vessel Communication and Support System (VCSS), on marine fishing vessels, including both mechanised and motorised, across 13 coastal states/UTs with an allocation of Rs 364 crores by December next year.The installation process already started in a few coastal states after it was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Palghar, Maharashtra, in August. In Odisha, which installed the transponders in more than 1,000 fishing vessels, it saved the lives of many fishermen who were out in the high seas during Cyclone Dana last month.Currently, EU nations, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, South Africa, and Chile are using transponders on fishing vessels to enhance safety, improve monitoring, and combat illegal fishing.The transponders, wireless tracking devices that use radio frequencies to operate, will be used for monitoring, control, and surveillance of marine fishing vessels. These are not only essential for the safety and security of fishermen at sea but also for helping the vessels avoid sea creatures, such as Olive Ridley sea turtles (an endangered species) and other marine species, that suffer injuries coming in contact with boats and fishing trawlers.It’s a two-way communication system enabling the fishermen to send short messages using their android mobile phones while fishing up to 200 nautical miles from the coast during any emergency to seek rescue operations. It will provide weather alerts to the fishermen, including cyclone warnings during any natural disaster. In case the fishermen cross maritime boundaries, alerts will be given to them to avoid unintentional transgression. Information related to the Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) will also be made available to the fishermen on their mobiles with the VCSS.The routes of fishing vessels can be tracked. In case of any suspicious activities, the security agencies will be able to inspect the vessels and also can comply with Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indian seas.The VCSS will help the fishermen through ISRO’s navigation satellite system, called NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation), that can provide accurate real-time positioning information, helping fishermen stay informed about their location relative to national boundaries. Alerts can be set up to notify them if they are approaching or crossing into restricted areas.Integrated navigation systems can include updated maps of territorial waters and fishing zones, enabling fishermen to understand the limits of legal fishing areas clearly. For example, if a vessel is approaching a boundary, communication systems can send alerts to the crew, giving them a chance to change course before entering foreign waters. Communication systems can facilitate direct communication between fishermen and local authorities. If a fisherman accidentally crosses a boundary, they can quickly report their position and intention, which may help in negotiating their safe return.The system has been designed to provide access to all features in the regional languages to the fishermen on the National Fisheries Application. It’ll also be featured with efficient harbour management tools like a token system for entry and exit of fishing vessels for voyage, details of fishing crew on board fishing vessels going for voyage, establishing traceability of fish catch which is essential for compliance with international guidelines of IUU fishing, etc.Besides Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Diu, Goa, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh have also started it. More than 3,500 transponders have already been installed. The transponders will be provided to the fishermen free of cost with a 60:40 funding pattern between the Centre and States, and 100% central share for UTs.There are 66,106 mechanised fishing boats and 135,763 motorised fishing boats currently operating throughout the coastal States/UTs. All the mechanised fishing vessels and a part of motorised fishing vessels will be covered under the present phase by December 2025.The transponder will be mounted on the fishing boat. Fishermen/boat operators will operate the applications of the transponders using their android mobile phones. The maintenance will be done by New Space India Limited (NSIL), a central PSU and the commercial arm of ISRO, for two years. Thereafter, the respective coastal States/UTs will maintain the transponders.","100,000 indigenously developed transponders, using ISRO's Vessel Communication and Support System (VCSS), will be installed across 13 coastal states/UTs. The installation process already started in a few coastal states after it was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Palghar, Maharashtra.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115122885,imgsize-55634,width-400,resizemode-4/115122885.jpg"
Pakistan Urges Sikh Pilgrims to Carry US Dollars Amid Currency Exchange Woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/pakistan-urges-sikh-pilgrims-to-carry-us-dollars-amid-currency-exchange-woes/articleshow/115098746.cms,"AMRITSAR: Grappling with a foreign exchange shortage, the Pakistan government has reiterated its advice through the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) for Indian pilgrims traveling to Pakistan to celebrate Parkash Purb (the birth anniversary of Sikhism’s founder Guru Nanak Dev) to carry US dollars instead of Indian currency during their pilgrimage, which begins on November 14.The advice was issued by PSGPC president Ramesh Singh Arora following the confirmation of the departure of the Indian jatha by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee.But many Indian devotees may not be able to arrange the foreign exchange for their pilgrimage, because the Pakistan high commission typically issues visas to devotees only on the eve of the Indian jatha’s departure, and often denies visa to several applicants.Without confirmation of the cross-border pilgrimage, devotees may find it difficult to arrange foreign exchange in advance. Unless the government facilitates currency exchange at the Attari border, where pilgrims could exchange their currency before crossing, many devotees may face challenges in obtaining the required foreign currency for their journey.Jagjit Singh Bhullar of Bhai Mardana Yadgiri Kirtan Darbar Society, which has applied for visas for over 800 devotees to visit Pakistan, expressed concerns about the difficulties pilgrims may face in arranging foreign exchange.He said: “I wonder how pilgrims could arrange foreign exchange when they are not even certain of receiving their visas. If visas are issued only a day before departure, many may struggle to obtain foreign currency in such a short time. The government should consider setting up currency exchange desks at Attari to assist pilgrims in this regard.”On the other hand, PSGPC president Ramesh Singh Arora said the committee had advised Indian devotees to carry internationally accepted currency, following numerous complaints regarding unfavourable exchange rates for the Indian currency in Pakistan during previous visits by the Indian jatha. Sources said that private money exchangers in Pakistan often arbitrarily set exchange rates, leading to significant losses for Indian devotees.On an average, an Indian devotee should receive PKR 3,300 for every Rs 1,000, but they are often exploited by money changers who offer rates ranging from PKR 2,600 to PKR 2,800. In the present case, when the Pakistani government itself is asking to bring foreign exchange, the money changers could further dip the exchange rate to around PKR 2,500, causing significant financial losses for Indian pilgrims.“The best solution would be to set up currency exchange desks at Attari to protect pilgrims from any kind of harassment or exploitation,” said Jagjit.",Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) reiterates its advice for Indian pilgrims traveling to Pakistan to celebrate Parkash Purb (the birth anniversary of Sikhism’s founder Guru Nanak Dev) The advice was issued by PSGPC president Ramesh Singh Arora following the confirmation of the departure of the Indian jatha.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115103722,imgsize-308277,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/115103722.jpg"

Trivedi urged Pakistan to ""desist from such rhetoric"" that, he stressed, would ""not alter the facts.""""The people of Jammu and Kashmir have recently exercised their democratic and electoral rights and elected a new government. Pakistan must desist from such rhetoric and falsehood because it will not alter the facts,"" Trivedi said.India’s retort followed remarks by the Pakistani representative, who referenced the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), originally set up to monitor ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC). India contends that UNMOGIP is now obsolete, as the Simla Agreement and establishment of the LoC have made its mandate irrelevant.Following his address, Trivedi took to social media to reiterate his message, accusing Pakistan of attempting to shift the focus away from substantive discussions on peacekeeping to promote an ""unnecessary mention"" of Kashmir. He credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ""firm foreign policies"" for bolstering India’s position on the global stage.As part of a 12-member Indian parliamentary delegation at the UN, Trivedi also delivered a broader address on the challenges facing UN peacekeeping . He highlighted India’s contributions as the largest cumulative troop contributor, noting that today's conflicts are increasingly complex and require ""realistic mandates"" tailored to the specific sociopolitical circumstances of each conflict.Reflecting on the dangers peacekeepers face, Trivedi noted an increase in asymmetric threats, including land mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), underscoring India’s advocacy for the safety and security of peacekeepers. He stressed the importance of accountability, asserting that ""perpetrators of crimes against peacekeepers must be brought to justice.""Addressing resource constraints, Trivedi argued that redundant peacekeeping missions often persist due to political agendas, and urged the UN to build exit strategies into peacekeeping missions from their inception. India, he affirmed, remains committed to international peacekeeping, viewing it as a mission dedicated to the cause of humanity.Describing peacekeeping as ""a mission with utmost dedication,"" he called for appropriate action to commemorate those who have sacrificed their lives in service to global peace.","India condemned Pakistan for its repeated attempts to ""derail"" United Nations discussions by invoking Jammu and Kashmir during a debate on peacekeeping operations.

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud , who will retire on November 10, marked his final working day at the Supreme Court on Friday, ending a tenure that began with his elevation to the top court in 2016 and his appointment as CJI in November 2022.A ceremonial bench of four justices assembled on Friday, for the farewell ceremony of Justice Chandrachud, including CJI-designate Sanjiv Khanna, Justices J B Pardiwala, and Manoj Misra. ""You asked me what keeps me going. It is this court which has kept me going because there is not a single day when you feel that you have not learned something, that you have not had an opportunity to serve the society,"" the CJI remarked.His time as a Supreme Court judge saw several landmark judgments, with the outgoing CJI authoring 613 judgments, 500 of which were written as a puisne judge.Also read: CJI DY Chandrachud's emotional farewell speech: 'No greater feeling than being able to serve those in need' Here are the top 10 judgements that the 50th head of the Indian judiciary has been part of during his tenure as Supreme Court judge:In, a nine-judge bench declared privacy a fundamental right. Justice Chandrachud, authoring the majority opinion, held that privacy was essential to personal liberty under Article 21 and other freedoms in Part III of the Constitution.The apex court's nine-judge bench overruled previous judgments on the issue- an eight-judge bench judgment in the MP Sharma case and a six-judge bench judgment in Kharak Singh case, both of which had ruled that privacy is not a fundamental right. The bench comprised Justices Khehar, J Chelameswar, S A Bobde, R K Agrawal, R F Nariman, A M Sapre, D Y Chandrachud , Sanjay K Kaul and S Abdul Nazeer.This ruling provided the basis for later decisions that decriminalized adultery and homosexuality.In, a five-judge bench unanimously struck down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), decriminalizing same-sex relations between consenting adults.Justice Chandrachud’s opinion, drawing from the Puttaswamy judgment, emphasized that denying the right to sexual orientation was a violation of privacy. ""Human sexuality cannot be reduced to a binary formulation and decriminalising Section 377 is but a first step,"" CJI observed.Thecase saw a five-judge bench, led by then Chief Justice Dipak Misra, unanimously decriminalize adultery under Section 497 of the IPC. The Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the 158-year-old Section that punished a married man for the offence of adultery if he had sexual relations with a married woman ""without the consent or connivance of her husband"", but said adultery could continue to be a ground for divorce.Justice Chandrachud, in a concurring opinion, criticized the provision as patriarchal, saying it viewed women as subordinate in marriage. ""This court has recognised sexual privacy as a natural right, protected under the Constitution. To shackle the sexual freedom of a woman and allow the criminalisation of consensual relationships is denial of this right. Section 497 denudes a married woman of her agency and identity, employing force of law to preserve a patriarchal conception of marriage which is at odds with constitutional morality,"" Justice Chandrachud said. He added that marriage could not force an individual to cede her sexual autonomy to others.In, a five-judge bench ruled that banning women of menstruating age from Sabarimala temple violated their rights to equality and liberty.Justice Chandrachud’s concurring opinion said that the ban was not an essential religious practice. He advocated for examining religious practices in light of fundamental rights. ""Any custom or religious practice that violates the dignity of women by denying them entry because of her physiology is unconstitutional,"" Justice Chandrachud had observed.In, a five-judge bench, led by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi, awarded the disputed Ayodhya site to the deity Shri Ram Virajman , with an alternate site in Ayodhya provided to the Sunni Waqf Board for a mosque.The bench noted the Babri masjid’s demolition as a violation of law but found evidence for Hindu claims to the site to be stronger. The Court observed, ""The evidence in respect of the possessory claim of the Hindus to the composite whole of the disputed property stands on a better footing than the evidence adduced by the Muslims.""In, a five-judge bench held that the chief minister of Delhi, not the Lieutenant Governor (LG), was the executive head. Justice Chandrachud ruled that the LG was bound by the council of ministers’ advice on areas where the Delhi Government could make laws.In 2023, a separate bench led by CJI Chandrachud held that the Delhi legislative assembly had control over civil services except for public order, police, and land.In, a five-judge bench, led by CJI D Y Chandrachud, rejected the plea to legalise same-sex marriages and extend the right of adoption to queer couples, in a setback to the push for equal treatment of those with alternative sexual orientation.SC ruled that there is no fundamental right to marriage for sexual minorities but allowed transgender persons in heterosexual relationships to marry. The bench also held that the Special Marriage Act (SMA), 1954 is not discriminatory for excluding non-heterosexual couples.Inthe Supreme Court upheld the Union government’s abrogation of some clauses of Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. CJI Chandrachud’s majority opinion held that Article 370 was a temporary provision, designed for immediate needs, and did not grant separate sovereignty to J&K.In, a five-judge bench unanimously struck down the 2018 Electoral Bond Scheme, saying it violated voters’ right to information under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.In three subsequent hearings, after the decision was pronounced, the Court ordered the immediate end to all sales of Electoral Bonds and ordered the State Bank of India (SBI) to publish all data on Electoral Bond transactions.Ina seven-judge bench led by CJI Chandrachud held that state governments could create sub-classifications within Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe categories based on varying levels of discrimination.The Court ruled that laws creating sub-classifications must be supported by empirical evidence and could be challenged in court.","Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud marked his final working day at the Supreme Court on Friday. He will retire on November 10, ending a tenure that began with his elevation to the top court in 2016. His time as a Supreme Court judge saw several landmark judgments, with the outgoing CJI authoring 613 judgments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115112522,imgsize-694534,width-400,resizemode-4/115112522.jpg"

However, they didn't expect a battery-run camera to expose what they thought was a perfect plan.

Their investigation found that the unit had 71 pumps on its premises before it closed on Oct 30, a day before Diwali.When the factory reopened on Nov 5, 21 were missing. When the agency heads tried accessing CCTV footage, they found that on Nov 1, all cameras had been switched off around 3.40am and were switched back on around 5.30am, the police complaint states.There was no headway until it was found that a battery-operated CCTV camera had captured one of the security guards, named Mahendra Dabhi, stealing a box containing a submersible pump. Vachhrajani and Khan's questioning of Dabhi and other guards revealed that all 11 had banded together to plan the theft and positioned themselves at their respective spots in the factory after executing their plan.Sanand GIDC police have launched an investigation.","Eleven security guards hired by industrial unit in Sanand GIDC to protect the premises, themselves turned thieves and stole submersible pumps worth Rs 4 lakh.

Transition team

In the wake of Donald Trump's recent election victory, speculation is rife regarding who will be picked for the top posts in his upcoming Cabinet, including the potential roles Indian-Americans might play.Besides top Trump aides, several prominent figures of Indian descent are being discussed as likely candidates for key positions, reflecting both their political alignment with Trump and their influence within the Republican Party.The inclusion of Indian Americans in high-level positions not only reflects their growing influence within US politics but also symbolises progress toward greater representation in government.Trump's acknowledgment of the achievements of Indian-Americans during his first term suggests he may seek to build on this foundation by appointing more individuals from this community.Trump's transition team includes notable figures such as Howard Lutnick, Linda McMahon, and his sons Eric and Donald Jr., who are expected to assist in shaping the new administration's direction and personnel decisions.As Trump prepares for his inauguration on January 20, 2025, discussions about these potential appointments will continue to evolve as he solidifies his team.Donald Trump won the US presidential election on November 5, marking a historic return to office after losing the last Presidential elections to Biden. His decisive victory included over 300 electoral votes, a sweep across all seven battleground states, and a win in the popular vote.","Elon Musk: Although not expected to hold a formal position, Musk has expressed interest in contributing to government efficiency initiatives.

During his campaign, Donald Trump has made several high-profile promises, some of which have sparked debate over their feasibility and potential impact. Many of Trump’s campaign promises involve significant legal , legislative, and logistical obstacles, meaning that even with substantial executive power, achieving these objectives would require cooperation from Congress, states, and possibly even constitutional amendments.The feasibility of these proposals largely hinges on navigating political opposition, potential legal battles, and the practical realities of implementation, making some of these promises more symbolic than achievable. Here’s a rundown of some of the bold promises he’s made on the trail, alongside an analysis of their practicality:Trump has pledged to overhaul the federal bureaucracy, replacing thousands of federal workers with those he considers ""loyalists.""Although a president can influence federal hiring and policies, sweeping federal layoffs face strong resistance due to existing civil service protections, union agreements, and procedural hurdles. Such moves would likely face significant legal challenges from federal employee unions and watchdog groups questioning the legality of mass firings based on political affiliation.Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on all imports to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign goods.Imposing such a broad tariff would require congressional support, which is far from guaranteed. Economists warn that a blanket tariff could raise costs for American consumers, strain trade relations, and potentially prompt retaliatory tariffs. Higher import costs could impact inflation, a point that might attract criticism from economic policymakers.Trump has vowed to launch the most extensive deportation effort ever, targeting millions of undocumented immigrants.While the federal government has the authority to enforce immigration laws, scaling up to this level would require massive resources, funding, and cooperation from local law enforcement. Such an operation would likely face legal pushback and public resistance, particularly in sanctuary cities. The logistical complexity and potential societal disruption make this a challenging promise to fulfil.Trump has proposed constructing ""freedom cities"" on federal land to address housing shortages and encourage innovation.Creating new cities would be a monumental task involving land use policy, infrastructure development, environmental reviews, and state cooperation. While it’s possible for the federal government to support housing initiatives, building entirely new cities from scratch would require substantial funding, legislative approval, and time—likely extending beyond a single presidential term.Trump has expressed support for imposing the death penalty on drug dealers to deter drug-related crimes.Implementing this would be a significant legal and constitutional hurdle, as it would require changes to federal law and might face challenges regarding Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment. Applying the death penalty broadly would likely encounter strong judicial opposition.Trump has suggested reconsidering US involvement in NATO and scaling back certain international commitments.While a president can influence foreign policy, withdrawing from NATO would face resistance from Congress and military leaders, as it is a treaty-bound alliance integral to US defence strategy. Exiting NATO would likely be unpopular with allies and could be seen as a threat to US influence on the global stage.Trump has proposed imposing term limits for members of Congress.Changing term limits would require a constitutional amendment, as term limits are not currently part of US law for federal offices. This amendment would need a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, as well as ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures—a high bar that makes this unlikely to be achieved swiftly, if at all.Trump has hinted at increasing US control over industries deemed strategic, such as energy.Nationalising industries is rare in the US and would meet strong legal, economic, and political opposition. It would require new legislation, significant federal resources, and could clash with private sector interests, raising questions of economic efficiency and constitutional authority.Trump has pledged to restart and expand the border wall construction with added technological enhancements.While Trump may have executive power to direct border security funds, constructing a larger, more advanced wall would require sustained funding from Congress. Legal disputes over land rights and environmental concerns would also challenge rapid expansion efforts.Trump has promised to restore and prioritise energy independence by maximising US energy production, especially fossil fuels.Increasing fossil fuel production could be pursued through executive orders and regulatory changes, but would face resistance from environmental advocates and potential legal constraints. Shifts to renewable energy and global environmental commitments add further complexity, limiting the extent to which fossil fuels can be prioritised without political and environmental repercussions.Trump has frequently claimed he could end the Russia-Ukraine conflict within 24 hours by negotiating directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.A US president cannot resolve a complex conflict in 24 hours, despite having significant diplomatic influence. ""While a US president has significant diplomatic influence, resolving such a complex conflict in 24 hours is highly improbable,"" according to experts. The conflict involves deep-rooted geopolitical issues, territorial disputes, and significant military and economic stakes. These factors impact both countries involved in the conflict and their allies.","During his campaign, Donald Trump has made several high-profile promises, some of which have sparked debate over their feasibility and potential impact.

MUMBAI: A lakh plus Indian families are again biting their nails at the prospect of work (employment) authorization being revoked for the H-4 dependent spouse. Members of the Indian diaspora point out that obtaining an employment authorization document (EAD) means much more than financial freedom. It enables spouses to obtain a social security number, open a bank account and get a driving license. In short – be integrated into the American community.President Trump during his previous tenure had issued the Executive Order – Buy American, Hire American – a slew of measures had then followed including a proposed rule to revoke employment authorization for H-4 dependent spouses.Just in the nick of time before the rule was finalized, the Biden administration stepped in and the proposed rule was formally withdrawn in January 2021. “Trump’s return to power would likely bring a renewed attack, disproportionately affecting Indian families where highly educated H-4 spouses play critical roles in tech, healthcare, and other sectors. Eliminating H-4 work permits would be a severe economic and personal blow, particularly for families facing a decades-long green card wait,” points out Ashwin Sharma, immigration attorney.The EAD rule was introduced by the Obama administration in 2015 to mitigate the problems faced by certain sections of immigrants (such as the Indian diaspora) who faced backlogs running into several decades to obtain an employment based green card. As per an analysis by Cato Foundation, the employment based green card backlog from India (EB-2 and EB-3 skilled category) has crossed one million in March 2023. If factors such as death and ageing out are considered (which will lead to these individuals dropping from the backlog statistics) the wait for a green card is 54 years, else it is a whopping 134 years.Under a specific rule, spouses of H-1B visa holders who are eligible for green cards can apply for work authorization in the United States. This rule applies if the H-1B visa holder is on track to receive a green card or has been granted a visa extension beyond the standard six-year limit. The spouse, who holds an H-4 visa, can then submit an application for employment authorization.The EAD rule has faced several legal challenges. In 2015, an advocacy group of tech workers (Save Jobs USA), who lost their jobs to H-1B visa holders, litigated on the grounds that the Department of Homeland Security was not eligible to introduce the rule. Further, it contended that the right given to spouses to work, took away American jobs and made the H-1B program more attractive. A district court upheld this rule and in 2023, the US department refused to intervene in this decision – and the EAD rule seemed here to stay.With hiring of US workers to be a priority for the Trump administration, the question is not – will the EAD rule be revoked, rather the question being asked in hushed tones among the Indian diaspora is – when?",A lakh plus Indian families are biting their nails at the prospect of work (employment) authorization being revoked for the H-4 dependent spouse. Members of the Indian diaspora point out that obtaining an employment authorization document (EAD) means much more than financial freedom.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115018275,imgsize-143922,width-400,resizemode-4/115018275.jpg"
Why does the US vote in November but the new president starts in January?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-does-the-us-vote-in-november-but-the-new-president-starts-in-january/articleshow/115019371.cms,"US election in November, president inauguration in January: Understanding the timeline

Election timing: In 1845, Congress established the timing for federal elections, setting the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November as Election Day. This date was chosen to accommodate an agrarian society: early November allowed farmers to complete the harvest and travel to polling places without interrupting agricultural duties. Additionally, Tuesday was preferred to avoid conflicts with religious observances on Sunday and local market days on Wednesday.

Inauguration timing: Originally, the U.S. Constitution set the presidential inauguration for March 4, providing a four-month transition period after the November election. This lengthy gap allowed enough time for vote counting, electoral processes, and the physical travel needed in an era when communication and transportation were slow. In 1933, the 20th Amendment shortened this gap by moving Inauguration Day to January 20, reducing the “lame-duck” period in which an outgoing president remains in office without significant power. This change was intended to streamline the transition and address inefficiencies associated with a prolonged wait between election and inauguration.

Reasons for the November-to-January gap

Transition planning

Electoral college process

Appointment of electors : State governors appoint electors, typically by early December, based on the state’s popular vote.

: State governors appoint electors, typically by early December, based on the state’s popular vote. Electors’ vote : On a set date in mid-December, the Electoral College meets in each state to officially cast votes for president and vice president.

: On a set date in mid-December, the Electoral College meets in each state to officially cast votes for president and vice president. Certification of votes: In early January, Congress convenes to count and certify the electoral votes, officially confirming the election results before the inauguration. This process provides a formal mechanism to verify the vote, giving an additional layer of credibility to the outcome.

Legal and procedural safeguards

U.S. president inauguration day: Key traditions and events

Swearing-in ceremony: The president-elect and vice president-elect take their oaths of office, a tradition that has remained largely unchanged since George Washington’s inauguration. The ceremony is typically held on the West Front steps of the U.S. Capitol at noon, symbolising the start of the new administration’s term.

Inaugural address: Following the swearing-in, the president delivers an inaugural address, outlining the vision, priorities, and aspirations for the upcoming term. Each inaugural address is unique, reflecting the themes and goals of the new administration while honouring the traditions of the office.

Departure of the outgoing president: After the swearing-in, the outgoing president and first lady leave the Capitol, often through a formal send-off, signifying the peaceful transfer of power. This departure reinforces the country’s commitment to a democratic process and respect for the electoral outcome.

Inaugural luncheon: The new president attends a luncheon hosted by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (JCCIC), where members of Congress and other dignitaries gather to honour the new administration.

Pass in review: The president reviews military troops, honouring the role of the armed forces and symbolising the president’s new role as commander-in-chief. A ceremonial procession down Pennsylvania Avenue follows, leading to the White House.

Presidential escort and inaugural parade: After the Pass in Review, the president is escorted to the White House in a procession that includes representatives from various branches of the military, celebrating the diversity and unity of the nation.

Inaugural balls and celebrations: In the evening, inaugural balls and other festivities are held to honour the new administration, allowing public participation in the celebrations. These events may be adjusted depending on circumstances, such as security concerns or public health issues.

In the United States, the presidential election and inauguration are separated by several months, a timeline that reflects both historical tradition and logistical needs. While the election occurs on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, the newly elected president is inaugurated only on January 20 of the following year. This transitional period serves multiple functions, from providing the incoming administration with time to prepare for governance to allowing the Electoral College to complete its process. The November-to-January gap is rooted in the structure of the U.S. electoral system, combining constitutional requirements, historical precedents, and practical considerations to ensure a smooth transfer of power. Here’s a detailed look at why this timeline exists and what events fill the gap between Election Day and Inauguration Day.The U.S. electoral timeline sets the country apart from other democracies, where elections and the transfer of power often occur within a shorter timeframe. The U.S. approach stems from a combination of historical scheduling and constitutional amendments that have shaped the election-inauguration gap over centuries.The period between Election Day and Inauguration Day serves several purposes essential to a stable and orderly transition of power.: The transition period is crucial for the president-elect, who must assemble a team, nominate cabinet members, and begin formulating key policies. This period allows the incoming administration to prepare for governance, helping to ensure that they are ready to address national and international responsibilities immediately after taking office. It includes detailed briefings, security updates, and policy reviews.An orderly transition is particularly important in times of crisis, allowing the new administration to continue policies or make necessary adjustments without disruptions. The transition also allows time for outgoing staff to assist the incoming team, ensuring continuity in government operations.: Unlike many countries, the U.S. does not select its president based solely on the popular vote. The Electoral College, an intermediary body, formally elects the president and vice president. The Electoral College process includes key dates and steps:: The period between the election and the inauguration also provides time for legal and procedural safeguards, including recounts and the resolution of potential disputes. In close or contested elections, this timeline allows for legal challenges to be addressed in court, ensuring that the final result is legitimate and free from unresolved disputes before the inauguration.This period offers a buffer against any attempts to disrupt or contest the election outcome, reinforcing the stability of the democratic process and giving citizens confidence that the result reflects their choice.Inauguration Day is a ceremonial event that formally marks the transfer of power to the new administration. Traditionally observed on January 20, it includes several symbolic events that reinforce the nation’s commitment to a peaceful and orderly transition.","In 1845, Congress established the timing for federal elections, setting the first Tuesday after November as Election Day.

Trump Towers In India: Trump luxury real estate arm to have maximum properties in India outside of the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trump-luxury-real-estate-arm-to-have-maximum-properties-in-india-outside-of-the-us/articleshow/115025972.cms,"File photo: Donald Trump sr (left) & jr with Kalpesh Mehta (centre)

NEW DELHI: India will have the maximum number of Trump Towers outside of US-president elect’s “The Trump Organisation” home country. From four all-residential high-rise luxury residential Trump Towers in Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon and Kolkata, the number will swell to 10 in the next six years with as many more projects — including office, golf course and villas — to be built in Noida, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Gurgaon and Pune.Trump’s luxury real estate partner in India, Tribeca Developers founder Kalpesh Mehta, now sees even more growth after the news of his victory in the US polls came in on Wednesday.“I did my MBA from Wharton, where the Trump family, including President Trump, went to. A professor there connected me to Donald Trump jr. We met at a bar in New York 13-14 years ago and on the back of a cocktail pier napkin discussed and made our initial plans which eventually became a reality. President Trump’s advice when we subsequently tied up and since then has been just this: ‘We don’t want to do too many projects, but whatever we do should be the best in class’,” Mehta (46), who comes from a family of architects, told TOI Wednesday.In 2014 when the two companies were launching Trump Tower Mumbai, Donald Trump had come to India. “This was shortly after PM Modi had won the 2014 general election. He generally discussed India during his first time trip to the country and the topic here was mainly Modi at that time. Since then he has been very fond of our PM. The President has always believed firmly in the potential of India but he became more bullish after Modi became the PM. India will have the maximum Trump properties outside of the US,” Mehta said.The Trump real estate business is run along the lines of management contract hotels where the Indian partner invests in the hardware (brick and mortar) and the foreign partner, Trump Organisation in this case, brings its branding and software in terms of service level and global reach. The Trump real estate business is doing very well here.“The four Trump Towers (one each in Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon and Kolkata) have a combined area of 30 lakh square feet with about 800 residences in the range of Rs 6-25 crore each and a total sale value of Rs 7,500 crore. The six more coming up in as many years will have a combined floor area of 80 lakh square feet and total sale value of Rs 15,000 crore,” Mehta said. Pune, which already has a Trump Tower, is getting another Trump complex with an office block.Trump golf course and villas will come up in another city.“A Trump presidency is fundamentally good for the world and for further strengthening the India – US relationship. PM Modi and President Trump greatly admire and respect each other and this relationship has the potential to be greatly beneficial to the world at large…. Trump is the only super luxury real estate brand in the world,” he added.","From four all-residential high-rise luxury residential Trump Towers in Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon and Kolkata, the number will swell to 10 in the next six years.

"The writing on the wall is clear: Tighter H-1B norms on anvil, perhaps with wage-hikes and stiffer vetting of applications",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections-the-writing-on-the-wall-is-clear-tighter-h-1b-norms-on-anvil-perhaps-with-wage-hikes-and-stiffer-vetting-of-applications/articleshow/115025897.cms,"Image credit: lexica.art

Challenges Ahead for H-1B Visa Extensions :

Hike in wages and restrictions in eligibility norms:

MUMBAI: American companies, including tech giants have been meeting with their attorneys over the past several days, debating what lies ahead. With President Trump’s victory, the immediate impact is expected to include greater scrutiny for new H-1B visa applications (the window for which will open in March) and also visa extensions.Scrutiny is expected to cover whether the job qualifies as a specialty occupation and ensuring an employer-employee relationship exists. A rise in Requests for Evidence (RFEs) and also denials is expected, which will have to be taken in stride. Policy changes relating to the H-1B program, that were previously stalled due to court rulings may be reintroduced.Indians are major beneficiaries of the H-1B program, receiving over 70% of all H-1B visas granted each year, both for initial applications and extensions. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023, Indians received 2.8 lakh H-1B visas, accounting for 72.3% of total allotments. Thus, procedural and policy changes will impact not only American employers but also the Indian diaspora.Immigration attorney Kripa Upadhyay told TOI, “During the last Trump administration, there was significant disruption due to the introduction of ‘extreme vetting’ for visa interviews. Certain job categories, such as ‘Computer Occupations, All Other,’ may no longer be an option, as they may require applicants to demonstrate specific technical skills and knowledge.”Those seeking H-1B visa extensions could be particularly affected. H-1B visas are typically issued for a maximum of three years, with the possibility of another three years. If the beneficiary (the individual sponsored by an American employer) is on track for a green card, further periodical extensions are permitted. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023, around 210,000 Indians received H-1B visa extensions, compared to 68,825 visas for new employment cases.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, explained, “We expect Trump will rescind the ‘deference policy’ again. During his first term, Trump directed USCIS not to defer to any previous approvals for extension cases and each extension application was treated as a new one leading to challenges. President Biden reinstated the deference policy, but it hasn’t been codified in regulations. If Trump rescinds this policy it will again lead to chaos and unpredictable outcomes.”Immigration attorney Cyrus D. Mehta added, “Similarly, the Trump administration could make it more difficult for employers to renew H-1B visas by requiring artificially high wages and making it harder to prove that the job qualifies as a specialty occupation for H-1B classification.”Policies pushing for steep wage increases for H-1B workers and linking visa allotments to the highest salaries within their occupations and locations may return. In early December 2020, a US district court struck down a rule issued by the Department of Labor (DOL), which had increased H-1B and employment-based green card wages by 40% to 100%. The court invalidated this rule, citing its rushed implementation without public notice and comment, violating the Administrative Procedure Act.""If a wage hike is announced for H-1B workers and allotment is linked to the highest wages, it would badly impact international students. F-1 students typically transition to an H-1B and earn the lowest range of salary in the initial years of their career,"" points out Adam Cohen, partner at immigration law firm Siskind Susser. The contingent of Indian students in the US is quite significant. According to the Open Doors Report, during academic year 2022-23 there were nearly 2.70 lakh Indian students in the US.The same court judgement also struck down a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rule that had imposed stricter definitions for the employer-employee relationship and specialty occupations, targeting tech companies, including Indian firms like Infosys and Wipro, which typically place H-1B workers at client sites. It also limited the H-1B visa duration to one year for workers in third-party placements.Steven A. Brown, partner at immigration law firm Reddy, Neumann, Brown, told TOI, “Many of Trump’s previous court losses were due to procedural issues, not substance. The incoming team may now proceed in a ‘smarter’ way to prevent courts from overturning their policy changes.”Ashwin Sharma, immigration attorney, noted, “In Trump’s first term, stricter H-1B eligibility criteria and increased paperwork, particularly for third-party placements, led to denials and RFEs that complicated approvals. A second term would likely bring swift reinstatement of these policies, creating new obstacles for Indian professionals in specialized fields, especially IT consulting.”US visa challenges may result in housing foreign employees to neighbouring countries or even having a major share of the work done remotely in India, state immigration experts.Charles H. Kuck, another immigration attorney, summed up, “Prepare for major H-1B changes: a lottery based on wages, higher filing fees, and stricter enforcement against job shops. Expect higher denial rates, longer processing times, no immigration reform, no increase in green card allotments, no changes to the 7% per-country limit, and possibly reduced legal immigration.”","With President Trump’s victory, the immediate impact is expected to include greater scrutiny for new H-1B visa applications and also visa extensions. A rise in Requests for Evidence (RFEs) and also denials is expected, which will have to be taken in stride. Policy changes relating to the H- 1B program, that were previously stalled due to court rulings may be reintroduced.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115026242,imgsize-1105056,width-400,resizemode-4/115026242.jpg"

Let's take a closer look (Image via WWE)

The U.S. Elections resulted in a huge dip in WWE's viewership

Will WWE’s viewership go back to normal following the U.S. Elections?

The U.S. election atmosphere often impacts WWE viewership , since live events and debates end up drawing attention away from WWE’s programming. Moreover, SmackDown and Raw both air during weekdays, which further brings their numbers down while elections are in full swing.When WWE SmackDown debuted on the FOX network back in 2019, the show opened with a massive viewership of 3.869 million. Unfortunately, the blue brand’s debut on the USA network this year only managed to bring in about 1.723 million viewers. This drop in viewership can be blamed on the heightened political engagement and on the fact that the NFL season kickoff happened around the same time. Let's take a look at a few more numbers.Also Read: 16-time WWE World Champion Shocked with Donald Trump's Victory in US Presidential Elections Before Donald Trump and Kamala Harris were holding multiple rallies a week, WWE's numbers looked pretty solid. For example, SmackDown averaged 2.199 viewers throughout the months of June, July and August in 2024 as per Fightful. But, as soon as election day started to get closer, the numbers began to drop.In September 2024, SmackDown only averaged about 1.64 million viewers, this means that their viewership was down 30% when compared to their numbers from September 2023. Just like SmackDown lost a few viewers as the elections drew closer, so did Raw and NXT. That’s not all, as WWE’s PLEs also took a bit of a dip. But, now that Kamala Harris has conceded, the elections are all but over. Let's take a look at what this means for WWE's viewership.Now that the elections are over, more and more viewers will divert their attention from political coverage and go back to their regular TV programming. This leads us to believe that WWE’s numbers should go back to normal soon, since there won't be any debates or rallies distracting the regular public. However, this will also require a fair amount of build up.For now, WWE must put all their efforts into building hype for their best storylines and upcoming PLEs. Doing so will help them recapture the viewers they lost because of the elections. It’ll be interesting to see what WWE’s viewership will look like for this month now that the voting phase of the elections is over.Also Read: WWE Hall of Famer slams Donald Trump's Presidential Election victory : ""SAD""","The U.S. Elections resulted in a huge dip in WWE's viewership.

🔴 LIVE: India refuse to travel to Pakistan for Champions Trophy, want matches in Dubai | BTB Live

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has decided to cancel a significant event connected to the upcoming Champions Trophy, originally set to take place on November 11 in Lahore, according to a report by Cricbuzz.The cancellation stems from ongoing disagreements over the tournament's schedule, particularly regarding India's participation in the eight-team 50-over tournament, planned for February 19 to March 19, 2025.The ICC had intended to use the November 11 event to kick-off the tournament, marking 100 days until the championship began. However, these plans have been put on hold due to uncertainty surrounding India's willingness to travel to Pakistan. An ICC official has confirmed that the schedule is still under discussion with Pakistan , the host nation, and other participating countries.""The schedule is not confirmed, we are still in discussions with the host and participating nations on the Champions Trophy schedule . Once confirmed we will announce through our normal channels,"" an ICC official was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.Although the ICC hasn't officially explained the cancellation, sources indicate that scheduling conflicts, exacerbated by India's reluctance to play in Pakistan, are the primary reasons. There are also suggestions that the ICC might cite Lahore's severe smog as a contributing factor, with some officials hinting that weather conditions could be used as a reason to postpone the event.The Champions Trophy was initially planned to be held across multiple cities in Pakistan, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Karachi. However, with the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) informing the ICC that it hasn't received government approval to send its team to Pakistan, a hybrid model for the tournament is looking increasingly likely. This arrangement would involve moving some matches, especially those featuring India, to the UAE.Mohsin Naqvi, the PCB chairman, has expressed his frustration over the lack of official communication regarding India's participation.""We have a clear stance that they must give it to us in writing if they [the Indian cricket board] have any issues. Till today, we have not spoken about any hybrid model, but we're ready to speak on this,"" Naqvi told reporters in Lahore recently. He also mentioned that neither the PCB nor the ICC has received any formal communication from the BCCI on this matter.India's original schedule had them facing Bangladesh on February 20, New Zealand on February 23, and Pakistan on March 1, all in Lahore. Adjustments to the tournament venues, if not the dates, seem unavoidable.","The ICC has decided to cancel a significant event connected to the upcoming Champions Trophy, originally set to take place on November 11 in Lahore.

Trudeau's current minority government position increases his vulnerability to losing power.Previously, Musk had expressed criticism of the Canadian government's approach to free speech, particularly regarding new regulations requiring online streaming services to register for government oversight.Donald Trump's potential return presents additional challenges for Trudeau's administration.
