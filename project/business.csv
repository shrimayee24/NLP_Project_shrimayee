"Infections from medicine tubes in Indian hospitals high, shows study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/infections-from-medicine-tubes-in-indian-hospitals-high-shows-study/articleshow/123609718.cms,"MUMBAI: A seven-year study at 54 private and public hospitals and 200 ICUs in India has found over 8,600 cases of severe bloodstream infections linked to mismanagement of tubes inserted into large veins to deliver medicines and fluids. These are called central lines, with newborns most at risk.About 40% of patients with central line infections died within two weeks. The rate: 8.83 central line infections per 1,000 central line-days, meaning nine infections for every 1,000 days that central lines were used. The study, just out in Lancet, recorded 9,77,052 central line-days. The figures are much higher than reported in the US, where the rate even in 2020 (Covid year) was 0.87 per 1,000.Doctors said newborns are vulnerable to most infections, and when they need central lines in ICUs, the risk increases. The study, titled 'Profile of CLABSI (Central-Line Associated Bloodstream Infection) Infections in Adults', said 87% of Acinetobacter and 78% of Klebsiella infections - the two most common culprits in such cases - were resistant to carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort.One more culprit, Candida auris - a fungal infection known for its drug resistance - was also a frequent cause. These reach central lines through contaminated hands, equipment or medicines, and enter the bloodstream.""There is a haphazard use of third-line antibiotics like carbapenems because they are the most effective to a point that now they are being rendered useless. We have allowed this resistance to develop because of a lack of monitoring mechanism and guidelines,"" said Dr Hemalata Arora, infectious disease expert at Mumbai's Nanavati Hospital. Microbiologist Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, from Pune's BJ Medical College, said most anti-fungals fail before Candida auris and it is most difficult to wipe out of hospital settings: ""Resistance rates to bacterial infections are alarming. Carbapenems have proven to be the safest ones. Eventually, doctors may have to switch to alternative antibiotics for certain infections which could be more toxic.""Conducted between 2017 and 2024, the research was led by Healthcare Associated Infection Surveillance Network and coordinated by AIIMS, New Delhi, with funding from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The authors, all microbiologists from across India, wrote that infection rates peaked in 2020-21, coinciding with Covid, when overwhelmed ICUs, staff shortages and strained infection-control practices likely played a role. Rates fell the following year but rebounded, leading them to conclude that the issue is persistent.Dr Arora said transmission of central line infections are bound to occur but the point is to reduce incidence. ""The rate of infection differs from hospital to hospital. In bigger hospitals, it is 1 or 2 per 1,000 central line days. Smaller hospitals could have 15 to 20, even 30 to 40 per 1,000,"" she said.A paediatrician and infectious disease specialist from Mumbai said, ""In most govt and semi-govt setups, doctors as well as allied staff are overworked due to staff shortage. Very sick patients often require prolonged use of central lines, and for paediatric patients, repeated needle pricks are difficult, so central lines are kept for longer durations. But these central lines are often not managed properly because of inadequate training and understaffing.

""Today there was a jolt to that system when India recorded a 7.8% growth in GDP in the first quarter when people felt that we would be down.If we grow like this, the skeptics will shut their mouths"".GDP growth in the first quarter of the ongoing fiscal was mainly due to good performance by the farm sector.""Those who call it a 'dead economy' should now understand that India is a 'long live economy' which is on the path to realising the dream of a developed and fully self-reliant India,"" Chouhan said in a post on X.

'The more pressure is put on India, the more it'll emerge as strong rock'

NEW DELHI: There are no permanent friends or enemies in international relations, only permanent interests, defence minister Rajnath Singh stressed on Saturday, amid the tariff tension with US and the thaw in India-China relations.India will ""never compromise with its fundamental interests and principles"", and will remain steadfast on its policies and self-reliance drive to preserve its strategic autonomy and emerge stronger ""despite any global pressure"", Singh said, in an apparent reference to US President Donald Trump's imposition of 50% tariffs on New Delhi.The minister's remarks, which did not name the US directly, came even as PM Modi reached China on Saturday to attend the SCO summit.PM Modi reached China on Saturday to attend the SCO summit, where he is scheduled to have bilateral meetings with the Chinese and Russian Presidents, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, respectively. ""India does not consider anyone its enemy. But for us, the interests of our people, our farmers, our small traders are paramount. We cannot compromise on our country's welfare at any cost. No matter how much pressure is exerted, India will continue to give the highest priority to the interests of its farmers, small businessmen, shopkeepers, livestock keepers, and common citizens,"" Rajnath Singh said, speaking at the NDTV Defence Summit.""We all study in geography that the more pressure is applied, the stronger the rock becomes. I feel that the more pressure is put on India, the more it will emerge as a strong rock,"" he added. Amid ongoing geopolitical churn and disruption, Singh said ""a kind of protectionism"" has been seen from the ""so-called developed countries"", with ""trade and tariff wars"" becoming increasingly serious. Referring to Edmund Burke's calling the British East India Company as ""a state in the guise of a merchant"", he said the description can be changed to ""a merchant in the guise of a state"" in the current circumstances.Noting that the world and technology is changing rapidly, with new challenges emerging in the form of pandemics, terrorism and regional conflicts, Singh said self-reliance is not just an option or an advantage but a strategic necessity essential for India's survival and progress. ""Today's shifting geopolitics has also made it clear that external dependency in the field of defence is no longer an option for us. In the current situation, self-reliance is essential for both our economy and our security,"" he said.""Under PM Modi's leadership, our govt has always believed that it is only through ' Atmanirbhar Bharat ' that we can strengthen our strategic autonomy. This very approach will keep us secure in the times to come and also secure us a leading position among the world's emerging powers,"" he added. Hailing Operation Sindoor as a shining example of India's growing indigenous defence capabilities, he said, ""It may appear to be a story of a war of a few days, of India's victory and Pakistan's defeat, but years of strategic preparation and defence preparedness were behind it.

MV tax only for use in public area: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mv-tax-only-for-use-in-public-area-sc/articleshow/123608381.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has held that the motor vehicles tax, which is imposed for use of public places and infrastructure, cannot be levied if a vehicle does not use the same.""Motor vehicle tax is compensatory in nature. It has a direct nexus with the end use. The rationale for levy of motor vehicle tax is that a person who is using public infrastructure, such as roads, highways etc. has to pay for such usage. Legislature has consciously used the expression 'public place' in Section 3. If a motor vehicle is not used in a 'public place' or not kept for use in a 'public place' then the person concerned is not deriving benefit from the public infrastructure; therefore, he should not be burdened with the motor vehicle tax for such period,"" a bench of Justices Manoj Misra and Ujjal Bhuyan said. The bench passed the order while interpreting the Andhra Pradesh Motor Vehicle Taxation Act, whose section 3 says govt may from time to time direct that a tax shall be levied on every motor vehicle used or kept for use in a public place in the State.It thereby allowed the plea of a company which had pleaded that it was not liable to pay tax as its vehicles were used in the central dispatch yard premises belonging to Visakhapatnam Steel Plant of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL) and were not plying on public roads.The state had taken the stand that actual use or non-use of public roads cannot be a ground for escaping tax liability. The bench said the taxable event under Section 3 arises when a vehicle is used or kept for use in a public place in the State.""Therefore, the tax is on the user or intendment for use of motor vehicle in a 'public place'. Thus, if a vehicle is actually used in a 'public place' or kept in such a way that it is intended to be used in a 'public place' then the tax liability accrues.... Requirement of law is that the motor vehicle should be used or kept for use in a 'public place'. When admittedly the motor vehicles of the appellant were confined for use within the RINL premises which is a closed area then the question of vehicles being used or kept for being used in a 'public place' does not arise,"" it said.The court said the motor vehicles in question were used or kept for use only within the restricted premises of RINL, which was not a public place. ""Therefore, the said vehicles are not liable to be taxed for the period the said vehicles were used or kept for use within the restricted premises of RINL. Argument of the respondent that appellant had not intimated non-use of the motor vehicles in terms of Rule 12A does not carry much persuasion in view of what we have discussed supra. Thus, even in the absence of any intimation in terms of Rule 12A, motor vehicles of the appellant cannot be subjected to motor vehicle tax for the period those were used or kept confined within restricted premises of RINL"".",Justices: Motor vehicle tax is compensatory in nature.

Travel slump: June sees a dip in number of Indian visitors in US; first decline since 2001,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/travel-slump-june-sees-a-dip-in-number-of-indian-visitors-in-us-first-decline-since-2001/articleshow/123608362.cms,"Indians With Valid US Visas Can Now Easily Travel To Argentina Without Needing Any Additional Visa

NEW DELHI: The desi peak outbound travel month of June saw a decline in the number of Indian visitors to the US in 2025 over the previous year for the first time this Millennium — barring the Covid period. With 2.1 lakh Indians headed to America in June, the number was 8% lower than 2.3 lakh in same month last year, according to data from US commerce dept’s National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO). The provisional figure for this July shows 5.5% fall over same month last year.Overall, the US has been seeing a decline in international visitors — and not just from India — in recent months. NTTO says total non-US resident international visitor volume to the US decreased 6.2% in June 2025 over June 2024; 7% in May; 8% in March; 1.9% in Feb. This Jan saw 4.7% increase over same period last year and April was up 1.3%.India is the fourth largest source market for international visitors for the US. Since the two biggest source markets — Mexico and Canada — share a land border, India is the second biggest overseas source market with the UK being the biggest. “Combined, these top five source markets (with Brazil being the fifth) accounted for 59.4% of total international arrivals” this June, says NTTO.While travel industry biggies here say it is too early to pin the blame for fall in Indian visitor numbers on the stricter visa regime adopted by President Trump in his second presidency which has seen souring of India-US ties, the impact could be more pronounced going ahead if the same continues. The reason: US mostly issues 10-year validity multiple entry visitor and business visas (B1/B2) so people who already have the same can keep travelling. But if new visas get impacted for reasons like long appointment time or stricter issuance norms, then with a time lag the impact will be visible.“We are seeing a very visible impact on student segment this year due to delay in visa issuance even after people securing college admission. Historically, the biggest categories of visitors headed from India to the US have been visiting friends & relatives (VFR), business and students. The US was never a top leisure destination for Indians. That space has been led by Southeast Asia, Middle East and Europe. North America came after that. Right now apart from students we are not seeing a dramatic impact on the other segments but if new visa issuances are affected, they will also be hit with a certain time lag,” said a leading travel agent.With an Indian diaspora of over 50 lakh, the US sees great demand for travel from the India. NTTO data shows since the start of this Millennium, every June had seen a jump from same month in last year till 2025 broke that trend.April was a great month as far as outbound from India is concerned. According to Indian tourism ministry data, 29 lakh Indians travelled abroad this April with the maximum going to the UAE followed by Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Singapore and the US.“But after May and June, travel was severely impacted following the Pehelgam terror attack, closure of Pakistan airspace (which continues for Indian carriers & vice versa) and then the Air India Ahmedabad crash. So every destination, especially in the west, was impacted badly. The drop to the US may not be in isolation as fast as western destinations go,” said another travel biggie.","June saw a decline in the number of Indian visitors to the US in 2025 over the previous year.

IAF vice chief Air Marshal Narmdeshwar Tiwari, speaking at the same NDTV summit, reiterated that less than 50 air-launched weapons fired by India at airbases and radar sites in Pakistan during Operation Sindoor compelled the western adversary to sue for peace and a ceasefire.""We hit them so hard that by mid-day (on May 10) they wanted to talk. Key takeaway for us, that in less than 50 weapons, we were able to achieve conflict elimination... It is very easy to start a war, but not easy enough to end it,"" Air Marshal Tiwari said, armed with videos and satellite imagery to showcase the damage to terror and military infrastructure caused in Pakistan.IAF had deployed Sukhoi-30MKI, Rafale and Mirage-2000 fighters to launch BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as Crystal Maze-2, Rampage and Scalp missiles for the calibrated pinpoint strikes on the Pakistani airbases and radar sites, a few of them close to nuclear facilities as well as command and control structures, as reported by TOI earlier.Both the officers said the political directives were clear about undertaking punitive strikes with minimum collateral damage, catering for escalation and creating a deterrence in Pakistan army's mind, and complete operational freedom was given to the armed forces for the same.Lt-Gen Sharma further said that the Pahalgam massacre came soon after Munir, in a ""provocative speech"" on April 16, claimed Kashmir was Pakistan's ""jugular vein"" while invoking the two-nation theory.""This was direct incitement to not only the terrorists but also the Pak army...

Russia Claims Its S-400 Missile System Is Shooting Down Missiles Fired From U.S. Patriot Systems

NEW DELHI: The Press Information Bureau (PIB) on Saturday dismissed as propaganda Pakistan’s claims that India’s S-400 air defence system was ""damaged"" during Operation Sindoor , the counterterror military strikes launched by India after the Pakistan-backed terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam.The PIB Fact Check wing clarified on X: ""Some pro-Pakistan social media handles are circulating claims that India admits its S-400 being damaged by Pakistan.""It added, ""Reports of destruction or any damage to an S-400 system are false & baseless.""Clarifying further, it said the image being circulated with these claims was actually from a Victory Parade held in Russia in May 2010.The clarification followed reports after the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, where Lashkar-e-Taiba affiliated terrorists opened fire on civilians, killing 26 people.In retaliation, India carried out Operation Sindoor, striking nine major terror hubs, including Lashkar’s headquarters in Muridke and Jaish-e-Mohammad’s stronghold in Bahawalpur.Pakistan responded with a barrage of drones and missiles, all of which were intercepted and neutralised by India, with the S-400 system playing a central role.India subsequently struck back at Pakistan’s key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan. The exchange of hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours finally ended after Pakistan’s DGMO contacted his Indian counterpart to agree on a ceasefire across land, air, and sea.","The PIB Fact Check wing clarified on X: ""Some pro-Pakistan social media handles are circulating claims that India admits its S-400 being damaged by Pakistan"" The image being circulated with these claims was actually from a Victory Parade held in Russia in May 2010.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123603840,imgsize-1154127,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-30.jpg"

Indian Army, J&K Police Neutralize 2 Terrorists In Bandipora, Ops Ongoing

NEW DELHI: The Army is now raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers, to enhance swift strike capabilities along the borders with Pakistan and China.The plan is to progressively raise 23 ""agile and lethal"" 'Bhairav' battalions from existing troops to bridge the gap between regular infantry soldiers and the elite Para-Special Forces. ""The aim is to have the first five such units in place by Oct 31, though it can take a little more time,"" a source told TOI.Three of the first five 'Bhairav' units are coming up under the Army's crucial Udhampur-based Northern Command, one each for the 14 Corps at Leh, 15 Corps at Srinagar, and 16 Corps at Nagrota. The fourth unit is in the desert terrain of the western sector and the fifth in the hilly terrain of the eastern sector.The 11.5-lakh strong Army is drawing 'Bhairav' commandos from its regular infantry battalions, which number 415 (each has 800 soldiers), under the ""save and raise"" concept without fresh troop accretions. ""Much smaller and nimble than infantry battalions, the 'Bhairav' units will be equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones.They will be geared for speed, flexibility and high-impact tactical operations,"" source said.These units will be in addition to the Army's 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions, each of which have 620 soldiers selected after arduous training, and are equipped with a wide array of specialised weapons and equipment.Though meant for special clandestine missions in high-risk environments, usually behind enemy lines, these crack units are often used for mere tactical operations. ""The 'Bhairav' battalions, each with seven-eight officers, are also meant to relieve Special Forces, who can then concentrate on their more critical tasks,"" another source said.The 'Bhairav' commandos will undergo specialised training for two-three months in their respective regimental centres and then be attached to the Special Forces units in their respective theatres for another month for advanced training.On July 26, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had announced the move to set up new 'Rudra' all-arms brigades, 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries, and the 'Bhairav' battalions. He also said all infantry battalions will now have dedicated drone platoons, as was then reported by TOI.A new tri-service joint doctrine for Special Forces operations was, incidentally, released on Wednesday. Apart from the Army's Special Forces, there are 27 'flights' of around 1,600 'Garud' commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.""Special Forces, owing to their agility, strategic reach and mission-specific capabilities, are uniquely suited to generate disproportionate operational effect through precision engagement, deep insertion and unconventional operations,"" said CDS General Anil Chauhan, in the doctrine's foreword.","The Army is raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers.

Choksi, who was arrested in Belgium in April this year, had applied for bail on medical grounds last month.Indian law enforcement agencies argued that Choksi was a habitual absconder and was likely to flee to another country if granted bail. The court accepted the argument and denied bond.Choksi is wanted in bank fraud cases worth over Rs 13,900 crore. He has been in a Belgian jail for over four months now. Ahead of his extradition hearing scheduled in mid-Sept, the CBI has provided Belgian prosecutors voluminous evidence of his involvement in economic offences in India and details of his escape from US and Antigua in the past, besides the two open warrants against him. The Global Operations Centre of CBI is monitoring the developments in the case in direct coordination with foreign law enforcement agencies and Interpol channels. It has also hired the services of a local law firm to bolster the case.In Jan 2018, Choksi had fled to the US and then to Antigua, whose citizenship he had obtained a year before. The CBI filed an FIR on complaint of bank fraud and started a probe. In 2021, he vanished from Antigua and surfaced in Dominica while trying to escape to Cuba on a boat. In 2022, five more cases were registered against him. He relocated to Belgium, for the second time, thereafter with his wife Preeti Choksi, who is a Belgian citizen, after securing an 'F Residency Card' there. Granted a residency in Belgium in Nov 2023, Choksi was arrested there on April 11 this year.","Mehul Choksi is wanted in bank fraud cases worth over Rs 13,900 crore.

The Big Picture







Donald Trump has never disguised his transactional approach to foreign policy. But in 2025, his behaviour toward India has crossed into something far more disruptive. He has claimed credit for ending a May India-Pakistan conflict (a claim Delhi flatly rejects). He has invited Pakistan’s army chief to lunch at the White House, prompting anger in Delhi that Washington is “treating India and Pakistan as equals.” And he has escalated a tariff war, leaving Indian exporters facing what the US Congressional Research Service (CRS) describes as a “50% tariff on India on top of existing tariffs.”These are not Indian government talking points. They are the findings of CRS—a dry, nonpartisan research arm of the US Congress—in a briefing dated August 25, 2025. When CRS puts it in writing, Capitol Hill pays attention.The Congressional Research Service is Washington’s in-house think tank. Its analysts don’t campaign, give TV interviews, or spin headlines. They produce factual, nonpartisan reports that lawmakers rely on when voting on tariffs, arms sales, or oversight of the White House. A critical CRS report means that Congress is on alert—and the alarms are flashing red on India policy.The CRS reminds lawmakers of the long, bipartisan effort since 2000 to build India into a pillar of US Indo-Pacific strategy:But now, CRS bluntly states that “President Trump since May has taken actions that observers say put the partnership at risk.”At the centre of the rupture is economics. Using emergency powers, Trump imposed:For India, which had already reduced tariffs and withdrawn its digital services tax to smooth talks, this is a gut punch. After two decades of being courted as a trade partner, Washington has just doubled the barriers.CRS also revisits the May 2025 four-day war between India and Pakistan. Its finding is damning: “Indian officials… have expressed frustration that the President has treated India and Pakistan as equals—including by hosting Pakistan’s army chief to lunch at the White House—while Delhi holds Pakistan responsible for the terrorist attack that sparked the conflict.”In other words, while Trump claims to be “tough on terror” domestically, his official record is one of legitimising the very military India blames for cross-border terrorism.The fallout isn’t only diplomatic. It risks spilling into the two areas once touted as the “load-bearing pillars” of the partnership:The stakes extend to people, not just policy. CRS highlights:But friction remains: Washington has labelled India “recalcitrant” on deportations, and Congress is split on H-1B reform.Beyond the headlines, the CRS report offers a layered warning. It documents how India’s rise—now the world’s fourth-largest economy—made it a natural partner for successive US administrations, only for Trump’s second term to throw sand in the gears.On trade, the report is explicit: Trump’s dual tariffs could leave India facing a 50% effective duty, an unprecedented escalation that Indian officials consider discriminatory since Europe was spared similar penalties. The report notes that this has already sparked calls in India to boycott American goods, a populist backlash that Modi has countered by doubling down on his “self-reliant India” agenda.On security, CRS points to Indian anger over Trump’s “equal treatment” of Pakistan and his claim to have ended the May conflict, when in Delhi’s telling, the ceasefire owed nothing to Washington.On technology, the report shows how reduced staffing in Trump’s National Security Council threatens to stall implementation of the TRUST roadmap on AI, semiconductors, and quantum. In defense, it flags both momentum—$24 billion in sales, growing interoperability—and fragility, with the 10-year framework expiring this year and still unresolved. And on immigration, it reminds lawmakers that India is not just a policy partner but a people partner: the single biggest source of H-1Bs, green cards, and foreign students.The concluding section distils the dilemma for Congress into a set of choices: whether to loosen export controls, resource the Quad, and keep betting on India’s democratic resilience—or let Trump’s instincts on tariffs and Pakistan dictate the shape of America’s India policy.CRS closes by laying out the dilemmas now before lawmakers:CRS never editorialises. But its message is unmistakable: after two decades of careful bipartisan investment, Trump’s mix of tariffs, boasts, and Pakistan lunches is shredding the credibility of America’s India policy. For Congress, the choice is whether to salvage the partnership or let Trump’s instincts dictate strategy. For India, the warning is even sharper: if this is what friendship looks like, what would betrayal look like?","The US Congress’ own research arm, CRS, warns that Donald Trump’s second term is destabilising a relationship built over 25 years. Massive tariffs (50% on top of existing ones) and claims of ending the May India-Pakistan conflict have left Delhi frustrated. America's ability to deliver on tech and defense initiatives looks weaker, even as immigration and diaspora ties remain central. For Congress, the dilemma is whether to salvage a bipartisan strategic partnership.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123584462,imgsize-91336,width-400,resizemode-4/trump-wrecking-us-india-relations-says-us-congressional-report.jpg"
Stray dog row in Faridabad society: RWA hires bouncers; feeder woman slapped with Rs 1.3L fine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/40-stray-dogs-left-starving-rwa-deploys-bouncers-fines-woman-rs-1-3l-for-feeding-inside-faridabad-society/articleshow/123575518.cms,"Supreme Court Allows Stray Dogs Back On Streets, But Bans Feeding Them In Public Spaces

Poll Do you believe the current laws regarding stray dogs are effective? Yes, they provide necessary guidelines No, they need to be revised





GURGAON: The residents' welfare association (RWA) of a housing society in Greater Faridabad has fined a dog lover Rs 1.3 lakh over the past three years for feeding strays in unauthorised areas.Divya Nair, a private firm employee known among residents of Princess Park in Sector 86 for her compassion towards stray animals, has been feeding dogs within the society since 2022.According to RWA officials, the fine was levied after Nair repeatedly fed dogs in parks, the basketball court, parking lots, and other public spaces despite the society designating a specific feeding zone in the market area. The RWA alleged her actions had created a mess on the campus and raised safety concerns for other residents.A senior police official clarified that RWAs do not have the authority to levy fines on residents. ""No, they can't. We can initiate action against them only if the woman lodges a complaint,"" the official added.The Princess Park dispute unfolded against the backdrop of recent Supreme Court rulings on the issue of stray dogs. Responding to concerns over rising dog bite incidents and rabies cases in Delhi-NCR, the apex court modified earlier orders that called for strays to be moved to shelter homes.The latest ruling allowed authorities to release strays after sterilisation, but clarified that aggressive or rabid dogs must be kept in shelters. Most importantly, the court banned the feeding of stray dogs in public spaces and instructed authorities to set up dedicated feeding areas.The tussle between the RWA and Nair escalated when she took to social media platform X, alleging that she was assaulted for feeding dogs and her family faced threats from local police. She also claimed that all dog feeding had been banned in the society since the revised Supreme Court order last week, and lady bouncers had been deployed by the RWA to enforce the rule.Nair expressed concern that nearly 40 stray dogs in the area were now starving because of such restrictions.RWA vice-president Ranmeek Chahal insisted that the society's measures were intended at protecting residents - especially children and the elderly - from potential harm.The RWA has now decided to pursue legal action against Nair to recover the outstanding fine.","Divya Nair is known among residents of Princess Park in Sector 86 for her compassion towards stray animals.

'Inspirational'





GENEVA: Residents of the tiny Indonesian island of Pari, threatened with disappearance by rising sea levels driven by climate change, have come to Switzerland to demand compensation from cement giant Holcim.The case is part of a wider international movement seeking to assign responsibility to major companies for the climate damage hurting the livelihoods of millions of people, especially in the Global South.More than two years after four residents of Pari filed suit against the world's largest cement firm, two of them have travelled to Switzerland to take part in a preliminary hearing in the landmark case.The hearing to determine whether or not the court will consider the complaint will take place on Wednesday in Zug, where the firm is headquartered.Holcim insists it is ""deeply committed to taking action on climate"", but maintains that ""the question of who is allowed to emit how much CO2"" should be ""a matter for the legislature and not a question for a civil court"".Environmentalists say cement production is responsible for around eight percent of global CO2 emissions, and allege that Holcim figures among the 100 largest CO2 emitters among all companies worldwide.The company thus bears significant responsibility for climate-related loss and damages, the suit maintains, in a case that could be a milestone for plaintiffs from developing countries who take on industrial giants.""I hope the case will become inspirational... for climate victims"" around the world, plaintiff Asmania told reporters in the Swiss city of Lausanne ahead of the hearing, speaking through a translator.Environmentalists have said most of the 42-hectare (104-acre) island of Pari could be underwater by 2050 due to rising sea levels.The islanders say saltwater floods have in recent years surged in scale and frequency, battering homes and damaging livelihoods.Asmania, a 42-year-old mother-of-three, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, has already lost her seaweed farm due to flooding, which has also ravished her fish farm, sweeping in dirt and oil that kill off the babies.This year, she began with 500 small fry, ""and there are only nine left"", she said, adding that income ""is zero"".- 'Biggest threat' -Another plaintiff, 54-year-old mechanic and beach manager Arif Pujianto, also said climate impacts were taking a dire toll.""The climate crisis is the biggest threat to my life,"" he said through a translator.He described how severe flooding of Star Beach had shrunk the pristine stretch of sand by nine metres since 2021, driving away tourists vital for his income.At the same time, tidal floods now regularly reach his bamboo house, rotting the walls and contaminating his well, forcing him to purchase drinking water for his family at a high price.The small workshop where he repairs motorcycles and diesel engines has also been repeatedly flooded, rusting his equipment, he said.If the Swiss court refuses to take the case, Arif said he feared he would lose his beach, his island and even his life.- A first -Environmental litigation against governments and fossil fuel firms seen as responsible for the greatest CO2 emissions has surged in recent years, but the case marks the first such action against a major cement company.It is also the first filed by Indonesians against a foreign company for climate-related damage, and the first instance of a Swiss company being sued for its alleged role in such damage.The four plaintiffs in the case are seeking 3,600 Swiss francs ($4,500) each from Holcim for damages and protection measures such as planting mangroves and constructing breakwater barriers.Swiss Church Aid (HEKS), an NGO helping the islanders, stressed that the amount was only equivalent to 0.42 percent of the actual costs -- in line with estimates that Holcim is responsible for 0.42 percent of global industrial CO2 emissions since 1750.In addition, the plaintiffs are demanding a 43-percent reduction in Holcim's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a 69-percent reduction by 2040, with HEKS saying this was in line with the Paris Climate Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to the pre-industrial era.nl/dc/sco",Indonesian island of Pari threatened with disappearance by rising sea levels driven by climate change.

China's industrial production showed a slight improvement in August but remained in contraction for the fifth consecutive month, as per official figures released on Sunday, while trade negotiations with the United States persist before a new November tariff implementation.The Purchasing Managers' Index, a crucial industrial output indicator, reached 49.4, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), showing a marginal increase from July's 49.3, as reported by AFP. Bloomberg analysts had predicted the index would reach 49.5.The most recent figure above 50, indicating positive growth, was recorded in March.NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe viewed the month-on-month improvement as indication that ""overall economic prosperity continues to expand"". ""The business climate has improved,"" he said.The NBS had previously attributed July's manufacturing difficulties to adverse weather conditions, including floods and high temperatures.China's economic recovery post-pandemic has been challenging, facing issues including a property sector debt crisis, reduced consumption levels and high unemployment rates among young people.The ongoing trade dispute with the United States, currently paused pending negotiations, has affected China's export-driven economy.Both nations have extended their suspension of most reciprocal tariffs until November 10 as discussions continue.On Friday, senior Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang emphasised the need for ""equal dialogue and consultation"" between both countries after completing a three-day US visit, according to China's commerce ministry statement.","Purchasing Managers' Index reaches 49.4, up from July's 49.3.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has called for the autonomy of sport to be “protected” after India’s National Sports Governance Bill 2025 became an Act earlier this month.Reacting for the first time after the bill — which the govt says is aimed at reforming the country’s sports administration and bringing accountability into the national federations’ (NSFs) functioning — became law following the publication of a gazette notification by the Centre on Aug 18, the IOC reminded the Indian authorities that the legislation should comply with the statutes of the Olympic Charter.In a statement to TOI, the IOC’s spokesperson said the Olympic sports’ global governing body has been engaged in discussions with the relevant authorities in India over the framing of the Act's rules, which the govt aims to finish by the year-end.“The IOC is aware that the national sports governance bill in India has recently become an Act. We have noted the developments and have been discussing this with all concerned parties in India. The IOC is always ready to help and work constructively with the relevant govt authorities and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) with a view to ensuring that the autonomy of sport is protected, and that the framing of rules and regulations are compatible with the applicable rules of the Olympic Charter,” the IOC said.As per the Act, the govt will be establishing a National Sports Board (NSB), National Sports Tribunal (NST) and National Sports Election Panel (NSEP).",The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has called for the autonomy of sport to be ‘protected’ after India’s National Sports Governance Bill 2025 became an Act.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

UP’s Rampur mentha oil industry reels under US tariff: Exporters warn of losses as orders on hold; job cuts loom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ups-mentha-oil-industry-reels-under-50-us-tariff-orders-put-on-hold-in-rampur-job-cuts-loom/articleshow/123610129.cms,"Representative AI image





The mentha oil sector in Rampur is experiencing severe difficulties, with exporters warning of substantial financial losses due to the US's 50 per cent import tariff on Indian goods.The situation is endangering the financial stability of numerous agricultural workers and labourers, according to PTI reports. Mentha oil serves as a crucial aromatic ingredient in various product manufacturing processes.Export professional Amrit Kapoor reported significant order disruptions and cancellations. ""The cost of a product of ours that was priced at USD 20 increased to USD 30 overnight due to the 50 per cent duty. The buyer there doesn't understand how to get a USD 30 product from India. So, orders are on hold. The goods are being manufactured in the factory and we don't know when they will go,"" he said.Kapoor further emphasised the effects on agricultural communities and workers. ""Over 10 lakh of our farmer brothers are connected to this. They will not be able to get enough money, and I think they will not even get the cost of their production back,"" he explained.He also expressed worries about industrial employment security adding, ""If America continues this behaviour and our production decreases, it is possible that in the coming time we may have to reduce the workers at factories.""Shirish Gupta, heading the Rampur division of the Indian Industries Federation, views these tariffs as strategic pressure but maintains confidence in governmental action. ""The government should create schemes for the industries that are in danger due to the tariff issue so that they don't close down and people's livelihoods are not put at risk,"" he said. However, he expressed optimism, stating that ""this is a temporary phase"" and that ""soon a positive result will come out"".The impact extends to Moradabad's export community.Moradabad, recognised as the 'Brass City', generates annual handicraft exports of Rs 8,500-Rs 9,000 crore, with the US receiving 75 per cent and Europe and Gulf nations sharing the remainder. ""The 50 per cent tariff imposed by the Trump administration has brought exports to a standstill. Orders worth more than Rs 300 crore have already been halted and another Rs 150 crore worth of business is shifting to other countries,"" reported Haji Iftekhar, who operates an export business.""This could lead to a 50 per cent fall in US-bound exports, pushing nearly 2 lakh people into unemployment. Several firms have already begun laying off workers,"" he indicated.The US administration's additional 25 per cent tariff on India, linked to Russian crude oil purchases, became active on Wednesday, elevating the total duties on Indian imports to 50 per cent.These enhanced duties took affect Indian products that are ""entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption"", on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on August 27.The initial 25 per cent reciprocal tariffs on India took effect on August 7, coinciding with similar charges on approximately 70 other nations.",Mentha oil sector in Rampur is experiencing severe difficulties due to the US's 50 per cent import tariff on Indian goods.
