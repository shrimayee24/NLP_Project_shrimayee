MUMBAI: The green cover in India has absorbed more carbon than it emitted annually in the last decade, but the rate of sequestration declines during extreme climate events such as drought, a study has revealed. The study by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Bhopal, also stressed the critical role of vegetation in climate change mitigation and adaptation.Green vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and releases it back into the air through respiration.""The overall balance between this uptake and release of CO2 is known as the net ecosystem exchange (NEE). When the NEE is positive, it means vegetation is releasing more carbon than it absorbs, and when it's negative, it indicates that the vegetation is effectively storing carbon,"" said Dhanyalekshmi Pillai, associate professor, head of the Max Planck Partner Group Germany, and of the Earth and Environmental Sciences, IISER Bhopal.""For the last decade, India's (green) ecosystem absorbed more carbon than they emitted annually, with annual NEE estimates ranging from 380 to 530 million tonnes of carbon per year,"" she said.Researcher and co-author of the paper, Aparnna Ravi, said this level of carbon sequestration is impressive but tends to decline in response to climate extremes, emphasising the critical role of vegetation in climate change mitigation and adaptation.Scientists also studied how different types of vegetation across India help absorb CO2 each year.Pillai said evergreen forests in India are highly efficient in capturing CO2 through photosynthesis. However, the deciduous forests in central India released more carbon into the atmosphere as plant respiration surpassed primary productivity.""They (green vegetation) released 210 million tonnes of carbon annually, acting as carbon sources. Although croplands are less effective at absorbing carbon per unit area than forests, their extensive coverage across the country benefits significant CO2 removal from the atmosphere,"" she said.Pillai said the sequestration rate is not constant but shows a decreasing trend, especially in response to drought.She said drought is an example of climate extremes, and these conditions are increasing due to climate change.""Green vegetation is favouring us (reducing global warming), but the sequestration potential cannot be limitless...under climate extremes, it shows decreasing sequestration. This is concerning,"" Pillai said.She said the study reflects on creating and implementing effective climate policies and ecosystem management in consonance with nationally prioritised action plans.IISER scientists, in collaboration with international experts, led and established an innovative technology-driven approach using highly resolved observations of plants' fluorescence (""glow"") and advanced physics-based computer models to quantify vegetation's carbon sequestration potential across India for the first time.In this novel approach, IISER-Bhopal researchers led long-term analyses across India by tracking several thousands of observational records of the last 10 years (2012-22), together with research experts from the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (Germany), University of Exeter (United Kingdom) and National Remote Sensing Centre (India).Pillai said this newly demonstrated system also benefits from the recently available radiance observations from multiple satellite instruments, including the TROPOMI instrument onboard the Sentinel-2 satellite.She said the method is more sensitive to detecting changes in ecosystem responses widely across the country than the commonly employed global methods that lack sufficient in-situ carbon measurements.""By integrating interdisciplinary national and international expertise, IISER-B research focuses on uncovering the complex ecosystem processes that govern carbon sequestration and their resilience to climate extremes,"" Pillai said.","Green vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and releases it back into the air through respiration.

Delhi Earthquake News: Why did the 4.0-magnitude earthquake in Delhi-NCR feel so strong?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-did-the-4-0-magnitude-earthquake-in-delhi-ncr-feel-so-strong/articleshow/118315557.cms,"Why did the tremors feel so strong?



Epicentre within Delhi: Since the earthquake originated beneath the city, seismic waves had less distance to travel, making the tremors feel more intense.

Shallow depth: Earthquakes that occur closer to the Earth's surface generate stronger shaking compared to deeper quakes of similar magnitude.

Urban infrastructure: High-rise buildings in Delhi, Noida, and Ghaziabad sway more due to their height, amplifying the sensation of shaking.

Soil composition: Soft alluvial soil in some areas of Delhi can amplify seismic waves, further intensifying the tremors.

How earthquake intensity changes with magnitude

NEW DELHI: Residents of Delhi-NCR and several parts of northern India were jolted awake early Monday morning as strong tremors shook high-rise buildings , prompting many to rush outdoors. The earthquake, measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale, struck at 5:36 AM IST with its epicentre located within Delhi's Dhaula Kuan, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).Though a 4.0-magnitude quake is considered moderate, its impact felt stronger than usual because of its shallow depth and close proximity to densely populated areas. Earthquakes with epicentres within a city result in more intense shaking since seismic waves travel a shorter distance before reaching structures, amplifying the tremors.Delhi, which falls in Seismic Zone IV , is prone to moderate-to-strong earthquakes, making localised tremors more pronounced as the. Experts noted that buildings, particularly high-rises, sway more due to their design, increasing the perceived intensity of shaking.Authorities have reported no major damage or casualties, but the sudden tremors sparked concern among residents. Seismologists continue to monitor aftershocks and have advised citizens to stay informed about earthquake preparedness measures.See how close were you from the epicenter: Dhaula Kuan Delhi sits near active fault lines, including the Delhi-Hardwar Ridge and the Mahendragarh-Dehradun fault, making it prone to moderate seismic activity. The tremors were caused by tectonic plate movement along one of these fault lines, where stress builds up over time and is eventually released as an earthquake.The intensity of an earthquake is measured on the logarithmic Richter scale, where each whole-number increase represents a tenfold increase in the amplitude of seismic waves and about 32 times more energy release. This means that even small changes in magnitude can have a dramatic impact.For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 4.0 produces 10 times stronger shaking and releases 32 times more energy than a 3.0. Similarly, a 5.0-magnitude earthquake shakes 10 times more than a 4.0 and releases 32 times more energy. By the time an earthquake reaches magnitude 6.0, the shaking is 1,000 times stronger than a 3.0, and the energy released is 32,000 times greater. This exponential increase is why a seemingly small rise in magnitude can lead to severe destruction, especially in urban areas.","Residents of Delhi-NCR and northern India were jolted awake early Monday morning as strong tremors shook high-rise buildings.

Eathquake in Delhi - 'Everything was shaking'

NEW DELHI: North India woke up to strong tremors early Monday morning with 4.0 magnitude first hitting Delhi-NCR at around 5.30 am and then in Bihar at 8 am.The strong tremors caused residents of high-rise buildings in Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida, and Ghaziabad to rush out of their homes.The tremor in Delhi occurred at 5.36 am, with its epicentre located near Durgabai Deshmukh College of Special Education in Dhaula Kuan at a depth of five kilometres, officials confirmed. There were no immediate reports of any damage or injuries.The area experiences minor seismic activity every two to three years, with a previous 3.3 magnitude earthquake recorded in 2015. Officials noted that a loud sound accompanied the tremor.Meanwhile, a 4.0 magnitude earthquake also hit Bihar's Siwan district at 8.02 am, the National Center for Seismology informed.Reacting to the strong tremors that hit New Delhi and neighbouring areas, PM Modi urged citizens to ""stay calm and follow safety precautions.""""Tremors were felt in Delhi and nearby areas. Urging everyone to stay calm and follow safety precautions, staying alert for possible aftershocks. Authorities are keeping a close watch on the situation,"" he wrote in an X post.The earthquake was felt across the capital region and neighbouring states. The Delhi Police posted on X, ""We hope you all are safe, Delhi!"" and advised citizens to use the emergency 112 helpline if needed.Former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal reacted to the strong tremors in Delhi-NCR, posting on X: ""I pray for everyone's safety.""In a post on X, The Delhi Police said, ""We hope you all are safe, Delhi!""Earlier on January 23, Delhi-NCR experienced strong tremors after a 7.2-magnitude earthquake hit Xinjiang, China, at a depth of 80 kilometers.This followed mild tremors on January 11, when a 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan, shaking the region.Delhi, situated 250 kilometres from the seismically-active Himalayan collision zone, regularly experiences seismic activity from both Himalayan and local sources.Previous significant tremors include a 3.5-magnitude quake on April 12, 2020, a 3.4-magnitude on May 10, 2020, in northeast Delhi, and a 4.4-magnitude earthquake near Rohtak on May 29, 2020, followed by numerous aftershocks.Being in Seismic Zone IV of India's seismic zoning map, this intraplate region faces moderate to high risk from Himalayan earthquakes.At New Delhi railway station, a vendor Anish said, ""Everything was shaking, customers started screaming.""A passenger waiting for his train at New Delhi railway station described the experience: ""I was in the waiting lounge when everyone rushed out. It felt like a bridge or something had collapsed.""A resident of Noida, Amit said, ""At 5.35 am, the whole building was shaking. Our whole family ran outside the home.

New Delhi station stampede: No steps taken despite early signs of trouble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-delhi-station-stampede-no-steps-taken-despite-early-signs-of-trouble/articleshow/118314279.cms,"New Delhi Railway Station stampede (AP)

Stranded passengers rely on each other for help in chaos

NEW DELHI: A day after the devastating stampede at New Delhi Railway Station, there were many questions but few answers. While the lack of measures that could have prevented such a situation was apparent, passengers also flagged a range of lapses ranging from absence of proper communication from railway staff to non-availability of trained medical help.There were early signs of trouble. Around 8.15pm, two hours prior to the stampede, several X users began posting about the growing crowd near the platforms. Yet, no measures were taken to manage the situation, it has been alleged.Despite clear warning signs, the congestion only worsened. One user posted, ""Shiv Ganga Express-12560. New Delhi - Overcrowded Platform No. 12 (last-minute change from 14). Despite having a ticket, we can't enter the coach. The first-class TTE has locked the door, but no one is managing the other AC coaches.""Many passengers claimed that they were caught off guard by the last-minute platform change which contributed to the chaos.Railway officials were quick to refute allegations that there was a last-minute change in platform. ""The matter is being investigated by a high-level committee. No train was cancelled, nor was there any change in platform... Let the committee submit its report and findings,"" said a senior railway officer.The sale of around 1,500 general class tickets every hour in such a situation also raised serious questions about accountability. Many passengers claimed that the influx should have been halted in time.The lack of clear announcements regarding train arrivals was another major concern raised by passengers, with many believing it contributed significantly to the stampede -particularly in the case of the special train. Passengers at the station claimed that the announcements were unclear due to background noise.There was little to no visible medical assistance available on the platforms. Stranded passengers were left to fend for themselves, relying on each other for help in the chaos.Several families that TOI spoke to said that doctors or trained responders could have made a real difference. ""Even on normal days, when the station is crowded, there's no one to assist those in need. Getting a wheelchair for the elderly or disabled is always a struggle. Sometimes, porters are paid extra to carry elderly passengers on the trolley,"" said a vendor who didn't wish to be named.Eyewitness Sharda Devi, a resident of Bijwasan, said there was a frantic rush at platforms 13-14. Seeing the chaos, she, along with her daughter and relative, attempted to move away, but security officials stopped them and others from proceeding further near the staircase. This created a bottleneck, forcing passengers at the back to push forward, triggering a ripple effect that led to the crush.At the station, the staircase and escalator are both extremely busy areas, but these aren't the only entry and exit points. There are other bridges and access routes, yet people weren't directed to use them. ""If the authorities had spread the crowd more effectively, the situation could have been much better controlled. Instead, the platforms, bridges and stairs were all packed with people, making it nearly impossible to move,"" said a passenger who had a narrow escape in the tragedy.Passengers also noted that there were inadequate crowd-control measures in place despite the massive overcrowding.","A day after the devastating stampede at New Delhi Railway Station, there were many questions but few answers.

NEW DELHI: Former chief election commissioner (CEC) SY Quraishi dismissed claims that a US agency funded efforts to raise voter turnout in India, calling the reports ""baseless"" and ""malicious."" His response follows an announcement by the US department of government efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk , which claimed to have cancelled $21 million in funding for voter participation initiatives in India.Quraishi clarified that during his tenure as CEC in 2012, the Election Commission of India (ECI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES). However, he said that this agreement did not involve any financial commitments.

""There was no financing or even promise of finance involved in the MoU, forget X or Y amount. The MoU in fact made it clear in black and white that there would be no financial and legal obligation of any kind on either side,"" he said, adding that this stipulation was explicitly mentioned at two different places in the document to avoid any ambiguity.Quraishi reiterated that any claims of US funding for voter participation in India were entirely false.

A US military aircraft landed at Amritsar airport on Saturday night, carrying 116 Indian migrants who had been deported from the United States. Among them was Daljit Singh, who had left his village in Punjab last year with hopes of a better future. Instead, he returned in shackles, his hands cuffed and legs chained throughout the journey.""Our legs were chained and hands were also cuffed throughout the journey. There were three women and three children on board who were not cuffed,"" Daljit told news agency PTI upon arrival. His experience reflects the harsh reality of illegal migration , where many fall prey to fraudulent travel agents and endure gruelling journeys, only to be deported back home.Among the deportees, over 60 were from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, eight from Gujarat, two each from Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, and one each from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.Daljit recounted how he was lured by a travel agent in 2022, who promised to take him to the US legally in exchange for Rs 65 lakh. To secure the deal, he handed over an advance agreement for an acre of his land. His journey began in November 2022, when he was first sent to Dubai. After spending nearly 18 months there, he returned to India, only to be sent to South Africa for four-and-a-half months.From there, he was taken to Brazil on August 26 last year and embarked on a treacherous route through multiple countries. The journey involved walking through dense forests, crossing rivers, and surviving on minimal food. Eventually, he reached Mexico, where he was forced to stay for a month while his travel agent coerced his wife into signing over his land. Finally, he crossed into the US on January 27, only to be caught and detained by US Border Patrol. ""I was given only a bottle of water, a packet of chips, and an apple daily,"" he told PTI.Sourav, a 20-year-old from Punjab's Ferozepur district, also shared his harrowing experience. His family spent Rs 45-46 lakh to send him to the US, selling farmland and borrowing money from relatives. ""We were kept in a camp (detention centre) for 18 days,"" he said. ""A day before our deportation, we were told that we would be shifted to another camp. When we boarded the plane, they said we were being taken to India.""Sourav had travelled through Amsterdam, Panama, and Mexico before attempting to cross the border on January 27. ""Our mobile phones were confiscated, and we had no contact with our families. Our hands and legs were tied.

Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the Donald Trump administration announced on Sunday a series of expenditure cuts, including the cancellation of $21 million intended for ""voter turnout in India."" BJP responded, alleging ""external interference in India's electoral process.""Sharing a post on X, the official DOGE handle outlined the list stating that, ""US taxpayer dollars were going to be spent on the following items, all of which have been cancelled.”It also canceled several other US spending, including $ 29 million allocated for ""strengthening the political landscape in Bangladesh"" and $ 10 million for ""Mozambique voluntary medical male circumcision,"" aimed at saving US taxpayer money.BJP's Amit Malviya took to X, responding to the announcement, stating that the $21 million allocated for voter turnout in India amounts to external interference in the country’s electoral process and questioned who would benefit from it.“$486M to the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening,’ including $22M for ‘inclusive and participatory political process’ in Moldova and $21M for voter turnout in India,” Malviya wrote in a post on X.“$21M for voter turnout? This definitely is external interference in India’s electoral process. Who gains from this? Not the ruling party for sure!” he added.The Department of Government Efficiency further cancelled $39 million designated for ""fiscal federalism"" and ""biodiversity conservation"" in Nepal.Additionally, $1.5 million for voter confidence programs in Liberia, $14 million for ""social cohesion"" in Mali, $2.5 million for ""inclusive democracies in Southern Africa,"" and $47 million for ""improving learning outcomes in Asia"" were also scrapped.The department also announced the cancellation of $32 million allocated to the Prague Civil Society Centre, $40 million for a gender equality and women’s empowerment hub, and $14 million for enhancing public procurement in Serbia.These actions align with DOGE's recent pattern of implementing substantial modifications to government expenditure. Established during the Trump administration, DOGE was tasked with eliminating “wasteful” government spending. However it has drawn scrutiny over its broad powers and Musk’s influence.During his recent visit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's discussion with Musk focused on enhancing collaboration between Indian and American entities across various sectors including innovation, space exploration, artificial intelligence, and sustainable development.The dialogue between PM Modi and Elon Musk , who was joined by three of his children, also encompassed expanding cooperation in emerging technologies, entrepreneurship, and good governance.Trump recently criticised USAID (US Agency for International Development), alleging widespread mismanagement of funds. He asserted that the organisation's financial dealings were dubious and called for its shutdown.""USAID is driving the radical left crazy, and there is nothing they can do about it because the way in which the money has been spent, so much of it fraudulently, is totally unexplainable. The corruption is at levels rarely seen before. Close it down,"" Trump wrote in a post on X.","The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the Donald Trump administration announced on Sunday a series of expenditure cuts.

DEHRADUN: Over 45% of Himachal Pradesh's area is highly prone to natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and avalanches, according to a study by researchers from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar. The team recently completed a hazard susceptibility mapping of the state as part of a broader effort by researchers and scientists from multiple IITs to assess multi-hazard vulnerability across the Himalayan states. The goal is to identify regions at high risk from multiple natural hazards simultaneously and aid in targeted disaster risk reduction strategies .The IIT Ropar team presented its findings at the 2nd Indian Cryosphere Meet (ICM), held at IIT Bombay on Feb 14-15, which was attended by nearly 80 glaciologists, researchers, and scientists from around the world.The study, conducted by MTech scholar Daishisha Iawphniaw under the guidance of Reet Kamal Tiwari, an associate professor at IIT Ropar, used geospatial data to evaluate the state's vulnerability. Tiwari told TOI, ""The study found that areas with mean slopes between 5.9 degrees and 16.4 degrees and elevations up to 1,600 metres are particularly prone to both landslides and floods. Meanwhile, higher-altitude regions with slopes between 16.8 degrees and 41.5 degrees are more likely to experience both avalanches and landslides."" He added that steep mountain slopes and elevations above 3,000 metres are at the ""highest risk"". Using GIS-based mapping, the study classified hazard-prone regions, showing that flood and landslide-prone zones are typically located in lower-elevation river valleys, while high-altitude mountains face a greater threat of avalanches.The study also highlighted how one hazard can trigger another due to shared underlying causes and stressed that having this knowledge is crucial for improving disaster planning and risk management.Tiwari said studies to assess multi-hazard vulnerability are being conducted in Uttarakhand, J&K, and northeast states. ""For Uttarakhand, we are collaborating with IIT Roorkee to conduct the study,"" he said.","Over 45% of Himachal Pradesh's area is highly prone to natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and avalanches.

Poll How Do You Feel About the Changes in the US Visa Renewal Process? It Could Make the Process More Organized in the Long Run It Makes the Process More Difficult for Applicants

NEW DELHI: Renewing the same class of US visa could now mean a long wait for many applicants in India. Uncle Sam has returned to its pre-Covid policy of allowing travellers to renew their visa without appearing at the embassy/consulate for an interview if their previous same-class visa is still valid or expired within the last 12 months.In Nov 2022, when the wait time for B1/B2 (business and tourism visa ) interview had crossed 999 days (touching almost three years) in India, the US increased the eligibility for same class drop box visa renewal — which does not require interview — from 12 months to 48 months. Since then the waiting period for B1/B2 interview has less than halved, it is currently over 440 days in Delhi & Mumbai; 436 in Chennai; 429 in Hyderabad and 415 in Kolkata.With such a long waiting, the reduction of drop box eligibility for renewal will mean more people again seeking appointments for same class visa renewal and further prolonging the queue. Asked in this backdrop if it planned to take any step in India to reduce the waiting, the US embassy said it had “anything additional”.Anil Kalsi, Travel Agents Federation of India VP, said: “This makes travel difficult for people who were banking on renewal. Since it’s announced and is already in effect, a lot of people have been caught unawares. There are anyway no interview dates available (in India) without a long waiting period. Some time should have been provided before the change took effect.”Repeat travellers to the US may, under some circumstances, renew their visas without appearing at the embassy or consulate for an interview. The visa waiver checklist for applicants, except those 14 years of age and 80 & above includes: “(is) a citizen of India/Bhutan or a lawful resident of India/Bhutan.(Has) a previous U.S. visa in the same class as the visa for which wish to apply and (the) prior visa in the same visa class is still valid or expired within the last 12 months. Most recent visa was issued on or after my 14th birthday,” according to a US Govt website.While India-US travel is reaching new highs post Covid, the travel industry says it remains way below potential due to two factors — long visa interview wait times and few direct flights due to US airlines not using Russian airspace. A record number of Indians travelled to the US last calendar year, more than CY 2023’s figure of 17.6 lakh which had overtaken the pre-Covid 2019 high of 14.7 lakh. India has now emerged as the second largest overseas source market of international visitors to the US, after the UK.",Uncle Sam has returned to its pre-Covid policy of allowing travellers to renew their visa without appearing at the embassy/consulate for an interview.

VARANASI: As lakhs of pilgrims from Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj continued to reach Varanasi, district authorities extended restrictions while CM Yogi Adityanath conducted an aerial survey of the congested city roads Saturday afternoon to assess the situation.Ganga aarti at the ghats were suspended until Feb 26. Classes up to 8 remained suspended. Schools will be online only. Traffic restrictions and diversions were strictly enforced to manage the swelling crowd.The influx of pilgrims has led to record-breaking numbers at Kashi Vishwanath temple , which saw more than 8 lakh devotees Thursday alone. The trend continued through Friday and Saturday, keeping the temple premises heavily crowded.After his helicopter sortie, chief minister Yogi adjusted his schedule, forgoing his planned visit to Kaal Bhairav temple and instead reaching Kashi Vishwanath temple. He did not take the jam-packed roads - instead chose the Ganga, boarding a cruise to make his way to the shrine. From there, he returned to Namo Ghat by cruise to inaugurate the Kashi Tamil Sangamam event.With the pilgrimage season in full swing, officials monitored the situation closely to ensure safety and crowd management across the city. Devotees traveling between Prayagraj, Ayodhya and Varanasi - completing the holy triangle - added to the pressure.""In view of the very high crowd load, Ganga aarti organisers had consented to keep the choreographed daily evening aartis postponed,"" said DCP Gaurav Banswal, adding that the restriction on boat operations in Ganga after 6pm will remain in place.",Ganga aarti at the ghats were suspended until Feb 26.

AMRITSAR: An American aircraft carrying 116 illegal Indian immigrants deported from the US was delayed and arrived at Amritsar's international airport a little past 11.30pm Saturday, the second such flight after a US military C-17 plane had brought back 104 deportees to the same airport on February 5.At a press conference earlier Saturday, Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Singh Mann had once again expressed anger over the flight landing in the holy city amid allegations of attempts by the Centre to ""tarnish the image of Punjab and Punjabis"". A third US flight carrying Indian deportees is expected to also land on Sunday, PTI reported, quoting official sources.When it was pointed out that the Centre had probably chosen Amritsar as the landing point for deportation flight as it was nearer to the US than other Indian airports, Mann shot back: ""If Amritsar is so close, then it would make sense to start flights from here to the US and Canada as we have been demanding.""Sixty-five of Saturday's deportees are from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, 8 from Gujarat, two each from UP, Goa, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, and one each from HP and J&K , PTI quoted official sources as saying, adding that 119 had been expected but an updated passenger manifest had been provided later.BJP national spokesperson RP Singh had said in a post on X on Saturday, in which Mann was tagged, ""Amritsar is the closest international airport for flights entering India from the US"" and that was why the US plane was landing there"".Mann also questioned the appropriateness of allowing a US military plane to land in a city close to the border, saying, ""Other countries are sending their civilian planes to bring back their deportees, so why are we allowing a US military plane to land here?"" He also asked whether Vatican City would allow a US military plane to land in its territory. [Vatican City has a heliport for VIPs; other visitors use Rome's airports.]Punjab's govt has arranged temporary accommodation for deportees from outside the state, who will leave for Delhi on a 6.30am flight on Sunday. Those from Punjab will be transported to their native places by road.Family members of some deportees who came to the airport expressed dissatisfaction with the Punjab govt's rehabilitation efforts.The relatives of Harjit Singh (22) and Harjot Singh (20), were deeply depressed. They had spent 45 lakh on each of the cousins to send them to the US. Their uncle, Nishan Singh, said the two young men from Khanowal, in Gurdaspur, had reached the US just 10 days ago but were caught and deported. He added that a US-based travel agent had assured them of legal entry into US.CM Mann, Union junior minister for railways Ravneet Singh Bittu and Congress MP from Amritsar Gurjeet Singh Aujla had visited the airport for some time earlier in the day.Mann, asked at Saturday's press conference whether Indian deportees would be in restraints, said state govt did not have any information about this, and that PM Modi should have raised the issue with Donald Trump when he met him.",65 of 116 deportees in 2nd flight are from Punjab.

Army & IAF intensify hunt for advanced anti-drone systems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-iaf-intensify-hunt-for-advanced-anti-drone-systems/articleshow/118290751.cms,"-Picture-

NEW DELHI: With the threat from hostile drones and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in both conventional and irregular warfare continuing to expand exponentially, the armed forces are stepping-up induction of a wide array of anti-drone systems but underline the urgent need for more advanced ones.The Army this week floated the tender for procurement of nine more indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (IDD&IS) to add to the ones already inducted under emergency procurements for the frontier with China.The IAF, in turn, wants 10 new kamikaze drones-based anti-swarm drone systems, 10 mobile micro munitions-based anti-swarm drone systems and 100-200 vehicle-mounted counter-UAS .Among other systems, IAF will begin inducting 200 radio frequency jammer guns from next month under a contract inked a year ago, while Army is getting around 30 vehicle-based drone jammers .“But much more advanced anti-drone systems, with multiple `soft-kill’ and `hard-kill’ options as well as much longer interception ranges, are urgently needed,” a senior officer said. These systems range from jamming, spoofing and blinding systems that disrupt the satellite or video command-and-control links of drones to laser-based directed energy weapons (DEWs) for hard-kills.A major problem, however, is that India is way behind other countries in indigenously developing such complex technologies. After DRDO developed anti-drone systems with 2-kilowatt to 10-kilowatt lasers, the armed forces ordered 23 such systems for around Rs 400 crore.“DRDO is developing DEWs with higher power. Many domestic private firms are also tying up with foreign companies for advanced anti-drone solutions. Let’s hope they work out,” another officer said.The Modi-Trump summit, incidentally, welcomed the new partnership between US company Anduril Industries and Indian Mahindra Group on advanced autonomous technologies to co-produce an “advanced AI-enabled counter-UAS”.The Army still relies heavily on old air defence systems, many of which have outlived their operational lives. “Though emergency procurements of anti-drone systems have been undertaken in recent years, they remain inadequate in countering the rapidly evolving threat from drones, which has been repeatedly reinforced by the Armenia-Azerbaijan, Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine conflicts,” he added.There is, for instance, the need to develop more advanced versions of the existing vehicle-mounted IDD&IS inducted by the Army Air Defence, which at present can soft-kill drones by jamming at 2 to 5-km range, with the effective hard-kill range through lasers only around 800-metre. “There is a mounting threat from low radar cross-section UAS and swarm drones,” an officer said.IAF air defence systems, with advanced radars and ground-to-air missile systems, are also geared towards thwarting air intrusions by large UAS, aircraft and helicopters. “The lack of adequate effective multi-sensor, multi-kill systems against smaller drones is an operational gap,” an officer said.A concerted effort is required to reduce the R&D time, fast-track procurement processes and ensure rapid induction of advanced counter-drone technologies. “The domestic defence industry should accelerate the production of advanced and scalable anti-drone systems to protect critical assets, particularly during wartime and heightened tensions,” he added.","The Army this week floated the tender for procurement of nine more indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems.

Goa's job scarcity and allure of the American dream spur desperate youths to trudge and trek via South America's donkey route. Once they cross Mexico-US border , they are smuggled to small towns where they then hope to find work as petrol pump operators, gardeners or delivery agents after paying lakhs to unscrupulous agents.For two young Goans who had left for the US only last month, this dream came crashing as they sat shackled and handcuffed on a US C-17 military transport aircraft on Saturday during their disconsolate journey back to where they started: home.Sarzora lad AC Mascarenhas, in his twenties, found his hopes crushed even before he could make it to US soil. His dangerous trek through several countries and his audacious plan of being smuggled by human traffickers in pursuit of the American dream ended at the US border.

This was the first instance of Goans being sent back in handcuffs with their legs chained during the flight.""It's unfortunate that Goan youths were part of the group deported.

NEW DELHI: Even as BJP on Sunday said a now cancelled US-funded programme linked to voter turnout in India was another example of the UPA govt allegedly enabling ""infiltration of Indian institutions by forces opposed to the country's interests"", S Y Quraishi , who was chief election commissioner at the time, said there indeed was an MoU in 2012 but any mention of any funds was ""completely false and malicious"".BJP seized upon Elon Musk-headed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), constituted by US President Donald Trump, announcing that it had cancelled many programmes costing hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars, citing $486 million to the 'Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening', which included $21 million for ""voter turnout"" in India.""It is becoming increasingly evident that the Congress-led UPA systematically enabled the infiltration of India's institutions by forces opposed to the nation's interests - those who seek to weaken India at every opportunity,"" BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said on X.Quraishi, who headed EC from July 30, 2010, to June 10, 2012, took to X to clarify matters: ""The report in a section of media about an MoU by ECI in 2012 when I was CEC for funding of certain million dollars by a US agency for raising voter turnout in India does not have an iota of fact.""SY Quraishi further said, ""Yes, there was an MoU with IFES (International Foundation for Electoral Systems) in 2012 like we had with many other agencies and election management bodies to facilitate training for desirous countries at ECI's training & resource centre, IIIDEM, which was very new at that stage.""The former CEC said there was no financing or even promise of finance involved in the MoU. ""The MoU, in fact, made it clear in black and white that there would be no financial and legal obligation of any kind on either side,"" he added.He said this stipulation was made at two different places to leave no scope for any ambiguity. Earlier, Amit Malviya claimed that the shadow of billionaire American investor George Soros, a ""known associate of Congress party and the Gandhis, loomed over our electoral process"".He said EC had signed an MoU with IFES, an organisation he claimed was linked to Soros's Open Society Foundation, which was primarily funded by USAID.""$21m for voter turnout? This definitely is external interference in India's electoral process. Who gains from this? Not the ruling party for sure,"" Malviya said.","Ex-CEC: No financing or promise of finance in MoU with IFES in 2012.

India attempts to promote Bimstec, which excludes Pakistan

Foreign minister S Jaishankar met Bangladesh foreign adviser Touhid Hossain on the sidelines of Indian Ocean Conference in Muscat on Sunday amid tense bilateral ties over the presence of ousted ex-PM Sheikh Hasina in India since last August.While Jaishankar said the conversation was focused on the bilateral relationship and cooperation under Bimstec , a Bangladesh readout said Hossain requested India to consider a huddle of Saarc standing committee that hasn't met since the 2016 Uri attack when India decided to block the process because of Pakistan's support to cross-border terror.Sunday's talks come ahead of a possible meeting between PM Modi and Bangladesh chief adviser Md Yunus on the margins of Bimstec summit in Thailand on April 3-4.If it happens, it would be the first bilateral meeting between the two after Yunus assumed office. Both Modi and Yunus are likely to attend the Bimstec summit in person. Modi had discussed concerns related to Bangladesh in the meeting with Trump last week.In his meeting with Jaishankar, Hossain also called for talks for renewal of Ganges Water Treaty , adding both sides recognised the challenges in the relationship and the need for joint efforts to address those.According to Dhaka, ahead of talks between border forces this week, it was hoped that various border related issues would be discussed and resolved during the meeting. Both sides recognised the challenges the two neighbours are facing in terms of bilateral relations and discussed the necessity to work together to address those, it said in its statement on the Jaishankar-Hossain meeting. Jaishankar also met his counterparts from other Bimstec member-states like Nepal and Bhutan in Muscat. India has sought to promote the inter-regional Bimstec, which excludes Pakistan and counts Thailand as a member, as a more relevant forum for regional cooperation and connectivity, as Saarc remains practically defunct.The mention of Bimstec in Jaishankar's post is important also because Bangladesh will officially take over as the chair of the group from Thailand at the summit.""As the chair, Bangladesh will have the opportunity to lead Bimstec, take initiatives for cooperation in different sectors by working together in tandem with all the member states and this will be an opportunity for Bangladesh to re-demonstrate its commitment to the world,"" said Bimstec secretary-general I M Pandey last week.Jaishankar is learnt to have conveyed India's desire for a constructive and mutually beneficial relationship with Bangladesh in a positive atmosphere.",S Jaishankar met Bangladesh foreign adviser Touhid Hossain on Sunday.

The fourth edition of TOI's Art of India (AOI) opened on a heartening note with Maharashtra's cultural minister Ashish Shelar announcing the launch of MAHARA - Maharashtra Art Recognition Award - as the state's commitment to its rich artistic heritage. ""Starting this year, MAHARA will honour outstanding contributions in the field of art and craftsmanship,"" said Ashish Shelar, who also unveiled another ambitious initiative - WAVES - World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit , set to take place in Mumbai from May 1 to 4. ""Just as Davos hosts the World Economic Forum, this summit will bring together global leaders in art, culture, music, film, and storytelling to showcase India's artistic and creative potential,"" he declared, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with several international guests, will be attending the event.In another major push for the arts, he reiterated Maharashtra's partnership with the central government to establish the Indian Institute for Creative Technology (IICT) on a 10-acre plot in Goregaon's Film City. ""This centre of excellence will bring together artists, sculptors, craftsmen, filmmakers, and content creators under one roof. India produces some of the finest creative work in the world, and we must recognise its potential.""Following AOI's grand success in Delhi, these major cultural commitments set the stage for its Mumbai edition, reaffirming the platform's role in celebrating and acknowledging the country's creative community.The Mumbai edition of the exhibition, inaugurated by industrialist Ajay Piramal, cultural minister Ashish Shelar, author Shobhaa De, CSMVS director Sabyasachi Mukherjee, showcased a striking mix of masterpieces featuring legendary names, emerging voices, and under-represented artists. This edition of AOI also highlights India's rich miniature styles and folk traditions.Piramal made a strong case for expanding institutional support for the arts. ""I feel that exhibitions like this will only help in bringing art to more and more people and encourage them,"" he said, pointing out how art should transcend social and educational boundaries. ""Art is for everyone. You don't have to be highly educated or part of the elite to appreciate it. If you look at the history of India's great masters, they came from humble backgrounds but made a name for themselves across the world,"" said Piramal, welcoming the growing international interest in Indian art. ""Indian art is finally being recognised abroad, but when you compare its market value to its beauty and skill, there's still a gap,"" he said, stressing on the need to not just celebrate Indian art but ensure it gets the recognition and the price it truly deserves.Describing AOI's fourth edition as a ""big, big moment for Mumbai, and, in fact, for India"", De said, ""What is special is the inclusivity, diversity and gender fluidity that's represented so equally. And to see our folk and tribal artists receive exactly the same kind of platform as some of our great masters, it democratises art. And that's what art should be about.""Shanti Ekambaram, Kotak Mahindra Banking board member, dwelled on the deeper essence of art beyond its visual appeal. Quoting Amrita Sher-Gil, she reflected on the personal connection artists have with their homeland: ""I can only paint in India. Europe belongs to Picasso, to Matisse. India only belongs to me."" Having taken a brief walk through the space with over 250 works by 150 renowned artists, she described it as ""some of India's most exclusive, breathtaking artwork,""Besides its aesthetic value, Ekambaram highlighted its appeal as an investment. Citing data from the 2024 Hurun India Art List, she said, ""I come from the money world, so you know, I can talk about money and how art is really valuable. The sales by the top 50 artists reached more than Rs 300 crore in 2024, a 19% increase over the previous year. A lot of the artists are seeing an increase in their value,"" she said.About how one should go about buying art, AOI curator Alka Pande had these wise words. ""Let art speak to you. Let it make you pause, reflect, and see the world differently. Because that's what art does-it reminds us of our shared humanity and our endless capacity to hope for a better future.""For some, art is restorative; for others, it can be resistance or even an antidote in times of chaos. But while it means different things to different people, it does have a magnetic power. Its draw was visible at AOI, which attracted not only the cultural fraternity but some of the country's best legal and corporate minds. Among those who attended were Sonjoy Chatterjee, chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs; Anant Goenka, executive director of Indian Express; top criminal lawyer Amit Desai; and Shishir Mehta, co-head, India Practice at global law firm Ashurst.",The fourth edition of TOI's Art of India (AOI) opened on a heartening note.

People said there is so much demand that they are unable to meet it. Some friends told me that it takes an average investment of Rs 75-80 crore to set up a factory that can employ 2,000 people. I would urge bankers to hear their demands, understand their priorities and give,"" Modi said at Bharat Tex, the premier business event for the sector.The comment comes at a time when industry representatives have also told the textiles ministry that there is a lot of demand in the wake of the developments in Bangladesh and efforts by companies to diversify the sourcing base, which is highly dependent on China. Several global companies are also in talks to step up sourcing from India.""Some friends were telling me that there are a lot of foreign companies which want to invest in India, and I would urge you to be the ambassadors for that. When you tell them, instead of the govt, they will agree,"" Modi said.He said govt is also taking steps to boost manufacturing in country and also promote textiles sector. ""We are working on long-term ideas for the textiles sector... we have taken several policy changes,"" he said, adding that several steps have been taken including in the budget to provide more credit and change the definition of MSMEs.Referring to his statement at Bharat Tex last year, the PM said, ""The vision of farm, fibre, fabric, fashion and foreign is becoming a mission for the country. This mission is opening up avenues of growth for everyone - farmers, weavers, designers and businesses. Last year, textiles and apparel exports from India grew 7%. If you cheer at 7% then what will happen to me? Next time there should be cheering when we grow 17%. We export textiles and apparel worth Rs 3 lakh crore, the target is to take it to Rs 9 lakh crore by 2030. But we may be able to achieve the target before 2030 itself.""",PM Narendra Modi urged bankers to ensure adequate credit flow to the textiles sector.

Additionally, delays in the Swatantra Senani Express and Bhubaneshwar Rajdhani Express led to an increased passenger presence on platforms 12, 13, and 14, further contributing to the congestion.""As per CMI, every hour 1,500 general tickets were sold by railways due to which the station got overcrowded and became uncontrollable. There was a stampede at platform no. 14 and near escalator near platform no. 16,"" the DCP said.DCP KPS Malhotra elaborated that the crowd surged within 15-20 minutes after the announcement of a special train, as passengers hurried to board.

As of now, the situation is under control,"" he had said.An eyewitness recalled similar situation and said, ""The stampede broke out around 9.30pm... When people on platform number 13 saw trains on platforms 14 and 15 - they moved towards these platforms. The platforms of the trains were not changed, but the crowd was so huge that it could not be controlled....""One of the passengers, Dharmendra Singh, recounted his experience, stating that he was traveling to Prayagraj but faced difficulties as many trains were either delayed or canceled. ""I was going to Prayagraj but many trains were running late or were cancelled. The station was overcrowded. There were far more people than I have ever seen at this station. In front of me, six or seven women were taken away on stretchers.""Likewise, the railway ministry said, ""An Unprecedented rush situation developed today at about 10 pm in New Delhi railway station near platforms 13 & 14. Some of the passengers present there on the platforms fainted due to this sudden rush further leading to the rumours of stampede like situation.

“The Mavericks, though, sit less than $200,000 away from the NBA's first luxury-tax apron … even after Davis waived his trade kicker upon learning that the Lakers were dealing him to Dallas for Doncic.”

According to NBA insider Marc Stein, the Mavericks recently tried to sign formerbefore he joined the Los Angeles Clippers.Stein reported on The Stein Line that Dallas showed interest in Simmons during the buyout market.Stein wrote.Ben Simmons, a three-time All-Star, could have provided the Mavericks with much-needed playmaking and defensive versatility. While he hasn’t been the same dominant force since his Philadelphia 76ers days, his ability to facilitate and guard multiple positions would have been valuable for Dallas.However, financial constraints played a role in the Dallas Mavericks ’ inability to secure Simmons. Stein noted,Despite missing out on Ben Simmons, the Mavericks’ interest signals their intent to remain active in the buyout market. With the trade deadline behind them, Dallas is likely to explore additional options to bolster their roster for a playoff push. The team’s success will depend on who becomes available and how quickly they can integrate new pieces.Simmons’ move to the Clippers also sets up a potential postseason showdown between the two teams.

The decision has sparked conversations among fans and analysts, as Clark continues to make an impressive impact on her fans with her WNBA career.The NBA All-Star weekend has long been a platform for collaboration between the NBA and WNBA, with stars from both leagues competing in events. Last year, the league featured a thrilling one-on-one 3-point contest between Golden State Warriors Stephen Curry and New York Liberty’s Sabrina Ionescu. This year, discussions included adding Caitlin Clark and Klay Thompson to the mix for a potential two-on-two showdown. However, the idea was ultimately scrapped, and Clark declined her invitation.Clark’s decision stems from her desire to make her first 3-point contest appearance at the WNBA All-Star weekend .her representatives stated. This summer’s WNBA All-Star weekend holds special significance, as it will be hosted in Indianapolis for the first time, with Clark expected to be a central figure.Last year, Caitlin Clark skipped the NBA All-Star 3-Point Contest 2025, citing the need for rest after transitioning directly from college basketball to the professional league. This year, she’s focused on making her mark in the WNBA’s marquee event.Clark’s rookie season has been nothing short of impressive. She won the Rookie of the Year award, averaging 19.2 points, 8.4 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game. She also led the league in 3-pointers made per game (3.0) and assists per game (8.4), solidifying her status as one of the WNBA’s most promising talents.Fans might be sad to miss Clark's shooting prowess during the NBA All-Star 3-Point Contest 2025, but her choice shows how dedicated she is to the WNBA and its rising stature.

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift might make their red carpet debut at the Met Gala

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, who have been dating since summer 2023, may be making their red carpet debut this year. They could have attended major red carpet events like Swift's Eras Tour film premiere in Los Angeles in October 2023 and the Grammys and VMAs in 2023 and 2024, but decided against them due to scheduling or unknown reasons. With Swift's Eras Tour over and Kelce having a break before the next football season, this event might be the perfect opportunity for them to make their red carpet debut.Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have been busy with social engagements and busy schedules since dating in 2023. Taylor's Eras Tour and Travis' role in helping the Kansas City Chiefs win three consecutive Super Bowls make them as busy as any celebrity couple.Swift and Kelce, who are off the road after a disappointing Super Bowl loss, are expected to attend the Met Gala red carpet on May 5. People Magazine reports that they will make headlines due to their fashion expertise and previous attendance at the event. Both Swift and Kelce are expected to make a statement at the event.“As part of their R&R time, it's thought the couple could finally make an official red carpet appearance together — with the Met Gala earmarked as their first potential event together,” the Mirror reported of Kelce and Swift. “So far Swift and Kelce, who began dating in 2023, have struggled to align their schedules to step out together at an event.”Swift and her boyfriend Kelce have decided to attend the Met Gala, a first for Swift, as she hasn't attended the event with any of her boyfriends since 2016. This follows their 2023 invitation to the Oscars, where they also declined. “… However the Met Gala isn't until May, and with Swift not planning to tour this year it's thought she and Kelce could turn out at the red carpet event together. The event would be a ‘relationship first' for the pair as they anticipated to step out together.”Also Read: “Negotiate with terrorists”: Saturday Night Live producer branded Travis Kelce's girlfriend Taylor Swift a terrorist Swift has been supporting Kansas City Chief Kelce after the Super Bowl 59 loss, but was unable to cheer on Kelce.

Zelnick Defends Human Creativity in GTA 6 Development Amid AI Advancements



Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick on Grand Theft Auto VI: We couldn't be more excited

""We've been using digital tools since the very beginning. I would say the interactive entertainment business is an innovator within what people call now AI.""

""I think it's worth noting, though, the genius is human. The tools may be digital, but the creative genius is human.""

The Reality of Industry Trust Issues of AI



A Pledge That Needs Action



AI is transforming the gaming sector at a fast pace, but Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick believes that human imagination is still irreplaceable. During a recent interview, he stressed that though AI tools have been employed in game development for a long time, the essence of excellent games such as GTA 6 continues to be derived from human skills. More significantly, he asserted that employees should still be compensated if AI mimics their efforts in the future.One of the largest fears about AI is that it will displace human workers or diminish the value of their work. Zelnick was adamant that Take-Two has a commitment to preserving and paying human creators a fair rate. He emphasized that if AI is using or duplicating a developer's work, those developers need to be compensated.He said,However, he made it clear that technology does not replace human talent, stating,This policy is at odds with some corporations that have not been as much in favor of human ability when confronted with AI innovation.AI has long been a mainstay in the gaming sector, assisting with pathfinding, enemy AI, and procedural generation, for example. Recent developments in generative AI have raised questions regarding its ethical deployment and implications for employment. Asked if AI is playing a role in development of GTA 6, Zelnick explained that the company has employed AI tools for years but the real innovation in games always originates from humans.Although Zelnick's statements are optimistic, the gaming community has heard those promises before—and only to watch companies subsequently care more about bottom lines than how they treat others. The very debate that's ongoing regarding AI underscores the insufficiency of legal protections that exist for creators whose work gets reused by AI. This instability leaves one guessing whether or not companies will see through their declarations of fair payment in the end.Take-Two's CEO has publicly stated that human imagination is central to quality games and needs to be safeguarded. His promise of equitable pay is welcome news, but until industry controls are robust, workers are at the mercy of AI-based job automation. It remains to be seen if Take-Two and others will actually adhere to these assurances, but at least Zelnick's words are comforting amid a changing digital environment.",Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick believes that human imagination is still irreplaceable.

Wave of deportations

Families in distress

Political reactions

NEW DELHI: A third US aircraft carrying 112 illegal Indian immigrants landed at Amritsar International Airport on Sunday, sources said. This marks the latest batch of deportations as part of the US administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration.This comes after two earlier flights brought back Indian immigrants. On February 5, a US military aircraft carrying 104 deportees landed in Amritsar, followed by another flight late Saturday night carrying 116 deportees. Reports indicate that many had spent lakhs on illegal routes, often referred to as ""donkey routes,"" only to be detained and sent back.According to officials, the deportees hail from Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. Most are between 18 and 30 years old.The deportations have left families in shock, many of whom took massive loans or sold land to finance their relatives' journeys. A relative of Gurjinder Singh (27), a deportee from Punjab, revealed that the family spent nearly ?50-55 lakh to send him abroad, only to see their hopes shattered.Punjab NRI affairs minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal met some deportees at the airport and assured them of the state government's support. He also urged victims to file complaints against travel agents who deceived them, promising strict action.Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann criticized the Centre, saying, “Do not make our holy city a deport center.” He assured that the Punjab government has arranged transportation and food for the deportees and even extended support to those from Haryana.Meanwhile, Haryana’s government faced criticism for using buses typically reserved for prisoners to transport deportees back home. Punjab’s ministers have slammed the move, calling it disrespectful.","Aircraft carrying 112 illegal Indian immigrants landed at Amritsar International Airport on Sunday.

"In troubled year, number of Bangladeshis marrying Indians doubles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/in-troubled-year-number-of-bangladeshis-marrying-indians-doubles/articleshow/118317147.cms,"In 2024, the number of Bangladeshis marrying Indians in Bengal has surged compared to the previous year, doubling with 111 applications till December 20

Shifting trend

'In past 5 years, 486 Bangladeshis chose Indian partners in Bengal'

KOLKATA: Love knows no boundaries, and politics. The number of Bangladeshi citizens marrying Indians in 2024 has doubled from 2023. In 2024, till Dec 20, 100 Bangladeshi girls applied to marry Indian grooms and 11 Bangladeshi men applied to marry Indian girls. This was the highest number of applications made in a year by Bangladeshis in half a decade and accounted for nearly 23% of the 486 such applications for marriage registrations in Bengal since Jan 2019.It is not immediately known how many among these Bangladeshis are going to stay in India, but senior officials say they have reasons to believe that an overwhelming majority among them will do so. A senior official said, ""We can safely presume that many of them will choose to stay in India given the citizenship laws.""According to the Citizenship Act of 1955, a person can apply for citizenship if he or she ""is married to a citizen of India and is ordinarily resident in India for seven years before making an application for registration"". Besides, children whose either parent is an Indian can get Indian citizenship by birthright.An official said: ""This could be one of the reasons for the spike in 2024. But this can be proven conclusively after we tabulate the pre- and post-Aug 2024 applications,"" an official said.Traditionally, more Bangladeshi girls choose to settle down with Indian grooms. In the past five years, 410 Bangladeshi women chose to marry Indian men in Bengal, while 76 Bangladeshi men took home Indian brides.According to data with the state marriage registrar-general's office, these marriage applications are made mostly by Hindus. Among the 111 applications in 2024, 79 brides were Bangladeshi Hindus, 16 were Muslims and five Christians. Among Bangladeshi grooms marrying in Bengal, nine were Hindus and only two Muslims.In 2023, while the Bangladeshi grooms and brides were mostly Hindus, the total number of marriage applications was less than half of 2024 at 54. This included 44 brides and 13 grooms.Senior state officials point to two reasons for the sudden spike in marriage applications from Bangladesh . First, such marriages make it easier to apply for Indian citizenship, and second, an Oct 2023 rule-tweak by the Bengal govt has made it easier for foreigners to wed Indians.The Oct 2023 rule tweak says foreigners with valid visas, who remain in the state during the 30-day notice period, can marry Indian citizens if they give an affidavit that they are unmarried.","In 2024, 100 Bangladeshi girls applied to marry Indian grooms and 11 men. This was the highest number of applications made in a year by Bangladeshis in half a decade. It is not immediately known how many among these Bangladeshis are going to stay in India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118317257,imgsize-1240656,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118317257.jpg"
